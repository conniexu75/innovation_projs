https://openalex.org/W3120305145,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is mild to moderate in the majority of previously healthy individuals, but can cause life-threatening disease or persistent debilitating symptoms in some cases. The most important determinant of disease severity is age, with individuals over 65 years having the greatest risk of requiring intensive care, and men are more susceptible than women. In contrast to other respiratory viral infections, young children seem to be less severely affected. It is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of COVID-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. In contrast to severe acute COVID-19, such 'long COVID' is seemingly more likely in women than in men. Also, postinfectious hyperinflammatory disease has been described as an additional outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here I discuss our current understanding of the immunological determinants of COVID-19 disease presentation and severity and relate this to known immune-system differences between young and old people and between men and women, and other factors associated with different disease presentations and severity."
https://openalex.org/W3119359828,"Introduction Sex is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the epidemiology and outcome of many diseases. This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes. Methods and findings Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0% vs. 14.6% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females. Conclusions In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients."
https://openalex.org/W3120299325,"Up to 20% of people worldwide develop gastrointestinal symptoms following a meal1, leading to decreased quality of life, substantial morbidity and high medical costs. Although the interest of both the scientific and lay communities in this issue has increased markedly in recent years, with the worldwide introduction of gluten-free and other diets, the underlying mechanisms of food-induced abdominal complaints remain largely unknown. Here we show that a bacterial infection and bacterial toxins can trigger an immune response that leads to the production of dietary-antigen-specific IgE antibodies in mice, which are limited to the intestine. Following subsequent oral ingestion of the respective dietary antigen, an IgE- and mast-cell-dependent mechanism induced increased visceral pain. This aberrant pain signalling resulted from histamine receptor H1-mediated sensitization of visceral afferents. Moreover, injection of food antigens (gluten, wheat, soy and milk) into the rectosigmoid mucosa of patients with irritable bowel syndrome induced local oedema and mast cell activation. Our results identify and characterize a peripheral mechanism that underlies food-induced abdominal pain, thereby creating new possibilities for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and related abdominal pain disorders. In mice, oral tolerance to food antigens can break down after enteric infection, and this leads to food-induced pain resembling irritable bowel syndrome in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3119544327,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are abundant and heterogenous groups of integrated retroviral sequences that affect genome regulation and cell physiology throughout their RNA-centred life cycle1. Failure to repress ERVs is associated with cancer, infertility, senescence and neurodegenerative diseases2,3. Here, using an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR knockout screen in mouse embryonic stem cells, we identify m6A RNA methylation as a way to restrict ERVs. Methylation of ERV mRNAs is catalysed by the complex of methyltransferase-like METTL3-METTL144 proteins, and we found that depletion of METTL3-METTL14, along with their accessory subunits WTAP and ZC3H13, led to increased mRNA abundance of intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) and related ERVK elements specifically, by targeting their 5' untranslated region. Using controlled auxin-dependent degradation of the METTL3-METTL14 enzymatic complex, we showed that IAP mRNA and protein abundance is dynamically and inversely correlated with m6A catalysis. By monitoring chromatin states and mRNA stability upon METTL3-METTL14 double depletion, we found that m6A methylation mainly acts by reducing the half-life of IAP mRNA, and this occurs by the recruitment of the YTHDF family of m6A reader proteins5. Together, our results indicate that RNA methylation provides a protective effect in maintaining cellular integrity by clearing reactive ERV-derived RNA species, which may be especially important when transcriptional silencing is less stringent."
https://openalex.org/W3118256895,"Avalanche phenomena use steeply nonlinear dynamics to generate disproportionately large responses from small perturbations, and are found in a multitude of events and materials1. Photon avalanching enables technologies such as optical phase-conjugate imaging2, infrared quantum counting3 and efficient upconverted lasing4-6. However, the photon-avalanching mechanism underlying these optical applications has been observed only in bulk materials and aggregates6,7, limiting its utility and impact. Here we report the realization of photon avalanching at room temperature in single nanostructures-small, Tm3+-doped upconverting nanocrystals-and demonstrate their use in super-resolution imaging in near-infrared spectral windows of maximal biological transparency. Avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) can be pumped by continuous-wave lasers, and exhibit all of the defining features of photon avalanching, including clear excitation-power thresholds, exceptionally long rise time at threshold, and a dominant excited-state absorption that is more than 10,000 times larger than ground-state absorption. Beyond the avalanching threshold, ANP emission scales nonlinearly with the 26th power of the pump intensity, owing to induced positive optical feedback in each nanocrystal. This enables the experimental realization of photon-avalanche single-beam super-resolution imaging7 with sub-70-nanometre spatial resolution, achieved by using only simple scanning confocal microscopy and without any computational analysis. Pairing their steep nonlinearity with existing super-resolution techniques and computational methods8-10, ANPs enable imaging with higher resolution and at excitation intensities about 100 times lower than other probes. The low photon-avalanching threshold and excellent photostability of ANPs also suggest their utility in a diverse array of applications, including sub-wavelength imaging7,11,12 and optical and environmental sensing13-15."

https://openalex.org/W3120583321,"The activation of mostly quiescent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a prerequisite for life-long production of blood cells1. This process requires major molecular adaptations to allow HSCs to meet the regulatory and metabolic requirements for cell division2-4. The mechanisms that govern cellular reprograming upon stem-cell activation, and the subsequent return of stem cells to quiescence, have not been fully characterized. Here we show that chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)5, a selective form of lysosomal protein degradation, is involved in sustaining HSC function in adult mice. CMA is required for protein quality control in stem cells and for the upregulation of fatty acid metabolism upon HSC activation. We find that CMA activity in HSCs decreases with age and show that genetic or pharmacological activation of CMA can restore the functionality of old mouse and human HSCs. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into a role for CMA in sustaining quality control, appropriate energetics and overall long-term HSC function. Our work suggests that CMA may be a promising therapeutic target for enhancing HSC function in conditions such as ageing or stem-cell transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3118674805,"In 1986, electron microscopy was used to reconstruct by hand the entire nervous system of a roundworm, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans1. Since this landmark study, high-throughput electron-microscopic techniques have enabled reconstructions of much larger mammalian brain circuits at synaptic resolution2,3. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how the structure of a synapse relates to its physiological transmission strength-a key limitation for inferring brain function from neuronal wiring diagrams. Here we combine slice electrophysiology of synaptically connected pyramidal neurons in the mouse somatosensory cortex with correlated light microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy of all putative synaptic contacts between the recorded neurons. We find a linear relationship between synapse size and strength, providing the missing link in assigning physiological weights to synapses reconstructed from electron microscopy. Quantal analysis also reveals that synapses contain at least 2.7 neurotransmitter-release sites on average. This challenges existing release models and provides further evidence that neocortical synapses operate with multivesicular release4-6, suggesting that they are more complex computational devices than thought, and therefore expanding the computational power of the canonical cortical microcircuitry."
https://openalex.org/W3119240720,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early-onset developmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication and social interaction and restrictive or repetitive behaviours1,2. Family studies demonstrate that ASD has a substantial genetic basis with contributions both from inherited and de novo variants3,4. It has been estimated that de novo mutations may contribute to 30% of all simplex cases, in which only a single child is affected per family5. Tandem repeats (TRs), defined here as sequences of 1 to 20 base pairs in size repeated consecutively, comprise one of the major sources of de novo mutations in humans6. TR expansions are implicated in dozens of neurological and psychiatric disorders7. Yet, de novo TR mutations have not been characterized on a genome-wide scale, and their contribution to ASD remains unexplored. Here we develop new bioinformatics methods for identifying and prioritizing de novo TR mutations from sequencing data and perform a genome-wide characterization of de novo TR mutations in ASD-affected probands and unaffected siblings. We infer specific mutation events and their precise changes in repeat number, and primarily focus on more prevalent stepwise copy number changes rather than large expansions. Our results demonstrate a significant genome-wide excess of TR mutations in ASD probands. Mutations in probands tend to be larger, enriched in fetal brain regulatory regions, and are predicted to be more evolutionarily deleterious. Overall, our results highlight the importance of considering repeat variants in future studies of de novo mutations. A bioinformatics pipeline to identify tandem repeat mutations is developed and used to characterize precise changes in repeat copy number associated with autism spectrum disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3120077678,"The innate immune regulator STING is a critical sensor of self- and pathogen-derived DNA. DNA sensing by STING leads to the induction of type-I interferons (IFN-I) and other cytokines, which promote immune-cell-mediated eradication of pathogens and neoplastic cells1,2. STING is also a robust driver of antitumour immunity, which has led to the development of STING activators and small-molecule agonists as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy3. Pain, transmitted by peripheral nociceptive sensory neurons (nociceptors), also aids in host defence by alerting organisms to the presence of potentially damaging stimuli, including pathogens and cancer cells4,5. Here we demonstrate that STING is a critical regulator of nociception through IFN-I signalling in peripheral nociceptors. We show that mice lacking STING or IFN-I signalling exhibit hypersensitivity to nociceptive stimuli and heightened nociceptor excitability. Conversely, intrathecal activation of STING produces robust antinociception in mice and non-human primates. STING-mediated antinociception is governed by IFN-Is, which rapidly suppress excitability of mouse, monkey and human nociceptors. Our findings establish the STING-IFN-I signalling axis as a critical regulator of physiological nociception and a promising new target for treating chronic pain."

https://openalex.org/W3118639017,"RAG endonuclease initiates Igh V(D)J recombination in progenitor B cells by binding a JH-recombination signal sequence (RSS) within a recombination centre (RC) and then linearly scanning upstream chromatin, presented by loop extrusion mediated by cohesin, for convergent D-RSSs1,2. The utilization of convergently oriented RSSs and cryptic RSSs is intrinsic to long-range RAG scanning3. Scanning of RAG from the DJH-RC-RSS to upstream convergent VH-RSSs is impeded by D-proximal CTCF-binding elements (CBEs)2-5. Primary progenitor B cells undergo a mechanistically undefined contraction of the VH locus that is proposed to provide distal VHs access to the DJH-RC6-9. Here we report that an inversion of the entire 2.4-Mb VH locus in mouse primary progenitor B cells abrogates rearrangement of both VH-RSSs and normally convergent cryptic RSSs, even though locus contraction still occurs. In addition, this inversion activated both the utilization of cryptic VH-RSSs that are normally in opposite orientation and RAG scanning beyond the VH locus through several convergent CBE domains to the telomere. Together, these findings imply that broad deregulation of CBE impediments in primary progenitor B cells promotes RAG scanning of the VH locus mediated by loop extrusion. We further found that the expression of wings apart-like protein homologue (WAPL)10, a cohesin-unloading factor, was low in primary progenitor B cells compared with v-Abl-transformed progenitor B cell lines that lacked contraction and RAG scanning of the VH locus. Correspondingly, depletion of WAPL in v-Abl-transformed lines activated both processes, further implicating loop extrusion in the locus contraction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3119028457,"The development of quantum computing architectures from early designs and current noisy devices to fully fledged quantum computers hinges on achieving fault tolerance using quantum error correction1-4. However, these correction capabilities come with an overhead for performing the necessary fault-tolerant logical operations on logical qubits (qubits that are encoded in ensembles of physical qubits and protected by error-correction codes)5-8. One of the most resource-efficient ways to implement logical operations is lattice surgery9-11, where groups of physical qubits, arranged on lattices, can be merged and split to realize entangling gates and teleport logical information. Here we report the experimental realization of lattice surgery between two qubits protected via a topological error-correction code in a ten-qubit ion-trap quantum information processor. In this system, we can carry out the necessary quantum non-demolition measurements through a series of local and entangling gates, as well as measurements on auxiliary qubits. In particular, we demonstrate entanglement between two logical qubits and we implement logical state teleportation between them. The demonstration of these operations-fundamental building blocks for quantum computation-through lattice surgery represents a step towards the efficient realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W3107486892,"By early May 2020, the number of new COVID-19 infections started to increase rapidly in Chile, threatening the ability of health services to accommodate all incoming cases. Suddenly, ICU capacity planning became a first-order concern, and the health authorities were in urgent need of tools to estimate the demand for urgent care associated with the pandemic. In this article, we describe the approach we followed to provide such demand forecasts, and we show how the use of analytics can provide relevant support for decision making, even with incomplete data and without enough time to fully explore the numerical properties of all available forecasting methods. The solution combines autoregressive, machine learning and epidemiological models to provide a short-term forecast of ICU utilization at the regional level. These forecasts were made publicly available and were actively used to support capacity planning. Our predictions achieved average forecasting errors of 4% and 9% for one- and two-week horizons, respectively, outperforming several other competing forecasting models."
https://openalex.org/W3119356018,"Soft γ-ray repeaters exhibit bursting emission in hard X-rays and soft γ-rays. During the active phase, they emit random short (milliseconds to several seconds long), hard-X-ray bursts, with peak luminosities1 of 1036 to 1043 erg per second. Occasionally, a giant flare with an energy of around 1044 to 1046 erg is emitted2. These phenomena are thought to arise from neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields (1014 to 1015 gauss), called magnetars1,3,4. A portion of the second-long initial pulse of a giant flare in some respects mimics short γ-ray bursts5,6, which have recently been identified as resulting from the merger of two neutron stars accompanied by gravitational-wave emission7. Two γ-ray bursts, GRB 051103 and GRB 070201, have been associated with giant flares2,8-11. Here we report observations of the γ-ray burst GRB 200415A, which we localized to a 20-square-arcmin region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253, located about 3.5 million parsecs away. The burst had a sharp, millisecond-scale hard spectrum in the initial pulse, which was followed by steady fading and softening over 0.2 seconds. The energy released (roughly 1.3 × 1046 erg) is similar to that of the superflare5,12,13 from the Galactic soft γ-ray repeater SGR 1806-20 (roughly 2.3 × 1046 erg). We argue that GRB 200415A is a giant flare from a magnetar in NGC 253."
https://openalex.org/W3120376821,"Dire wolves are considered to be one of the most common and widespread large carnivores in Pleistocene America1, yet relatively little is known about their evolution or extinction. Here, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of dire wolves, we sequenced five genomes from sub-fossil remains dating from 13,000 to more than 50,000 years ago. Our results indicate that although they were similar morphologically to the extant grey wolf, dire wolves were a highly divergent lineage that split from living canids around 5.7 million years ago. In contrast to numerous examples of hybridization across Canidae2,3, there is no evidence for gene flow between dire wolves and either North American grey wolves or coyotes. This suggests that dire wolves evolved in isolation from the Pleistocene ancestors of these species. Our results also support an early New World origin of dire wolves, while the ancestors of grey wolves, coyotes and dholes evolved in Eurasia and colonized North America only relatively recently. Dire wolves split from living canids around 5.7 million years ago and originated in the New World isolated from the ancestors of grey wolves and coyotes, which evolved in Eurasia and colonized North America only relatively recently."
https://openalex.org/W3119284030,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are progressive, multicellular neoplasms that cause morbidity and may transform to sarcoma. Treatment of Nf1fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice with cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, caused a reduction in PN size and number and differential modulation of kinases in cell lineages that drive PN growth. Based on these findings, the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized Simon two-stage study to assess the safety, efficacy and biologic activity of cabozantinib in patients ≥16 years of age with NF1 and progressive or symptomatic, inoperable PN ( NCT02101736 ). The trial met its primary outcome, defined as ≥25% of patients achieving a partial response (PR, defined as ≥20% reduction in target lesion volume as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) after 12 cycles of therapy. Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and quality of life (QOL), pharmacokinetics (PK) and the levels of circulating endothelial cells and cytokines. Eight of 19 evaluable (42%) trial participants achieved a PR. The median change in tumor volume was 15.2% (range, +2.2% to -36.9%), and no patients had disease progression while on treatment. Nine patients required dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy due to AEs; common AEs included gastrointestinal toxicity, hypothyroidism, fatigue and palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia. A total of 11 grade 3 AEs occurred in eight patients. Patients with PR had a significant reduction in tumor pain intensity and pain interference in daily life but no change in global QOL scores. These data indicate that cabozantinib is active in NF1-associated PN, resulting in tumor volume reduction and pain improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3120702085,"Magnetars are neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields (1013 to 1015 gauss)1,2, which episodically emit X-ray bursts approximately 100 milliseconds long and with energies of 1040 to 1041 erg. Occasionally, they also produce extremely bright and energetic giant flares, which begin with a short (roughly 0.2 seconds), intense flash, followed by fainter, longer-lasting emission that is modulated by the spin period of the magnetar3,4 (typically 2 to 12 seconds). Over the past 40 years, only three such flares have been observed in our local group of galaxies3-6, and in all cases the extreme intensity of the flares caused the detectors to saturate. It has been proposed that extragalactic giant flares are probably a subset7-11 of short γ-ray bursts, given that the sensitivity of current instrumentation prevents us from detecting the pulsating tail, whereas the initial bright flash is readily observable out to distances of around 10 to 20 million parsecs. Here we report X-ray and γ-ray observations of the γ-ray burst GRB 200415A, which has a rapid onset, very fast time variability, flat spectra and substantial sub-millisecond spectral evolution. These attributes match well with those expected for a giant flare from an extragalactic magnetar12, given that GRB 200415A is directionally associated13 with the galaxy NGC 253 (roughly 3.5 million parsecs away). The detection of three-megaelectronvolt photons provides evidence for the relativistic motion of the emitting plasma. Radiation from such rapidly moving gas around a rotating magnetar may have generated the rapid spectral evolution that we observe."
https://openalex.org/W3120227363,"A non-enveloped virus requires a membrane lesion to deliver its genome into a target cell1. For rotaviruses, membrane perforation is a principal function of the viral outer-layer protein, VP42,3. Here we describe the use of electron cryomicroscopy to determine how VP4 performs this function and show that when activated by cleavage to VP8* and VP5*, VP4 can rearrange on the virion surface from an 'upright' to a 'reversed' conformation. The reversed structure projects a previously buried 'foot' domain outwards into the membrane of the host cell to which the virion has attached. Electron cryotomograms of virus particles entering cells are consistent with this picture. Using a disulfide mutant of VP4, we have also stabilized a probable intermediate in the transition between the two conformations. Our results define molecular mechanisms for the first steps of the penetration of rotaviruses into the membranes of target cells and suggest similarities with mechanisms postulated for other viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3111750156,"The dominant feature of large-scale mass transfer in the modern ocean is the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The geometry and vigour of this circulation influences global climate on various timescales. Palaeoceanographic evidence suggests that during glacial periods of the past 1.5 million years the AMOC had markedly different features from today1; in the Atlantic basin, deep waters of Southern Ocean origin increased in volume while above them the core of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) shoaled2. An absence of evidence on the origin of this phenomenon means that the sequence of events leading to global glacial conditions remains unclear. Here we present multi-proxy evidence showing that northward shifts in Antarctic iceberg melt in the Indian-Atlantic Southern Ocean (0-50° E) systematically preceded deep-water mass reorganizations by one to two thousand years during Pleistocene-era glaciations. With the aid of iceberg-trajectory model experiments, we demonstrate that such a shift in iceberg trajectories during glacial periods can result in a considerable redistribution of freshwater in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that this, in concert with increased sea-ice cover, enabled positive buoyancy anomalies to 'escape' into the upper limb of the AMOC, providing a teleconnection between surface Southern Ocean conditions and the formation of NADW. The magnitude and pacing of this mechanism evolved substantially across the mid-Pleistocene transition, and the coeval increase in magnitude of the 'southern escape' and deep circulation perturbations implicate this mechanism as a key feedback in the transition to the '100-kyr world', in which glacial-interglacial cycles occur at roughly 100,000-year periods."
https://openalex.org/W3120150322,"Background and aims Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is empirically implemented in horses with colitis to facilitate resolution of diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to assess FMT as a clinical treatment and modulator of fecal microbiota in hospitalized horses with colitis. Methods A total of 22 horses with moderate to severe diarrhea, consistent with a diagnosis of colitis, were enrolled at two referral hospitals (L1: n = 12; L2: n = 10). FMT was performed in all 12 patients on 3 consecutive days at L1, while treatment at L2 consisted of standard care without FMT. Manure was collected once daily for 4 days from the rectum in all colitis horses, prior to FMT for horses at L1, and from each manure sample used for FMT. Fecal samples from 10 clinically healthy control horses housed at L2, and 30 healthy horses located at 5 barns in regional proximity to L1 were also obtained to characterize the regional healthy equine microbiome. All fecal microbiota were analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing. Results and conclusions As expected, healthy horses at both locations showed a greater α-diversity and lower β-diversity compared to horses with colitis. The fecal microbiome of healthy horses clustered by location, with L1 horses showing a higher prevalence of Kiritimatiellaeota. Improved manure consistency (lower diarrhea score) was associated with a greater α-diversity in horses with colitis at both locations (L1: r = -0.385, P = 0.006; L2: r = -0.479, P = 0.002). Fecal transplant recipients demonstrated a greater overall reduction in diarrhea score (median: 4±3 grades), compared to untreated horses (median: 1.5±3 grades, P = 0.021), with a higher incidence in day-over-day improvement in diarrhea (22/36 (61%) vs. 10/28 (36%) instances, P = 0.011). When comparing microbiota of diseased horses at study conclusion to that of healthy controls, FMT-treated horses showed a lower mean UniFrac distance (0.53±0.27) than untreated horses (0.62±0.26, P&lt;0.001), indicating greater normalization of the microbiome in FMT-treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W3118741690,"Inter-relationships among mosquito vectors, Plasmodium parasites, human ecology, and biotic and abiotic factors, drive malaria risk. Specifically, rural landscapes shaped by human activities have a great potential to increase the abundance of malaria vectors, putting many vulnerable people at risk. Understanding at which point the abundance of vectors increases in the landscape can help to design policies and interventions for effective and sustainable control. Using a dataset of adult female mosquitoes collected at 79 sites in malaria endemic areas in the Brazilian Amazon, this study aimed to (1) verify the association among forest cover percentage (PLAND), forest edge density (ED), and variation in mosquito diversity; and to (2) test the hypothesis of an association between landscape structure (i.e., PLAND and ED) and Nyssorhynchus darlingi (Root) dominance. Mosquito collections were performed employing human landing catch (HLC) (peridomestic habitat) and Shannon trap combined with HLC (forest fringe habitat). Nyssorhynchus darlingi abundance was used as the response variable in a generalized linear mixed model, and the Shannon diversity index (H’) of the Culicidae community, PLAND, and the distance house-water drainage were used as predictors. Three ED categories were also used as random effects. A path analysis was used to understand comparative strengths of direct and indirect relationships among Amazon vegetation classes, Culicidae community, and Ny . darlingi abundance. Our results demonstrate that Ny . darlingi is negatively affected by H´ and PLAND of peridomestic habitat, and that increasing these variables (one-unit value at β 0 = 768) leads to a decrease of 226 ( P &lt; 0.001) and 533 ( P = 0.003) individuals, respectively. At the forest fringe, a similar result was found for H’ (β 1 = -218; P &lt; 0.001) and PLAND (β 1 = -337; P = 0.04). Anthropogenic changes in the Amazon vegetation classes decreased mosquito biodiversity, leading to increased Ny . darlingi abundance. Changes in landscape structure, specifically decreases in PLAND and increases in ED, led to Ny . darlingi becoming the dominant species, increasing malaria risk. Ecological mechanisms involving changes in landscape and mosquito species composition can help to understand changes in the epidemiology of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W3118908945,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic and incurable autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation in synovial lining of joints. To identify the signaling pathways involved in RA, its disease activity, and treatment response, we adapted a systems immunology approach to simultaneously quantify 42 signaling nodes in 21 immune cell subsets (e.g., IFNα→p-STAT5 in B cells) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 194 patients with longstanding RA (including 98 patients before and after treatment), and 41 healthy controls (HC). We found multiple differences between patients with RA compared to HC, predominantly in cytokine-induced Jak/STAT signaling in many immune cell subsets, suggesting pathways that may be associated with susceptibility to RA. We also found that high RA disease activity, compared to low disease activity, was associated with decreased (e.g., IFNα→p-STAT5, IL-10→p-STAT1) or increased (e.g., IL-6→STAT3) response to stimuli in multiple cell subsets. Finally, we compared signaling in patients with established, refractory RA before and six months after initiation of methotrexate (MTX) or TNF inhibitors (TNFi). We noted significant changes from pre-treatment to post-treatment in IFNα→p-STAT5 signaling and IL-10→p-STAT1 signaling in multiple cell subsets; these changes brought the aberrant RA signaling profiles toward those of HC. This large, comprehensive functional signaling pathway study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of RA and shows the potential of quantification of cytokine-induced signaling as a biomarker of disease activity or treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W3119552425,"Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) cohort; to assess correlations with disease characteristics and rheumatic therapy; and to evaluate the occurrence of treatment discontinuation and its impact on disease activity. Materials and methods SLE patients monitored by a single Italian centre were interviewed between February and July 2020. Patients were considered to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections in case of 1) positive nasopharyngeal swab; 2) positive serology associated with COVID19 suggesting symptoms. The following data were also recorded: clinical symptoms, adoption of social distancing measures, disease activity and treatment discontinuation. Results 332 patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients (1.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the incidence being significantly higher in the subgroup of patients treated with biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (p = 0.005), while no difference was observed for other therapies, age at enrollment, disease duration, type of cumulative organ involvement or adoption of social isolation. The course of the disease was mild. Thirty-six patients (11.1%) discontinued at least part of their therapy during this time period, and 27 (8.1%) cases of disease flare were recorded. Correlation between flare and discontinuation of therapy was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). No significant increase of rate of flare in a subgroup of the same patients during 2020 was observed. Conclusion Treatment discontinuation seems to be an important cause of disease flare. Our findings suggest that abrupt drug withdrawal should be avoided or evaluated with caution on the basis of individual infection risk and comorbidities."

Physical fitness tests included 20 m shuttle run test, handgrip strength test, standing long jump test, 4x10 m shuttle run test as part of PREFIT fitness test battery, and one-leg stance test from EUROFIT test battery. The participants of this study were 147 Estonian children (51% boys) aged 6–8 years, who were measured in the transition from kindergarten to school. Results After adjusting for maternal body mass index, educational attainment, child’s sex, age at the measurements, greater cardiovascular and motor fitness, relative lower body strength, static balance at 6.6 yr were associated with lower fat mass index, fat mass percentage at 12-month follow-up. The relative lower body strength above the median at 6.6 yr were related to lower fat mass index and fat mass percentage at 12-month follow-up, while the static balance test results demonstrated the opposite associations. Improvements in the 4x10 m shuttle run test results during the 12-month follow-up period were associated with the most beneficial changes in body composition status, such as increases in fat-free mass index and decreases in fat mass index, fat mass percentage, waist-to-height ratio after adjusting for maternal body mass index, educational attainment, child’s sex, age, at the measurements and baseline values of exposures. Conclusion Better physical fitness tests results at 6.6 yr in kindergarten generally predicted lower body fat parameters in children at 7.6 yr in first grade at school."
https://openalex.org/W3118566540,"Numerical body models of children are used for designing medical devices, including but not limited to optical imaging, ultrasound, CT, EEG/MEG, and MRI. These models are used in many clinical and neuroscience research applications, such as radiation safety dosimetric studies and source localization. Although several such adult models have been reported, there are few reports of full-body pediatric models, and those described have several limitations. Some, for example, are either morphed from older children or do not have detailed segmentations. Here, we introduce a 29-month-old male whole-body native numerical model, ""MARTIN"", that includes 28 head and 86 body tissue compartments, segmented directly from the high spatial resolution MRI and CT images. An advanced auto-segmentation tool was used for the deep-brain structures, whereas 3D Slicer was used to segment the non-brain structures and to refine the segmentation for all of the tissue compartments. Our MARTIN model was developed and validated using three separate approaches, through an iterative process, as follows. First, the calculated volumes, weights, and dimensions of selected structures were adjusted and confirmed to be within 6% of the literature values for the 2-3-year-old age-range. Second, all structural segmentations were adjusted and confirmed by two experienced, sub-specialty certified neuro-radiologists, also through an interactive process. Third, an additional validation was performed with a Bloch simulator to create synthetic MR image from our MARTIN model and compare the image contrast of the resulting synthetic image with that of the original MRI data; this resulted in a ""structural resemblance"" index of 0.97. Finally, we used our model to perform pilot MRI safety simulations of an Active Implantable Medical Device (AIMD) using a commercially available software platform (Sim4Life), incorporating the latest International Standards Organization guidelines. This model will be made available on the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging website."

We performed a retrospective review of 1,676 pediatric ADRs documented at our hospital from 2014–2018. We evaluated patient demographics, implicated medication, ADR severity, calculated Naranjo score, associated symptoms, and location within the hospital in which the ADR was documented. ADR severity was poorly correlated with Naranjo interpretation. Out of the 10 Naranjo scale questions, 4 had a response of “unknown” greater than 85% of the time.

Further strategies are needed to enhance the causality assessment of pediatric ADRs in clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W3119772442,"The effects of economic development on natural environment is explored by momentous literature, this study focuses on exploring the role of institutional quality for environmental protection in the selected One Belt One Road (OBOR) economies. The main goal of the paper is to find the threshold level of institutional quality that may minimize CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere due to widespread industrialization and transportation. The data is selected for the panel of 33 OBOR economies over the time period of 1986–2018. The panel threshold regression technique is applied to determine the threshold level of institutional quality. The estimated results of the study reveal that 2.315 is the threshold level of institutional quality in selected partner OBOR countries. If quality of institutions is above the threshold level then CO 2 emission do not contribute significantly for environmental deterioration in spite of growing industrialization and transportation and vice versa. The study emphasized to improve the institutional quality up to threshold level to get potential gains from industrialization and transportation."

https://openalex.org/W3118332436,"The aim of this study is to examine whether technical characteristics predict current and future tennis performance of youth tennis players. Twenty-nine male youth tennis players (age 13.40 ± .51) were assessed on anthropometrical characteristics (height, weight, maturity status) and technical characteristics (ball speed, accuracy and percentage errors) using an on-court tennis test when they were under-14 (U14). Game situations were simulated, which were either fixed or variable. The variable game situations required players to consider the direction of the ball, as opposed to the fixed game situations where players needed to play every ball to the same side. Players’ tennis ratings were obtained U14 (‘current performance’) and under-18 (U18) (‘future performance’). According to their rating U18 players were classified as future elite (n = 9) or future competitive (n = 20). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that ball speed and accuracy were significant predictors of current and future performance (p &lt; .001), with R 2 of .595 and .463, respectively. When controlling for age, a one-way MANCOVA revealed that future elite players were more accurate than future competitive players (p = .048, 95% CI [.000 to .489]), especially in variable compared to fixed game situations (p &lt; .05). In conclusion, the current study is the first to show that technical characteristics are crucial for current as well as future performance in youth male tennis players. Findings of this prospective study provide essential information to coaches about characteristics that require most attention in performance development in youth players."
https://openalex.org/W3118404234,"Cycloramphus bolitoglossus (Werner, 1897) is a rare species with a low population density in the Serra do Mar region of Paraná and Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil. Currently, it has been assigned to the Near Threatened (NT) category in the Brazilian List of Endangered Animal Species. Here, we described the karyotype of this species for the first time and investigated the patterns of some repetitive DNA classes in the chromosomes using molecular cytogenetic approaches. We isolated, sequenced and mapped the 5S rDNA and the satellite DNA PcP190 of C . bolitoglossus , as well as mapped the telomeric sequences and seven microsatellites motifies [(GA) 15 , (CA) 15 , (GACA) 4 , (GATA) 8 , (CAG) 10 , (CGC) 10 , and (GAA)] 10 . Cycloramphus bolitoglossus has 2n = 26 chromosomes and a fundamental number (FN) equal to 52, with a highly conserved karyotype compared to other genus members. Comparative cytogenetic under the phylogenetic context of genus allowed evolutionary interpretations of the morphological changes in the homologs of pairs 1, 3, and 6 along with the evolutionary history of Cycloramphus . Two subtypes of 5S rDNA type II were isolated in C . bolitoglossus genome, and several comparative analysis suggests mixed effects of concerted and birth-and-death evolution acting in this repetitive DNA. The 5S rDNA II subtype “a” and “b” was mapped on chromosome 1. However, their different position along chromosome 1 provide an excellent chromosome marker for future studies. PcP190 satellite DNA, already reported for species of the families Hylidae, Hylodidae, Leptodactylidae, and Odontophrynidae, is scattered throughout the C . bolitoglossus genome, and even non-heterochromatic regions showed hybridization signals using the PcP190 probe. Molecular analysis suggests that PcP190 satellite DNA exhibit a high-level of homogenization of this sequence in the genome of C . bolitoglossus . The PcP190 satDNA from C . bolitoglossus represents a novel sequence group, compared to other anurans, based on its hypervariable region. Overall, the present data on repetitive DNA sequences showed pseudogenization evidence and corroborated the hypothesis of the emergence of satDNA from rDNA 5S clusters. These two arguments that reinforced the importance of the birth-and-death evolutionary model to explain 5S rDNA patterns found in anuran genomes."

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic."
https://openalex.org/W3119461874,"Development of a reliable method for RNA interference (RNAi) by orally-delivered double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is potentially promising for crop protection. Considering that RNAi efficiency considerably varies among different insect species, it is important to seek for the practical conditions under which dsRNA-mediated RNAi effectively works against each pest insect. Here we investigated RNAi efficiency in the brown-winged green stinkbug Plautia stali , which is notorious for infesting various fruits and crop plants. Microinjection of dsRNA into P . stali revealed high RNAi efficiency–injection of only 30 ng dsRNA into last-instar nymphs was sufficient to knockdown target genes as manifested by their phenotypes, and injection of 300 ng dsRNA suppressed the gene expression levels by 80% to 99.9%. Knockdown experiments by dsRNA injection showed that multicopper oxidase 2 (MCO2), vacuolar ATPase (vATPase), inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), and vacuolar-sorting protein Snf7 are essential for survival of P . stali , as has been demonstrated in other insects. By contrast, P . stali exhibited very low RNAi efficiency when dsRNA was orally administered. When 1000 ng/μL of dsRNA solution was orally provided to first-instar nymphs, no obvious phenotypes were observed. Consistent with this, RT-qPCR showed that the gene expression levels were not affected. A higher concentration of dsRNA (5000 ng/μL) induced mortality in some cohorts, and the gene expression levels were reduced to nearly 50%. Simultaneous oral administration of dsRNA against potential RNAi blocker genes did not improve the RNAi efficiency of the target genes. In conclusion, P . stali shows high sensitivity to RNAi with injected dsRNA but, unlike the allied pest stinkbugs Halyomorpha halys and Nezara viridula , very low sensitivity to RNAi with orally-delivered dsRNA, which highlights the varied sensitivity to RNAi across different species and limits the applicability of the molecular tool for controlling this specific insect pest."
https://openalex.org/W3119509792,"Improving our knowledge of subsistence strategies and food processing techniques of past societies is of prime interest for better understanding human cultures as well as multiple aspects of human evolution. Beyond the simple matter of food itself, a substantial portion of socio-economic behavior is expressed in what, how, when, and with whom we eat. Over the last few decades, diverse methodologies for the analysis and interpretation of cut marks have progressively provided new insights for past butchery practices. For example, a recent study of the production of antelope biltong in South Africa concluded that the drying of meat generates high frequencies of longitudinal cut marks. This paper presents a cut mark analysis of faunal remains recovered by Lewis Binford from 8 campsites occupied by Nunamiut groups from the end of 19 th to middle of the 20 th century in the area around Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska. The preparation of meat—primarily from caribou ( Rangifer tarandus )–varied at these sites according to the season of occupation and was, depending on the site, either immediately consumed, processed after being stored in ice-cellars, or dried and stored. These faunal assemblages therefore provide a unique opportunity to explore the material traces of different meat preparation and preservation techniques in order to identify whether specific patterns can be identified and subsequently used to explore subsistence practices in the past. Binford’s Nunamiut faunal assemblages, which were produced by individuals using traditional techniques and methods, were analyzed in order to 1) further test the hypothesis that meat drying produces high frequencies of longitudinal cut marks, 2) explore the common assumption that skilled butchers leave smaller numbers of cut marks on bones compared to less experienced individuals, and 3) test whether cut mark patterns vary as a function of the processing techniques employed. The introduction of a %cutL index represents a quicker alternative to geo-referencing cut marks on bones when exploring meat processing techniques and methods and can easily be integrated in zooarchaeological analyses. While the results obtained support processing techniques linked to meat drying to leave high numbers of longitudinal cut marks, they are inconsistent with cut mark frequencies varying as a function of the butcher’s skill and experience. Analyzing cut mark patterns is therefore a reliable means for exploring food processing by past human societies and, by extension, their methods for safeguarding against unfavorable seasonal variations in both the abundance and condition of prey species. Identifying food storage in the archaeological record equally provides a unique window on to the social dynamics and potential inequalities of past societies."

Sub-Saharan Africa accounts up to 41% of the total burden of neonatal deaths worldwide. Our study aims to describe causes of neonatal mortality and to evaluate predictors of timing of neonatal death at Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH), Ghana. This retrospective study was conducted at TTH located in Northern Ghana. All neonates who died in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) from 2013 to 2017 were included and data was obtained from admission and discharge books and mortality records. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess predictors of timing of neonatal death. Out of the 8,377 neonates that were admitted at the NICU during the 5-year study period, 1,126 died, representing a mortality rate of 13.4%. Of those that died, 74.3% died within 6 days. There was an overall downward trend in neonatal mortality over the course of the 5-year study period (18.2% in 2013; 14.3% in 2017). Preterm birth complications (49.6%) and birth asphyxia (21.7%) were the top causes of mortality. Predictors of early death included being born within TTH, birth weight, and having a diagnosis of preterm birth complication or birth asphyxia. Our retrospective study found that almost 3/4 of neonatal deaths were within the first week and these deaths were more likely to be associated with preterm birth complications or birth asphyxia. Most of the deaths occurred in babies born within health facilities, presenting an opportunity to reduce our mortality by improving on quality of care provided during the perinatal period."
https://openalex.org/W3120692961,"The experiment was conducted with an intent to know the effect of different farming systems on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility coefficients, reproductive traits, disease incidence, heat stress indices, and cost economics of Nellore sheep. The study includes two parallel trials to prevent the influence of age on heat stress indices (panting score and erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF)). One hundred and twenty lambs (60 ram-lambs and 60 ewe-lambs) were allotted in a randomized block design under extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive systems for trial I, whereas trial II include eighteen rams assigned to the three respective farming systems in a completely randomised design. Both, season (summer) and grazing practice increased the panting score and EOF. The heat stress indices were positively correlated (P&lt;0.01) with dry-bulb temperature and temperature-humidity index (THI) and inversely correlated (P&lt;0.01) to relative humidity. Allotting the sheep to intensive system increased (P&lt;0.001) weight gain and average daily gain with higher effect in males compared to females. The parameters of asymptotic weight (A), integration constant (B), and maturation rate were higher for intensive males. The male Nellore lambs had higher asymptotic weight and lower maturity rate than females, irrespective of the rearing system. Intensive sheep revealed a higher dry matter intake, digestibility coefficients, feed conversion ratio. The instantaneous bite mass (IBM) was higher for Commelina benghalensis , while instantaneous bite frequency (IBF), instantaneous intake rate (IIR) were higher for Cyanodon dactylon and amaranthus viridis , respectively. The proportion of intakes were highest for Stylo hemata followed by Cynodon dactylon and Tridax procumbens species. No differences were observed for the weight at puberty, oestrus cycle length, oestrus duration, conception percent, gestation period, and lambing percent in three rearing systems; however, the age at puberty was lower (P&lt;0.001) and the birth weight was higher (P&lt;0.001) for sheep reared under intensive farming system. Highest disease incidence was observed in rainy and winter seasons, particularly in sheep reared under extensive system. The capital expenditure was same for the three rearing systems, while the recurring expenditure was higher for Intensive farming system. The gross income and net income were higher for intensive system on account of higher weight gains. However, the higher returns per rupee of expenditure project the extensive farming as an ideal rearing system for small farmers and entrepreneurs with a low initial capital."

Nonsynonymous mutations in the lanosterol C14 alpha-demethylase ( ERG11 ) gene is one of the predominant mechanisms of azole resistance in C . tropicalis . We evaluated the tetra primer-amplification refractory mutation system-PCR (T-ARMS-PCR), restriction site mutation (RSM), and high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis methods for rapid resistance detection based on ERG11 polymorphism in C . tropicalis . Twelve azole-resistant and 19 susceptible isolates of C . tropicalis were included. DNA sequencing of the isolates was performed to check the ERG11 polymorphism status among resistant and susceptible isolates. Three approaches T-ARMS-PCR, RSM, and HRM were evaluated and validated for the rapid detection of ERG11 mutation. The fluconazole MICs for the 12 resistant and 19 susceptible isolates were 32–256 mg/L and 0.5–1 mg/L, respectively. The resistant isolates showed A339T and C461T mutations in the ERG11 gene. The T-ARMS-PCR and RSM approaches discriminated all the resistant and susceptible isolates, whereas HRM analysis differentiated all except one susceptible isolate. The sensitivity, specificity, analytical sensitivity, time, and cost of analysis suggests that these three methods can be utilized for the rapid detection of ERG11 mutations in C . tropicalis . Additionally, an excellent concordance with DNA sequencing was noted for all three methods.

Patterns of serum metabolites in ME/CFS and GWI are different from control groups and suggest potential dysfunction of energy and lipid metabolism. The metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid was contrasted between ME/CFS, GWI and sedentary controls in 2 sets of subjects who had lumbar punctures after either (a) rest or (b) submaximal exercise stress tests. Postexercise GWI and control subjects were subdivided according to acquired transient postexertional postural tachycardia. Banked cerebrospinal fluid specimens were assayed using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® p180 kits for quantitative targeted metabolomics studies of amino acids, amines, acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, lysophospholipids, alkyl and ether phosphocholines. Glutamate was significantly higher in the subgroup of postexercise GWI subjects who did not develop postural tachycardia after exercise compared to nonexercise and other postexercise groups. The only difference between nonexercise groups was higher lysoPC a C28:0 in GWI than ME/CFS suggesting this biochemical or phospholipase activities may have potential as a biomarker to distinguish between the 2 diseases. Exercise effects were suggested by elevation of short chain acylcarnitine C5-OH (C3-DC-M) in postexercise controls compared to nonexercise ME/CFS. Limitations include small subgroup sample sizes and absence of postexercise ME/CFS specimens.

We propose a novel transformative adaptive activation function that improves the gene expression inference even further and which generalizes several existing adaptive activation functions. Our improved neural network achieves an average mean absolute error of 0.1340, which is a significant improvement over our reimplementation of the original D–GEX, which achieves an average mean absolute error of 0.1637.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether surgical simulation of pancreatico-jejunostomy (PJ) using an inanimate biotissue model could improve the technical proficiency of hepato-biliary pancreatic (HBP) surgical fellows. Methods The biotissue drill consisted of sewing biotissues to simulate PJ. The drill was repeated a total of five times by each of the participant surgical fellows. The improvement of the surgical fellows’ technical proficiency was evaluated by the supervisor surgeons using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scale. Results Eight HBP surgical fellows completed all the 5 drills. Both the OSATS 25 score and OSATS summary score, assessed by the two supervisor surgeons, improved steadily with repeated execution of the PJ drill. The average OSATS score, as assessed by both the supervisor surgeons, improved significantly from the first to the final drill, with a P value of 0.003 and 0.014 for the assessment by the two surgeons, respectively. On the other hand, no chronological alteration was observed in time of procedure ( P = 0.788). Conclusion Repeated execution of a biotissue PJ drill improved the HBP surgical fellows’ technical proficiency, as evaluated by OSATS. The present study lends support to the evidence that simulation training can contribute to shortening of the time required to negotiate the learning curve for the technique of PJ in the actual operating room."
https://openalex.org/W3118919475,"Background The paradigm shift in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment options in the last five years has raised the prospect of eliminating the disease as a global health threat. This will require a step-change in the number being treated with the new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Given constrained budgets and competing priorities, policy makers need information on how to scale-up access to HCV treatment. To inform such decisions, we examined the cost effectiveness of screening and treatment interventions in Yunnan, China. Methods and findings We simulated the HCV epidemic using a previously published model of HCV transmission and disease progression, calibrated to Yunnan data, and implemented a range of treatment and screening interventions from 2019. We incorporated treatment, diagnosis, and medical costs (expressed in 2019 US Dollars, USD) to estimate the lifetime benefits and costs of interventions. Using this model, we asked: is introducing DAAs cost effective from a healthcare sector perspective; what is the optimal combination of screening interventions; and what is the societal return on investment of intervention? The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of switching to DAAs with a median cost of 7,400 USD (50,000 Chinese Yuan) per course is 500 USD/disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted; at a threshold of 50% of Yunnan gross domestic product (2,600 USD), switching to DAAs is cost effective 94% of the time. At this threshold, the optimal, cost-effective intervention comprises screening people who inject drugs, those in HIV care, men who have sex with men, and ensuring access to DAAs for all those newly diagnosed with HCV. For each USD invested in this intervention, there is an additional 0·80 USD (95% credible interval: 0·17–1·91) returned through reduced costs of disease or increased productivity. Returns on investment are lower (and potentially negative) if a sufficiently long-term horizon, encompassing the full stream of future benefits, is not adopted. The study had two key limitations: costing data were not always specific to Yunnan province but were taken from China-level studies; and modelled interventions may require more operational research to ensure they can be effectively and efficiently rolled-out to the entire province. Conclusions Introducing DAAs is cost effective, the optimal package of screening measures is focussed on higher risk groups, and there are likely to be positive returns from investing in such HCV interventions. Our analysis shows that targeted investment in HCV interventions will have net benefits to society; these benefits will only increase as DAA costs fall."
https://openalex.org/W3121047748,"Current research approaches employ traditional tissue engineering strategies to promote vocal fold (VF) tissue regeneration, whereas recent novel advances seek to use principles of developmental biology to guide tissue generation by mimicking native developmental cues, causing tissue or allogenic/autologous progenitor cells to undergo the regeneration process. To address the paucity of data to direct VF differentiation and subsequent new tissue formation, we characterize structure-proliferation relationships and tissue elastic moduli over embryonic development using a murine model. Growth, cell proliferation, and tissue biomechanics were taken at E13.5, E15.5, E16.5, E18.5, P0, and adult time points. Quadratic growth patterns were found in larynx length, maximum transverse diameter, outer dorsoventral diameter, and VF thickness; internal VF length was found to mature linearly. Cell proliferation measured with EdU in the coronal and transverse planes of the VFs was found to decrease with increasing age. Exploiting atomic force microscopy, we measured significant differences in tissue stiffness across all time points except between E13.5 and E15.5. Taken together, our results indicate that as the VF mature and develop quadratically, there is a concomitant tissue stiffness increase. Greater gains in biomechanical stiffness at later prenatal stages, correlated with reduced cell proliferation, suggest that extracellular matrix deposition may be responsible for VF thickening and increased biomechanical function, and that the onset of biomechanical loading (breathing) may also contribute to increased stiffness. These data provide a profile of VF biomechanical and growth properties that can guide the development of biomechanically-relevant scaffolds and progenitor cell differentiation for VF tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3118580833,"Financial advisors often emphasize asset diversification as a means of limiting losses from investments that perform unexpectedly poorly over a particular time period. One might expect that this perceived wisdom could apply in another high stakes arena–professional baseball–where player salaries comprise a substantial portion of a team’s operational costs, year-to-year player performance is highly variable, and injuries can occur at any time. These attributes are particularly true in the case of the starting pitching staffs of professional baseball teams. Accordingly, this study analyzes starting pitcher performance and financial data from all Major League Baseball teams for the period 1985–2016 to determine whether the standard investment advice is applicable in this context, understanding that the time horizon for success for an investor and a baseball team may be distinct. A multiple logistic regression model of playoff qualification probability, based on realized pitcher performance, measures of luck, and starting pitcher staff salary diversification is used to address this question. A further stratification is conducted to determine whether there are differences in strategy for teams with allocated financial resources that are above or below league average. We find that teams with above average resources increase their post-season qualification probability by focusing their salary funds on a relative few starting pitchers rather than diversifying that investment across the staff. Second, we find that pitcher performance must align with that investment in order for the team to have a high qualification probability. Third, the influence of luck is not negligible, but those teams that allocate more overall funds to their pitching are more resilient to bad luck. Thus, poorly resourced teams, who are generally unable to bid for pitchers at the highest salary levels, must adopt alternative strategies to maintain their competitiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3119546074,"The transcriptional network determines a cell’s internal state by regulating protein expression in response to changes in the local environment. Due to the interconnected nature of this network, information encoded in the abundance of various proteins will often propagate across chains of noisy intermediate signaling events. The data-processing inequality (DPI) leads us to expect that this intracellular game of “telephone” should degrade this type of signal, with longer chains losing successively more information to noise. However, a previous modeling effort predicted that because the steps of these signaling cascades do not truly represent independent stages of data processing, the limits of the DPI could seemingly be surpassed, and the amount of transmitted information could actually increase with chain length. What that work did not examine was whether this regime of growing information transmission was attainable by a signaling system constrained by the mechanistic details of more complex protein-binding kinetics. Here we address this knowledge gap through the lens of information theory by examining a model that explicitly accounts for the binding of each transcription factor to DNA. We analyze this model by comparing stochastic simulations of the fully nonlinear kinetics to simulations constrained by the linear response approximations that displayed a regime of growing information. Our simulations show that even when molecular binding is considered, there remains a regime wherein the transmitted information can grow with cascade length, but ends after a critical number of links determined by the kinetic parameter values. This inflection point marks where correlations decay in response to an oversaturation of binding sites, screening informative transcription factor fluctuations from further propagation down the chain where they eventually become indistinguishable from the surrounding levels of noise."

Bats in China moved to Jeju Island and/or Taiwan in the last 20,000 years via the Korean Peninsula and/or Japan. The phylogenies of host mitochondrial D-loop DNA was not significantly congruent with those of bat adenovirus (m 2 XY = 0.07, p = 0.08), and bat alphacoronavirus (m 2 XY = 0.48, p = 0.20). We estimate that the first divergence time of bats carrying bat adenovirus in five caves studied (designated as K1, K2, JJ, N2, and F3) occurred approximately 3.17 million years ago. In contrast, the first divergence time of bat adenovirus among bats in the 5 caves was estimated to be approximately 224.32 years ago. The first divergence time of bats in caves CH, JJ, WY, N2, F1, F2, and F3 harboring bat alphacoronavirus was estimated to be 1.59 million years ago. The first divergence time of bat alphacoronavirus among the 7 caves was estimated to be approximately 2,596.92 years ago. The origin of bat adenovirus remains unclear, whereas our findings suggest that bat alphacoronavirus originated in Japan. Surprisingly, bat adenovirus and bat alphacoronavirus appeared to diverge substantially over the last 100 years, even though our gene-flow data indicate that the eastern bent-winged bat serves as an important natural reservoir of both viruses."

Yet, there are limited data available about the impact of this interaction on clinical outcomes. We studied the effect of MO on mortality in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary PCI using a prospective registry. Methods Of the 1255 patients who underwent primary PCI, 397 received MO based on physician's judgment. Clopidogrel was used as P2Y 12 receptor antagonist in all cases. Median follow-up time was 7.5 years with 457 deaths. To adjust for confounding, two propensity score-based procedures were performed: 1 to 1 matching (PSM, 728 cases), and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) retaining data from all patients. Primary outcome measure was time to all-cause death, whereas predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was used as secondary end point. Results An adequate balance on baseline covariates was achieved by both methods. We found no difference in survival as the HR (MO/no MO) was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76–1.26), p = 0.86 using PSM and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.84–1.23), p = 0.88 with IPTW. Likewise, distributions of LVEFs were similar using either methods: with PSM, median LVEFs were 50.0% (interquartile range [IQR]: 43.0%–55.3%) vs 50.0% (IQR: 42.0%–55.0%) in the no MO and MO groups, respectively (p = 0.76), whereas using IPTW, they were 50.0% (IQR: 42.5%–55.0%) vs 50.0% (IQR: 41.0%–55.0%), respectively (p = 0.86). Conclusions Our data suggest that morphine use may have no impact on long-term mortality and on predischarge ejection fraction in STEMI patients treated with primary PCI."
