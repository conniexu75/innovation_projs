https://openalex.org/W2009399134,"Localization of the 215 kd mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) was studied in normal rat kidney cells. Low levels of receptor were detected in the trans Golgi network, Golgi stack, plasma membrane, and peripheral endosomes. The bulk of the receptor was localized to an acidic, reticular-vesicular structure adjacent to the Golgi complex. The structure also labeled with antibodies to lysosomal enzymes and a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein (lgp120). While lysosome-like, this structure is not a typical lysosome that is devoid of MPRs. The endocytic marker alpha 2 macroglobulin-gold entered the structure at 37 degrees C, but not at 20 degrees C. With prolonged chase, most of the marker was transported from the structure into lysosomes. We propose that the MPR/lgp-enriched structure is a specialized endosome (prelysosome) that serves as an intermediate compartment into which endocytic vesicles discharge their contents, and where lysosomal enzymes are released from the MPR and packaged along with newly synthesized lysosomal glycoproteins into lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2011509827,A novel strategy has been used to isolate a CDNA clone that encodes a DNA binding domain whose recognition properties overlap those of the mammalian transcription factors H2TF1 and NF-κB. These two factors are distinguished by their cell type distributions and their relative affinities for related sequence elements in the enhancers of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 and immunoglobulin κ chain genes. The human cDNA clone was detected by screening a λ phage expression library with a binding site probe derived from the MHC enhancer. The phage encoded fusion protein binds specifically to both the MHC and κ gene enhancers. The cDNA hybridizes to a single copy gene that is expressed as a 10 kb mRNA in both B and non-B cells. The strategy used in this study may prove generally useful in the cloning and analysis of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1969949240,"The Fos protein complex and several Fos-related antigens bind directly or indirectly to a common sequence element that is similar to the consensus binding site for HeLa cell activator protein 1 (AP-1). This element is present in a negative regulatory sequence in the differentiation-sensitive adipocyte gene, aP2; in a transcriptional enhancer for the Gibbon ape leukemia virus; and in a region of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat partially characterized as a negative regulatory element. The protein level and binding activity of Fos and Fos-related antigens increase rapidly after calcium ionophore treatment of a CD4+ human lymphoblast cell line, H9. These data suggest that several proteins may associate with the AP-1 binding site. Moreover, temporally regulated control of the level of each protein could represent a mechanism for modulation of these putative mediators of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2018869556,"Insulin-dependent diabetes is caused by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic islets. It has been proposed that aberrant expression of Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules on beta cells stimulates an autoimmune attack against beta cell antigens. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice that express Class II MHC molecules (E alpha d/E beta b, or I-Eb) on beta cells. Diabetes was found in 100% of transgenic progeny from three expressing transgenic mouse lines, but without evidence for lymphocytic infiltrates. Furthermore, T lymphocytes appeared to be tolerant to the transgene I-Eb molecule, despite the absence of expression of I-Eb in the thymus or any other lymphoid tissue. The results suggest that novel expression of Class II MHC molecules on nonlymphoid cells is by itself insufficient to initiate autoimmune responses against tissue-specific antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1585676872,"Transforming growth factors of the beta-class (TGFs-beta) stimulate extracellular matrix synthesis and have been implicated in embryogenesis, wound healing, and fibroproliferative responses to tissue injury. Because cells communicate with several extracellular matrix components via specific cell membrane receptors, we hypothesized that TGFs-beta may also regulate the expression of such receptors. We confirmed that TGF-beta 1 increases the expression of fibronectin, an adhesive glycoprotein expressed during embryogenesis and tissue remodeling. Based upon the 48-72-h period required for a maximal fibroproliferative response to dermal injections of TGF-beta 1, we exposed human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) to TGF-beta 1 for periods up to 48 h in vitro. We observed as much as 6-fold increases in fibronectin synthesis by 24 h as previously reported for fibroblastic cells (Ignotz, R. A., and Massague, J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4337-4345; Ignotz, R. A., Endo, T., and Massague, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6443-6446; Raghow, R., Postlethwaithe, A. E., Keski-Oja, J., Moses, H. L., and Kang, A. H. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 79, 1285-1288), but up to 30-fold increases by 48 h. These increases are accompanied by similar increases in fibronectin mRNA levels which are prevented by actinomycin D treatment. Using a monospecific antibody raised to the human placental fibronectin receptor complex, we found that TGF-beta 1 stimulated fibronectin receptor synthesis up to 20-40-fold and increases mRNA levels encoding both the alpha- and beta-subunits up to 3-fold, compared to control IMR-90 in serum-free medium. Actinomycin D blocks TGF-beta 1-mediated increases in receptor mRNA levels. The earliest detectable TGF-beta 1-mediated increases in fibronectin receptor complex protein synthesis and mRNA levels occur at 8 h, whereas the earliest increases in fibronectin protein synthesis and mRNA levels occur at 12 h. These results demonstrate that TGF-beta 1 stimulates fibronectin receptor synthesis, extending the diverse stimulatory activities of this polypeptide to matrix receptors. In addition, because fibronectin matrix assembly may involve the fibronectin cell adhesive receptor complex, increased receptor expression may help drive fibronectin deposition into matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2101447839,"Transgenic mice that carry fusions between the transcriptional regulatory sequences of atrial natriuretic factor (a hormone intimately involved in the regulation of blood pressure) and those encoding SV40 T antigen (an oncoprotein) were generated. Although both atria express the fusion gene, the pathological response to T antigen is asymmetrical. The right atrium undergoes a several hundredfold increase in mass while the left atrium remains relatively normal in size. Hyperplasia is accompanied by a progressive increase in both the frequency and severity of abnormalities in the atrial conduction system, which ultimately result in death."
https://openalex.org/W2099010190,"Dynein, the force-generating enzyme that powers the movement of cilia and flagella, has been characterized biochemically, but no simple system has been available for examining its motile properties. Here we describe a quantitative in vitro motility assay in which dynein adsorbed onto a glass surface induces linear translocation of purified bovine microtubules. Using this assay, we show that both 22S and 14S dyneins from Tetrahymena cilia induce movement but have distinct motile properties. A unique property of 14S dynein, which has not been described for other motility proteins, is its ability to generate torque that causes microtubules to rotate during forward translocation. In the axoneme, 14S dynein-induced torque may induce rotation of central-pair microtubules and may play an important role in generating three-dimensional ciliary beating patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1982069598,"S100 protein is a calcium-binding protein found predominantly in the vertebrate nervous system. Genomic and complementary DNA probes were used in conjunction with a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids to assign the gene for the β subunit of S100 protein to the distal half of the long arm of human chromosome 21. This gene was identified as a candidate sequence which, when expressed in the trisomic state, may underlie the neurologic disturbances in Down syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1517176127,"The in vivo accumulation of polypeptide chains in the form of aggregated non-native states is a problem in many applications of biotechnology. In the maturation pathway of the thermostable P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase, the folding and chain association intermediates can be distinguished from the native tailspikes in crude extracts of phage-infected Salmonella cells. Temperature-sensitive folding mutations, at many sites in the chain, destabilize these conformational intermediates preventing the formation of native tailspikes at restrictive temperatures (Goldenberg, D. P., Smith, D. H., and King, J. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 7060-7064). We report here that both wild type and mutant tailspike polypeptide chains which fail to reach the native state accumulate in an aggregated state. These off-pathway aggregates form from a thermolabile intermediate in the productive folding pathway. These aggregation reactions are suppressed by lowering the temperature of maturation. Similar off-pathway steps from folding intermediates may account for the non-native aggregates often found in the expression of cloned genes in heterologous hosts."

https://openalex.org/W1531451570,"Chimeric Fc receptors, consisting of the IgG-binding domains of both staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G, were constructed. An efficient bacterial expression system was used to produce the recombinant proteins, which vary in size and number of IgG-binding domains. The purified receptors were analyzed by immunodiffusion and a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to establish the relative binding strength to various polyclonal and monoclonal immunoglobulins from different species. The results demonstrate that protein A and protein G have complementary binding patterns and that the chimeric receptors retain the binding capacities of both the parental constituents. This suggests that these novel chimeric receptors might be versatile reagents for immunochemical assays."
https://openalex.org/W1967864930,"A DNA molecule carrying Mu end DNA sequence(s) is a poor target in the Mu DNA strand-transfer reaction, a phenomenon which is referred to as ""target immunity."" We find that Mu B protein stimulates intermolecular strand-transfer by binding to the target DNA. Our results show that a differential distribution of Mu B protein between ""immune"" and ""non-immune"" DNA molecules is responsible for target immunity; in the presence of Mu A protein and ATP, Mu B protein dissociates preferentially from immune DNA molecules. Hydrolysis of ATP is implicated in establishing the differential distribution of Mu B protein between immune and non-immune DNA molecules in the presence of Mu A protein; nonhydrolyzable ATP gamma S can support an efficient strand-transfer reaction even with a target DNA that is immune in a reaction with ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2069017620,"During lambda integration, Int recombinase must specifically bind to and cut attachment sites on both the viral and host chromosomes. We show here by foot-printing and by a novel cleavage assay that the bacterial attachment site, attB, cannot stably bind Int in competition with other DNAs. Instead, during recombination reactions, attB obtains its Int by collision with the intasome, a nucleoprotein assembly that forms on the viral attachment site, attP. Our cleavage assay also shows that the capture of attB by the attP intasome does not depend on DNA homology between the two sites; synapsis is governed solely by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1507475376,"Analysis of two recombinant variants of chicken striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin has shown that the structure of the amino terminus is crucial for most aspects of tropomyosin function: affinity to actin, promotion of binding to actin by troponin, and regulation of the actomyosin MgATPase. Initial characterization of variants expressed and isolated from Escherichia coli has been published (Hitchcock-DeGregori, S. E., and Heald, R. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9730-9735). Fusion tropomyosin contains 80 amino acids of a nonstructural influenza virus protein (NS1) on the amino terminus. Nonfusion tropomyosin is a variant because the amino-terminal methionine is not acetylated (unacetylated tropomyosin). The affinity of tropomyosin labeled at Cys190 with N-[14C]ethylmaleimide for actin was measured by cosedimentation in a Beckman Airfuge. Fusion tropomyosin binds to actin with an affinity slightly greater than that of chicken striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin (Kapp = 1-2 X 10(7) versus 0.5-1 X 10(7) M-1) and more strongly than unacetylated tropomyosin (Kapp = 3 X 10(5) M-1). Both variants bind cooperatively to actin. Troponin increases the affinity of unacetylated tropomyosin for actin (+Ca2+, Kapp = 6 X 10(6) M-1; +EGTA, Kapp = 2 X 10(7) M-1), but the affinity is still lower than that of muscle tropomyosin for actin in the presence of troponin (Kapp much greater than 10(8) M-1). Troponin has no effect on the affinity of fusion tropomyosin for actin indicating that binding of troponin T to the over-lap region of the adjacent tropomyosin, presumably sterically prevented by the fusion peptide in fusion tropomyosin, is required for troponin to promote the binding of tropomyosin to actin. The role of troponin T in regulation and the mechanisms of cooperative binding of tropomyosin to actin have been discussed in relation to this work."
https://openalex.org/W1492839186,"We have isolated two genomic clones which together encode the Ca2+-ATPase of rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. One of the two 16.5 kilobase (kb) genomic inserts in the lambda phage vector Charon 4A contains 23 exons extending from the polyadenylation site at the 3' end of the ATPase gene to within 38 nucleotides of the translation initiation codon in the 5' exon. An overlapping genomic insert of 16.5 kb contains the remainder of the 5' exon and a further 8 kb of upstream sequence. S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis of the 5' end of the Ca2+-ATPase mRNA indicate that the transcription initiation site is located 185 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation initiation codon. A TATA box (CA-TAAA) was found at position -30 and the sequence CCAAT was found at position -78 relative to the transcription initiation site. In a previous study (Brandl, C. J., de Leon, S., Martin, D. R., and MacLennan, D. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3768-3774) cDNAs for neonatal and adult forms of the fast-twitch Ca2+-ATPase were shown to encode different carboxyl-terminal sequences, presumably as a result of alternative splicing. We have now found that these different DNA sequences encoding different carboxyl-terminal sequences are located in different exons. Exon boundaries of the Ca2+-ATPase gene did not correlate well with proposed domain boundaries for the Ca2+-ATPase protein. The locations of exon/intron boundaries were only partially conserved between the Ca2+-ATPase gene and a Na+/K+-ATPase gene (Ovchinnikov, Y. A., Monastyrskaya, G. S., Broude, N. E., Allikmets, R. L., Ushkaryov, Y. A., Melkov, A. M., Smirnov, Y. V., Malyshev, I. V., Dulubova, I. E., Petrukhin, K. E., Gryshin, A. V., Sverdlov, V. E., Kiyatkin, N. I., Kostina, M. B., Modyanov, N. N., and Sverdlov, E. D. (1987) FEBS Lett. 213, 73-80) and they did not follow closely the boundaries of amino acid sequences that are highly conserved among a group of ion transport ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1626530869,"Four structural analogs of human insulin-like growth factor I (hIGF-I) have been prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of a synthetic IGF-I gene and subsequent expression and purification of the mutant protein from the conditioned media of transformed yeast. [Phe-1,Val1,Asn2, Gln3,His4,Ser8, His9,Glu12,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I (B-chain mutant), in which the first 16 amino acids of hIGF-I were replaced with the first 17 amino acids of the B-chain of insulin, has greater than 1,000-, 100-, and 2-fold reduced potency for human serum binding proteins, the rat liver type 2 IGF receptor, and the human placental type 1 IGF receptor, respectively. The B-chain mutant also has 4-fold increased affinity for the human placental insulin receptor. [Gln3,Ala4]IGF-I has 4-fold reduced affinity for human serum binding proteins, but is equipotent to hIGF-I at the types 1 and 2 IGF and insulin receptors. [Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I has 4-fold reduced affinity for human serum binding proteins and 10-fold increased affinity for the insulin receptor. This peptide is also equipotent to hIGF-I at the types 1 and 2 IGF receptors. The peptide in which these four-point mutations are combined, [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I, has 600-fold reduced affinity for the serum binding proteins. This peptide has 10-fold increased potency for the insulin receptor, but is equipotent to hIGF-I at the types 1 and 2 IGF receptors. All four of these mutants stimulate DNA synthesis in the rat vascular smooth muscle cell line A10 with potencies reflecting their potency at the type 1 IGF receptor. These studies identify some of the domains of hIGF-I which are responsible for maintaining high affinity binding with the serum binding protein and the type 2 IGF receptor. In addition, these peptides will be useful in defining the role of the type 2 IGF receptor and serum binding proteins in the physiological actions of hIGF-I."

The degrees of inhibition by 3 x 10(-6) M K-252a were 69 and 48% of the control activities with the purified enzyme and the cross-linked complex, respectively. Chlorpromazine (3 x 10(-4) M), a calmodulin antagonist, inhibited the native enzyme, but not the cross-linked one. These results suggested that K-252a inhibited myosin light chain kinase by direct interaction with the enzyme, whereas chlorpromazine suppressed the enzyme activation by interacting with calmodulin. 3) The inhibition by K-252a of the cross-linked kinase was affected by the concentration of ATP, a phosphate donor. The concentration causing 50% inhibition was two orders magnitude lower in the presence of 100 microM ATP than in the presence of 2 mM ATP. 4) Kinetic analyses using [gama-32P]ATP indicated that the inhibitory mode of K-252a was competitive with respect to ATP (Ki = 20 nM). These results suggest that K-252a interacts at the ATP-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase. The direct action of the compound on the enzyme would explain the multivarious inhibition of myosin ATPase, of superprecipitation, and of the contractile response of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1564963470,"The role of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4B in translation is somewhat uncertain, although it appears to stimulate a variety of activities of eIF-4A and eIF-4F. Using the model RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis assay, the ability of eIF-4B to stimulate eIF-4A and eIF-4F was investigated. The most dramatic effect of eIF-4B is to increase the affinity of eIF-4A for RNA; no effect is seen on the affinity of eIF-4A for ATP. This is not the case for eIF-4F where stimulation occurs primarily through an increase in Vmax and not a change in the affinity for RNA. The finding that eIF-4A and eIF-4B can bind to an mRNA (lacking in secondary structure), with essentially the same degree of effectiveness and affinity as would occur for natural mRNAs in the presence of eIF-4A, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F, suggests a possible role for eIF-4A and eIF-4B in both cap-independent and internal initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1504805361,"Abstract There are two major isozymes of human lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52), hexosaminidase A, alpha(beta a beta b), and hexosaminidase B, 2(beta a beta b). The alpha subunit contains a single polypeptide chain, while the beta subunit is composed of two nonidentical chains (beta a and beta b) derived from a common pro-beta precursor. The mature subunits, like those of most lysosomal enzymes, are produced through the proteolytic processing of propolypeptides once they enter the lysosome. In order to define the structure of the alpha and beta subunits generated in the lysosome, the alpha, beta a, and beta b polypeptides of hexosaminidase A and B were separated by a combination of molecular sieve and ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography, and amino-terminal sequences were determined. These were localized to the deduced amino acid sequences of previously isolated cDNAs coding for the prepro-alpha and beta polypeptides. From this analysis, the sites of hydrolysis generating the mature alpha, beta a, and beta b chains from hexosaminidase A and B could be determined. First, the signal peptide, required for processing of the pre-propolypeptides through the rough endoplasmic reticulum was predicted from the first in-frame Met residue on the cDNA. Second, amino acid sequencing defined the amino termini of the mature polypeptide chains and identified the pro-sequences removed from both the pro-alpha and pro-beta polypeptides. Third, an internal cleavage resulted in the removal of a tetrapeptide, Arg-Gln-Asn-Lys, and tripeptide, Arg-Gln-Asn, from the pro-beta chain of hexosaminidase A and B, respectively , to generate the beta b and beta a chains. This result localized the beta b and beta a chains to the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal halves of the pro-beta sequence, respectively. Finally, we previously reported minimal or no carboxyl-terminal processing of the pro-beta chain in the lysosome. On the other hand, we suggest that there is trimming at the carboxyl terminus of the pro-alpha chain based on comparison of molecular weights of deglycosylated alpha with the isolated beta b and beta a chains comprising the mature beta subunit with those predicted from the cDNA. Thus, in the lysosome the pro forms of hexosaminidase A and B undergo extensive proteolytic processing which, while specific in nature, has the appearance of removing easily accessible, nonessential domains, rather than contributing to biosynthetic maturation of function."
https://openalex.org/W1525457441,"Rat liver Golgi membranes contain two alpha 1,2-specific mannosidases (IA and IB) (Tulsiani, D. R. P., Hubbard, S. C., Robbins, P. W., and Touster, O. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3660-3668). Mannosidase IA has now been purified to apparent homogeneity by detergent extraction and (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, followed by Sephacryl S-300, ion-exchange, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The enzyme was homogeneous by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with different gel concentrations, and Ferguson plot analysis indicated an Mr of 230,000 for the native enzyme. Although electrophoresis under denaturing conditions generally gave a subunit Mr of 57,000, electrophoresis of less than 1 microgram of protein yielded a faint doublet of Mr 57,000 and 58,000. Thus, the enzyme appears to be a tetramer with four very similar subunits. The enzyme bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B only when it was kept in contact with the lectin for 16 h. Endoglycosidase H treatment resulted in loss of its binding to the lectin, without leading to a detectable change in the size of the enzyme subunit. On electrophoretic gels, the enzyme gave a faint positive stain with periodic acid-Schiff's base. The enzyme contained about 0.9% hexose by direct analysis. It did not bind to affinity resins specific for neuraminic acid, galactose, or N-acetylglucosamine. All these studies suggest that the enzyme is a glycoprotein containing only one or two clusters of high mannose oligosaccharide. Mannosidase IA is active toward oligosaccharides containing alpha 1,2-linked mannosyl residues. [3H]Man9GlcNAc, [3H] Man8GlcNAc, [3H]Man7GlcNAc, and [3H]Man6GlcNAc are good substrates. Man9GlcNAc, the best substrate, yields Man8, Man7, and Man6 derivatives with structures suggesting that the sequence of release of mannose residues is rather specific. Immunoprecipitation studies using polyclonal antibody (IgG) prepared against homogeneous mannosidase IA cross-reacted with mannosidase IB, a result suggesting that these two enzymes share antigenic determinants. However, no cross-reactivity was observed with rat liver cytosolic and lysosomal alpha-D-mannosidases or with Golgi mannosidase II."
https://openalex.org/W1546774137,"The factors controlling the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a hypothalamic neuropeptide involved in the regulation of ACTH secretion, are poorly understood partly because a suitable in vitro model is lacking. To study the regulation of CRH gene expression, an 8-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment containing the entire human CRH gene as well as approximately 6 kb of 5' sequence and 0.8 kb of 3' sequence was isolated from a lambda Charon 4A human genomic library and introduced into a mouse anterior pituitary cell line, AtT-20, by CaPO4 transfection with a neomycin-selectable marker. Approximately 10% of the neomycin-resistant lines stably expressed the CRH gene and secreted radioimmunoassay-detectable CRH into culture media at levels greater than 100 pg/ml. By Southern blot analysis the 8-kb DNA fragment containing the CRH gene had been incorporated intact into the AtT-20 genome. In each CRH-producing strain, but not in the parent AtT-20 cell line, we detected by Northern blot analysis an RNA species that hybridized to two radioactive cRNA probes specific for either the 5' or 3' portion of CRH mRNA, and that co-migrated with placental CRH mRNA. Dexamethasone treatment for 24-96 h caused a specific decrease in CRH mRNA and peptide levels of 40-50% in the five CRH-producing cell lines with half-maximal suppression at approximately 10(-9) M dexamethasone, indicating that CRH gene expression is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. Thus, we have established an in vitro model suitable for studying in detail those cis- and trans-acting factors which regulate CRH gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1504343794,"The precursor for transforming growth factor-alpha, proTGF-alpha, is synthesized as an integral membrane glycoprotein with the mature TGF-alpha sequence located in the extracellular domain. Retrovirally transformed rat embryo fibroblasts (FeSV-Fre cells) expressing the endogenous proTGF-alpha gene release and accumulate in the medium mature TGF-alpha as well as a heterogeneous (17-19 kDa) group of soluble, bioactive TGF-alpha precursor forms. These precursors correspond to the heterogeneously glycosylated extracellular domain of proTGF-alpha which is released from the membrane by proteolytic cleavage. They are designated mesoTGF-alpha to denote their intermediate position in the proTGF-alpha processing pathway. The nature of the carbohydrate linked to mesoTGF-alpha has been examined by treatment with glycosidases and the use of metabolic inhibitors of glycosylation. The results indicate that the TGF-alpha precursors from FeSV-Fre cells contain O-linked carbohydrate as well as sialylated N-linked carbohydrate. Heterogeneous N-linked glycosylation of an 11-kDa core polypeptide accounts for the heterogeneous nature of mesoTGF-alpha. MesoTGF-alpha released by cells treated with inhibitors of N-linked carbohydrate processing appears as a 17-kDa species. Treatment with these inhibitors does not alter significantly the production of mesoTGF-alpha or mature TGF-alpha by the cells. However, treatment of cells with an inhibitor of co-translational N-linked glycosylation, tunicamycin, reduces the accumulation of mesoTGF-alpha in the medium and blocks the production of mature TGF-alpha under conditions in which overall protein synthesis is only minimally affected. These findings suggest that the proTGF-alpha processing activity is limiting in FeSV-Fre cells and other transformed cells that accumulate mesoTGF-alpha in the medium and that proTGF-alpha processing depends on a component whose function may require N-linked glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1485376061,"The cDNA encoding a low Mr derivative (residues 144-411) of human single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator was cloned, the recombinant low Mr single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA-32k) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the translation product was purified to homogeneity from conditioned cell culture medium. rscu-PA-32k is very similar to intact recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator in terms of its very low activity (120 IU/mg) on a chromogenic substrate for urokinase (pyroglutamylglycylarginine p-nitroanilide), its plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates (specific activity = 170,000 IU/mg), its plasminogen activating potential, and the lack of specific binding to fibrin. In a rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model, comparable thrombolysis was obtained with rscu-PA-32k as compared to low molecular weight two-chain urokinase (50% lysis at 2.1 and 1.6 mg/kg infused over 4 h). Thrombolysis was associated with much less extensive systemic fibrinogen breakdown with rscu-PA-32k than with two-chain urokinase (residual fibrinogen at 50% lysis of 71 and 10%, respectively). It is concluded that the functional properties of rscu-PA-32k, expressed with a high efficiency, are similar to those of its previously characterized natural counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W1549391316,"We have used specific inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing enzymes as probes to determine the involvement of oligosaccharide residues in the biosynthesis and function of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors.

Chem. 261, 970-975) swainsonine was used to inhibit mannosidase II, resulting in the production of receptors containing only hybrid-type oligosaccharides. These receptors had a slightly lower molecular weight and were much more sensitive to endoglycosidase H, but otherwise behaved identically to normal receptors. In this study, we used two compounds that inhibit oligosaccharide processing at earlier steps: (i) N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (MedJN), which inhibits glucosidases I and II and yields glucosylated, high mannose oligosaccharides, and (ii) manno-1-deoxynojirimycin (MandJN), which inhibits mannosidase I and yields high mannose oligosaccharides. In the presence of MandJN, HepG2 cells synthesized receptors of lower molecular weight, which were cleaved into alpha and beta subunits and were able to bind hormone and autophosphorylate. These receptors were as sensitive to endoglycosidase H as receptors made in the presence of swainsonine. In the presence of MedJN, receptors of only slightly lower molecular weight than normal were synthesized and were shown to contain some glucosylated high mannose oligosaccharides. These receptors were able to bind hormone and retained hormone-sensitive autophosphorylation activity. In both cases, the incompletely processed receptors could be detected at the cell surface by cross-linking of iodinated hormone and susceptibility to trypsin digestion, although less receptor was present in cells treated with MedJN. Studies of receptor synthesis using pulse-chase labeling showed that the receptor precursors synthesized in the presence of MedJN were cleaved into alpha and beta subunits at a slower rate than normal receptors or those made in the presence of MandJN. Inhibition of oligosaccharide processing had no effect on the association of the receptor subunits into disulfide-linked oligomeric complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1577045758,"The two subunits of beta-hexosaminidase undergo many post-translational modifications characteristic of lysosomal proteins, including limited proteolysis. To identify proteolytic cleavage sites in the alpha-chain, we have biosynthetically radiolabeled the transient forms, isolated these by immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and electroelution, and subjected them to automated Edman degradation. The position of the NH2-terminal amino acid was inferred from the elution cycle of the radioactive amino acid and the primary sequence encoded in the alpha-chain cDNA. The amino terminus of the precursor obtained by in vitro translation of SP6 alpha-chain mRNA in the presence of microsomes was leucine 23. The same amino terminus was found in precursor alpha-chain synthesized by normal human fibroblasts (IMR90) in a 1- or 3-h pulse or secreted by these cells in the presence of NH4Cl. The alpha-chain isolated after a 3-h pulse followed by a 5-h chase (intermediate form) included a mixture of molecular species of which the amino terminus was arginine 87 (most abundant), histidine 88, or leucine 90. After a 20-h chase (mature form) the latter species predominated. This mature form of the alpha-chain remained fully reactive with antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids, indicating little if any proteolysis at the carboxyl terminus. Thus synthesis and maturation of the alpha-chain of beta-hexosaminidase includes two major proteolytic cleavages: the first, between alanine 22 and leucine 23, removes the signal peptide to generate the precursor form, whereas the second occurs between the dibasic amino acids, lysine 86 and arginine 87. The second cleavage is followed by trimming of 3 additional amino acids to give the mature form of the alpha-chain."
https://openalex.org/W1523148876,"Studies were undertaken to investigate potential interactions among plasma lipoproteins. Techniques used were low density lipoprotein2 (LDL2)-ligand blotting of plasma lipoproteins separated by nondenaturing 2.5-15% gradient gel electrophoresis, ligand binding of plasma lipoproteins by affinity chromatography with either LDL2 or lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) as ligands, and agarose lipoprotein electrophoresis. Ligand blotting showed that LDL2 can bind to Lp(a). When apolipoprotein(a) was removed from Lp(a) by reduction and ultracentrifugation, no interaction between LDL2 and reduced Lp(a) was detected by ligand blotting. Ligand binding showed that LDL2-Sepharose 4B columns bound plasma lipoproteins containing apolipoproteins(a), B, and other apolipoproteins. The Lp(a)-Sepharose column bound lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B and other apolipoproteins. Furthermore, the Lp(a) ligand column bound more lipoprotein lipid than the LDL2 ligand column, with the Lp(a) ligand column having a greater affinity for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Lipoprotein electrophoresis of a mixture of LDL2 and Lp(a) demonstrated a single band with a mobility intermediate between that of LDL2 and Lp(a). Chemical modification of the lysine residues of apolipoprotein B (apoB) by either acetylation or acetoacetylation prevented or diminished the interaction of LDL2 with Lp(a), as shown by both agarose electrophoresis and ligand blotting using modified LDL2. Moreover, removal of the acetoacetyl group from the lysine residues of apoB by hydroxylamine reestablished the interaction of LDL2 with Lp(a). On the other hand, blocking of--SH groups of apoB by iodoacetamide failed to show any effect on the interaction between LDL2 and Lp(a). Based on these observations, it was concluded that Lp(a) interacts with LDL2 and other apoB-containing lipoproteins which are enriched in triglyceride; this interaction is due to the presence of apolipoprotein(a) and involves lysine residues of apoB interacting with the plasminogen-like domains (kringle 4) of apolipoprotein(a). Such results suggest that Lp(a) may be involved in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism, could form transient associations with apoB-containing lipoproteins in the vascular compartment, and alter the intake by the high affinity apoB, E receptor pathway."

Electron microscopy of sectioned, negatively stained, freeze-fractured, and frozen-hydrated Ca2+-ATPase crystals indicates that they consist of stacked lamellar arrays of Ca2+-ATPase molecules. Prominent periodicities of ATPase molecules within the lamellae arise from a centered rectangular lattice of dimensions 164 x 55.5 A. The association of lamellae into three-dimensional stacks is assumed to involve interactions between the exposed hydrophilic headgroups of ATPase molecules, that is promoted by glycerol and 20 mM Ca2+. Similar Ca2+-induced crystals were observed with purified or purified and delipidated Ca2+-ATPase preparations at lower detergent/protein ratios. Cross-linking of Ca2+-ATPase crystals with glutaraldehyde protects the structure against conditions such as low Ca2+, high pH, elevated temperature, SH group reagents, high concentration of detergents, and removal of phospholipids by extraction with organic solvents that disrupt unfixed preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1533957803,"Insulin caused a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the binding of 125I-insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) to the surface of cultured H-35 hepatoma cells. The [32P]phosphate content of the IGF-II receptors, immunoprecipitated from extracts of H-35 cell monolayers previously incubated with [32P]phosphate for 24 h, was decreased after brief exposure of the cells to insulin. Analysis of tryptic digests of labeled IGF-II receptors by bidimensional peptide mapping revealed that the decrease in the content of [32P]phosphate occurred to varying degrees on three tryptic phosphopeptides. Thin layer electrophoresis of an acid hydrolysate of isolated IGF-II receptors revealed the presence of [32P] phosphoserine and [32P]phosphothreonine. Insulin treatment of cells caused a decrease in the labeled phosphoserine and phosphothreonine content of IGF-II receptors. The ability of a number of highly purified protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, phosphorylase kinase, and casein kinase II) to catalyze the phosphorylation of purified IGF-II receptors was examined. Casein kinase II was the only kinase capable of catalyzing the phosphorylation of the IGF-II receptor on serine and threonine residues under the conditions of our assay. Bidimensional peptide mapping revealed that the kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of the IGF-II receptor on a tryptic phosphopeptide which comigrated with the main tryptic phosphopeptide found in receptors obtained from cells labeled in vivo with [32P]phosphate. IGF-II receptors isolated by immunoadsorption from insulin-treated H-35 cells were phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II to a greater extent than the receptors isolated from control cells. Similarly, IGF-II receptors from plasma membranes obtained from insulin-treated adipocytes were phosphorylated by casein kinase II to a greater extent than the receptors from control adipocyte plasma membranes. Thus, the insulin-regulated phosphorylation sites on the IGF-II receptor appear to serve as substrates in vivo for casein kinase II or an enzyme with similar substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1496768241,"Membrane integration of a nascent opsin polypeptide was examined to determine whether insertion of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum is dependent upon energy provided by ribonucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. A discrete-sized nascent chain was obtained by in vitro translation of a mRNA which lacked a termination codon yet encoded the first 156 residues of bovine opsin. Ribosomes bearing the newly synthesized opsin chains were post-translationally incubated with canine pancreas microsomal membrane vesicles after addition of exogenous ribonucleotides or ribonucleotide analogues. Post-translational membrane integration and glycosylation of the 156-residue nascent polypeptide was found to require either the presence of guanosine triphosphate or a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue. ATP did not promote post-translational integration of the nascent polypeptide. Although ribonucleotide hydrolysis was not obligatorily required for integration of opsin, we observed an increase in the proportion of glycosylated opsin chains in post-translational incubations that contained hydrolyzable ribonucleotide triphosphates. We conclude that a GTP-binding protein performs an essential role during integration of opsin into the endoplasmic reticulum."

Chem. 262, 15448-15456), the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was labeled with N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine without a loss of the catalytic activity. The main labeled site was Cys674. A large monophasic fluorescence drop occurred upon ATP binding to the catalytic site of the Ca2+-activated enzyme in the presence of K+. The present results show that this fluorescence drop is biphasic in the absence of K+. The first and rapid phase of this drop accounts for most of the fluorescence drop. This phase reflects a conformational change in the enzyme.ATP complex. The second and slow phase, being much smaller than the first phase, coincides with phosphoenzyme (EP) isomerization from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form. This phase disappears when accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP is inhibited by K+ or when EP isomerization is prevented by the N-ethylmaleimide treatment. These results show that this phase reflects a conformational change upon EP isomerization. When free Ca2+ is chelated after EP formation from ATP, the fluorescence intensity is restored to the initial level without Ca2+. This restoration coincides with EP decomposition. This suggests that the fluorescence restoration reflects a conformational change upon hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP. This probability is supported by the concurrent occurrence of the Pi-induced fluorescence drop and EP formation from Pi. The results demonstrate that the fluorescence drop upon ATP binding is predominant in the fluorescence change throughout the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1487313650,"Human neutrophils (PMN) respond to various soluble stimuli by translocating intracellular complement C3b/C4b receptors (CR1) to the cell surface. Ligand-independent internalization of surface CR1 has been demonstrated previously, but the fate of total cellular CR1 during PMN stimulation has not been determined. In order to study the fate of CR1 during neutrophil activation, we have employed a unique approach for the quantitative analysis of intracellular antigens which allows simultaneous measurement of total cellular and surface membrane antigen pools. Stimulation of isolated PMN with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe or ionomycin resulted in a mean 7-fold increase in surface CR1 expression within 15 min. Total cellular CR1 decreased by as much as 45% within 15 min, with loss continuing for up to 1 h. Inclusion of NH4Cl during PMN stimulation inhibited the loss of total CR1 without affecting surface CR1 expression. Addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited loss of total CR1 and enhanced the stimulus-induced increases in surface CR1. These data suggest that intracellular degradation of CR1 occurs during stimulation of PMN and may involve proteolysis in an acidic intracellular compartment. Since our experiments were done with isolated PMN in the absence of serum and complement components, this degradation occurred in the absence of C3b, the ligand for CR1. To our knowledge, ligand-independent degradation of a cell surface receptor has not been previously detected."

In mice that are treated with estradiol there is a marked increase in free heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan in the extract. (a) By Sepharose exclusion chromatography the [35S]sulfate-labeled major HSPG had a nominal Mr of 200-250 X 10(3), consisting of a core protein of about 80-90 X 10(3) Mr with about 8-10 heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains (Mr = 13 X 10(3)). The HSPG had a lower bouyant density (less than 1.45 g/ml) than the dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and was heterogeneous, as was evident in the fact that HSPG attained equilibrium over a wide range of CsCl densities and also showed nonuniform interaction with octyl-Sepharose. (b) Virtually all of the major HSPG was removed when the epithelium was isolated by proteolysis, indicating a cell surface localization. A smaller, less prominent HSPG (nominal Mr = 80 X 10(3)) was synthesized during the first 2 h after isolation. (c) Label and chase experiments with and without chloroquine showed that virtually all of the free heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains derived from endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the plasma membrane-associated HSPG. We conclude that estradiol stimulates endocytosis of HSPG, predominantly from the basolateral epithelial surface and suggest that this HSPG turnover may reflect changes associated with blastocyst attachment and invasion of the endometrium."

https://openalex.org/W1607335372,"Epidemiological data suggest that transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) occurs primarily by transference of virally infected cells. However, the efficiency of lytic productive infection induced by HIV after transmission of cell-associated virus vs. free virus is difficult to assess. The present studies compare the extent of depletion of CD4+ (helper/inducer) T cells after mixing uninfected cells with either free HIV or irradiated HIV-infected allogeneic or autologous cells in vitro. Rapid CD4+ cellular depletion occurred only in cultures containing allogeneic infected cells or after addition of a nonspecific T cell activation signal to cultures with autologous infected cells. These in vitro observations strongly support the epidemiological implication that interactions between infected and uninfected cells are the most efficient means of transmission and HIV-induced cytopathology in vivo. They also provide direct support for the concept that immunological stimulation by foreign cells infected with HIV dramatically increases the likelihood of transmission. These in vitro observations suggest a model for the acquisition of HIV in vivo and the role of cellular activation in dissemination of the virus to uninfected cells in an infected individual."
https://openalex.org/W1487271825,"The gene for ATPase subunit 9 of yeast mitochondria (Oli 1) contains two promoter sequences (Op1 and Op2) separated by 78 nucleotides. Both promoters are transcribed in vivo and in vitro though with different efficiency. The upstream promoter (Op1) is 12-15 times stronger than the downstream promoter (Op2), and this difference in promoter activity is partly attributable to the influence of the +2 nucleotide (Biswas, T. K., and Getz, G. S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 270-274). In addition, the presence of the strong promoter (Op1) in close proximity to the weak promoter (Op2) partially inhibits the expression of the latter (Op2). The relative orientation of the two promoters has no influence on these inhibitory effects. When both promoters are present in the same reaction mixture, the strong promoter always competes effectively with the weak promoter for limited RNA polymerase (trans or competition effect). When the two promoters are present in the same plasmid, there is an inhibitory interaction between them that decreases as the distance between the two promoters increases (cis or position effect). Thus, the difference between the activities of a strong and a weak mitochondrial promoter in tandem is a function of two effects, the trans or competition effect and the cis or position-related effect. A model for promoter-promoter interactions is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1575175033,"Extensive phosphate-water oxygen exchange occurs when ATP is hydrolyzed in an [18O]water medium by length oscillated and Ca2+-activated, chemically skinned fibers from the flight muscle of the giant waterbug Lethocerus indicus. For fibers which are length oscillated under conditions not optimal for ATPase activity or oscillatory work, the pattern of exchange shows two pathways for hydrolysis. One pathway has low exchange, because steps controlling Pi release are rapid; the other pathway has high exchange and slow Pi release. Steps controlling Pi release appear rate-limiting for changes in the high-exchange ATPase activity that occur on varying the frequency and amplitude of oscillation. On length oscillation under conditions of optimal ATPase activity or work, only the high-exchange pathway is present. Cross-bridges following the high-exchange pathway are therefore responsible for oscillatory work, the physiological function of the muscle, and behave uniformly with respect to oxygen exchange. The single pathway and the magnitude of the ATPase activity are both similar to results with isometric strained fibers (Lund, J., Webb, M. R., and White, D. C. S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8584-8590). A qualitative model is suggested for oscillatory work by cross-bridges, arising from the common periodicity of the thick and thin filaments in insect flight muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1509451282,"Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a hydrophobic carboxyl reagent, inhibited Ca2+ release from Ca2+-loaded sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, induced by elevated pH, tetraphenylboron, ATP + Pi, or membrane modification with acetic anhydride. Under the conditions used, the same concentrations of DCCD were required for inhibition of Ca2+ release, Ca2+-ATPase activity, and Ca2+ uptake. On the other hand, free Ca2+ or alkaline pH prevented the inhibition by DCCD of Ca2+-ATPase and coupled Ca2+ transport but not that of Ca2+ release. Moreover, several hydrophilic carboxyl reagents inhibited Ca2+-ATPase but not Ca2+ release. We suggest that a carboxyl residue(s), located in a hydrophobic region of a protein(s), is involved in the control of Ca2+ release, where DCCD interaction with this group blocks Ca2+ release. This group is distinct from the one involved in the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase. DCCD also inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The presence of Ca2+ or an alkaline pH only slightly affects the degree of inhibition of ryanodine binding by DCCD. Incubation of the membranes with [14C]DCCD resulted in labeling of 350-, 170-, 140-, 53-, and 30-kDa proteins in addition to the Ca2+-ATPase. The involvement of one or all of the DCCD-labeled proteins in Ca2+ release and ryanodine binding is discussed."

The E1A so purified is biologically active, stimulating cellular DNA synthesis following microinjection into quiescent NIH 3T3 and REF52 cells. In another report (Spangler, R., Bruner, M., Dalie, B., and Harter, M. L.

https://openalex.org/W1544673792,"Abstract The binding of highly purified monomeric 125I-C3b to its receptor (CR1) on resting human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) was analyzed under equilibrium conditions, at 4 degrees C and ionic strength. Scatchard analysis of specific binding data yielded curvilinear concave upward plots, which resulted from the presence of site-site interactions of the negative type among PMN C3b-receptors (negative cooperativity), as shown by dissociation kinetic experiments. Indeed, the dissociation rate of 125I-C3b from PMN was markedly increased in the presence of an excess of unlabeled C3b in the dilution medium and was directly dependent on the degree of initial receptor occupancy with the radioligand. These interactions occurred when 2% of the receptors were occupied with 125I-C3b and resulted in a 4-fold decrease in CR1 when the receptor went from its empty to its filled conformation. In a disease associated with a continuous production of C3b (factor I deficiency), CR1 on in vivo circulating PMN was found to be in a low affinity and dissociating state similar to that of normal CR1 at high occupancy. Finally, negative cooperativity among CR1 sites disappeared after PMN activation with chemotactic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1486337065,"Abstract The role of pH, KCl, ATP, water activity, and temperature in ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi was investigated in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. In totally aqueous medium, the synthesis of ATP was inhibited by ATP, KCl, and pH values above 6.5. When the water activity of the medium was decreased by the addition of 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, the synthesis of ATP was no longer inhibited by ATP; it was activated by KCl and the optimum pH changed from 6.5 to 7.5. In totally aqueous medium, the concentration of MgCl2 needed for half-maximal synthesis of ATP was found to vary with the temperature of the assay medium; at 35 degrees C it was 1 mM and increased to a value higher than 10 mM when the temperature was decreased to 15 degrees C. In the presence of 30% dimethyl sulfoxide, maximal synthesis of ATP was attained in presence of 0.05 mM MgCl2 at both 15 and 35 degrees C. The hypothesis is raised that in the living cell water structure may play a role in regulating the synthesis of ATP observed during the reversal of the Ca2+ pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1594196605,"In the hydrolysis of MgATP by acto heavy meromyosin (HMM) there are two enzymatic pathways that differ in the properties of their intermediate oxygen exchange; one of these is designated the low exchange pathway (P1); the other is designated the high exchange pathway (P2). A plot of the P1 flux versus the actin concentration gives a sigmoid curve, whereas the corresponding curve for the P2 flux rises in an approximately hyperbolic manner. At low concentrations of actin, where the sigmoid curve of the P1 flux is in a lag phase, the major flux is along P2; but at higher concentrations of actin, as the P1 curve rises sharply, the flux along P1 comes to predominate. Even at the highest levels of actin, at saturating levels for both pathways, the kinetics of exchange along P1 and P2 are significantly different. In addition to these differences in the actin dependence, the flux of P1 relative to P2 is markedly inhibited by KCl. Therefore, which of the two pathways dominates during the hydrolysis of MgATP by HMM is strongly dependent on experimental conditions. The findings suggest that P1 involves the interaction of HMM with two actin units whereas P2 involves the interaction of HMM with one actin unit. The results are discussed in relation to a kinetic scheme based on this proposal."
