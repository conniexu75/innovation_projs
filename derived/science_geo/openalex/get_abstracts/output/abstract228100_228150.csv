We spun fibers and ribbons of carbon nanotubes directly from the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis zone of a furnace using a liquid source of carbon and an iron nanocatalyst. This process was realized through the appropriate choice of reactants, control of the reaction conditions, and continuous withdrawal of the product with a rotating spindle used in various geometries. This direct spinning from a CVD reaction zone is extendable to other types of fiber and to the spin coating of rotating objects in general."
https://openalex.org/W2069705491,"Enduring forms of synaptic plasticity and memory require new protein synthesis, but little is known about the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Here, we investigate the role of MAPK signaling in these processes. Conditional expression of a dominant-negative form of MEK1 in the postnatal murine forebrain inhibited ERK activation and caused selective deficits in hippocampal memory retention and the translation-dependent, transcription-independent phase of hippocampal L-LTP. In hippocampal neurons, ERK inhibition blocked neuronal activity-induced translation as well as phosphorylation of the translation factors eIF4E, 4EBP1, and ribosomal protein S6. Correspondingly, protein synthesis and translation factor phosphorylation induced in control hippocampal slices by L-LTP-generating tetanization were significantly reduced in mutant slices. Translation factor phosphorylation induced in the control hippocampus by memory formation was similarly diminished in the mutant hippocampus. These results suggest a crucial role for translational control by MAPK signaling in long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory."
https://openalex.org/W1987139499,"Cellular lamellipodia bind to the matrix and probe its rigidity through forces generated by rearward F-actin transport. Cells respond to matrix rigidity by moving toward more rigid matrices using an unknown mechanism. In spreading and migrating cells we find local periodic contractions of lamellipodia that depend on matrix rigidity, fibronectin binding and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). These contractions leave periodic rows of matrix bound beta3-integrin and paxillin while generating waves of rearward moving actin bound alpha-actinin and MLCK. The period between contractions corresponds to the time for F-actin to move across the lamellipodia. Shortening lamellipodial width by activating cofilin decreased this period proportionally. Increasing lamellipodial width by Rac signaling activation increased this period. We propose that an actin bound, contraction-activated signaling complex is transported locally from the tip to the base of the lamellipodium, activating the next contraction/extension cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1975510716,"Signals generated in response to extracellular stimuli at the plasma membrane are transmitted through cytoplasmic transduction cascades to the nucleus. We report the identification of a pathway directly linking the small GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of endocytosis, to signal transduction and mitogenesis. This pathway operates via APPL1 and APPL2, two Rab5 effectors, which reside on a subpopulation of endosomes. In response to extracellular stimuli such as EGF and oxidative stress, APPL1 translocates from the membranes to the nucleus where it interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase multiprotein complex NuRD/MeCP1, an established regulator of chromatin structure and gene expression. Both APPL1 and APPL2 are essential for cell proliferation and their function requires Rab5 binding. Our findings identify an endosomal compartment bearing Rab5 and APPL proteins as an intermediate in signaling between the plasma membrane and the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2106302419,"The LKB1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is mutated in the Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome. LKB1 is homologous to the Par-4 polarity genes in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. We have previously reported the identification and characterization of an LKB1-specific adaptor protein, STRAD, which activates LKB1 and translocates it from nucleus to cytoplasm. We have now constructed intestinal epithelial cell lines in which inducible STRAD activates LKB1. Upon LKB1 activation, single cells rapidly remodel their actin cytoskeleton to form an apical brush border. The junctional proteins ZO-1 and p120 redistribute in a dotted circle peripheral to the brush border, in the absence of cell-cell contacts. Apical and basolateral markers sort to their respective membrane domains. We conclude that LKB1 can induce complete polarity in intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast to current thinking on polarization of simple epithelia, these cells can fully polarize in the absence of junctional cell-cell contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2113324803,"The FLO gene family of Saccharomyces cerevisiae includes an expressed gene, FLO11, and a set of silent, telomere-adjacent FLO genes. This gene family encodes cell-wall glycoproteins that regulate cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion. Epigenetic silencing of FLO11 regulates a key developmental switch: when FLO11 is expressed, diploid cells form pseudohyphal filaments; when FLO11 is silent, the cells grow in yeast form. The epigenetic state of FLO11 is heritable for many generations and regulated by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hda1p. The silent FLO10 gene is activated by high-frequency loss-of-function mutations at either IRA1 or IRA2. FLO10 is regulated by the same transcription factors that control FLO11: Sfl1p and Flo8p, but is silenced by a distinct set of HDACs: Hst1p and Hst2p. These sources of epigenetic and genetic variation explain the observed heterogeneity of cell-surface protein expression within a population of cells derived from a single clone."
https://openalex.org/W2154649008,"The fusion pore of regulated exocytosis is a channel that connects and spans the vesicle and plasma membranes. The molecular composition of this important intermediate structure of exocytosis is unknown. Here, we found that mutations of some residues within the transmembrane segment of syntaxin (Syx), a plasma membrane protein essential for exocytosis, altered neurotransmitter flux through fusion pores and altered pore conductance. The residues that influenced fusion-pore flux lay along one face of an alpha-helical model. Thus, the fusion pore is formed at least in part by a circular arrangement of 5 to 8 Syx transmembrane segments in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2102686303,RNA polymerase functions like a molecular motor that can convert chemical energy into the work of strand separation and translocation along the DNA during transcription. The structures of phage T7 RNA polymerase in an elongation phase substrate complex that includes the incoming nucleoside triphosphate and a pretranslocation product complex that includes the product pyrophosphate (PPi) are described here. These structures and the previously determined posttranslocation elongation complex demonstrate that two enzyme conformations exist during a cycle of single nucleotide addition. One orientation of a five-helix subdomain is stabilized by the phosphates of either the incoming NTP or by the product PPi. A second orientation of this subdomain is stable in their absence and is associated with translocation of the heteroduplex product as well as strand separation of the downstream DNA. We propose that the dissociation of the product PPi after nucleotide addition produces the protein conformational change resulting in translocation and strand separation.
https://openalex.org/W2017149825,"Allosteric communication underlies ligand-dependent transcriptional responses mediated by nuclear receptors. While studies have elucidated many of the components involved in this process, the energetic architecture within the receptor protein that mediates allostery remains unknown. Using a sequence-based method designed to detect coevolution of amino acids in a protein, termed the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), we identify a network of energetically coupled residues that link the functional surfaces of nuclear receptor ligand binding domains. Functional analysis of these predicted residues demonstrates their participation in an allosteric network that governs the ability of heterodimeric receptors to activate transcription in response to ligand binding by either partner. Interestingly, mutation of a single network residue can discriminate between receptor activation by endocrine, dietary, and synthetic agonists. These results reveal a structural network required for RXR heterodimer allosteric communication and suggest that the specificity of ligand response and permissivity coevolved to enable signal discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2164517655,"The mechanism by which nucleotide polymerases select the correct substrate is of fundamental importance to the fidelity of DNA replication and transcription. During the nucleotide addition cycle, pol I DNA polymerases undergo the transition from a catalytically inactive ""open"" to an active ""closed"" conformation. All known determinants of substrate selection are associated with the ""closed"" state. To elucidate if this mechanism is conserved in homologous single subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs), we have determined the structure of T7 RNAP elongation complex with the incoming substrate analog. Surprisingly, the substrate specifically binds to RNAP in the ""open"" conformation, where it is base paired with the acceptor template base, while Tyr639 provides discrimination of ribose versus deoxyribose substrates. The structure therefore suggests a novel mechanism, in which the substrate selection occurs prior to the isomerization to the catalytically active conformation. Modeling of multisubunit RNAPs suggests that this mechanism might be universal for all RNAPs."
https://openalex.org/W2109586670,"When faced with nutrient deprivation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells enter into a nondividing resting state, known as stationary phase. The Ras/PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the entry into this resting state and the subsequent survival of stationary phase cells. The survival of these resting cells is also dependent upon autophagy, a membrane trafficking pathway that is induced upon nutrient deprivation. Autophagy is responsible for targeting bulk protein and other cytoplasmic constituents to the vacuolar compartment for their ultimate degradation. The data presented here demonstrate that the Ras/PKA signaling pathway inhibits an early step in autophagy because mutants with elevated levels of Ras/PKA activity fail to accumulate transport intermediates normally associated with this process. Quantitative assays indicate that these increased levels of Ras/PKA signaling activity result in an essentially complete block to autophagy. Interestingly, Ras/PKA activity also inhibited a related process, the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway that is responsible for the delivery of a subset of vacuolar proteins in growing cells. These data therefore indicate that the Ras/PKA signaling pathway is not regulating a switch between the autophagy and Cvt modes of transport. Instead, it is more likely that this signaling pathway is controlling an activity that is required during the early stages of both of these membrane trafficking pathways. Finally, the data suggest that at least a portion of the Ras/PKA effects on stationary phase survival are the result of the regulation of autophagy activity by this signaling pathway.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells respond to nutrient deprivation by arresting cell division and entering into a nondividing resting state, known as the stationary phase (1Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells in this resting state exhibit a diminished rate of metabolic activity, an increased resistance to a variety of environmental stress conditions and an altered pattern of gene expression (1Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Herman P.K. Curr. Opin.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Entry into this quiescent state is essential for the long term survival of these cells as mutants that do not assume stationary phase characteristics rapidly lose viability upon nutrient limitation (1Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, this budding yeast, like most other eukaryotes, spends the majority of its existence in this resting state awaiting the signals needed to trigger new rounds of cell division. This latter observation has suggested that the transitions between the mitotic cycle and these periods of quiescence might be key points of proliferative control (4Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 5Varmus H. Weinberg R.A. Genes and the Biology of Cancer. Scientific American Library, New York1993Google Scholar). However, despite the importance of these resting states, relatively little is known about the mechanisms controlling the entry into, and subsequent maintenance within, this stationary phase of growth. Recent studies have identified a number of genes that are important for the long term survival of S. cerevisiae stationary phase cells (2Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 6Howard S.C. Hester A. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Howard S.C. Chang Y.W.

Interestingly, many of these genes encode proteins important for the process of macroautophagy (10Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 11Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy (to be referred to as simply autophagy for the remainder of this report) is a degradative pathway that is responsible for delivering bulk protein and other constituents of the cytoplasm to the vacuole for degradation (11Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 12Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y.

Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This pathway is induced by nutrient deprivation and mutants that are defective for autophagy rapidly lose viability during stationary phase growth (10Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 14Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Autophagy begins with the encapsulation of cytoplasmic material through the formation of a double membrane structure, termed the autophagosome (12Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct.

Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recent work has indicated that this intermediate originates from a novel cytoplasmic site, termed the pre-autophagosomal structure (12Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 17Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The outer membrane of the autophagosome subsequently fuses with the vacuole releasing the internal vesicle, the autophagic body, into the lumen of this degradative compartment (12Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic enzymes within the vacuole then degrade both the delimiting membrane and the contents of the autophagic body (19Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 20Kim J. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 198: 153-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When this pathway is fully induced, it is generally responsible for the majority of the protein and membrane turnover occurring in those cells (21Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10807-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 539-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has implicated the Tor signal transduction pathway in the control of both autophagy and stationary phase entry in S. cerevisiae. The inactivation of this signaling pathway results in the induction of autophagy and in a growth arrest that resembles that associated with stationary phase cells (24Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 25Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Tor proteins are conserved serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that appear to coordinate the overall growth rate with nutrient availability in eukaryotic cells (26Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 27Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposition, a wide variety of Tor pathway targets important for the control of cell growth have been identified in both yeast and other eukaryotic cells (26Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 27Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schreiber S.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Stationary phase metabolism in S. cerevisiae is also controlled by a second signaling pathway that involves the Ras proteins and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; EM, electron microscopy. (1Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Broach J.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic Ras proteins are small, GTP-binding proteins that function as molecular switches by oscillating between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form (31Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 32Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 171-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae has two Ras proteins, Ras1p and Ras2p, that directly interact with the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (33Field J. Xu H.P. Michaeli T. Ballester R. Sass P. Wigler M. Colicelli J. Science. 1990; 247: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Suzuki N. Choe H.R. Nishida Y. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Ohnishi S. Tamaoki T. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8711-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This interaction results in higher intracellular levels of cAMP and ultimately in increased PKA activity (35Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 36Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). A role for this pathway in the regulation of stationary phase was suggested by the phenotypes of mutants with altered levels of Ras/PKA activity. For example, mutants with constitutively elevated levels of Ras/PKA activity fail to adopt stationary phase characteristics upon nutrient limitation (36Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutations that inactivate this pathway result in a permanent stationary phase-like arrest (30Broach J.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Iida H. Yahara I. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Matsumoto K. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 146: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, two different signaling pathways involving the Ras and Tor proteins appear to play a significant role in the control of stationary phase biology in S. cerevisiae (2Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). We are interested in characterizing the role of the Ras/PKA signaling pathway in the regulation of autophagy. Although the nature of this regulation has not been examined in detail, a recent study has found that increased levels of Ras/PKA signaling activity result in a decrease in the autophagic activity induced by the drug, rapamycin (39Schmelzle T. Beck T. Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of Tor activity in vivo and is often used to study the consequences of Tor pathway inactivation (40Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 41Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Thus, these data were consistent with the Ras/PKA pathway having some regulatory role in the autophagy process. In this study, we examined this regulation in detail and found that Ras/PKA signaling activity controls a relatively early step in the autophagy pathway. This Ras-sensitive step likely precedes the formation of the autophagosome as these transport intermediates were not formed in cells with elevated levels of Ras/PKA signaling activity. This signaling pathway also inhibited a vacuolar trafficking pathway that is related to autophagy but functions during the log phase of growth. This cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway shares many mechanistic features with autophagy and most of the proteins required for autophagy are also required for Cvt transport (42Khalfan W.A. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 44Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In all, these data indicate that Ras/PKA activity is not regulating the switch between autophagy and the Cvt pathway in vivo and is instead controlling an activity that is required during the early stages of both of these membrane trafficking pathways. Growth Media—Standard Escherichia coli growth conditions and media were used throughout this study (46Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The yeast rich growth medium, YPAD, consists of 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 50 mg/l adenine-HCl, and 2% glucose. The yeast YM minimal growth medium consists of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids, 2% glucose and all of the growth supplements required for cell proliferation (8Chang Y.W. Howard S.C. Budovskaya Y.V. Rine J. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2001; 157: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrogen starvation medium, SD-N, consists of 0.17% yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids and ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose. Growth media reagents were from DIFCO. Plasmid Constructions—The construction of the MET3-RAS2val19 integrating plasmid, pPHY446, was described previously (7Howard S.C. Chang Y.W. Budovskaya Y.V. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integration of this allele was directed to the RAS2 locus by digesting this plasmid with XmnI prior to transformation of yeast cells. For the high copy number TPK1 plasmid, pPHY2056, a 1.7-kb PCR fragment containing the TPK1 gene was cloned into the pRS426 plasmid (47Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). A dominant negative allele of RAS2, known as RAS2ala22, was generated by a site-directed mutagenesis of a RAS2 plasmid, pJW82, that was kindly provided by Dr. Jasper Rine. The pJW82 plasmid has RAS2 placed under the control of the inducible promoter from the GAL1 gene. The site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech) and resulted in the substitution of an alanine residue for the glycine normally found at position 22 of Ras2p. The resulting plasmid was called pPHY2128. The effects of this dominant negative allele have been described previously (49Powers S. O'Neill K. Wigler M. Mol. Cell.

For the Ape1p overexpression experiments, the APE1 coding sequences were placed under the control of the inducible promoter from the yeast CUP1 gene; CUP1 encodes a copper-binding metallothionein (51Thiele D.J.

RAS2val19 expression was induced by transferring these cells to medium that lacks methionine (7Howard S.C. Chang Y.W. Budovskaya Y.V. Herman P.K.

For the experiments with the dominant negative allele, GAL1-RAS2ala22, a wild-type strain, TN125, was transformed with either pPHY2128 or a control vector, pRS416. These strains were grown to mid-log phase in YM-glucose minimal medium and were transferred to YM medium containing 5% galactose and 2% raffinose. Culture samples were collected at the indicated time intervals and alkaline phosphatase assays were performed to assess autophagy activity, as described below. Alkaline Phosphatase-based Autophagy Assays—Autophagy levels were measured with an alkaline phosphatase-based assay that has been described previously (55Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In general, autophagy was induced by transferring cells to a medium that lacks a nitrogen source, SD-N. Alkaline phosphatase levels were typically determined for cells that had been incubated in SD-N medium for 0 and 15 h at 30 °C. The increase in alkaline phosphatase activity that was observed following the period of starvation was a direct measure of the autophagy activity present in those cells. For the assays, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of the assay buffer (250 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, 10 mm MgSO4, 10 μm ZnSO4) and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and 50 μlofthe resulting protein extract was added to a tube containing 500 μl of assay buffer and 50 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of p-nitrophenylphosphate. This reaction mix was incubated for 30 min at 35 °C, and the reaction was then stopped by the addition of 500 μlof2 m glycine-NaOH, pH 11. The absorbance at 405 nm of the resulting solution was then measured. One unit of activity is defined as the release of 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl/min/mg of protein. The protein concentrations in the cell extracts were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). For the rapamycin experiments, autophagy assays were performed on cells that had been treated with 0.2 μg/ml rapamycin for 0, 1, or 3 h at 30 °C. Western Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—For the Western immunoblots, protein extracts were prepared by a glass-beading method described previously (56Klekamp M.S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8432-8441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Budovskaya Y.V. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Herman P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The resulting protein extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The membranes were then probed with either anti-Ape1p (58Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), anti-Pgk1p, or anti-Atg13p antisera, and the immunoreactive proteins were detected with anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) used at a dilution of 1:3000. The Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was subsequently used to illuminate the reactive bands. The carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (57Budovskaya Y.V. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Herman P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 59Herman P.K. Stack J.H. DeModena J.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1991; 64: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—The pep4Δ (TVY1) and vam3ts (TDY2) strains carrying either a control vector or an integrated version of the MET3-RAS2val19 construct, were grown overnight in YM-glucose medium containing 500 μm methionine. The cells were washed twice with water and transferred to a YM-glucose medium lacking methionine for 4 h to induce RAS2val19 expression. The cells were then washed twice with water and transferred to SD-N for 3 h. All incubations for the pep4Δ strains were performed at 30 °C. For the vam3ts strains, the incubations in YM-glucose media were performed at 26 °C, whereas the incubations in the SD-N medium were done at 37 °C to inactivate the temperature-sensitive Vam3p present. Cells were fixed with permanganate, dehydrated with acetone, and embedded with Spurr's resin as described (60Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). 70-nm sections were mounted on nickel grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to be finally imaged with a Philips CM-100 transmission electron microscope. Elevated Levels of Ras/PKA Signaling Activity Inhibited Autophagy—We were interested in examining the role of the Ras/PKA pathway in the regulation of autophagy. For our initial experiments, autophagy activity was measured with an assay that analyzes the vacuolar delivery of a cytoplasmic variant of the Pho8p alkaline phosphatase following a shift to conditions of nitrogen starvation (55Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The wild-type Pho8p is synthesized as an inactive zymogen that is delivered to the vacuolar compartment via the traditional secretory pathway (61Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 62Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5349-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the vacuole lumen, this zymogen is activated by a proteolytic cleavage that removes a C-terminal propeptide (61Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The cells used for the autophagy assay express a Pho8p variant, Pho8pΔ60, that lacks a transmembrane domain that functions as an internal signal sequence and normally directs this protein into the secretory pathway (55Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 61Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As a result, Pho8pΔ60 is found in the cytosol in its inactive, precursor form. Following the induction of autophagy, this protein is packaged into autophagosomes and delivered to the vacuole where it can be activated (12Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 55Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that the levels of alkaline phosphatase activity present are proportional to the amount of autophagy occurring in these cells (12Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 55Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Pho8pΔ60 assay was used to examine the effect that elevated levels of Ras/PKA signaling activity would have on the autophagy process. To increase Ras/PKA activity, a dominant hyperactive allele of RAS2, known as RAS2val19, was introduced into the assay strain. The presence of this allele results in constitutively elevated levels of Ras/PKA signaling activity (30Broach J.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,"

It was first identified by screening an EST data base and subsequently expressed as a recombinant protein and characterized as an authentic tissue component. The COL22A1 gene on human chromosome 8q24.2 encodes a collagen that structurally belongs to the FACIT protein family (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices). Collagen XXII exhibits a striking restricted localization at tissue junctions such as the myotendinous junction in skeletal and heart muscle, the articular cartilage-synovial fluid junction, or the border between the anagen hair follicle and the dermis in the skin. It is deposited in the basement membrane zone of the myotendinous junction and the hair follicle and associated with the extrafibrillar matrix in cartilage. In situ hybridization of myotendinous junctions revealed that muscle cells produce collagen XXII, and functional tests demonstrated that collagen XXII acts as a cell adhesion ligand for skin epithelial cells and fibroblasts.

Tissue integrity of all organs is critically dependent on suprastructural aggregates containing collagens. The family of collagens is specified in man by 42 genes encoding polypeptides assembled into at least 28 distinct, trimeric collagens. Their functions are indirectly illustrated by a multitude of human diseases resulting from mutations in collagen genes. To date more than 1000 different mutations are known to cause “collagen diseases” in a wide spectrum of organ systems, including the skeletal system, ligaments and other soft connective tissues, the kidney, bone marrow, skin, eye, and as shown recently, the brain (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Sertie A.L. Sossi V. Camargo A.A. Zatz M. Brahe C. Passos-Bueno M.R. Hum. Mol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Depending on their occurrence in supramolecular assemblies and other structural features, collagens are subdivided into different classes, such as fibrillar, network-forming, beaded filament-forming, fibril-associated, or transmembrane collagens. The major fibrillar collagens often have a wide tissue distribution in mesenchymal connective tissues, such as bone, cartilage, tendons, or dermal connective tissue (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, other collagens, e.g. the network-forming basement membrane collagens, can exhibit a very limited tissue localization lining epithelia, endothelia, or muscle cells and separating them from the surrounding extracellular matrix. Such a restricted expression pattern is believed to indicate both a highly specialized mechanical role in maintaining integrity of a tissue compartment and a role in regulation of cellular functions (4Dogic D. Eckes B. Aumailley M. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1999; 93: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The FACITs, 1The abbreviations used are: FACIT, fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices; VWA, von Willebrand factor A-like; TSPN, N-terminal thrombospondin-like domain; Col XXII, collagen XXII; NC1 domain, corresponds to the N-terminal non collagenous region of Col XXII; MTJ, myotendinous junction; kb, kilobase(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; pAb, polyclonal antibody. fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices, are quantitatively minor collagens that often copolymerize into suprastructures with the major collagens and mediate ligand interactions between the fibrils and their environment (5Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Typically, these collagens contain triple helical as well as other functional protein modules, including VWA domains and fibronectin type III-like domains. VWA domains are found in a variety of proteins, e.g. the prototype von Willebrand factor, collagens, matrilins, and integrins (for review, see Ref. 6Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The general notion about the function of VWA domains is mediation of protein-protein interactions. For example, the classical collagen binding receptors, integrin α1β1 and α2β1, bind to their target via VWA domains (7Nolte M. Pepinsky R.B. Venyaminov S. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P.J. Karpusas M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although not yet proven, it is likely the VWA domains of FACIT collagens also bind to other proteins. Two new VWA-containing proteins, collagens XX and XXI, were recently identified by screening databases (8Koch M. Foley J.E. Hahn R. Zhou P. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Fitzgerald J. Bateman J.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, except for the gene structure and the predicted molecular domain structure, very little is known about these molecules, their distribution, or their functions in tissues. Tissue junctions have critical functions in joining tissue compartments and in transmitting forces. However, because of a lack of specific markers for such junctions, their molecular and cellular composition and morphogenesis have remained elusive. The only exception may be the myotendinous junction (MTJ), which represents the link between muscles and tendons, the biology and pathology of which has been studied in more detail. To overcome the drastic forces at MTJs, the muscle increases the contact area by forming finger-like interdigitations of the basement membrane zone at the junction. Some molecules are enriched but not exclusively present at the MTJ, e.g. integrin α7β1, or tenascin (10Bao Z.Z. Lakonishok M. Kaufman S. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 579-589PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Nawrotzki R. Willem M. Miosge N. Brinkmeier H. Mayer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consequently, mutations in integrin α7β1 cause muscular dystrophy (13Mayer U. Saher G. Fassler R.

Genet. 1998; 19: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recent developmental studies have provided evidence for the requirement of communication between muscle and tendon for morphogenesis. The morphogenetic origin of the muscle and tendon cells was shown to be the somites (12Nawrotzki R. Willem M. Miosge N. Brinkmeier H. Mayer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Brent A.E. Schweitzer R. Tabin C.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 235-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar); in muscle cell ablation experiments tendons were not formed in a muscle-less wing (16Kardon G. Development. 1998; 125: 4019-4032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, except for the initial generation of the precursors, practically nothing is known about the signaling between the tissue compartments, which will lead to formation of the MTJ. In this study we identified and characterized a novel marker, collagen XXII (Col XXII), which exhibits a unique localization at tissue junctions in the muscle, tendons, heart, articular cartilage, and skin. cDNA Isolation—A BLAST search (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar) of the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST, Ref. 18Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) for homology with the C-terminal amino acid sequence of human collagen XII (accession number, NM_004370) yielded one clone (GenBank™ accession number AA296964) as a possible candidate for a novel collagen cDNA. The EST clone, which was about 1520 bp in length, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and sequenced in its entirety. The sequence revealed codons for 167 amino acid residues, and the 3′-untranslated region was 1.0 kb in length. From the sequence of the EST clone, nested primers were designed for 5′ RACE using a human placental cDNA Marathon library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as template, as previously described (19Koch M. Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. Olson P.F. Jin W. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For 5′ RACE, the Long Expand PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) was used for the PCR reaction. By performing in total three RACEs with primer sequences derived from each previous RACE, overlapping segments representing the full-length 6.4-kb mRNA were obtained. To confirm the nucleotide sequence and as a control for PCR-induced nucleotide substitutions, gene-specific primers were used to reamplify the entire cDNA on human cartilage/bone cDNA. A first strand cDNA synthesis kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used to synthesize cDNA from total RNA using random primers following the manufacturer's protocol; PCR was used to generate overlapping clones complementary to the entire human a1 (XXII) collagen mRNA. Sequencing of all the PCR products obtained from the cDNA confirmed the nucleotide sequence of the human collagen XXII. The full-length cDNA of Col XXII is deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AF406780. To generate a genetic relationship map of the VWA domain-containing proteins, the VWA of protein sequences were analyzed with the GrowTree program (GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, Genetics Computer Group Inc.). The following sequences were used: matrilin1 (NP_002370, 35-221); matrilin2 (NP_085072, 51-237); matrilin3 (NP_002372, 77-263); matrilin4 (NP_003824, 28-224); collagen XII 1 (NP_004361, 1192-1376), collagen XII 2 (NP_004361, 2317-2501); collagen XIV 1 (CAA72402, 1-185), collagen XIV 2 (XX, 151-335); collagen XXI (NP_110447, 31-212); collagen XXII (AAN03620, 32-218). The WVA were analyzed, and the Jukes-Cantor method was chosen to correct the distances for multiple substitutions at a single site; the tree was created with the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) algorithm. Northern Blot Analysis—A 1368-bp PCR product (AF406780, nucleotides 529-1896) was labeled with [33P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the rediprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The Northern blot (Clontech) was prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 2 h. Without further purification the probe was denatured in the same buffer plus 1:10 (v/v) human Cot-1 DNA (Roche Applied Science) and 1:10 (v/v) sheared salmon testis DNA (Invitrogen) at 94 °C for 5 min, placed on ice, added to the blots, and hybridized for 20 h. Blots were washed 3 times in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 1% SDS at 42 °C, and 2 times in 0.1× SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C. Blots were placed on BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with a BioMax TranScreen-LE intensifying screen (Kodak) for 20 h at -70 °C. Recombinant Expression of Secreted Collagen XXII and Its Fragments—The following fragments were amplified by PCR and subcloned into an episomal expression vector: NC1 domain (nucleotides 529-1896) and full-length cDNA (nucleotides 529-5328). One μg of total RNA from human cartilage/bone was reverse-transcribed, and PCR was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Herculase DNA polymerase; Stratagene). The PCR product was purified on an agarose gel (Qiagen) and subcloned (rapid DNA ligation kit; Roche Diagnostics) into a modified PCEP-4 (gift from Ernst Poeschl) expression vector. For convenience, an His8 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site was included adjacent to the NheI site in the vector. The ligated DNA was transformed into TOP 10 cells (Invitrogen). Plasmids were isolated from the bacteria (Qiagen) and sequenced with gene-specific primers (Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit; Amersham Biosciences). 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were transformed (FuGENE; Roche Diagnostics) with the expression vector and selected after 2 days with puromycin (Sigma). Stably transfected 293-EBNA cells were pseudo-subcloned, and the highest protein-producing clones were expanded for large scale production. Two liters of supernatant from these cells were collected and supplemented with 1 mm Pefablock (Merck). After ammonium sulfate precipitation (45% saturation), the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dialyzed against the binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and applied onto a nickel-chelated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The elution was done by applying binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (10-150 mm) to the column. In some cases, the His tag was digested with thrombin (isolated from bovine plasma; Sigma) according to the protocol from EMD Biosciences. The digested protein was again applied to a nickel-chelated Sepharose column to remove the His tag, and since the protein still weakly binds to the matrix, the fragment was again eluted with increasing imidazole concentration. Antibody Production—The human Col XXII NC1 protein was injected intradermally into a rabbit (R34) for antibody production following standard procedures (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-119Google Scholar). The R34 antiserum was passed over a protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with triethylamine (Sigma). The neutralized eluate was affinity-purified by applying it to a human Col XXII NC1 protein column that was prepared by coupling the protein without His tag to activated CNBr-Sepharose. Bound antibodies were eluted with triethylamine and immediately neutralized (19Koch M. Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. Olson P.F. Jin W. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of Collagen XXII—The above polyclonal antibody pAb R34 was used for immunofluorescence staining of cryosections of 1-day-old mice and adult mouse tissues. The incubation with the first antibody (1:2000) was done overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-coupled secondary antibody at room temperature. The staining was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. For immunoblotting the proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE with 4.5, 5.0, or 7.5% polyacrylamide under non-reduced or reduced conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The affinity-purified antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 and incubated overnight followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The signals were visualized with chemiluminescence substrate Renaissance™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunoelectron microscopy with pAb R34, recombinant Col XXII was subjected to rotary shadowing using previously published methods (21Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Native fibrils were isolated form bovine cartilage, placed on grids, immunostained with pAb R34 and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibodies, and analyzed with transmission electron microscopy as described (22Kassner A. Hansen U. Miosge N. Reinhardt D.P. Aigner T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Grassel S. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy with immunogold labeling on ultra-thin sections of skin, muscle, and articular surface was carried out as described previously (23Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tissue Extractions—For analysis of Col XXII tissue form, adult mouse tissues were dissected, homogenized in Tris-buffered saline (1 g of tissue/ml), and extracted sequentially at 4 °C with the following buffers; TBS for 30 min; 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, overnight; 2 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, overnight. All buffers contained 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm Pefabloc (Merck) as proteinase inhibitors. Between the extractions the tissue was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and 50-100 μl of the supernatants were used for the enzyme digestions and 10-50 μl for immunoblotting. Collagenase Digestion—For assessment of the domain structure of Col XXII, the recombinant collagen and tissue extracts were subjected to collagenase digestion. The incubation with 40 units/ml highly purified bacterial collagenase (Advanced Biofacturers Inc., Lynbrook, NY) was carried out in 50 μl of extraction buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1mm Pefablock at 37 °C for 4 h (34Chiquet M. Renedo A.S. Huber F. Fluck M. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Cell Adhesion Assays—Skin epithelial cells (HaCaT) and fibroblasts (WI-26) were cultivated under standard conditions. Multiwell tissue culture plates (96 wells, Costar Corp., Faust, Germany) were coated with serial dilutions of Col XXII (0-165 nm) overnight at 4 °C. After saturation with 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma), the plates were immediately used for short term cell adhesion assays. After 30 min the floating cells were washed away, and the number of adherent cells were counted (24Aumailley M. Mann K. von der Mark H. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All assays were done in triplicate. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (25Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Morgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using cRNA probes generated from PCR products. The T7 polymerase recognition site was added to the reverse primers. For mouse collagen COL1A1 the region between nucleotides 3653 and 4242 (BC050014) was chosen as a probe. The mouse cDNA was obtained by comparison of the human Col XXII cDNA to the mouse genome. The following primers localized within the VWA and thrombospondin N-terminal-like domain (TSPN) domain region was used to amplify the probe from embryonic mouse cDNA (forward, 5′-GCCACTTCAACTCTCGCGAGGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CACAAAGCCGACGCCTCAGCTTGC-3′). Images shown here were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Releases 7.0); no enhancements other than contrast and brightness have been made to these images. Identification and Cloning of Collagen XXII—Several novel partial cDNA sequences were identified in a human dbEST sequence data base search for clones containing Gly-X-Y triplets. One of these sequences was extended using rapid PCR amplification of cDNA ends. After three rounds of amplification, the full-length cDNA for Col XXII was obtained. It contains a predicted open reading frame of 1626 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide (27 amino acids) (Fig. 1; Ref. 26Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). The predicted protein is a secreted molecule with an N-terminal domain similar to a VWA-like domain followed by a TSPN and a long collagenous domain with several interruptions of the Gly-X-Y repeats. The TSPN sequence contains two consensus N-glycosylation sites, and a short linker sequence containing a polyproline stretch joins the globular and the collagenous region. The collagenous domain contains six small imperfections in which the third amino acid of Gly-X-Y triplet is missing and larger interruptions of 4-38 amino acids throughout the collagenous sequence. The last 105-amino acid collagenous stretch at the C-terminal end contains the imperfections and amino acid organization common to FACIT proteins, i.e. two interruptions of the Gly-X-Y triplets followed by two Cys residues (Fig. 1). Thus, the overall structure of Col XXII is similar to the FACIT or FACIT-related proteins. As judged by their domain organizations, the closest relative of Col XXII is human collagen XXI; it contains the same non-collagenous domain structure (9Fitzgerald J. Bateman J.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The collagenous domain, however, is shorter in collagen XXI, in which the first collagenous stretch is missing (Fig. 2). Both molecules contain two cysteines on either side of the collagenous domain. The Col XXII VWA domain is 43% identical to the VWA domains of human collagen XXI, 37% in collagen XII and 36% in Matrilin-1 (Fig. 3). The TSPN domain, typically located between the non-collagenous domain and the collagenous domain, is a common feature of proteins of the FACIT subfamily. Comparing the TSPN domain of Col XXII to those in other collagens indicated a close relation to collagen XII and XXI. However, the overall homologies between the different TSPN domains were too low for the construction of a statistically relevant phylogenetic tree.Fig. 3Genetic relationship of the VWA domains of matrilins and collagens. The VWA domains of matrilins form one subgroup and can be further separated into two branches. FACIT collagens constitute the second group. Collagens XII and XIV are closely related and form one subgroup. Similarly, collagens XXI and XXII are closely related and form another subgroup. This tree was calculated with two different methods; both calculations yielded the same prediction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Collagen XXII Gene COL22A1—Comparison of the COL22A1 gene encoding collagen XXII with sequences in the genome databases revealed an orthologue for collagen XXII in mouse, zebra fish, and puffer fish. COL22A1 is present on human chromosome 8q24.2 and spans 326 kb (NT_028251). The mouse col22a1 gene is localized on chromosome 15 D2 to D3. According to the NCBI evidence viewer, the coding region of COL22A1 contains 66 exons, separated by 65 introns, and the largest introns, intron 1 and 3, are more than 30 kb in size. The exon-intron boundaries follow the classical splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences (not shown). The signal peptide coding sequence is localized in the second exon. The VWA domain is encoded by exon 3, whereas the TSPN sequence is distributed over exons 4-9. Most exons encoding the collagenous sequences are rather small, and the majority of them encode for only 5-6 Gly-X-Y repeats. Production and Characterization of an Antibody to Collagen XXII—The N-terminal globular region of Col XXII (NC1 domain), including a His tag and a thrombin cleavage site, was produced in 293-EBNA cells using an episomal expression vector. After purification with a nickel-containing column and removal of the His tag by cleavage with thrombin, the protein was used for immunization. The affinity-purified rabbit antibody pAb R34 efficiently recognized the NC1 domain of Col XXII in immunoblots. The calculated molecular mass of this domain is 53 kDa; however, the recombinant protein migrates with an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to an apparent mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Removal of the His tag had no effect on the ability of the antibodies to recognize Col XXII (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Importantly, despite structural similarities between this domain in collagens XXI and XXII, no cross-reactivity with collagen XXI was seen (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Recombinant Full-length Col XXII—Recombinant human Col XXII was expressed in 293-EBNA cells and affinity-purified using the His tag (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3). Under non-reducing conditions, monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric molecules were detected, indicating partial inter-chain disulfide bonding (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The monomeric polypeptide chains of full-length Col XXII had an electrophoretic mobility consistent with a mass of about 200 kDa (Fig. 4B); in some cases a smaller product of about 70 kDa, corresponding to the NC1 domain, was observed. The full-length molecule was collagenase-sensitive, and digestion yielded the collagenase-resistant NC1 domain (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Visualization of recombinant Col XXII by transmission electron microscopy after rotary shadowing indicated that the recombinant molecule formed structures resembling other FACIT collagens (Fig. 5, A-C). Full-length Col XXII has a thin rod-like structure that corresponds to the collagenous domain, with a contour length of about 301 ± 15 nm. The rod contains several kinks representing the interruptions of the collagenous domain. At the N-terminal region the globules correspond to the VWA and TSPN domains (Fig. 5, A and D). From these images the flexible structure of Col XXII becomes evident. Col XXII in Tissue Extracts—Col XXII was easily extracted with a high salt buffer from muscle and, less efficiently, from skin (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). Very little additional protein was released by subsequent urea extraction of either tissue (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 5). In addition to the 200-kDa Col XXII band, smaller bands of 110-120 and 70 kDa were visible in an immunoblot. Indeed, Col XXII proved to be very sensitive to proteolysis. Despite rapid protein isolation methods and use of potent proteinase inhibitor cocktails during extraction, a single band was not seen in tissue extracts. Similarly, if the recombinant full-length protein was stored for some time at 4 °C, a comparable fragmentation pattern was obtained (not shown). Collagenase digestion of tissue extracts abolished the 200-kDa and the 160-kDa bands, and immunoblotting with pAb34 demonstrated that the 70-kDa band corresponded to the NC1 domain (Fig. 6A, lane 3). These observations confirmed that in tissue extracts, partial proteolytic degradation of the collagenous stretch of the molecule had taken place. Tissue Distribution of Col XXII mRNA—Northern blot analysis of human tissues showed Col XXII mRNA to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 6B). A single band of about 6.4 kb was detected, indicating no alternative splice variants. The size of the COL22A1 mRNA corresponds well to the length of the cloned cDNA. Semiquantitative RT-PCR on mouse tissues revealed additional signals in cartilage, skin, and keratinocytes and in the eye (not shown). In contrast, almost no signal was obtained from neuronal tissues or other organs such as bone, liver, kidney, or lung. Col XXII mRNA Is Expressed in Muscle Cells, Not in Fibroblasts—By in situ hybridization, COL22A1 mRNA was detected exclusively in muscle cells at the muscle attachment sites to tendon elements and ribs (Fig. 7, A and B). Dense alkaline phosphatase reaction products were observed only in the muscle cells closest to the rib or aponeurosis. No signal was detected in muscle fibers at any other location in the muscle. For comparison, a collagen I probe was used to identify fibroblasts at the tendinous sheet zone. As shown in Fig. 7, C and D, Col XXII mRNA is absent from the region positive for collagen I message. Controls with antisense probes remained negative (data not shown). Tissue Distribution of Col XXII Protein—Tissue distribution of Col XXII was determined by indirect immunofluorescence in postnatal mouse tissues. A striking observation was that Col XXII is expressed only at sites of tissue junctions in muscle, cartilage, heart, and skin (Fig. 8). In skeletal muscle Col XXII was found juxtaposed to tendon insertion sites, i.e. in tendinous sheets, so called aponeurosis, which separate muscles (Fig. 8A), the myotendinous junction (Fig. 8B), and the muscle attachment site to the rib (Fig. 8C). In the heart Col XXII was present at the insertion points of the chordae t"

Identity of the PINO1 gene was confirmed by functional complementation in a yeast inositol auxotrophic strain. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of PINO1 with that of the homologous gene from Oryza sativa L.

Purified bacterially expressed PINO1 protein demonstrated a salt-tolerant character in vitro compared with the salt-sensitive RINO1 protein as with those purified from the native source or an expressed salt-sensitive mutant PINO1 protein wherein amino acids 174–210 have been deleted. Analysis of the salt effect on oligomerization and tryptophan fluorescence of the RINO1 and PINO1 proteins revealed that the structure of PINO1 protein is stable toward salt environment. Furthermore, introgression of PINO1 rendered transgenic tobacco plants capable of growth in 200–300 mm NaCl with retention of ∼40–80% of the photosynthetic competence with concomitant increased inositol production compared with unstressed control.

Inositols are six-carbon cyclohexane hexitols found ubiquitously in the biological kingdom, and its metabolism plays a vital role in growth regulation, membrane biogenesis, osmotolerance, and in many other processes. As phosphorylated derivatives, its role as a phosphorus store and as a “second messenger” in signal transduction pathways has long been recognized. myo-Inositol, physiologically the most favored stereoisomer among the eight possible geometric isomers of inositol, also enters into an array of biochemical reactions having diverse functions in cellular metabolism both as free and conjugated and phosphorylated or methylated forms (1Biswas B.B.

The primary enzyme for the synthesis of l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate from glucose 6-phosphate is l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4; referred to as MIPS), 1The abbreviations used are: MIPS, l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase; aa, amino acids; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; X-gal, 5-bromo-4 chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; X-glu, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide; Bis-ANS, bis-5,5′-8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. which synthesizes l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate through an internal oxidoreduction reaction involving NAD+. Free inositol is generated by dephosphorylation of the MIPS product by a specific Mg2+-dependent inositol-1-phosphate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.25). This mechanism is followed by all myo-inositol-producing organisms throughout the phylogenetic lines, and MIPS has been identified as an evolutionarily conserved protein (4Majumder A.L.

Although the chloroplastic MIPS has been characterized at the enzyme protein level, identification of its structural gene is still to come. In this communication, we report the cloning and bacterial expression of the INO1 gene from Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka (PINO1), a halophytic wild rice, biochemical and biophysical characterization of the gene product with special reference to its salt tolerance property, and comparison with the O. sativa INO1 gene (RINO1) product. Further experiments report functional expression of the RINO1 and PINO1 genes as salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant MIPS proteins, respectively, upon introgression into tobacco. Introgression and expression of PINO1 allows growth of the transgenic plants in salt environment with concomitant increased inositol production and maintenance of photosynthetic potential.

The halophytic wild rice plants, P. coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka, were collected from the saline river banks of the Sunderbans in the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal and were maintained in the Institute greenhouse. Seeds of rice varieties were grown in 12-h alternating light and dark conditions for the desired periods after an initial 3-day growth in the dark. pGEMT Easy was from Promega, and pET-20b(+) was from Novagen. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE-3) and DH-5α strains were cultured on LB medium at 37 °C, and cultures were maintained on LB agar plates and stored as glycerol (16%) stock at -80 °C. Cells containing recombinant plasmids, pGEMT-Easy and pET-20b(+), were supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Yeast strains were routinely grown at 30 °C in YEPD and complete synthetic media as required (5Majumder A.L. Dattagupta S. Goldwasser P. Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. Mol. Gen.

Purification of Cytosolic MIPS from Oryza and Porteresia Leaves—Cytosolic MIPS from leaves of O. sativa and P. coarctata were isolated following the procedure developed in this laboratory (20RayChaudhuri A. Hait N.C. DasGupta S. Bhaduri T.J. Deb R. Majumder A.L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Low speed supernatant from the leaf homogenate was subjected to 40–70% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Dissolved precipitate was run through a column of Superose 12. Enzymatically active fractions were loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column and eluted with a linear 0–0.25 m NH4Cl gradient. Enzymatically active fractions were further purified by filtration through a Bio-Gel A0.5 column.

Poly(A) RNA was isolated from the total RNA by the poly(A) tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. 20–30 ng of poly(A) RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA thus synthesized was used as the template for PCR amplification of the INO1 gene. For cloning of the full-length cDNA of INO1 for Oryza (RINO1) and Porteresia (PINO1), sense (5′–3′) and antisense (3′–5′) oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the published RINO1 sequences (GenBank™ accession number AB 012107) with additional sites for NdeI and XhoI at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. PCR amplification was done as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 1.5 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 32 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified product (∼1.5 kb) was eluted and purified from the gel and ligated overnight at 4 °C to the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). The ligation mixture was used for transformation of high efficiency JM109 competent cells (Promega), and transformants were selected on ampicillin/IPTG/X-gal plates. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformants in large quantities, purified, and completely sequenced by contracting to the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Arizona, Tucson. The sequence data obtained for RINO1 were checked with the published sequences showing complete identity and that for PINO1 was compared through standard bioinformatic tools. The sequences of the PINO1 gene have been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AF412340. 2Patent application for the PINO1 gene has been submitted under reference IN (1250/D/2002) dated December 12, 2002 and PCT (INO3/00065) dated March 21, 2003. Complementation of RINO1 and PINO1 in Yeast Inositol Auxotrophic Strain FY250 —The procedure followed was that of Bacchawat and Mande (9Bachhawat N. Mande S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified RINO1 and PINO1 genes were cloned into pGEMT-T easy vector and were subsequently cloned downstream of a strong constitutively expressed yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter of a yeast multicopy expression vector p426 GAPDH within EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites. The yeast strain FY250 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2 Ino1::HIS3, a gift from Dr. A. Bacchawat, IMTECH, Chandigarh, India) was transformed (28Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the p426 GAPDH containing RINO1 and PINO1 and with a p426 GAPDH without any insert as control. Transformed cells having the plasmid constructs were allowed to grow in the presence of 10 μm inositol but lacking uracil and then gradually transferred to a medium lacking both inositol and uracil. Generation of Deletion Mutants of PINO1 (ΔPINO1-1 and ΔPINO1-2) —Two types of deletion mutants of PINO1 were generated. The first one, designated ΔPINO1-1, was a catalytically inactive PINO1 in which a portion of the PINO1 gene between Asn-342 and Lys-361, a part of the stretch identified as the “core catalytic domain” of the MIPS enzyme protein (12Majumder A.L. Chatterjee A. Ghosh Dastider K.R. Majee M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 3-10Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was deleted by in vitro mutagenesis using the Stratagene Quick-change mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The following primers were used for this purpose: 5′-TACAACCACTTGGGAGCAGCGTGGTCGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCGACCACGCTGCTCCCCAAGTGGTTGTA-3′. The second mutant of PINO1, designated ΔPINO1-2, was generated by an internal deletion of the amino acids Trp-174 to Ser-210 of PINO1, a portion identified as non-identical with RINO1. To generate this mutant, two separate fragments, one 519 bp (upstream of the deleted region) and the other 906 bp (downstream of the deleted region) were separately PCR-amplified from a full-length PINO1 gene cloned into pGEMT-Easy using the following two pair of primers: 5′-ACATATGTTCATCGAGAGCTTCCGCGT-3′ and 5′-TCTGTCGACGGACTCCATGTAAGGCCTAAGCT-3′ for the upstream fragment, and 5′-TCTGTCGACAAGGACATCAAGGAGTTCAAGG-3′ and 5′-CTCAAGCTTCTTGTACTCCAGGATCATGTTGTTCTCAGGG-3′ for the downstream fragment. The forward and reverse primers for the upstream- and downstream-amplified fragments contain NdeI and HindIII as the mutated gene terminal restriction sites, whereas the reverse and forward primers for the upstream- and downstream-amplified fragments contain the SalI site. After the PCR amplification of these fragments separately, they were ligated in-frame in a tripartite ligation reaction using the SalI sites introduced in the primers to generate the full-length internally deleted mutant PINO1 gene termed ΔPINO1-2. Bacterial Overexpression of the cloned RINO1, PINO1, and ΔPINO1 Genes—The cDNA for RINO1, PINO1, and the mutant genes ΔPINO1-1 and ΔPINO1-2 were subcloned into the NdeI/XhoI or HindIII sites of the expression vector pET-20b(+). The resulting plasmids were introduced into the host strain E. coli BL-21 (DE3) by transformation (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). The bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °Cupto A600 of 0.5 absorbance units and induced by 0.5 mm IPTG for 6 h. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-ME, 2 mm PMSF. The extracts were centrifuged, and both the pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Solubilization and Purification of Expressed RINO1, PINO1, and ΔPINO1 Gene Products—The pellet fractions containing the expressed proteins were solubilized in a buffer containing urea (8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-ME, 2 mm PMSF) and kept for 30 min at room temperature. Solubilized samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was dialyzed serially (step dialysis with 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 m urea and finally with urea-free buffer) to remove urea. Dialyzed expressed protein sample was purified by DEAE-Sephacel and Bio-Gel A0.5 as for the native enzyme described earlier (20RayChaudhuri A. Hait N.C. DasGupta S. Bhaduri T.J. Deb R. Majumder A.L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the blot was probed with rabbit anti-MIPS antibody (1:1000) raised against purified recombinant MIPS of Entamoeba (31Lohia A. Hait N.C. Majumder A.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter. Protein solution (0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was taken in a quartz cuvette (4 × 4 mm). Excitation wavelength was selected at 295 nm, and the emission was scanned at a speed of 240 nm/min from 310 to 400 nm by using excitation and emission slits at 5 nm each. Each spectrum was an average of three scans. Appropriate control buffer spectra were subtracted from sample spectra to generate the fluorescence spectra of the proteins. Wavelength of maximum emission for each spectrum was determined by derivative analysis using the instrument software. Fluorescence Quenching Experiments—Tryptophan fluorescence was quenched by titrating the protein solution with 5 m acrylamide or potassium iodide. 2.0 ml of 0.1 mg/ml protein solution was taken in a 3-ml quartz cuvette containing a magnetic stir bar. Excitation and emission wavelength were set at 295 and 340 nm, respectively. Freshly prepared quencher (acrylamide or potassium iodide) was added in small aliquots in the cuvette, and after each addition the solution was stirred magnetically for 1 min, and thereafter the emission reading was taken. The fluorescence readings for all concentrations of the titrant were corrected for the “dilution effect” due to addition of the titrant. The readings were also corrected for the “inner filter effect” according to Equation 1, [ Fcorr=F·antilog(Aex+Aem)/2 (Eq. 1) where F and Fcorr indicate the uncorrected and corrected fluorescence, and Aex and Aem indicate the absorbance of the solution at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The quenching data were analyzed according to modified Stern-Volmer Equation 2 (32Leherer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), Fo/ΔF=1/fa+1/faKSV[Q] (Eq. 2) where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in absence and presence of the quencher; [Q] indicates the molar concentration of the quencher, and fa indicates the fraction of tryptophans accessible to the quencher. The accessible fraction fa and the effective Stern-Volmer quenching constants (KSV)eff are equal to fa. KSV values were obtained from the ordinate intercept and slope, respectively, of the linear portion of the Fo/ΔF versus 1/[Q] plot. Bis-ANS Fluorescence Assay—Purified recombinant RINO1 and PINO1 proteins were dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl with 10 mm β-ME. 2 ml of dialyzed protein (0.1 mg/ml) in each was taken into a 3-ml quartz cuvette containing a magnetic stirrer. Excitation and emission wavelength were set at 370 and 490 nm, respectively. Freshly prepared Bis-ANS solution (372 μm stock solution) was added in small aliquots to the cuvette, and after each addition the solution was stirred magnetically for 1 min. Assay for Aggregation of RINO1 and PINO1 Proteins in Vitro under NaCl Environment—Purified bacterially expressed RINO1 and PINO1 proteins (0.875 μm) were assayed for static light scattering in the absence and presence of different NaCl concentrations at 37 °C in a Shimadzu-160A spectrophotometer. Optical density of the samples at 360 nm were measured over a period of 170 min at regular intervals where increased OD was indicative of aggregation of the protein samples (33Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). Construction of Plant Expression Vectors and Tobacco Transformation—Full-length clones of RINO1, PINO1, ΔPINO1-1, and ΔPINO1-2, as obtained, were subcloned at the XbaI/KpnI site of the plant expression vector pCAMBIA1301 (a gift from Prof. Akhilesh Tyagi, University of Delhi, South Campus) under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and nopaline synthase (Nos) terminator. The vector contains the hpt gene for hygromycin resistance and gus as the reporter gene. The resultant constructs SMSA9, SMSA10, 3KSMA1, and 3KSMA2 contain RINO1, PINO1, ΔPINO1-1, and ΔPINO1-2 genes respectively. All the constructs and the control plasmid pCAMBIA1301 without any insert were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA 4404 by the freeze-thaw method (34Nishiguchi R. Takanami M. Oka A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 1-8Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tobacco leaf discs were infected with A. tumefaciens containing SMSA9, SMSA10, 3KSMA1, 3KSMA2, and the control plasmid pCAMBIA1301 without any insert. After 3 days of co-cultivation the leaf discs were transferred to the regeneration medium supplemented with cefotaxim (250 mg/liter) and hygromycin (15 mg/liter). Cultures were maintained at 26 °C and under continuous illumination provided by white fluorescent tubes. Shoot bud differentiation started after 14–16 days of culture in the regeneration medium, which elongated into shoots within 30–35 days. Shoots regenerated in the selection medium were transferred to hormone-free MS medium containing hygromycin (30 mg/liter) and cefotaxim (250 mg/liter) and allowed to develop roots in this medium. Ten putative transformed plants for each construct were screened for stable integration of gus, RINO1, PINO1, ΔPINO1-1, and ΔPINO1-2 genes. For histochemical gus assay, leaf segments and roots taken from the putative transformants (T0) were incubated in a buffer containing 100 mm phosphate, 10 mm disodium EDTA, 0.5 mm ferro- and ferricyanide, and 0.1% X-glu dissolved in dimethylformamide at 37 °C for 10–12 h (35Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8307) Google Scholar). For analysis of introgression of RINO1, PINO1, ΔPINO1-1, and ΔPINO1-2 genes by PCR, genomic DNA was isolated (36Procunier J.D. Jie X. Kasha K.J. Barley Genet. News Lett. 1991; 20: 74-75Google Scholar) from young leaves of both the transformed and untransformed T0 plants, and PCR amplification of RINO1 and PINO1 genes was done following the conditions mentioned earlier. The transgenic T0 plants were allowed to flower and set seeds by preventing cross-pollination. Seeds were collected from transformed plants and germinated on medium containing hygromycin (20 mg/liter). Seedlings (T1) resistant to hygromycin were maintained to full growth at 25 ± 2 °C and a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle in the culture room. Plants were analyzed for their photosynthetic efficiency by the Photosynthetic Efficiency Analyzer (Handy-PEA, Hansatech, UK). Photosynthetic performance of individual plants was calculated following the method of Strasser et al. (37Strasser R.J. Srivastava A. Govindjee Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 32-34Crossref Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). The analysis was done with the kind cooperation from Dr. A. K. Mishra, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, India. Estimation of Inositol Content of Transgenic Plants—For isolation and estimation of inositol content of the transgenic plants, the method of Bieleski and Redgwell (38Bieleski R.L. Redgwell R.J. Aust. J. Plant. Physiol. 1977; 4: 1-10Google Scholar) was followed. Leaf tissue (∼500 mg) was homogenized with a mixture of methanol/chloroform/water/trichloroacetic acid (12:5:2:1) for isolation of total water-soluble sugars and polyols. Chloroform and water (1:1) was added to the homogenized sample for phase separation. The aqueous phase containing the bulk of the water soluble plant metabolites including inositol was lyophilized to complete dryness. For gas chromatography analysis, the lyophilized samples were transferred quantitatively to glass reaction vials in pyridine and evaporated under high vacuum. All the samples were kept in a vacuum dessicator for 24 h over P2O5 for complete removal of water. Samples were tetramethylsilane-derivatized (39Low N.H. J. AOAC. Int. 1996; 79: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with Tri-Sil-Z (Pierce) and were run through gas-liquid chromatography in a Chemito 1000 gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector. Gas chromatography conditions are as follows: 3% SP-2100 stationary phase (Supelco) supported on chromosorb-W (Sigma) packed in a 1.8-m (length) × 2-mm (inner diameter) glass column with N2 (flow rate 31 ml/min) as ca"

Thus, we addressed the role of PKCα in signaling TRPC1 activation and thereby triggering Ca2+ entry and endothelial barrier dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of TRPC1 is an important signal contributing to SOC activation and triggering Ca2+ entry. We also show that PKCα-activated Ca2+ entry is critical in mediating the thrombin-induced increase in transendothelial permeability.

Adenoviral Infection—The adenoviral construct containing a kinase-defective mutant of PKCα (referred to herein as Ad-dnPKCα) was a generous gift from Dr. Viswanathan Natarajan (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes (for determination of phosphorylation) or on 25-mm coverslips (for [Ca2+]i measurements) were infected with 1 × 107 plaque-forming units of the PKCα construct for 5 h in serum-containing medium, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In parallel, monolayers were infected with adenovirus containing the β-galactosidase gene, lacZ (Ad-lacZ), as a control for nonspecific viral infection upon endothelial cell signaling (34Holinstat M.

SOC currents were measured at a holding potential of –50 mV by depleting the cellular calcium store with 30 μmol/liter 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-myo-IP3 (metabolism-resistant IP3) and/or 2 μm thapsigargin included in the pipette solution. All experiments were performed at room temperature. [Ca2+]i Measurements—An increase in [Ca2+]i was measured using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura 2/AM as described (8Tiruppathi C.

For loading of cells with Fura 2/AM, cells grown on 25-mm coverslips were incubated with 3 μm Fura 2 for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and imaged using an Attoflor Ratio Vision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Inc., Rockville, MD) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope and an F-Fluar ×40 1.3-numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Regions of interest in individual cells were marked and excited at 334 and 380 nm with emission at 520 nm. The 334/380 nm excitation ratio, which increased as a function of [Ca2+]i, was captured at 5-s intervals. Immunoprecipitation and Phosphorylation of TRPC1—Cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes were serum-starved in phosphate-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C, after which cellular proteins were labeled by incubation with 150 μCi/ml 32P for 4 h. Following incubation with 32P, cells were stimulated with 50 nm thrombin or 2 μm thapsigargin at the indicated time intervals and lysed for 20 min on ice with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) (34Holinstat M.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG or anti-TRPC1 antibody (Ab) and Western-blotted with anti-TRPC1 antibody (2 μg/ml) to verify equal protein loading in each lane. To determine the specificity of anti-TRPC1 Ab, COS-7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged TRPC1 or vector alone were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc Ab and Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-TRPC1 antibodies. Both antibodies detected protein at ∼90 kDa in TRPC1-transfected cells, confirming the specificity of anti-TRPC1 antibody as described (35Mehta D. Ahmmed G.U. Paria B.C. Holinstat M.

Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Measurement—The time course of endothelial cell retraction, a measure of increased endothelial permeability, was measured using established protocols (35Mehta D. Ahmmed G.U. Paria B.C. Holinstat M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol.

For transfection of the Myc-tagged TRPC1 construct, HMECs grown on gelatin-coated gold electrodes were transfected with 1 μg/ml Myc-TRPC1 cDNA (TRPC1-overexpressing cells) or vector alone (control cells) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described (24Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37195-37203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The DNA/LipofectAMINE Plus mixture was incubated with cells for 4 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, followed by addition of complete growth medium to the cells. After 48–72 h of transfection, the cells were used for experiments. Before measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance, cells were placed in reduced serum medium (1% fetal bovine serum) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with or without Gö6976 for 1 h, after which they were stimulated with thrombin to determine the changes in electrical resistance of the endothelial monolayer. Data are presented as the change in the resistive (in-phase) component of the impedance normalized to its initial value at zero time. Data Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using unpaired Student's t test. Statistical differences of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Thrombin-induced Ca2+ Entry—In Fura 2-loaded endothelial cells, the thrombin response consists of an immediate but transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ due to release of sequestered Ca2+ from the ER, followed by a secondary rise in intracellular Ca2+ due to Ca2+ entry. We experimentally separated the two phases (Fig. 1A) using a Ca2+ add-back protocol. When administered under Ca2+-free bath conditions, thrombin elicited only the Ca2+ transient due to release of sequestered Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. A more sustained Ca2+ signal appeared subsequently when extracellular Ca2+ was restored to the bath medium, signifying entry of extracellular Ca2+ into cells. To identify the Ca2+ entry pathway, we used the trivalent cation La3+ or Gd3+, either of which is a known blocker of SOCs (11Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Paria B.C. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Addition of La3+ or Gd3+ rapidly abolished the Ca2+ entry phase (Fig. 1, A and B), thus indicating that Ca2+ entry is mediated via SOCs. To exclude the possibility that the Ca2+ entry was not the result of background or tonic Ca2+ entry, we showed that there was no Ca2+ entry following repletion of Ca2+ in the medium in the absence of store depletion (Fig. 1A, dotted line). In another series, we observed the blocking effect of a specific inhibitor of PKCα on Ca2+ entry via SOCs (Fig. 1C). The marked inhibitory action of Gö6976 on Ca2+ entry was evident because the Ca2+ release from ER stores was equivalent in control and treated cells, i.e. Ca2+ store depletion was the same under both conditions. Expression of dnPKCα (a kinase-defective mutant of PKCα) also resulted in a marked reduction in thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry via SOCs (Fig. 1D). As a procedural control, we showed that cells infected with a control construct (Ad-lacZ) gave normal responses to thrombin (Fig. 1D). The adenoviral vector used for these experiments guaranteed nearly 90% transfection of the endothelial monolayer (34Holinstat M. Mehta D. Kozasa T. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28793-28798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The summary graph in Fig. 1E demonstrates that 1) Ca2+ store depletion induced by thrombin was statistically indistinguishable in all groups and 2) Ca2+ entry caused by Ca2+ repletion was significantly reduced (>50% of the control) by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PKCα. To demonstrate that TRPC1 is a functional component of SOCs in endothelial cells, we used anti-TRPC1 Ab against the extracellular epitope of TRPC1, which has been recently shown to block TRPC1 function in platelets (38Rosado J.A. Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42157-42163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry was measured following depletion of stores using thrombin. Anti-TRPC1 Ab pretreatment significantly inhibited the influx of Ca2+ following Ca2+ store depletion; however, control IgG had no effect (Fig. 1F). In these experiments, anti-TRPC1 Ab did not significantly reduce the Ca2+ release transient, but markedly inhibited Ca2+ entry, which fell to ∼60% of the control. These findings indicate that normal Ca2+ entry via SOCs has a requirement for TRPC1 in endothelial cells. Thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ Entry—Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase found in the ER (40Gericke M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 422: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was used to activate SOCs by inducing Ca2+ store depletion independently of GPCRs (3Kwan H.Y. Leung P.C. Huang Y. Yao X. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Ca2+ entry in response to thapsigargin was monitored in Fura 2-loaded endothelial cells with or without Gö6976 pretreatment (Fig. 2, A and B) or in endothelial cells expressing either dnPKCα or the lacZ control (Fig. 2, C and D). Inhibition of PKCα attenuated the store depletion-induced Ca2+ entry by 52 ± 5% (Gö6976) and 58 ± 6% (dnPKCα) (Fig. 2, A–D), indicating that PKCα contributes to SOC activation independently of GPCR pathways. IP3-induced Store-operated Current—IP3 can induce Ca2+ store depletion and should thereby activate Ca2+ entry via SOCs. Poor selectivity for divalent cations and sensitivity to La3+ or Gd3+ are characteristic properties of store-operated channels in many tissues (4Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol.

Using the whole cell patch clamp technique (43Ahmmed G.U. Dong P.H. Song G. Ball N.A. Xu Y. Walsh R.A. Chiamvimonvat N. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we internally applied IP3 and measured the resulting SOC that we operationally defined as the La3+-sensitive inward current at –50 mV. Continuous current recordings showed the rapid development of an La3+ (1 mm)-sensitive inward current upon internal dialysis with IP3 or perfusion of thapsigargin. The action of La3+ was reversible as shown (Fig. 3A). Without IP3/thapsigargin in the pipette, there was no current as shown in Fig. 3B, indicating that the current was not the result of a nonspecific leak. To determine whether the SOC current is regulated by PKCα, we pretreated cells with Gö6976 prior to membrane rupture with patch pipettes. Inhibition of PKCα by Gö6976 markedly reduced the SOC current amplitude from a mean value of 2.9 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.2 pA/picofarad (Fig. 3, C and I), indicating the role of endogenous PKCα in regulating SOC currents. Because Gö6976 has been shown to affect PKCβ in several cell types (30Ma R. Kudlacek P.E. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1390-C1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44Akiba S. Ohno S. Chiba M. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we also used LY379196, an inhibitor of PKCβ, to address the possible role of PKCβ in modulating SOC currents. As shown in Fig. 3D, inhibition of PKCβ had no effect on the IP3-induced current. To demonstrate the specific role of PKCα, we also compared the magnitude of IP3-induced currents in endothelial cells expressing the pCMV vector (control) and in cells expressing dnPKCα. As shown in Fig. 3 (E and F), expression of dnPKCα significantly reduced IP3-induced currents; current amplitude was significantly decreased from 2.7 ± 0.3 to 1.2 ± 0.3 pA/picofarad (Fig. 3I). Perfusion of thapsigargin (2 μm) activated the SOC current to a similar amplitude as that induced by IP3 (Fig. 3G). The current-voltage relationship in Fig. 3H shows a reversal potential close to 0 mV, indicating that the inward current was carried by cations as described previously for SOCs (4Liu X. O'Connell A.

https://openalex.org/W2111590266,"By using a genome-wide approach, we sought the identification of p53-regulated genes involved in cellular apoptosis. To this end, we assessed the transcriptional response of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells during apoptosis induced by the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil as the function of p53 status, and we identified 230 potential targets that are regulated by p53. Previously identified p53 targets known to be involved in growth arrest and apoptosis were observed to be induced, thus validating the approach. Strikingly, we found that p53 regulates gene expression primarily through transcriptional repression (n = 189) rather than activation (n = 41), and selective blockade of p53-dependent gene repression resulted in the reduction in 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. Reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that p53 can suppress the promoter activities of three further studied candidate genes PLK, PTTG1, and CHEK1 but would only bind directly to PTTG1 and CHEK1 promoters, revealing that p53 can repress gene expression through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Moreover, RNAi-mediated knockdown of PLK and PTTG1 expression was sufficient to induce apoptosis, suggesting that repression of novel anti-apoptotic genes by p53 might contribute to a significant portion of the p53-dependent apoptosis. Our data support the divergent functions of p53 in regulating gene expression that play both synergistic and pleiotropic roles in p53-associated apoptosis.

Our data support the divergent functions of p53 in regulating gene expression that play both synergistic and pleiotropic roles in p53-associated apoptosis. p53 protein is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor in human cancers. p53 exerts its function through cell cycle arrest, which allows time for DNA damage repair, or apoptosis, which eliminates cells with damaged DNA (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5773) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that these functions of p53 are mediated by transactivation of p53 through its ability to bind to cis-acting DNA elements within the regulatory regions (2Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability in transcriptional activation, p53 can also negatively regulate the expression of genes through unknown mechanisms (4Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 5Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage and other forms of cellular stress, the levels of p53 protein are greatly increased, and the ability of p53 to bind specific DNA sequences is activated (3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). p53 protein levels are regulated post-transcriptionally; thus, the accumulation of p53 following DNA damage results primarily from an increase in protein stability (6Mosner J. Mummenbrauer T. Bauer C. Sczakiel G. Grosse F. Deppert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It has become clear that the transcriptional activity of p53 is required for p53-dependent cell cycle arrest; however, the mechanisms by which p53 induces apoptosis are not fully understood (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5773) Google Scholar, 3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). In particular, it remains unclear as to whether p53-mediated transactivation contributes fully to p53-dependent apoptosis. Unlike the cell cycle inhibitory capacity of p53, which is mediated primarily by p21, a number of genes known to be involved in apoptosis, including BAX, PUMA, FAS/APO-1, NOXA, PIGs, and p53AIP1, have been identified as direct transcriptional targets regulated by p53 (3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 7Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although it is widely believed that p53 induces apoptosis through transcriptional activation of its putative apoptotic targets (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is indirect evidence indicating that p53 induces apoptosis through transcriptional repression of anti-apoptotic signals (12Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W.

Moreover, p53 has been shown to induce apoptosis in response to one stimulus but growth arrest to another, probably because of selective transcription of subsets of p53 targets (15Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Flaman J.M. Robert V. Lenglet S. Moreau V. Iggo R. Frebourg T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, how p53 modulates apoptosis remains elusive, and whether transcriptional activation and repression are both required for p53-induced apoptosis is unclear. Several studies have been performed to identify p53 target genes on a large scale by using microarray technology (17Mirza A. Wu Q. Wang L. McClanahan T. Bishop W.R. Gheyas F. Ding W. Hutchins B.

However, most of these studies focused on the p53 transactivated genes, and the whole transcriptional program regulated by p53 in relation to apoptosis has not been dissected in detail. In addition, previous studies (23Guo Q.M. Malek R.L. Kim S. Chiao C. He M. Ruffy M. Sanka K. Lee N.H. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5922-5928PubMed Google Scholar) carried out in artificial systems produced exaggerated levels of overexpressed p53 which, in the case of Myc, had been shown to induce a different set of genes than physiologic levels of Myc. We sought to identify the transcriptional programs involved in p53-induced apoptosis and to understand the regulation of p53 target genes in biologically relevant conditions. To these ends, we took the advantage of colorectal cancer HCT116 cells that are known to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis in response to the anticancer drug 5-FU, 1The abbreviations used are: 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interference RNA; CHX, cycloheximide. 1The abbreviations used are: 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interference RNA; CHX, cycloheximide. an antimetabolite that activates p53 (24Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Thus, by comparing the temporal gene expression-response profiles between HCT116 cells and the p53-deficient counterparts following 5-FU treatment, we were able to identify 5-FU-induced changes in gene expression that are either dependent on p53 in general or specific to the drug treatment. We dissected the p53-dependent transcriptional program in detail, and we identified ∼230 genes that are tightly regulated by p53 out of a 19,000 probe array. Our data reveal that p53 not only induces genes known to be involved in growth arrest and apoptosis but also activates multiple genes that function to promote cellular growth, supporting the role of p53 as a dual-signal gatekeeper in balancing apoptosis with cellular growth. Strikingly, we show that the majority of p53-responsive genes are repressed rather than activated and that gene repression by p53 on a genomic scale is tightly linked to its ability to induce apoptosis. Extending these observations, we show that p53 can repress the transcription of PLK, CHEK1, and PTTG1 directly or indirectly, and their expression is required for maintaining cell survival. Thus, p53 utilizes both transcriptional activation and repression of its target genes for the full induction of apoptosis. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—Human colon cancer cell line HCT116 and its derived isogenic p53 (-/-) cell line were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All of the culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen. 5-Fluorouracil and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared as reported previously (25Yu Q. La Rose J. Zhang H. Takemura H. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5743-5748PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was quantified (Bio-Rad), and protein samples (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). p53, PLK, PTTG1, and Chk1 proteins were identified using anti-p53, anti-Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PLK, and anti-PTTG1 primary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Apoptosis Analyses—Apoptosis was measured using FACS analysis of cells in sub-G1 phase. Cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) after treatment with RNase (100 μg/ml). The stained cells were analyzed for DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in a FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle fractions were quantified with Cellquest (BD Biosciences). Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with the use of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and the Qiagen RNase Mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Valencia, CA). The methods for probe labeling reaction and microarray hybridization were described previously (26Yu Q. He M. Lee N.H. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13059-13066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except the total RNA was used directly for labeling. For all experiments, universal human reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate a reference probe for drug-treated and -untreated samples. 30 μg of total RNA from experimental samples or equal amounts of universal human reference RNA were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, by using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The microarray hybridization, image process, and data normalization were as described previously (26Yu Q. He M. Lee N.H. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13059-13066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The log 2 ratios of each time point were then normalized for each gene to that of untreated cells (time 0) to obtain the relative expression pattern. The genes that showed substantial differences after drug treatment were selected based on a 2-fold change of expression value for at least two time points across all experimental conditions. A total of 1260 of ∼19,000 genes met the criteria and were further analyzed using clustering and display programs (rana.stanford.edu/software) developed by Eisen et al. (27Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13157) Google Scholar). Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was subjected to real time RT-PCR using ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green master mix (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Primers are available upon request. β-Actin was used as an internal control for equal amounts of RNA used. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—For promoter reporter constructs, DNA fragments containing ∼1–1.5 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the respective genes were isolated by genomic PCR and subsequently subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR primers are as follows: for PLK1, CCGGGGGTACCTGCTGTAAATGTTTTACAATGG (forward) and GGAAGATCTCTGGGAACGTTACAAAAGCCT (reverse); for CHEK1, TCCCCCGGGACCGGGCTGAAGTAAAGCAT (forward) and CCCAAGCTTCTCCCAAGCACACCGAAGGT (reverse); and for PTTG1, CCGGGTACCGCAAAATTTCTTTTCATATCTG (forward) and CCCAAGCTTTGGGGTCTTTAGAGGTCTCC (reverse). The wild-type p53 (pCMV-p53) and dominant negative mutant p53 (pCMV-p53R175H) expression vectors were obtained from Dr. B. Vogelstein. For transfection, 1 × 104 HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells were seeded in triplicate into 96-well tissue culture plates and transfected with FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each well, 60 ng of reporter construct or PGL3 basic empty vector were co-transfected with 1 or 10 ng of wild type or mutant p53 expression vectors, together with 3 ng of Renilla luciferase control vector PRL-null (Promega). The total amount of transfected DNA in each well was kept constant by adding empty vector pCMV plasmid. To correct for variation in transfection efficiency, reporter firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, which was measured using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays with HCT116 cells were carried out as described in Weinmann et al. (28Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and Wells and Farnham (29Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at different time points before and after 5-FU treatment were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was inactivated by addition of 125 mm glycine. Chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments of average size of 500 bp were immunoprecipitated using anti-p53 DO1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For all ChIP experiments, quantitative PCR analyses were performed in real time using ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green Master Mix as described (30Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Relative occupancy values were calculated by determining the apparent immunoprecipitation efficiency (ratios of the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA over that of the input sample) and normalized to the level observed at a control region, which was defined as 1.0. The control region is a 279-bp region on chromosome 22 and is amplified using the following primers: 5′-GGACTCGGAAGAGGTTCACCTTCGG-3′ and 5′-GTCGCCTCCGCTTGCTGAACTCAATGC-3′. The error for independent determinations is ±10%. List of Primers—For CHEK1, A, GAAATTTGCAGGTCTTCCTCTTCGTATTC (forward) and CCTACCTCAGCATCCCAAGTCACTG (reverse); B, CCGGCCAGTGCTGGAGAATGTAAT (forward) and CGGGGAGAGCCAAAATAAATCTTACAACG (reverse); and C, AAGCTCCAACATAAACTGCTCGCTTTC (forward) and GTGCTTTGTAAACCTCAGAGTGCGGTACT (reverse). For PTTG11, A, TCCCCGTCGCCCGCAAGTTCTAACAATAT (forward) and CCCGCCAGGAAATTAGTGCGCATGT (reverse); B, CCTCTTTTCTTCACCTTAAGTTAGGCTCT (forward) and CGAAAGGCTTGACACTATACCTGACATA (reverse); C, CCCAGAAAACGTGCCACAAAGTTTGCAAG (forward) and TCACGCAGGTCTTAACAGCCGCATTCA (reverse). siRNA and Transfection—siRNAs were synthesized by the in vitro transcription method using Silencer™ siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Targeting sequence for human PLK (GenBank™ accession number NM_005030), AAGGGCGGCTTTGCCAAGTGC, and for PTTG1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_004219), AAAGCTCTGTTCCTGCCTCAG. An unrelated siRNA targeting a sequence in GADPH mRNA (Ambion) served as a control. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates on the day before transfection at the concentration of 1 × 105 cells per well. Cells were transfected with siRNAs at a concentration of 30 nm using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum was added. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for protein expression or FACS analysis. Genome-wide Effects in Gene Expression in Response to 5-FU Treatment in HCT116 and HCT116 p53 (-/-) Cells—To study the regulation of gene expression by p53 during genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis, we treated the well characterized colorectal cancer HCT116 cells and the p53-deficient subline with 5-FU, an antimetabolite anticancer drug known to induce p53-dependent apoptosis in these cells (24Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Addition of 5-FU to the culture medium of HCT116 cells induced a strong p53 accumulation and apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. However, only a minimum apoptosis was induced in their p53 null counterparts (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, as reported previously, 5-FU induces a p53-dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells. We then used spotted Oligo arrays representing 19,000 gene set (Genome Institute of Singapore) to study the temporal gene expression of p53 wild-type and null HCT116 cells following 5-FU treatment at different time points. The expression of ∼1260 genes changed significantly (2.0-fold cut-off) after 5-FU treatment for at least 2 time points after we applied a series of filters and normalizations described under “Experimental Procedures.” A hierarchical clustering method was used to group drug-responsive genes on the basis of similarities in their expression patterns (27Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13157) Google Scholar) and three clusters consisting of 280 genes display progressive changes in gene expression across the time points, as illustrated in Fig. 1C. When gene expression patterns in HCT116 wild-type cells were compared with HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 h after treatment, two clusters of genes were found to be differentially expressed between HCT116 and HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells both as a function of time following drug treatment and p53 status (Fig. 1C, clusters B and C). The vast majority of genes were down-regulated by 5-FU treatment in HCT116 cells: Fig. 1C, clusters B and C, shows 41 genes that were up-regulated and 239 genes that were down-regulated with induction occurring earlier temporally than repression (Fig. 1D). However, in HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells treated with 5-FU, these gene responses were either abolished or largely reduced, suggesting that the major transcriptional effects by 5-FU are mediated by p53. A much smaller subset of genes was concomitantly increased following 5-FU treatment in both p53 wild-type and null HCT116 cells (Fig. 1C, cluster A). One gene of note in this cluster is cyclin E2, which was significantly induced by 5-FU (∼3-fold), and cyclin E1, to a lesser degree (∼1.5-fold). These genes may represent the general response to 5-FU and appeared to be independent of p53 status. The array results were confirmed in a select subset of these genes by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Real time RT-PCR analyses of selected genes. HCT116 and HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells were either untreated or treated with 5-FU, and mRNA expression of selected genes was measured by real time RT-PCR using ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green Master mix. Representative genes whose expressions are independent of p53 (CCNE2, upper panel), up-regulated by p53 (CNKN1A, TGFα, and EPHA2, middle panel), and down-regulated by p53 (PTTG1, RAD21, and CDKN3, lower panel) are shown. Fold changes relative to the untreated control (C, arbitrarily set as 1) at indicated times in HCT116 cells (open bars) and HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells (dark bars) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Genes Affected by Levels of p53 Protein Accumulation—Protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) has been shown to block p53 accumulation and to inhibit p53-dependent transcription (31Woo R.A. Jack M.T. Xu Y. Burma S. Chen D.J. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3000-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To identify genes whose expression is directly influenced by p53 protein levels, we pretreated the culture with CHX for 30 min prior to the induction by addition of 5-FU and harvested the cells at different time points. As predicted, pretreatment of HCT116 cells with 10 μg/ml CHX significantly abrogated 5-FU-induced p53 accumulation (Fig. 3A) and accordingly abolished 5-FU-induced apoptosis by 90% (Fig. 3B). However, CHX treatment had negligible effect on low levels of apoptosis observed in 5-FU-treated HCT116 p53 (-/-) cells (data not shown). This observation suggests the abrogation of p53 accumulation by CHX blocks 5-FU-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Of 41 genes that were induced following p53 accumulation in the absence of CHX, 38 were either abolished or largely reduced in their induction in the presence of CHX (Fig. 3C). At all the time points analyzed, the expression of the majority of p53-inducible genes is directly associated with p53 protein levels. In contrast to the p53-inducible genes, we found that ∼40% of p53-repressed genes (n = 50) were insensitive to CHX treatment and therefore not p53-regulated (Fig. 3C). Thus, only those that are sensitive to blockade of p53 accumulation by CHX are considered truly p53-regulated genes. These genes are listed in Table I of the Supplemental Material. Note, however, that because cycloheximide blocked p53 accumulation itself, we cannot discriminate between p53 primary and secondary target genes. p53-inducible Genes—Among 41 genes up-regulated by p53, 16 have been identified previously as p53 targets in a variety of systems (Table I, boldface text, see Supplemental Material). They are putative p53 targets involved in apoptosis (PUMA, NOXA, PIG3, and FAS/CD95) or growth arrest (CDKN1A, GADD45, and 14-3-3σ). Induction of other known p53 targets such as MDM2, APAF, and KILLER/DR5 were also observed but to a lesser degree than those listed in Table I of Supplemental Material. The successful detection of a large number of previously identified p53 targets indicates that our system is robust and accurate in identifying p53-responsive genes. However, 3 of 41 p53-inducible genes including known p53 targets GADD45A and PPMID (Fig. 3) were not sensitive to CHX treatment, indicating that these three genes must be regulated by p53 in a way that is distinct from other target genes. This observation seems to be in line with a previous report (32Zhan Q. Chen I.T. Antinore M.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that GADD45A is regulated by p53 through indirect transactivation. Of all p53-inducible genes, CDKN1A (encoding p21) was most strongly up-regulated (9-fold), which is consistent with a high binding affinity of p53 to p21 promoter (11Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We also found that PUMA was most responsive among the detectable putative apoptotic targets induced by p53, supporting the previous reports that PUMA was a major apoptotic target mediating p53-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells (33Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 34Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). We also identified 25 previously unidentified putative target genes up-regulated by p53. Of these 25, 19 (76%) were found to contain putative p53-binding sites in their promoter regions (data not shown). This compares to 29% in genes unresponsive to p53 induction. Most interesting, a candidate tumor suppressor gene SERPINB5 was also strongly induced by p53 at 24 h after 5-FU treatment (9-fold), pointing to a potential role of its gene product in mediating p53-mediated tumor suppressor function. The other two candidate genes of interest are DUSP5 and -14, which encode dual specificity phosphatases 5 and 14, respectively. In line with these findings, a recent study shows that DUSP2, another member of this family, is a transcription target of p53 that functions in signaling apoptosis and growth arrest (15Yin Y. Liu Y.X. Jin Y.J. Hall E.J. Barrett J.C. Nature. 2003; 422: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that p53 activation also led to the induction of a number of genes associated with mitogenic responses. These genes include TGFα, SEK, TOP1, CNK, and EPHA2, and all contain putative p53-binding sites in their promoters. In particular, TGFα and EPHA2 have been reported previously to be linked to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade that promotes cell growth (35Sawhney R.S. Sharma B. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19861-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Pratt R.L. Kinch M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7690-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This implies that activation of p53 is accompanied by an induction of the cellular mitogenic program. This finding is consistent with recent studies (37Han J.A. Kim J.I. Ongusaha P.P. Hwang D.H. Ballou L.R. Mahale A. Aaronson S.A. Le"
https://openalex.org/W2020017486,"Truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) are small hemoproteins forming a separate cluster within the hemoglobin superfamily; their functional roles in bacteria, plants, and unicellular eukaryotes are marginally understood. Crystallographic investigations have shown that the trHb fold (a two-on-two α-helical sandwich related to the globin fold) hosts a protein matrix tunnel system offering a potential path for ligand diffusion to the heme distal site. The tunnel topology is conserved in group I trHbs, although with modulation of its size/structure. Here, we present a crystallographic investigation on trHbs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydomonas eugametos, and Paramecium caudatum, showing that treatment of trHb crystals under xenon pressure leads to binding of xenon atoms at specific (conserved) sites along the protein matrix tunnel. The crystallographic results are in keeping with data from molecular dynamics simulations, where a dioxygen molecule is left free to diffuse within the protein matrix. Modulation of xenon binding over four main sites is related to the structural properties of the tunnel system in the three trHbs and may be connected to their functional roles. In a parallel crystallographic investigation on M. tuberculosis trHbN, we show that butyl isocyanide also binds within the apolar tunnel, in excellent agreement with concepts derived from the xenon binding experiments. These results, together with recent data on atypical CO rebinding kinetics to group I trHbs, underline the potential role of the tunnel system in supporting diffusion, but also accumulation in multiple copies, of low polarity ligands/molecules within group I trHbs.

Truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) 1The abbreviations used are: trHb, truncated hemoglobin; Ce-trHb, group I trHb from C. eugametos; Mt-trHbN, group I trHb from M. tuberculosis; Mt-trHbO, group II trHb from M. tuberculosis; Pc-trHb, group I trHb from P. caudatum; Ss-trHb, group I trHb from Synechocystis sp.; Mb, myoglobin; MD, molecular dynamics; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: trHb, truncated hemoglobin; Ce-trHb, group I trHb from C. eugametos; Mt-trHbN, group I trHb from M. tuberculosis; Mt-trHbO, group II trHb from M. tuberculosis; Pc-trHb, group I trHb from P. caudatum; Ss-trHb, group I trHb from Synechocystis sp.; Mb, myoglobin; MD, molecular dynamics; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. are small oxygen-binding hemoproteins, identified in bacteria, higher plants, and in certain unicellular eukaryotes, building a separate cluster within the hemoglobin superfamily. Based on amino acid sequence analysis, three trHb phylogenetic groups (groups I, II, and III) have been recognized (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). TrHbs display amino acid sequences that are 20-40 residues shorter than (non)vertebrate hemoglobins, to which they are scarcely related by sequence similarity. Notably, trHbs belonging to the different groups, but also within the same group, may share less then 20% amino acid sequence identity (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). TrHbs from more than one group can coexist in some bacteria, suggesting a wide diversification of functions. Possible trHb functions that are consistent with observed biophysical properties include long term ligand or substrate storage, NO detoxification, O2/NO sensor, redox reactions, and O2 delivery under hypoxic conditions (1Wittenberg J.B.

The main structural features highlighted by these studies are an unprecedented two-on-two α-helical sandwich fold, a ligand-dependent hydrogen-bonding network within the distal heme pocket, and a protein matrix hydrophobic tunnel/cavity network connecting the solvent space to the heme distal pocket through one or two access sites (5Pesce A.

Such tunnel/cavity network is topologically conserved in Ce-trHb, Pc-trHb, and in Mt-trHbN three-dimensional structures, being built by almost invariant apolar residues (5Pesce A. Couture M.

In contrast, the recently solved crystal structure of hexacoordinated Ss-trHb, where the sixth heme ligand is residue HisE10, 2TrHb residues are identified by their three-letter code, their globin fold topological position, and their sequence number. 2TrHb residues are identified by their three-letter code, their globin fold topological position, and their sequence number. did not show evidence of such cavity network, likely related to extensive conformational changes observed in the protein distal site region (8Hoy J.A.

The tunnel short branch (about 8 Å long) connects the heme distal site to the outer solvent space, at a location comprised between the central region of the G and H helices. The tunnel long branch stretches for about 20 Å through the protein matrix, from the heme distal cavity to a solvent access site located between the interhelical AB and GH loops. Overall, the tunnel volume is about 265 Å3 (6Milani M. Pesce A. Ouellet Y. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3902-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A very similar but more open tunnel system displays a volume of about 400 Å3 in Ce-trHb, whereas in Pc-trHb the tunnel is restricted to three cavities, with an overall volume of 180 Å3 (5Pesce A.

However, the Mb cavities are much smaller (13-45 Å3) than the cavities found in trHbs and are topologically unrelated.The location and size of the hydrophobic tunnels in group I trHbs suggest important roles in controlling diffusion of small ligands to/from the heme distal pocket or in temporary ligand storage and/or accumulation (1Wittenberg J.B.

To shed first light on such stimulating ideas, we have analyzed crystals of Mt-trHbN, Ce-trHb, and Pc-trHb treated with xenon or butyl isocyanide, two distinct probes expected to diffuse differently through the trHb tunnel system, and determined their three-dimensional structures. Our data, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, show that diffusion to the heme distal site in the group I trHbs considered may follow a path matching the trHb hydrophobic tunnel system, where xenon and butyl isocyanide docking sites are experimentally identified.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMt-trHbN, Ce-trHb, and Pc-trHb were expressed, purified, and crystallized as previously reported (5Pesce A.

To promote xenon diffusion within the protein matrix, the selected trHb crystals, in their cryo-protectant solutions, were treated in a high pressure chamber (Xcell, Oxford Cryo-system, UK). Mt-trHbN, Ce-trHb, and Pc-trHb crystals were exposed to 25 bar xenon, for 20-30 min. The x-ray diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K, using a MAR-Research 345 imaging plate detector coupled to a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator (copper Kα radiation; resolution limits of 2.43 Å for Mt-trHbN, 2.45 Å for Ce-trHb, and 2.40 Å for Pc-trHb).

Monomeric Ce-trHb-refined (R factor = 21.0% and Rfree = 26.8%, at 2.45 Å resolution) and Pc-trHb-refined (R factor = 21.1% and Rfree = 28.2%, at 2.40 Å resolution) xenon adducts display 4 and 1 protein matrix xenon atoms, respectively.Mt-trHbN cyano-met crystals were soaked for about 30 min in a solution containing the stabilizing medium (1.46 m K2HPO4, 0.40 m KH2PO4, 0.001 m KCN, pH 8.1) and 0.038 m butyl isocyanide. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K, at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beam line ID14-2 (Grenoble, France), using the soaking solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, as cryo-protectant. The diffraction data (to 2.10 Å resolution) were processed and scaled using MOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsl.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19703) Google Scholar). Structure solution and refinement were carried over as described above for the xenon adduct; however, to minimize local bias, an Ala-trimmed model of Mt-trHbN was used as the starting model. A prominent difference electron density peak next to the A subunit heme distal cavity suggested the presence of butyl isocyanide and was refined accordingly (for the final model, R factor = 19.4% and Rfree = 25.1%, at 2.10 Å resolution).Similar experiments were performed on Ce-trHb and on Pc-trHb, soaking the crystals in stabilizing solutions containing 0.020 m butyl isocyanide, for 2 h. In the case of Ce-trHb, a 3.0 Å resolution data set was collected in house. Inspection of the difference Fourier maps showed an elongated difference electron density peak in the long branch of the protein matrix tunnel, allowing only a qualitative modeling of a bound butyl isocyanide molecule, because of low occupancy (data not shown). In the case of the butyl isocyanide Pc-trHb-soaked crystals (data collected in house, up to 2.4 Å resolution), no extra electron density could be located, indicating the lack of butyl isocyanide binding to this trHb. Table I summarizes all the data collection and refinement statistics. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the above trHb adducts have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with the entry codes 1s56 (Mt-trHbN xenon), 1uvx (Ce-trHb xenon), 1uvy (PctrHb xenon), and 1s61 (Mt-trHbN butyl isocyanide).The MD simulations of dioxygen diffusion within the Mt-trHbN tunnel system were performed using the program GROMACS and the GROMACS force field (23Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R.

The protein was enclosed in a parallelepiped box (89.4 Å × 67.7 Å × 77.5 Å), solvated with 15,035 water molecules; the box was neutralized adding six Na+ ions (the overall number of atoms in the system is 45,998). A dioxygen molecule was added in a random position within the distal heme cavity. After application of an initial conjugate gradient minimization (until convergence to a maximum force within the system of 300 kJ mol-1nm-1) to relax the system, the MD cycles were performed in a NPT ensemble, with 1-fs time steps. The total simulation time was 1950 ps.RESULTSTrHb Xenon DerivativesMt-trHbN—Analysis of the Mt-trHbN xenon adduct allowed identification of 8 xenon atoms, with different occupancy levels, distributed between the two asymmetric unit molecules. The overall Mt-trHbN structure is little affected by xenon binding, the r.m.s.d. values calculated for comparisons of the xenon bound/unbound A and B subunits being 0.82 and 0.68 Å (on 122 Cα atom pairs), respectively. Three major xenon sites (named Xe1, Xe2, and Xe4; Fig. 2A) are equally present and located in both Mt-trHbN A and B subunits. The Xe1 site (100% xenon occupancy) is located in the tunnel long branch, at 13.3 Å from the heme iron atom, whereas site Xe2 (60% occupancy) falls in the short branch (at 6.3 Å from the heme iron atom). The Xe4 site (50% occupancy) is located at the tunnel short branch entrance, in a hydrophobic cleft between symmetry related molecules. In contrast, the Xe3 site (50% occupancy) is present in subunit B only, being located between the Xe2 and Xe4 sites, at the interface between the tunnel short branch and the solvent. Xe5, located at 9.0 Å from the heme iron atom, between the sites Xe1 and Xe2 in subunit A, displays only 30% occupancy, likely representing a transition site bridging between the Xe1 and Xe2 sites. Such a bridging role is also suggested by the elongated distribution of the residual Fo - Fc map, around Xe5.Fig. 2Stereo view of binding of xenon atoms and butyl isocyanide to trHbs. A, Mt-trHbN subunit B is portrayed together with the bound xenon atoms (magenta); the radius of the spheres representing each xenon atom is proportional to the occupancy of the site. The Xe5 atom, not observed in subunit B, is, however, reported here to highlight its location bridging between the Xe1 and Xe2 sites. The path of the protein matrix tunnel is defined by a gray mesh. The heme group is red, and PheE15(62) is gray. For all figures, the tunnel path has been calculated with SURFNET (29Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), and figures have been drawn with BOBSCRIPT (30Esnousf B.M. J. Mol.

The butyl isocyanide molecule (magenta) fills part of the tunnel volume available through selection of PheE15(62) conformation (orange). In the B subunit, where butyl isocyanide is scarcely present, PheE15(62) displays also the alternate conformation (yellow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Xe2, Xe3, and Xe4 sites outline the path of the Mt-trHbN tunnel short branch from the heme distal cavity to the solvent (Fig. 2A) (6Milani M. Pesce A. Ouellet Y. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3902-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In particular, the Xe3 site protein surface location suggests that access to the heme distal site may occur through an entry site comprised between the G and H helices, defined by residues PheG5(91), AlaG9(95), LeuH8(116), IleH11(119), and AlaH12(120). Binding of xenon at the Xe3 site induces shifts of 0.4-1.2 Å at residues AlaG9(95) and IleH11(119), resulting in a wider solvent aperture for the tunnel short branch. The structural analysis also shows that the Mt-trHbN tunnel long branch is accessible from the solvent, in both A and B subunits, through an aperture defined by residues IleA15(19), IleB2(25), ValB5(28), and LeuG16(102). The location of a full occupancy xenon atom in the Xe1 cavity, at 5.5 Å from the long branch solvent aperture, is stabilized by van der Waals' contacts with residues ValB5(28), PheE15(62), LeuE19(66), LeuG12(98), and LeuG16(102) (Figs. 1 and 2A).Ce-trHb—The Ce-trHb structure displays the wider (∼5 Å in diameter) and more extended L-shaped tunnel observed so far in group I trHbs (Fig. 2B). The four xenon atoms found in the Ce-trHb xenon adduct follow the long tunnel branch, at mutual distances of 4-5 Å. In particular, three xenon atoms match the Xe1, Xe2, and Xe5 sites observed in Mt-trHbN (the MttrHbN-Xe site numbering scheme is kept for Ce-trHb and PctrHb, to identify topologically equivalent xenon sites within the trHb fold). The Xe1 site (70% occupancy) falls at 13.7 Å from the heme iron atom, contacting residues LeuE15(49), LeuE19(53), and LeuG16(91). The Xe2 site (occupancy of 80%) falls at 6.8 Å from the iron atom, being surrounded by residues AlaB5(15), PheB9(19), GlnE11(45), and LeuG12(87) and by the heme group. The third xenon site (40% occupancy) in Ce-trHb is located at a position matching the Xe5 site of Mt-trHbN (10.8 Å from the heme iron atom), next to residues PheB9(19), LeuE15(49), and LeuG12(87). Finally, the fourth xenon site (Xe6; 70% occupancy) does not match any xenon site in MttrHbN, being located at the protein-solvent interface at the exit of the tunnel long branch, contacting residues LeuA15(6), AlaB1(11), AlaB5(15), LeuG16(91), and Val(96) (Figs. 1 and 2B).Structural comparison of the Ce-trHb in the presence and in the absence of xenon atoms does not highlight significant main readjustments in the protein backbone (r.m.s.d. of 0.18 Å, calculated over 121 Cα pairs). However, xenon binding induces a 1.0 Å shift of LeuG12(87), such that the tunnel volume is increased from 320 Å3 in the absence of Xe to 380 Å3 in the presence of Xe, originating the Xe5 site. In contrast, the Xe1, Xe2, and Xe6 atoms are found in cavities that are already present in the Xe-free Ce-trHb structure (5Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tunnel short branch of Mt-trHbN is more properly defined as a cavity in Ce-trHb (about 90 Å3), lined by residues PheG5(80), GlnG6(81), AlaG9(84), MetH8(105), ValH11(108), and AlaH12(109). Remarkably, upon xenon binding, such a cavity shrinks to about 50 Å3, because of the conformational readjustments at LeuG12(87) and MetH8(105), linked to occupation of the Xe5 site.Pc-trHb—The residue selection at the B5 and H7 topological sites (Fig. 1), together with a shift of the B6-B10 polypeptide segment, restrict the tunnel size in Pc-trHb and divide it into three cavities (overall volume 180 Å3), topologically distributed along the tunnel long branch described above (Fig. 2C). In agreement with such picture, only one xenon atom is bound by Pc-trHb, at the Xe1 site (80% occupancy, at 13.8 Å from the heme iron atom), in a 65 Å3 cavity lined by the hydrophobic residues ValB2(12), ValB5(15), ThrB6(16), LeuE15(49), LeuE19(53), LeuG12(85), LeuG16(89), and ThrH7(102). As for Mt-trHbN and Ce-trHb, the r.m.s.d. value, calculated for the protein backbones of the aquo-met Pc-trHb and its xenon adduct (0.28 Å, for 116 Cα pairs), is indicative of minor overall structural readjustments. Binding of the xenon atom, however, results in a wider Xe1 cavity (volume increase of 10 Å3), reflected by side chain shifts (of about 0.5 Å) of residues LeuE15(49) and LeuG12(85). In Pc-trHb, these residues build a narrow neck between the Xe1 site and the adjacent (smaller) cavity, corresponding to the Xe2 site in Ce-trHb. The small size of the potential Xe2 site in Pc-trHb (11 Å3) prevents xenon binding. However, xenon binding to Pc-trHb shifts the heme vinyl CBC atom by 0.7 Å to form an additional small cavity with a volume of 12 Å3. This additional cavity is not observed in the aquo-met Pc-trHb structure in the absence of Xe.Mt-trHbN-butyl Isocyanide DerivativeUnder the experimental conditions applied, binding of butyl isocyanide to Mt-trHbN occurs essentially only in the tunnel long branch of the A subunit (with 100% occupancy). The B subunit displays electron density compatible with very low occupancy binding only. The r.m.s.d. calculated between subunits A and B of the Mt-trHbN adduct is 0.93 Å, (over Cα pairs 3-125). Butyl isocyanide is completely buried within the short tunnel branch and the heme distal cavity (Figs. 1 and 2D), being stabilized by van der Waals' contacts with the heme, PheB9(32), PheE15(62), ValG8(94), LeuG12(98), and IleH11(119) and by dipole-dipole interaction with the amide group of GlnE11(58) (Fig. 2D).It has previously been shown that in Mt-trHbN the short and the long tunnel branches are separated by the two facing residues PheE15(62) and LeuG12(98). In particular, PheE15(62) was ob"

The biochemical pathway mediating protein sumoylation has been characterized and is analogous to that defined for ubiquitination. Namely, the combined action of three proteins (an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase) mediates isopeptide bond formation between SUMO and the target lysine on the substrate protein. Importantly, sumoylation is reversible, and a number of SUMO proteases that can cleave SUMO from specific target proteins have been identified (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 2Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).The bulk of present knowledge of the role of sumoylation in the regulation of cell behavior has been inferred from the nature of identified SUMO substrate proteins (3Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The list of known SUMO substrates has been compiled by a combination of serendipitous observations and direct candidate analysis. It is not at all clear how well this list reflects the contribution of dynamic sumoylation to cell regulatory events. Therefore, we wished to assess the feasibility of a proteomics-based approach for an unbiased sampling of cellular SUMO target proteins. Here, we report the use of affinity chromatography-coupled HPLC/MS/MS analysis for identification of sumoylated proteins. Our observations suggest a major role for SUMO in the modulation of proteins controlling chromatin structure and gene expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of Cellular SUMO1-conjugated Proteins—HA-tagged SUMO1 and SUMO1-QT were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells. HEK-293 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Five μg of pCDNA3-HA-SUMO1 or pCDNA3-HA-SUMO1-QT were transfected per 10-cm plate of cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection, HEK-293 cells were serum-deprived for 24 h. Fifteen 10-cm plates of the transfected HEK-293 cells were used for the subsequent immunopurification of expressed HA-tagged proteins. Cells were lysed in boiling phosphate-buffered saline, 4% SDS. Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min. SDS was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5% SDS in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, with a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates again were cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min prior to immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins with Sepharose beads conjugated to monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (BAbCO) was used for immunoblot analysis of sumoylated proteins. Goat polyclonal anti-TFII-I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect TFII-I in anti-HA immunoprecipitates.Protein Digestion—The affinity-purified proteins present in the antibody-conjugated beads were eluted using 1× SDS sample buffer; the resulting proteins were resolved in 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands specific to natural SUMO1 were excised from the gel slab. Each protein band was cut into 1-mm3 pieces and destained with 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% methanol, 50% water (v/v) three times for 10 min. Then they were washed with 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol, 40% water (v/v/v) three times for 1 h and swollen in water twice for 20 min. After that, the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY). The gel pieces were rehydrated with modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at the concentration of 10 ng/ml in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and then were subjected to trypsin proteolytic digestion at 37 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were sequentially extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 45% water, 5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) and 75% acetonitrile, 24.9% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) solutions. The peptide extracts were combined and dried in SpeedVac. The peptide samples were cleaned with a ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to HPLC/MS/MS analysis.Nano-HPLC/Mass Spectrometry for Protein Identification—HPLC/MS/MS analysis was performed in a LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nano electrospray ionization source. The electrospray source was coupled online with an Agilent 1100 series nano flow HPLC system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Two μl of the peptide solution in buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 97.9% water, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v/v)) was manually loaded into a capillary HPLC column (50-mm length × 75 μm (inner diameter), 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore diameter) packed in house with Luna C18 resin (Phenomenex, St. Torrance, CA). The peptides were eluted from the column with a gradient of 5 to 80% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 9.95% water, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v/v)) in buffer A for 10 min. The eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into the LCQ mass spectrometer. The MS/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode that determined the masses of the parent ions and fragments of the two strongest ions. All MS/MS spectra were searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence data base using the MASCOT algorithm for protein identification. The following search parameters were used in all MASCOT searches: a maximum of one missed trypsin cleavage, a maximum 4-Da error tolerance in MS, and an 0.5-Da error tolerance in MS/MS data. Protein hits with more than a three-peptide match (with each peptide score >35) were considered true protein identification. All other hits were analyzed manually to ascertain the accuracy of protein identification. In the manual analysis, the criterion used for a true identification was that the masses of all the major peaks (typically more than six peaks) in an MS/MS spectrum had to match those of the theoretically calculated fragment ions. All of the redundant proteins were removed in the protein identification list.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo assist in the affinity purification of SUMO-modified cellular proteins, we expressed HA-tagged SUMO or a non-ligatable SUMO variant, HA-SUMO-QT (4Orth K. Xu Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), in HEK-293 cells. Sumoylation is a dynamic modification controlled by the balance between the activities of SUMO ligase and SUMO protease machinery (2Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that although ectopic expression of SUMO may enrich the population of sumoylated proteins in the cell, it likely would have little effect on the specificity of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 1, HA-SUMO was incorporated into multiple high molecular weight proteins and, as expected, HA-SUMO-QT was not. Affinity purification of HA-tagged proteins from denatured whole-cell lysates recovered a complex mixture from HA-SUMO-expressing cells, whereas only the monomer was isolated from HA-SUMO-QT-expressing cells (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Affinity purification of SUMO1-modified proteins. HA-tagged SUMO1 wild-type (WT) and SUMO1-conjugation-defective (QT) were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. HA-SUMO1-conjugated proteins were affinity-purified and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described under “Materials and Methods.” The silver-stained gel shown here represents approximately one-tenth of the purified material. Protein bands in both lanes are excised for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For protein identification, we transfected ∼3 × 107 cells with HA-SUMO or HA-SUMO-QT and affinity-purified HA-conjugated proteins from denatured whole-cell lysates. Our method of lyses and precipitation made it highly unlikely that SUMO-specific proteins would be recovered as a consequence of non-covalent association with SUMO or other SUMO-modified proteins. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), excised, in-gel digested, and analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS (Fig. 3). Protein identifications that were specific to the HA-SUMO immunoprecipitate are shown in Table I.Fig. 3An example of nano-HPLC/MS/MS analysis for protein identification.

In addition, SUMO E1, E2, and E3 enzymes were identified. The latter identification likely is a consequence of the purification of proteins conjugated to HA-SUMO through thioester linkages as no reducing agents were included in the lyses or immunoprecipitation buffer. All gel slices also produced peptides corresponding to SUMO1 and SUMO2. SUMO2 is from the native pool of SUMO-like proteins and suggests that individual proteins can be modified by a mixture of SUMO family members. For novel candidate sumoylated proteins, we searched the amino acid sequences for matches to a SUMO target consensus sequence (hydrophobic KXE, where X is any amino acid) present in many but not all previously identified sumoylated proteins (Table II and Ref. 1Melchior F.

In yeast, deletion of the SUMO ortholog results in a number of chromatin-related defects including aberrant mitosis, telomere elongation, and chromosome missegregation (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a number of transcription factors and histone modification enzymes recently have been identified as SUMO targets (3Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical SUMO target PML and the previously identified DNA topoisomerase I (5Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we identified three predicted chromatin-associated proteins and the HDAC-3-associated transcription factor TFII-I (6Wen Y.D. Cress W.D. Roy A.L. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1841-1847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NXP-2 is a member of the MORC family of nuclear matrix-associated proteins (7Kimura Y. Sakai F. Nakano O. Kisaki O. Sugimoto H. Sawamura T. Sadano H. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20611-20617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In mice, MORC is required for progression through meiotic prophase (8Inoue N. Hess K.D. Moreadith R.W. Richardson L.L. Handel M.A. Watson M.L. Zinn A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Like NPX-2, zinc finger protein 262 contains a predicted chromatin-association domain (9Smedley D. Hamoudi R. Lu Y.J. Cooper C. Shipley J. Genomics. 1999; 60: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A highly related family member, znf261, is involved in chromosome translocation and may be the XQ13.1 defect responsible for X-linked retardation (10van der Maarel S.M. Scholten I.H. Huber I. Philippe C. Suijkerbuijk R.F. Gilgenkrantz S. Kere J. Cremers F.P. Ropers H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TIF1-β is a homolog of the known SUMO target TIF1-α. TIF1-α and -β have been implicated as negative regulators of nuclear hormone receptors (11Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). TIF1-β forms a complex with a histone H3-specific methyltransferase and a KRAB domain transcription factor, increasing the efficiency of transcriptional repression (12Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TFII-I has been shown to interact with PIASx-β, a SUMO E3 ligase, and HDAC-3, one of four class 1 histone deacetylases involved in transcriptional repression (13Tussie-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Seto E. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12807-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To validate modification of TFII-I, we immunoblotted the anti-HA immunoprecipitates with anti-TFII-I antibody. Unmodified TFII-I migrated at 135 kDa. As shown in Fig. 4, TFII-I in the HA-SUMO immunoprecipitate migrated much slower with a predicted 40-kDa increase in molecular weight suggesting that TFII-I is a bona fide SUMO target protein.Fig. 4Validation of TFII-I modification. An aliquot of the indicated immunoprecipitate (I.P.) was immunoblotted for the presence of TFII-I. 20 μg of HeLa cell lysate (WCl) was loaded to display the mobility of unmodified TFII-I. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In an intriguing parallel to the identification of TFII-I as a SUMO target, two proteins that share the presence of a predicted BTB/POZ domain were identified. This domain is present in a variety of proteins that interact with histone deacetylase complexes and mediate transcriptional repression (14Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27695-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A founding member of the protein family defining the BTB/POZ domains, the Drosophila protein Tramtrack 69 is a bona fide SUMO substrate (15Lehembre F. Badenhorst P. Muller S. Travers A. Schweisguth F. Dejean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).We were surprised to identify a large class of RNA polymerase III subunits as well as RNA Pol I and RNA Pol II subunits. It has been suggested that one function of SUMO may be localization of proteins at PML domains. Recently it has been reported that PML domains dynamically localize at sights of active transcription in a cell cycle-regulated manner (16Kiesslich A. von Mikecz A. Hemmerich P. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 140: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether sumoylation regulates the activity and/or subnuclear compartmentalization of RNA polymerases.Five additional novel candidate SUMO substrates were identified. Two chaperones, HSP70.1 and the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein disulfide isomerase Erp72 (17Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were isolated. NOP5 is a small ribonucleotide protein involved in ribosome biosynthesis (18Lyman S.K. Gerace L. Baserga S.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Polymyositis/scleroderma autoantigen 2 is a component of the exosome, an mRNA quality control complex (19Allmang C. Petfalski E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Mitchell P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2148-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Finally, the epidermal growth factor-like receptor ErbB3 was identified. Interestingly, this family of mitogenic receptors is known to be down-regulated by ubiquitination and degradation (20Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to examine the impact of SUMO modification on that regulatory step.In conclusion, our observations suggest that a proteomics-based approach is a viable mechanism to derive unbiased profiles of cellular sumoylated proteins. We have examined a single growth condition for this study. However, sumoylation is a dynamic process, and substrate profiles may change dramatically depending upon the cell regulatory context. The majority of candidate SUMO targets identified here appear to be involved with the regulation of chromatin and gene expression. Future studies coupling this approach with multiple cell regulatory phases likely will help reveal the major nodes of regulation impacted by dynamic SUMO modification. In addition to the well recognized role of protein phosphorylation, dynamic post-translational regulation of protein function can be achieved through a combination of a variety of other reversible covalent modifications including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. Ubiquitination and sumoylation involve the ligation of ubiquitin family small polypeptides to one or more lysines of the target protein. Ubiquitination has long been recognized as an address code that sends proteins to the proteasome for degradation. However, apart from its role in protein degradation, ubiquitination also participates in the regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, and intracellular transport.

There are three known small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TF, transcription factor; ms/ms, tandem mass spectrometry; Pol, polymerase. 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TF, transcription factor; ms/ms, tandem mass spectrometry; Pol, polymerase. family members in mammalian cells: SUMO1, -2, and -3. The biochemical pathway mediating protein sumoylation has been characterized and is analogous to that defined for ubiquitination. Namely, the combined action of three proteins (an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase) mediates isopeptide bond formation between SUMO and the target lysine on the substrate protein. Importantly, sumoylation is reversible, and a number of SUMO proteases that can cleave SUMO from specific target proteins have been identified (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 2Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem.

The bulk of present knowledge of the role of sumoylation in the regulation of cell behavior has been inferred from the nature of identified SUMO substrate proteins (3Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The list of known SUMO substrates has been compiled by a combination of serendipitous observations and direct candidate analysis. It is not at all clear how well this list reflects the contribution of dynamic sumoylation to cell regulatory events. Therefore, we wished to assess the feasibility of a proteomics-based approach for an unbiased sampling of cellular SUMO target proteins. Here, we report the use of affinity chromatography-coupled HPLC/MS/MS analysis for identification of sumoylated proteins. Our observations suggest a major role for SUMO in the modulation of proteins controlling chromatin structure and gene expression. MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of Cellular SUMO1-conjugated Proteins—HA-tagged SUMO1 and SUMO1-QT were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells. HEK-293 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Five μg of pCDNA3-HA-SUMO1 or pCDNA3-HA-SUMO1-QT were transfected per 10-cm plate of cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection, HEK-293 cells were serum-deprived for 24 h. Fifteen 10-cm plates of the transfected HEK-293 cells were used for the subsequent immunopurification of expressed HA-tagged proteins. Cells were lysed in boiling phosphate-buffered saline, 4% SDS. Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min. SDS was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5% SDS in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, with a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates again were cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min prior to immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins with Sepharose beads conjugated to monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (BAbCO) was used for immunoblot analysis of sumoylated proteins. Goat polyclonal anti-TFII-I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect TFII-I in anti-HA immunoprecipitates.Protein Digestion—The affinity-purified proteins present in the antibody-conjugated beads were eluted using 1× SDS sample buffer; the resulting proteins were resolved in 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands specific to natural SUMO1 were excised from the gel slab. Each protein band was cut into 1-mm3 pieces and destained with 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% methanol, 50% water (v/v) three times for 10 min. Then they were washed with 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol, 40% water (v/v/v) three times for 1 h and swollen in water twice for 20 min. After that, the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY). The gel pieces were rehydrated with modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at the concentration of 10 ng/ml in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and then were subjected to trypsin proteolytic digestion at 37 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were sequentially extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 45% water, 5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) and 75% acetonitrile, 24.9% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) solutions. The peptide extracts were combined and dried in SpeedVac. The peptide samples were cleaned with a ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to HPLC/MS/MS analysis.Nano-HPLC/Mass Spectrometry for Protein Identification—HPLC/MS/MS analysis was performed in a LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nano electrospray ionization source. The electrospray source was coupled online with an Agilent 1100 series nano flow HPLC system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Two μl of the peptide solution in buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 97.9% water, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v/v)) was manually loaded into a capillary HPLC column (50-mm length × 75 μm (inner diameter), 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore diameter) packed in house with Luna C18 resin (Phenomenex, St. Torrance, CA). The peptides were eluted from the column with a gradient of 5 to 80% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 9.95% water, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v/v)) in buffer A for 10 min. The eluted"

Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages with mPGES-1 deficiency were found to lose their ability to produce PGE2 upon LPS stimulation.

The cyclooxygenase product PGH2 serves as common precursor to all five major prostanoids (TXA2, PGE2, PGD2, PGI2, and PGF2α). The physiological roles of PG are both diverse and complex, with effects on kidney ion transport, vascular homeostasis, gastrointestinal protection and motility, pregnancy and parturition, sleep, and immune function (1Sugimoto Y.

In particular, the primary mediators of pain and inflammation are PGE2 and PGI2 (4Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Yamasaki A. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Aze Y. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 388: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), whereas pyresis is mediated by PGE2 through the EP3 receptor (5Ushikubi F. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Murata T.

Two major cyclooxygenase isoforms are known, each with distinct roles. Expression patterns suggest that the constitutively expressed COX-1 plays housekeeping functions, whereas the inducible COX-2 is implicated in inflammatory processes. Exceptions to this paradigm have been uncovered with observations of constitutive COX-2 expression in several neuronal structures of the brain and in the kidney (6Harris R.C. McKanna J.A. Akai Y.

The inducible nature of the mPGES-1 and COX-2 genes, together with studies of cotransfection of various COX and PGE synthase isoforms, suggest that COX-2 works more efficiently with mPGES-1, whereas COX-1 is enzymatically coupled preferentially with cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase (16Tanioka T.

Hence, it is hypothesized that mPGES-1 acts as a source of inflammatory PGE2. In support of this, thioglycollate-elicited macrophages from mPGES-1-null mice are unable to produce PGE2 following LPS treatment (23Uematsu S. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and mice lacking mPGES-1 show a strong reduction in both the incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis or LPS-induced fever (30Engblom D.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Clearly, mPGES-1 plays an important role during inflammation in vivo. On the other hand, whether mPGES-1 contributes to basal PGE2 production is unknown, and the effect of eliminating mPGES-1 activity on the production of other prostaglandins has never been assessed. Here, we addressed these issues by examining the impact of mPGES-1 deficiency on synthesis of major prostaglandins and thromboxane, both in cultured macrophages and in vivo. We find that mPGES-1 is necessary for PGE2 production, in a gene dosage-dependent manner, in resident and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, we show that mPGES-1 is responsible for PGE2 elevation is several tissues of LPS-challenged mice, and in addition, contributes significantly to basal PGE2 levels in brain, kidney, stomach, and spleen. The stomachs of mPGES-1-null mice exhibited level alterations for all prostaglandins, without changes in mRNA expression of other terminal synthases. Taken together, these data uncover an unexpected contribution of mPGES-1 to basal, non-inflammatory PGE2 and an imbalance in other prostaglandins, most noticeable in the stomach of mice deficient for mPGES-1 activity. Prostaglandins (PGs), deuterated PGs, and indomethacin were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Non-deuterated PGs were purchased as solids and reweighed using a microbalance. Human mPGES-1, COX-1, and COX-2 were expressed in baculovirus Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (32Ouellet M. Falgueyret J.P. Ear P.H. Pen A. Mancini J.A. Riendeau D.

Mice (129P2 × C57Bl/6)-mPGES-1+/+, -mPGES-1+/-, and -mPGES-1-/- were bred at Taconic Farms and housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All procedures were carried out at Merck Frosst under appropriate Animal Care Committee approval in strict accordance to Merck and Co. animal care policies. Only males were used. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of LPS (1.2 mg/ml; Salmonella minnesota Re595, Sigma-Aldrich) or saline, and tissues were collected 4 h post-dosing. Tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C until processed. Stomachs, brains, and spleens were cut in two symmetric sections, and the two halves were kept separately for RNA and prostaglandin isolation. Both lungs and both kidneys were collected from each mouse, with one serving for prostaglandin and microsomal protein preparation, and the other serving for RNA extraction. Macrophage Preparations—Five animals each for mPGES-1 wild type, heterozygote, and null mice were used as macrophage source and treated individually to account for possible differences caused by their mixed genetic background. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 6% thioglycollate media. Peritoneal lavages with PBS supplemented with 10 units/ml heparin were performed 3-4 days following injection to recover thioglycollate-elicited macrophages. Resident macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage of naïve animals. Cells were centrifuged and suspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), penicillin 100 units/ml, and streptomycin 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Cells recovered from individual mice were plated in triplicate in 96-well dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well and allowed to adhere for1hina humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were eliminated by two PBS washes. Macrophages were incubated with culture media alone (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FBS and antibiotics) or culture media containing LPS (S. minnesota Re-595, Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 ng/ml for 24 h. Following the incubation, the culture media was collected and assayed for PGE2, PGF2α, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1α by EIA (Assay Design) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some results obtained by EIA were subsequently confirmed by LC-MS analysis, which also allowed dosing of PGD2. For Western blotting, peritoneal lavage cells were plated in 48-well dishes at a density of 5 × 105/well and treated as described above. Adherent macrophages were washed with PBS and lysed with 40 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Half the volume of pooled samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and processed by Western blotting. Tissue Processing—Tissues were homogenized at 4 °C in PBS supplemented with 1× of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture and 20 μm indomethacin with a Polytron and sonicated for 30 s. The homogenates were first centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for protein determination and for PG measurements. A portion of the supernatant was used to prepare microsomes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). Protein content was measured by the Bradford assay (BioRad) using bovine-γ-globulin as standard. Fractions were kept at -80 °C until further analysis. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Solubilized microsomes (50 μg) and macrophage extracts were resolved by electrophoresis in 10-20% SDS-Tris-glycine pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Quantitative Western blotting was performed with purified human COX-1, COX-2, and mPGES-1 protein standards (1, 3, and 5 ng of each) that were loaded on each gel for standardization. The following antibodies were used: anti-human mPGES-1 (Cayman #160140, 1:300), anti-COX-2 (MF243, Merck Frosst, 1:3000), anti-COX-1 (Cayman #160110, 1:500), and anti-β-actin (Sigma #A-5310, 1:5000) in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat skim milk. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences NA934 and NA931) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Immunodetection was performed by chemiluminescence using Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Detection and quantitative analysis were performed using a Fuji Film LAS-1000 charge-coupled device and Image Gauge software. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Prostaglandins Measurements—PGE2, PGF2α, PGD2, 6-keto-PGF1α, and TXB2 were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Samples (100 μl) were protein-precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile (150 μl) containing deuterated prostaglandins (2 ng each) as internal standards (deuterated PGE2 served as internal standard for both PGE2 and PGD2). Samples were vortexed and centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate. Samples (50 μl) were injected onto a 4.6-× 150-mm YMC ODS-A column using a Shimadzu SIL-HTc autosampler and LC-10ADVP pumps. Prostaglandins were eluted at 1 ml/min using a linear gradient from 10 to 90% acetonitrile versus 0.1% formic acid over 10 min. Detection of prostaglandins was achieved using a Sciex API-4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Analysis was carried out using negative ion electrospray with 1 ml/min entering the source. The source was operated at 500 °C, electrospray voltage was -4500 V, and gas 1 and gas 2 were 60 and 50, respectively. Each prostaglandin was optimized individually for parent mass and fragment mass sensitivity. Real-Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, tissues were homogenized in 15 volumes of TRIzol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were then mixed with 0.2 volume of chloroform, incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 3300 × g for 20 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube containing an equal volume of isopropanol, and RNA was precipitated at 25 °C for 5 min before centrifugation at 3300 × g for 20 min (4 °C). The RNA pellet was washed once with 75% EtOH before resuspension in RNase-free water. Between 50 and 100 μg of each RNA sample were further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment according to the RNeasy mini kit instruction manual. Purified RNA was quantified, and RNA integrity was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer apparatus. Each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit (Applied Biosystems), with 250 ng of total RNA per 100 μl of reverse transcription reaction mix. Enough reverse transcription reaction was generated to provide material for amplification of at least seven different messages in duplicates. Control reactions in the absence of Multiscribe reverse transcriptase were performed to test for genomic DNA contamination. For TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR, primer annealing, transcription and reaction termination were done 25 °C, 48 °C, and 95 °C for 10 s, 30 s, and 5 min, respectively. The sequences of the primers and probes used are shown in Table II. The 18 S rRNA primers and probe set was purchased from Applied Biosystems. All TaqMan hydrolysis probes except for the 18 S rRNA probe consisted of a gene-specific oligonucleotide dually labeled with a 6-carboxyfluorescein reporter dye at the 5′-end and a Black Hole Quencher-1 dye at the 3′-end. The 18 S rRNA probe contained a VIC reporter dye at the 5′-end and a 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine quencher dye at the 3′-end. Primer specificity for all amplifications was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 μl of cDNA, 25 μl of TaqMan PCR Universal Mix (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm forward and reverse primers, and 300 nm TaqMan probe. PCR for the 18 S rRNA was performed in a similar way, except that 2.5 μl of the commercial primers and probe mix was used. The cycling parameters consisted of 2 min of uracil removal incubation at 50 °C, 10 min polymerase activation at 95 °C, 50 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Every reaction set included a reaction in which water was used instead of cDNA to serve as a control for DNA contamination and probe degradation. Quantification was performed as described in User Bulletin 2 of the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system using the comparative Ct method.Table IIOligonucleotide primer pairs and probes used for quantitative RT-PCRGeneAccession no.PrimersProbeCOX-2M64291Forward: 5′-CAGCCAGGCAGCAAATCC-3′5′-TTCCAATCCATGTCAAAACCGTG-3′Reverse: 5′-TCAAATCCTGTGCTCATACATTCC-3′mPGES-1AB041997Forward: 5′-CCAGTATTACAGGAGTGACCCAGAT-3′5′-TGGAGCGCTGCCTCAGAGCCC-3′Reverse: 5′-GGAAAGGATAGATTGTCTCCATGTC-3′mPGES-2AK024100Forward: 5′-TGGTGTGCTGCGAGTGATG-3′5′-CCTTCGACGACCTGATGCGACACTC-3′Reverse: 5′-CAGGTACCAAGGCTGGATGTG-3′L-PGDSD83329Forward: 5′-AAGAAAGCTGTATTGTATATGTGCAAGAC-3′5′-TAGCCCCCTCCACAGAAGGCG-3′Reverse: 5′-TTCCTGAGGAAGGTAGAGGTGAG-3′PGISNM_008968Forward: 5′-TCACCACGCACCCATGAG-3′5′-CAGGCCCAAGATCGTGTCCACTCA-3′Reverse: 5′-TGTCGGAAGGTATGGAAAACATC-3′TXASL18868Forward: 5′-TCCTCTTCTGAGTGCACAAAGG-3′5′-CCACCCCAAAGGTGCCATCCTACC-3′Reverse: 5′-TTTCATCCACAGTGAAAGGCTTAG-3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Standard one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare multiple groups. Data was log-scaled so that underlying assumptions of equal variance and normality were better satisfied. All comparisons were deemed statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Effect of Deletion of mPGES-1 on PGE2 Release by Macrophages—Production of PGE2 by LPS-stimulated thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages was shown previously to depend on the expression of mPGES-1 (23Uematsu S. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because macrophages vary widely in their morphology and cytokine-producing properties, we asked whether mPGES-1 would play an equally essential role in a different macrophage type. To that end, we compared PGE2 accumulation in the media of thioglycollate-elicited and resident peritoneal macrophages from mPGES-1 +/+, +/-, and -/- mice and quantified COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression in each of these cells, in the absence or presence of LPS stimulation. As expected, LPS-stimulated mPGES-1+/+ thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages produced PGE2 in amounts that exceeded by 10-fold PGE2 released by resting cells. LPS failed to significantly increase PGE2 output by mPGES-1-/- macrophages, whereas, interestingly, the amount of PGE2 released by mPGES-1+/- cells was approximately half that of wild type cells (Fig. 1A). Unstimulated macrophages produced low levels of PGE2 with no clear variation attributed to genotype. A similar experiment was performed with resident peritoneal macrophages. LPS treatment resulted in a 700-fold increase in accumulated PGE2 over a 24-h period, and per cell, resident macrophages produced ∼10-fold more PGE2 than thioglycollate-elicited macrophages. Loss of one mPGES-1 allele led to a 50% reduction in PGE2 release, whereas complete absence reduced PGE2 output by 96%. Despite this large reduction, LPS treatment of mPGES-1-/- resident macrophages resulted in a 20-fold increase in accumulated PGE2 compared with untreated mPGES-1-/- cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, a small portion of PGE2 was produced in the absence of mPGES-1 activity. Taken together, these results argue for an important and rate-limiting role for mPGES-1 in PGE2 synthesis by macrophages and uncover a minor component of LPS-stimulated PGE2 production independent of mPGES-1 in resident macrophages. mPGES-1 and COX-2 Expression Both Regulate Production of PGE2—To better understand the mPGES-1 gene dosage effect on PGE2 release, we quantified mPGES-1 and COX-2 protein by Western blotting in resident and elicited macrophages from wild type, heterozygous, and mPGES-1-null mice. At rest, both macrophage types from wild type and heterozygous mice expressed low levels of mPGES-1 protein. LPS stimulation for 24 h increased mPGES-1 protein expression, with levels in heterozygous cells reaching only half of those found in wild type cells (Fig. 2, A and C). COX-2 protein expression was strongly induced by LPS and was not significantly different in wild type and heterozygous macrophages. Interestingly, LPS-induced COX-2 expression in resident and thioglycollate-elicited mPGES-1-/- macrophages was 2- to 3-fold greater than the levels induced in wild type cells (p < 0.05, Fig. 2, B and D). Similar results for mPGES-1 and COX-2 were obtained with 6 h of LPS stimulation (data not shown). The quantitation of mPGES-1 and COX-2 revealed several interesting findings. LPS-stimulated wild type resident and elicited macrophages expressed similar amounts of mPGES-1 protein per cell. However, resident macrophages released 10-times more PGE2, which coincided with a 10-fold greater COX-2 protein content. Both macrophage types showed a 50% decrease of PGE2 accumulation when the mPGES-1 protein content was reduced by half in heterozygous cells (Table I). These results suggest that COX-2 and mPGES-1 together regulate total PGE2 release, with COX-2 being mainly responsible for the difference in PGE2 output between elicited and resident cells.Table ICOX-2 and mPGES-1 monomers in LPS-stimulated macrophagesCOX-2mPGES-1PGE2a24 h media accumulation per 200,000 plated cellsMolecules/cellng/mlGenotype (thioglyco"
https://openalex.org/W2021788902,"The <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> homologs, Pkh1/2p, of the mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) regulate the Pkc1-MAP kinase cascade and the partially parallel Ypk1/2p pathway(s) that control growth and cell integrity. Mammalian PDK1 is regulated by 3-phosphoinositides, whereas Pkh1/2p are regulated by sphingolipid long-chain bases (LCBs). Recently Pkh1/2p were found to complex with two related proteins, Pil1p (Ygr086) and Lsp1p (Ypl004). Because these two proteins are not related to any known protein we sought to characterize their functions. We show that Pkh1p phosphorylates both proteins <i>in vitro</i> in a reaction that is only weakly regulated by LCBs. In contrast, LCBs inhibit phosphorylation of Pil1p by Pkh2p, whereas LCBs stimulate phosphorylation of Lsp1p by Pkh2p. We find that Pil1p and Lsp1p down-regulate resistance to heat stress and, specifically, that they down-regulate the activity of the Pkc1p-MAP and Ypk1p pathways during heat stress. Pil1p and Lsp1p are thus the first proteins identified as regulators of Pkh1/2p. An unexpected finding was that the level of Ypk1p is greatly reduced in <i>pkc1</i>Δ cells, indicating that Pkc1p controls the level of Ypk1p. Homologs of Pil1p and Lsp1p are widespread in nature, and our results suggest that they may be negative regulators of PDK-like protein kinases and their downstream cellular pathways that control cell growth and survival."

Therefore, GABAA receptors may possess two types of etomidate sites: high affinity GABA-modulating sites and low affinity channel-activating sites. However, GABA modulation and direct activation share stereoselectivity for the (R)(+)-etomidate isomer and display parallel dependence on GABAA β subunit isoforms, suggesting that these two actions may be mediated by a single class of etomidate site(s) that exert one or more molecular effects. In this study, we assessed GABA modulation by etomidate using leftward shifts of electrophysiological GABA concentration responses in cells expressing human α1β2γ2L receptors. Etomidate at up to 100 μm reduced GABA EC50 values by over 100-fold but without apparent saturation, indicating the absence of high affinity etomidate sites. In experiments using a partial agonist, P4S, etomidate both reduced EC50 and increased maximal efficacy, demonstrating that etomidate shifts the GABAA receptor gating equilibrium toward open states. Results were quantitatively analyzed using equilibrium receptor gating models, wherein a postulated class of equivalent etomidate sites both directly activates receptors and enhances agonist gating. A Monod-Wyman-Changeux co-agonist mechanism with two equivalent etomidate sites that allosterically enhance GABAA receptor gating independently of agonist binding most simply accounts for direct activation and agonist modulation. This model also correctly predicts the actions of etomidate on GABAA receptors containing a point mutation that increases constitutive gating activity.

Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Clinical concentrations of these anesthetics enhance GABAA receptor activity (15Carlson B.X. Hales T.G. Olsen R.W. Yaksh T.L. Lynch III, C. Zapol W.M. Maze M. Biebuyck J.F. Saidman L.J. Anesthesia: Biologic Foundations. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 259-275Google Scholar), which is observed electrophysiologically as increased multichannel responses to low GABA concentrations (e.g. EC5 or EC10). Responses to maximally activating GABA concentrations are either not or weakly enhanced by general anesthetics. As a result, general anesthetics shift GABA concentration-response relationships leftward (reduce EC50), which could be caused by either enhanced GABA binding to agonist sites or to enhanced gating of ligand-bound receptors (16Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 17O'Shea S.M. Wong L.C. Harrison N.L. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Supra-clinical concentrations of general anesthetics can also directly activate GABAA receptors (agonism or GABA-mimetic activity) (18Hall A.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med.

The widely different concentrations of general anesthetics that induce GABA modulation versus direct activation suggest that there may be two distinct types of sites on GABAA receptors as follows: high affinity sites that enhance apparent GABA sensitivity, and low affinity sites that directly activate receptors. Alternative mechanisms, postulating a single class of sites that change affinity for general anesthetic depending on the receptor state, can also account for multiple actions. These unified mechanisms fall into two generic classes: orthosteric partial agonism (where anesthetics act via the GABA sites) and allosteric co-agonism (where anesthetics act via sites distinct from GABA sites). In one electrophysiological study, three effects of n-octanol on α1β2γ2S GABAA receptors, GABA modulation, direct activation, and inhibition, were explained by partial agonism (21Kurata Y. Marszalec W. Yeh J.Z. Narahashi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a study of the effects of pentobarbital on brain synaptosomal GABAA channels, Cash and Subbarao (22Cash D.J. Subbarao K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) considered an allosteric co-agonist mechanism where distinct pentobarbital and GABA-binding sites couple independently to the receptor open-closed equilibrium via Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosterism (preferential binding to the open state). These different mechanisms predict different effects of general anesthetic on experimental parameters that reflect the equilibria between closed and open receptors. If two distinct classes of saturable sites have sufficiently different affinities for an anesthetic, then reliable measures of GABA modulation should display maximal effects at anesthetic concentrations below those that induce maximal direct activation. Partial agonist and co-agonist mechanisms also predict different relationships between GABA EC50 and anesthetic concentration. Orthosteric partial agonism predicts that as general anesthetic concentration rises, GABA EC50 will at first decrease (positive modulation) but then increase again as competition for occupation of GABA-binding sites develops. In contrast, allosteric co-agonism predicts that GABA EC50 will only decrease, approaching a minimum in the same anesthetic concentration range where direct activation reaches a maximum. Furthermore, models that postulate a single class of sites mediating multiple anesthetic actions predict that structurally similar anesthetics (e.g. stereoisomers) will likely display similar relative potencies for their multiple actions. The intravenous general anesthetic etomidate (ethyl-1-(α-methylbenzyl)imidazole-5-carboxylate) presents several advantages for distinguishing between possible mechanisms of GABAA receptor modulation. It is a very potent clinical anesthetic, causing loss of righting responses in tadpoles at about 3 μm (19Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A.

Anesthesiology. 1998; 88: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and loss of responsiveness in humans at about 2 μm (23Arden J.R. Holley F.O. Stanski D.R. Anesthesiology. 1986; 65: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Modulation of apparent GABA affinity for GABAA receptors (i.e. Kd or EC50) is seen with etomidate concentrations as low as 0.1 μm (9Uchida I. Kamatchi G. Burt D. Yang J. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 185: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Yang J. Uchida I. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Etomidate alone at concentrations above 10 μm directly activates GABAA receptors, exhibiting maximal efficacy up to 50% relative to GABA, depending on subunit combination (9Uchida I. Kamatchi G. Burt D. Yang J. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 185: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Hill-Venning C. Belelli D. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, etomidate contains a chiral center. Both direct activation of GABAA receptors and modulation of GABA responses by (R)(+)-etomidate is seen at about 20 times lower concentrations than with (S)(-)-etomidate, closely paralleling the relative anesthetic potency of these enantiomers in animals (19Husain S.S.

Stereoselectivity also constitutes the strongest evidence for etomidate-binding sites within the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex (26Belelli D. Muntoni A.L. Merrywest S.D. Gentet L.J. Casula A.

In this study, we examined the relationship between etomidate-induced direct activation of GABAA receptors and GABA modulation assessed with EC50 shifts. We also used a partial agonist, P4S, to investigate whether etomidate-induced leftward shift is due to enhancement of agonist-receptor binding or channel gating. Activity was measured electrophysiologically in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells expressing human α1β2γ2L GABAA receptors. Results obtained over a wide range of etomidate concentrations were comparatively analyzed using equilibrium partial agonist and co-agonist models that account for multiple etomidate effects via a single class of GABAA receptor-binding sites. Finally, we tested whether an MWC co-agonist model predicts etomidate effects on mutant GABAA receptors characterized by a high degree of spontaneous activity.

Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were incubated at 17 °C for 48–144 h before electrophysiological experiments. Maintenance of HEK293 cells (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and methods for transient transfection of GABAA receptors have been described (29Scheller M. Forman S.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8411-8421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with GABAA subunit cDNA mixtures at a ratio of 1α:1β:5γ, along with a marker plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein. Chemicals—All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. GABA was stored at -80 °C as an aqueous 1 m stock solution, and aliquots were thawed and diluted into electrophysiology solution each day. P4S was freshly prepared each day as a 1 m stock. (R)(+)-etomidate (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford, OH) solutions were also prepared daily. Two Microelectrode Oocyte Electrophysiology—Oocyte electrophysiological measurements were carried out at 21–23 °C in ND-96 solution (in mm: NaCl 96, KCl 2, MgCl2 0.8, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, pH 7.5) as described previously (19Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Oocytes were placed in a custom-built low volume (20 μl) flow chamber, and currents were elicited with ND-96 solutions containing etomidate, GABA (± etomidate), or P4S (± etomidate), delivered by gravity from glass reservoirs via polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and computer-actuated solenoid valves. Half-maximal agonist concentrations (EC50 values) were assessed both in the absence and presence of (R)(+)-etomidate, in individual oocytes. Every other recording used a maximal activating GABA concentration (1–10 mm) for normalization of oocyte responses, which can change over time. Oocytes were washed for at least 5 min in ND-96 between experiments. After completion of a control agonist concentration-response study, ND-96 was replaced with ND-96 plus (R)(+)-etomidate. Etomidate at up to 32 μm induced minimal run-down of oocyte currents and was continuously present during the agonist concentration-response experiments. Oocyte currents were elicited with agonist plus etomidate alternating with 1 mm GABA plus etomidate for normalization. Maximal responses in the absence and presence of etomidate were also compared, enabling all currents from a single oocyte to be normalized to the same standard response in 1–10 mm GABA alone. In the continuous presence of 100 μm etomidate, significant run-down of oocyte current responses was observed, which we supposed was due to GABAA receptor desensitization. Therefore, oocytes were bathed in ND-96, and 100 μm etomidate was applied for 30 s prior to GABA plus 100 μm etomidate exposure. Oocytes were washed for 15 min in ND-96 before subsequent experiments. HEK293 Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Experiments were performed at 21–23 °C as described previously (29Scheller M. Forman S.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8411-8421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular solution contained (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.2, and patch pipettes were filled with intracellular solution (in mm: 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, pH 7.3). Open pipette tip resistance ranged from 2 to 5 megohms. Transfected cells were identified by green fluorescent protein fluorescence. Membrane patches with greater than 1 gigohm seal resistance were excised in the outside-out configuration. For whole-cell recordings, small cells (<10 μm diameter) were lifted from coverslips, and pipette capacitance and series resistance compensation were applied. Patches and cells were voltage-clamped at -50 mV during current recordings. Rapid application of solutions was achieved using a piezo-driven quad (2 × 2) capillary tube with up to four flowing solutions (30Forman S.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One channel of the quad tube was reserved for external solution, and an adjacent channel contained external solution with 1 mm GABA as a normalization standard. The other two channels, each fed by multiple upstream reservoirs via selector valves, contained extracellular solutions with GABA, etomidate, or combinations of the two. When responses to GABA plus etomidate were studied, the patch or cell was first exposed to etomidate alone for 0.1–0.5 s before subsequent exposure to the combination. To both normalize responses among cells and to correct for run-down, every second or third trace was a control current elicited with 1 mm GABA. Cells and patches were washed in external buffer for 10–60 s between experiments. Solution exchange times were under 1 ms, measured by open pipette junction currents. Whole-cell solution exchange times, estimated from currents elicited with 0.1–1 mm GABA, were 2–5 ms. Analysis of GABA Concentration Responses—Data analysis was performed offline. For responses elicited with GABA alone, peak currents were corrected by subtracting the base-line leak current, which was usually below 0.1 μA in oocytes. Corrected peak currents were normalized to the average of pre- and post-control maximal GABA responses measured at 1–10 mm, ImaxGABA. Direct activation by etomidate was estimated by subtracting the average leak current from sweeps where there was no etomidate from the average leak when etomidate was present in the same oocyte. Oocyte current responses elicited with etomidate plus GABA were corrected by subtracting only the average leak in buffer (i.e. the directly activated component of the current was not subtracted). Leak-corrected responses were normalized to the average of pre- and post-control responses to etomidate plus maximal activating GABA (1–10 mm), ImaxGABA+Eto. Scaling of responses in the presence versus absence of etomidate was achieved by multiplying by the ratio of currents elicited with maximal GABA plus etomidate and with maximal GABA alone, ImaxGABA+Eto/ImaxGABA. At etomidate concentrations below 100 μm, inhibition by etomidate was minimal, and ImaxGABA+Eto was larger than ImaxGABA in most oocytes. In the absence of etomidate, α1β2γ2L GABAA receptors display negligible spontaneous activity. Therefore, normalized data from individual oocytes were fitted by non-linear least squares with Equation 1 (Hill or logistic), where EC500 is the half-maximal activating GABA concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient, IGABAImax⁡GABA=11+(EC500/[GABA])n(Eq. 1) Normalized GABA concentration responses recorded in the presence of etomidate were fitted with a similar logistic equation (Equation 2), where the minimum was constrained to equal the normalized directly activated current, IEto/ImaxGABA, IGABA+EtoImaxGABA=ImaxGABA+EtoImaxGABA−IEtoImaxGABA1+(EC50Eto/[GABA])n+IEtoImaxGABA(Eq. 2) The ratios of EC50 values measured in the presence and absence of etomidate (left-shift ratios), EC50Eto/EC500, were calculated for data recorded in individual oocytes. Determination of Model Parameters—By using equations defining equilibrium Popen as functions of GABA and etomidate concentrations, parameters for the partial agonist model (Fig. 5) and allosteric co-agonist models (Fig. 6) were independently fitted to pooled concentration-response data from oocytes. Data for these fits were converted to estimated Popen by re-normalizing to a maximal open probability (Popenmax) of 0.85 in the presence of GABA alone. Popenmax was based both on published single channel estimates (31Weiss D.S. Magleby K.L. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1314-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 33Steinbach J.H. Akk G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 715-733Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and on the degree of current enhancement observed in the presence of high GABA plus etomidate. Because GABA EC500 values varied among individual oocytes, we fitted GABA parameters for the models to a restricted set of GABA concentration responses from 10 oocytes characterized by EC500 values between 32 and 40 μm. Etomidate direct activation parameters were fitted to the oocyte data shown in Fig. 1 (right panel).Fig. 6An MWC co-agonist model for etomidate modulation of GABAA receptor gating. A, this model is based on Cash and Subbarao (22Cash D.J. Subbarao K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and depicts allosteric co-agonism with two equivalent GABA sites and two equivalent etomidate sites. Related models with different numbers of etomidate sites (nE) would be depicted with nE + 1 vertically stacked layers. All models have five free parameters. Basal equilibrium between unliganded closed (R) and open (O) states is described by L0 = [R]/[O]. GABA binding (horizontal arrows) to closed states is described by microscopic dissociation constant KG, and efficacy per GABA is c. Etomidate binding (vertical arrows) to closed states is described by microscopic dissociation constant KE, and efficacy per etomidate is d. Open states are stabilized by GABA and/or etomidate binding, because c < 1 and d < 1. Closed-open transitions (diagonal arrows) between states in which GABA and/or etomidate sites are occupied are labeled with equilibrium constants. B, GABA EC50 shows an inverse square root dependence on direct activation at high etomidate, as predicted by the co-agonist model. Points represent results from individual oocytes exposed to directly activating etomidate concentrations: 10 μm (squares; n = 10), 32 μm (circles; n = 5), and 100 μm (triangles; n = 5). The slope of a linear least squares fit to the log transformed data is -0.48 ± 0.072 (R = -0.84; p < 0.0001). Back extrapolation to the average control EC50 (36 μm) results in an estimate of basal receptor activation: Po = 1.4 × 10-5. C, optimal parameters fitted to oocyte data for the nE = 2 model are reported in Table I. Model-simulated GABA concentration responses are shown for etomidate concentrations between 0 and 1000 μm (compare with Fig. 3, top). D, model predictions (lines) are overdrawn on re-normalized oocyte data for both EC5 enhancement by etomidate (squares; data from Husain et al. (19Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F.

Different lines represent models with different nE values: 1, long dash; 2, solid; 3, short dash; 4, dot-dash; 5, dotted. E, model predictions for EC50 ratios (lines representing models with different nE values are as in D) are overdrawn on oocyte data from Fig. 3, bottom. F, error analysis comparing the predictions of models with different nE values to oocyte results. Sum-of-squares deviations are plotted for EC5 enhancement (squares), direct activation (circles), and EC50 ratios (triangles). G, modeling the effects of etomidate on P4S-activated currents. Data from Fig. 4, bottom, were re-normalized assuming GABA PmaxGABA (dashed line). The line overlaying control data (squares) represents a fit to Equation 3 (substituting KP for KG), with L0 = 70,000 and nE = 2. Fitted KP = 44 ± 10 μm and c = 0.0055 ± 0.0017. The line overlaying the data with 3.2 μm etomidate (circles) was calculated using Equation 5 with L0 = 70,000, KP = 44 μm, c = 0.0055, KE = 35 μm, d = 0.0077, and nE = 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 1Direct activation of α1β2γ2L GABAA receptor-mediated currents by etomidate. Left, traces show currents recorded from an HEK cell patch. Three traces were activated using etomidate (concentrations labeled in μm). For normalization, a trace activated with 1 mm GABA is also shown. A notable difference between etomidate-activated currents from oocytes and HEK293 membrane patches is that patch currents displayed larger “surge” currents, evident after discontinuing etomidate above 100 μm. This indicates the presence of an inhibitory etomidate action that rapidly reverses before deactivation is complete. Right, etomidate direct activation responses from HEK293 cells and patches (open circles) and oocytes (solid squares) are plotted. Oocyte data include some previously published data (19Husain S.S.

Peak responses to etomidate (surge current peak was used, if present) were normalized to maximal GABA currents (1 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For the partial agonist model, Equation 4 from Kurata et al. (21Kurata Y. Marszalec W. Yeh J.Z. Narahashi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was fitted to estimated Popen versus [GABA] data to derive KG (the microscopic GABA dissociation constant), a (the binding allosteric factor for GABA), and χG (the gating efficacy with both sites occupied by GABA). An analogous equation was fitted to estimated direct activation Popen versus [etomidate] data to derive KE (the microscopic etomidate dissociation constant), b (the binding allosteric factor for etomidate), and χE (the gating efficacy with both sites occupied by etomidate). These six parameters were used in Equation 6 from Kurata et al. (21Kurata Y. Marszalec W. Yeh J.Z. Narahashi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to generate Popen values for combinations of GABA and etomidate. The remaining model parameter, χGE (gating efficacy with one agonist site occupied by GABA and the other site occupied by etomidate), was varied manually, and EC50Eto/EC500 ratios were derived from model-generated Popen versus [GABA] curves for etomidate concentrations of 0.32, 1, 3.2, 10, 32, and 100 μm (Fig. 4, bottom). Least squares analysis was applied to log-transformed model versus experimental EC50Eto/EC500 ratios to determine the optimal χGE value.

Using maize mitochondrial mutants, we show that permanent mitochondrial deficiencies trigger novel Ca2+-independent signaling pathways, leading to constitutive expression of genes for molecular chaperones, heat shock proteins (HSPs) of different classes. The signaling to activate hsp genes appears to originate from a reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Upon depolarization of mitochondrial membranes in transient assays, gene induction for mitochondrial HSPs occurred more rapidly than that for cytosolic HSPs. We also demonstrate that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans transcription of hsp genes can be induced by RNA interference of nuclear respiratory genes. In both organisms, activation of hsp genes in response to mitochondrial impairment is distinct from their responses to heat shock and is not associated with oxidative stress. Thus, mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling to express a hsp gene network is apparently a widespread retrograde mechanism to facilitate cell defense and survival.

In response to transient stress, impairment of mitochondrial function is a key event (1Jones A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) that leads to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; HSP, heat shock protein; sHSP, small HSP; NCS, non-chromosomal stripe; RNAi, RNA interference; AOX, alternative oxidase; ETC, electron transfer chain. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; HSP, heat shock protein; sHSP, small HSP; NCS, non-chromosomal stripe; RNAi, RNA interference; AOX, alternative oxidase; ETC, electron transfer chain. and, if oxidative damage is severe, to execution of programmed cell death. In contrast, mitochondrial mutants acclimated to permanent respiratory deficiencies do not develop oxidative stress and have enhanced tolerance to apoptotic stimuli and environmental stresses (2Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1212-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). It has been shown that osteosarcoma ρ0 cell lines devoid of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are more resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis than are the parental ρ+ lines (2Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We found that maize mutants with mtDNA deletions did not undergo oxidative stress despite severe respiratory deficiencies (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, similar mitochondrial mutants in tobacco appeared to develop higher tolerance to biotic (viral infection) and abiotic (ozone) stresses (4Dutilleul C. Garmier M. Noctor G. Mathieu C. Chetrit P. Foyer C.H. De Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1212-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the enhanced stress resistance of mitochondrial mutants might be contributed by the up-regulation of hsp genes. It was previously demonstrated that cytosolic HSP70 can preserve mitochondrial capacity to maintain membrane potential under oxidative conditions (5Polla B.S. Kantengwa S. Francois D. Salvioli S. Franceschi C. Marsac C. Cossarizza A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6458-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Cytosolic HSP70 can also prevent mitochondria from inducing both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways of programmed cell death (6Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 7Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). One of the α-crystallin type small HSPs (sHSPs) appears to block cytochrome c release from mitochondria (8Paul C. Manero F. Gonin S. Kretz-Remy C. Virot S. Arrigo A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 816-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thus, some HSPs exert anti-apoptotic effects in addition to their well documented functions (9Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar) in preventing aggregation of non-native proteins (sHSPs) and promoting ATP-dependent renaturation (HSP70). In plants, along with diverse sHSPs (10Waters E.R. Lee G.J. Vierling E. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 325-338Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar), another chaperone, ClpB/HSP101, is crucial for recovery after severe damage to cellular proteins (11Queitsch C. Hong S.-W. Vierling E. Lindquist S. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Its yeast homolog, HSP104, resolves cytosolic aggregates of denatured proteins (12Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) in a functional complex with SSA1 (HSP70) and Ydj1 (HSP40). To test whether permanent mitochondrial respiratory defects affect expression of hsp genes, we use two experimental models: (i) maize respiratory-deficient NCS (non-chromosomal stripe; reviewed in Ref. 13Newton K.J. Gabay-Laughnan S. Singh K.K. Mitochondrial DNA Mutations in Aging, Disease, and Cancer. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 365-381Crossref Google Scholar) mutants with defined deletions in mtDNA (14Marienfeld J.R. Newton K.J.

Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 107-113PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with loss of function of different nuclear respiratory genes mediated by RNA interference. In both cases, we show that in response to mitochondrial impairment activation of a number of hsp genes occurs, including heat-inducible, constitutive, and cryptic ones. We present evidence that the primary signaling may originate from a reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and does not involve either Ca2+- or ROS-dependent pathways. Altogether, these features characterize the mitochondria-dependent expression of hsp genes as a novel physiologically important process of retrograde regulation. Plant Material—Maize mutants carrying maternally inherited deletions in mtDNA were analyzed. In NCS2, the nad4 gene is partially deleted and mutant plants are deficient in the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the respiratory complex I (14Marienfeld J.R. Newton K.J. Genetics. 1994; 138: 855-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NCS4 deletion removes the 5′-end of the mitochondrial gene encoding the RPS3 ribosomal protein and is associated with reduced levels of mitochondrial translation (15Hunt M.D. Newton K.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Newton K.J. Mariano J.M. Gibson C.M. Kuzmin E.V. Gabay Laughnan S. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 5′-end of the cox2 gene in NCS6 mutants causes a deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (17Lauer M.K.C. Newton K. Gabay-Laughnan S. Laughnan J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 107-113PubMed Google Scholar, 18Newton K.J. Knudsen C. Gabay-Laughnan S. Laughnan J.R. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 107-113PubMed Google Scholar), the respiratory complex IV. Mutant plants are heteroplasmic for the mutations, so plants with the most defective phenotypes (with very high levels of mutant mtDNA) (13Newton K.J. Gabay-Laughnan S. Singh K.K. Mitochondrial DNA Mutations in Aging, Disease, and Cancer. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 365-381Crossref Google Scholar) were used for analysis. Such highly mutant individuals are rare, and sufficient amounts of material for analysis could be collected from mature plants only. Control plants with normal phenotype were chosen within the same or closely related NCS families (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Heat shock experiments were performed with seedlings, a developmental stage at which the temperature of the whole maize plant can be reliably controlled. 4-day-old maize seedlings (genotypes A619 and B37N) were incubated at 42 °C as described previously (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the roots were used for further analysis. Treatments with inhibitors were performed using 4-day-old normal maize seedlings (genotype B37N) or seedlings with T type cytoplasmic male sterility (B37T) according to Ref. 3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar. Methomyl and chloramphenicol were applied at final concentrations of 7.5 mm and 50 μg/ml, respectively. After 24-h incubations, all seedlings looked normal and retained undamaged mitochondria, because no loss of the outer mitochondrial membrane or mitochondrial matrix content was detected by Western analysis (data not shown). Identification of Maize hsp Coding Sequences—Protein sequences were used to query plant genomic and Expressed Sequence Tag data bases with the tBLASTn algorithm. Arabidopsis homologs of the yeast SSA1-type HSP70 were identified and then used as queries to search the maize EST data bases (Maize Genome Data base, www.zmdb.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/main/ZMDB, and the TIGR Eukaryotic Gene Ortholog (EGO) data base, www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/ego/orth_search.shtml). The maize orthologs of Arabidopsis mitochondrial HSP70s (19Sung D.Y. Vierling E. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) were found by homology in the N-terminal protein sequences. The identification of heat-inducible and HS non-responsive maize orthologs of HSP70s was confirmed by gene-specific hybridization of maize total RNA from heat-shocked seedlings. In rice and maize, mitochondrial HSP22s were searched for in the TIGR EGO data base and in the grass genome data base GRAMENE (www.gramene.org/db/searches/blast). The potential mitochondrial targeting of the candidate precursors was evaluated using the Predotar program (www.inra.fr/predotar), and phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial HSP22s was performed by CLUSTALW alignment (clustalw.genome.ad.jp) of the predicted full-length amino acid sequences. Northern Analysis of Maize Transcripts—Isolation of total RNAs from maize tissues and RNA blot hybridizations was performed as described previously (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Gene-specific maize riboprobes were prepared from RT-PCR-amplified total maize (B73N) RNA, using 3′- or 5′-untranslated region-specific primers (Supplemental Table I). To obtain the hsp22B riboprobe, PCR amplification from B73N genomic DNA was used. PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega) and verified by sequencing. To compare the methomyl and chloramphenicol effects, equal RNA amounts were loaded on the same gel, and for each hybridization probe the same x-ray film was used for quantification of hybridization signals (program Image Gauge 3.3; Fuji). Three independent experiments were performed. Protein Analysis—Total protein extracts from unpollinated ear shoots were prepared as described (20Nieto-Sotelo J. Martinez L.M. Ponce G. Cassab G.I. Alagon A. Meeley R.B. Ribaut J.M. Yang R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cytosolic protein fractions were obtained after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of post-mitochondrial supernatants. Western analyses of total protein extracts (40 μg), cytosolic fractions (100 μg), and mitochondrial protein extracts (50 μg) were performed as described previously (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For immunoblot hybridizations, polyclonal antibodies to maize HSP101 (20Nieto-Sotelo J.

Monde R.A. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), provided by D. Kliebenstein, Cornell University, were used. Monoclonal antibodies to maize mitochondrial proteins, E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, HSP70 (isotype 70A), CPN60 (isotype 60B), and HSP22 were supplied by T. E. Elthon (22Lund A.A. Blum P.H. Bhattramakki D. Elthon T.E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNAi Silencing in C. elegans—C. elegans (N2) RNA interference (RNAi) by feeding was performed basically as described by Kamath et al. (23Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome Biol. 2001; http://genomebiology.com/2000/2/1/research/0002.1PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain HT115(DE3) was transformed with L4440-based constructs containing PCR fragments of four genes derived from genomic DNA (primers listed in Supplemental Table II). Adult worms were placed on nematode growth medium plates with recombinant HT115(DE3) clones induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. The worms were allowed to lay eggs and were removed after 12 h. Progeny were grown for 72 h at 23 °C and harvested for RNA extraction by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenolchloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). Developmental stages were scored 10 h before harvesting. Northern hybridizations were performed as described previously (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PCR fragments generated from N2 genomic DNA with primers listed in Supplemental Table II were used as hybridization probes. Constitutive Expression of hsp Genes in Maize Mitochondrial Mutants—Northern analysis showed that hsp101 and genes for cytosolic sHSPs, classes I and II (shsp-I and shsp-II), whose products are confirmed to have cytoprotective functions (11Queitsch C. Hong S.-W. Vierling E. Lindquist S. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 25Low D. Brandle K. Nover L. Forreiter C. Planta. 2000; 211: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), are constitutively expressed in all NCS mutants under normal growth conditions (Fig. 1A). Higher levels of all transcripts were found in the translation-impaired NCS4 (rps3) mutant than in the complex I-deficient NCS2 (nad4) and complex IV-deficient NCS6 (cox2) mutants. For expression analysis of genes for cytosolic and mitochondrial HSP70s, we performed a maize Expressed Sequence Tag data base search and then identified the candidate cDNAs (Supplemental Table I) through protein sequence alignments with Arabidopsis orthologs (19Sung D.Y. Vierling E. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and response to heat shock (Fig. 1B). Two tested ssa1-homologous genes for cytosolic HSP70s were both highly expressed in all NCS mutants (Fig. 1A), although only one of them was found to be HS-inducible (Fig. 1B). cDNAs for mitochondrial HSP70s were identified via a signature motif in the deduced N-terminal sequences (19Sung D.Y. Vierling E. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Both constitutive (mthsc70) and HS-inducible (mthsp70) genes for mitochondrial HSP70s were found to be expressed in NCS mutants at significantly higher levels than in normal plants (Fig. 1, A and B). Transcript levels for CPN60, a different constitutive mitochondrial chaperonin (26Prasad T.K. Stewart C.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were also increased in all NCS mutants (Fig. 1A). In addition to the earlier studied hsp22A gene for the mitochondrial sHSP (22Lund A.A. Blum P.H. Bhattramakki D. Elthon T.E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we identified another hsp22-like expressed sequence tag (hsp22B; Supplemental Table I) that had orthologs in rice and wheat, but not in Arabidopsis (Fig. 2A). Both genes were dramatically expressed in NCS mutants (Fig. 1A), although hsp22B did not respond to heat shock (Fig. 1B) and its transcripts were not detectable in normal samples of any tissues tested (Figs. 1A and 2B, lanes N; other data not shown). To check expression of an HS-responsive gene that does not belong to the hsp gene families, we used a probe for one of the multiple maize heat shock transcription factor genes, hsfb (Fig. 1B), that had been shown earlier to be HS-inducible (27Gagliardi D. Breton C. Chaboud A. Vergne P. Dumas C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 841-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). None of the transcripts hybridizing to this probe was found at elevated levels in any NCS mutant (Fig. 1A and Table I). Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of hsp genes in NCS mutants differs from a typical heat shock response (e.g. Ref. 28Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Identification and expression analysis of the maize hsp22B gene.

We considered two effects of the loss of mitochondrial genes: (i) decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential Δψm (2Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and (ii) failure to assemble respiratory complexes without mitochondrially encoded components, resulting in accumulation and/or proteolysis of unincorporated subunits (30Karpova O.V. Newton K.J. Plant J. 1999; 17: 511-521Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These processes can be individually induced in a transient mode by specific inhibitors that cause depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane or arrest of mitochondrial translation. For a membrane discharge that would be highly specific to mitochondria, we chose methomyl treatment of maize seedlings with T-type cytoplasmic male sterility (31Klein R.R. Koeppe D.E. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 912-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMS-T mtDNA encodes an aberrant membrane protein, T-URF13, that can specifically interact with methomyl to form small hydrophilic pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane (32Rhoads D.M. Levings III, C.S. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, strong induction of the hsp genes with two types of expression patterns was observed in response to methomyl. Induction of transcripts for mitochondrial HSPs occurred rapidly and was mostly complete within 12 h (Fig. 3A, left). For genes encoding cytosolic HSPs, there was a prolonged lag phase prior to an exponential accumulation of transcripts between 18 and 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3B, left). These results suggest that depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane can trigger divergent signaling pathways for two groups of hsp genes. As we have shown earlier (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), neither increases in protein oxidation nor elevated levels of marker antioxidant enzymes were detected in maize NCS tissues. Absence of endogenous oxidative stress was further corroborated with the lack of induction of a few highly ROS-responsive genes, including the apx1 for cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (33Mittler R. Lam E. Shulaev V. Cohen M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because no apx1 induction was detected upon methomyl treatment (Fig. 3A, left), the activation of hsp genes was not associated with transient oxidative stress. Chloramphenicol treatment to inhibit mitochondrial translation did not result in any detectable induction of transcripts for cytosolic HSPs (Fig. 3B, right). In addition, chloramphenicol appeared to be a much less potent inducer of genes for mitochondrial HSP22s than methomyl. In contrast, the level of cpn60 induction by chloramphenicol was considerably higher, which was consistent with previous data on cpn60 expression in response to accumulation of a misfolded mitochondrial protein (34Zhao Q. Wang J. Levichkin I.V. Stasinopoulos S. Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that, except for cpn60, an excess of non-assembled protein subunits within mitochondria is unlikely to generate a primary signal for induction of hsp genes. It is well known that different HSPs are abundantly expressed during pollen development in maize (27Gagliardi D. Breton C. Chaboud A. Vergne P. Dumas C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 841-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Magnard J.-L. Vergne P. Dumas C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Young T.E. Ling J. Geisler-Lee J. Tanguay R.L. Caldwell C. Gallie D.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 777-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, as seen in Fig. 2B, genes for mitochondrial HSC70 and HSP22A are actively transcribed in male florets of fertile and sterile maize lines, including CMS-T with T-URF13-impaired mitochondria and also CMS-C and CMS-S lines that develop unknown mitochondrial dysfunctions during microsporogenesis (13Newton K.J. Gabay-Laughnan S. Singh K.K. Mitochondrial DNA Mutations in Aging, Disease, and Cancer. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 365-381Crossref Google Scholar). However, the hsp22B gene is induced exclusively in CMS-T and the mthsc70 expression is increased in CMS-T, where mitochondrial membrane depolarization was suggested to occur naturally in anthers (37Levings III, C.S. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the same mechanism of Δψm-dependent hsp activation is turned on in CMS-T maize during microsporogenesis and upon methomyl treatment of vegetative tissues. The differential kinetics of hsp induction in response to methomyl treatment indicates that there is a direct signal from a reduced Δψm to up-regulate the genes for mitochondrial sHSPs. On the other hand, the delayed induction of genes for cytosolic HSPs would suggest another signal generated as a secondary consequence of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Inhibition of protein import into uncoupled mitochondria leads to accumulation of some mitochondrial precursors in cytosol (38Reid G.A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13056-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), facilitating their aggregation. In turn, an excess of non-native proteins and their aggregates in cytosol can trigger the induction of hsp genes (9Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Indeed, in NCS mutants that should have reduced Δψm, we have found that accumulation of the nuclearly encoded E1α subunit of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase in the cytosol correlates with the significant increase in levels of HSP101 protein (Fig. 4, A and B). Concomitantly in the mitochondria of NCS mutants, high steady-state amounts of HSP22(A), the major HS-responsive maize mitochondrial protein (22Lund A.A. Blum P.H. Bhattramakki D. Elthon T.E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were detected (Fig. 4C). In addition, analysis of mitochondrial HSP70s with the monoclonal antibodies (22Lund A.A. Blum P.H. Bhattramakki D. Elthon T.E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a new immunoreactive protein in addition to the constitutive HSP70. It is likely that the novel HSP70 isoform represents a highly homologous inducible mitochondrial HSP70 (∼50% of the deduced amino acid sequence shows 92% identity to that of constitutive HSP70; data not shown). These changes in protein patterns of inducible mitochondrial HSPs are consistent with high induction of their transcripts in NCS mutants (Fig. 1A), whereas levels of constitutive mitochondrial HSPs, HSP70 and the very abundant CPN60 (Fig. 4C), do not reflect an increase in transcription of the corresponding genes. In mtDNA-depleted mammalian cell cultures, a decrease in Δψm was shown to be associated with a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and increased expression of some Ca2+-responsive genes was reported (29Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We found no difference in transcript levels of the Ca2+-inducible adh1 gene for alcohol dehydrogenase (39Subbaiah C.C. Zhang J. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) between NCS mutants and normals in the ear shoot tissues where an overexpression of the hsp genes has been observed (compare Figs. 5A and 1A). To test directly whether genes for mitochondrial and cytosolic HSPs respond to increases in cytosolic Ca2+, we treated B37T maize seedlings with the ionophore A23187, which causes fluxes of intracompartmental Ca2+ into the cytosol. Unlike methomyl, which would also release Ca2+ specifically from mitochondria (40Holden M.J. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 235-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), A23187 does not affect Δψm unless exogenous Ca2+ is supplied (41Curtis M.J. Wolpert T.J. Plant J. 2002; 29: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 42Kahlert S. Reiser G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Adh1 is up-regulated in response to hypoxia, which was shown to be mediated by Ca2+ (43Andrews D.L. Cobb B.G. Johnson J.R. Drew M.C. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Gradual induction of adh1 is commonly observed in maize seedling roots submerged in water for up to 24 h (Fig. 5B, no additions). Both methomyl and A23187 caused much faster adh1 induction (Fig. 5B), apparently reflecting their effects on Ca2+ efflux into the cytosol. However, neither hsp22A nor shsp-I responded to the A23187 treatment (Fig. 5B). These experiments suggest that a decrease in Δψm itself, rather than changes in cellular Ca2+ fluxes, generates a primary signal to induce expression of hsp genes. RNAi Silencing of Nuclear Respiratory Genes in C. elegans Leads to Induction of hsp Genes—We predicted that signaling from dysfunctional mitochondria to induce hsp genes would exist in organisms other than plants. It may take place not only in mitochondrial mutants but also when the expression of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial components is impaired. To assess the presence of the mitochondria-mediated signaling to express hsp genes in nematode C. elegans, we used RNAi (44Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar) of nuclear genes for the components of the ETC. The genes for the following proteins have been chosen as targets: B18 subunit of respiratory complex I, 14-kDa subunit of complex III, cytochrome c1 (complex III), and coxVb subunit of complex IV. All cultures showed developmental delays (mostly L2 and L3 larvae instead of predominant L4 larvae in control culture after 74 h). Like maize mitochondrial mutants (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), none of the RNAi-treated cultures seemed to experience oxidative stress. No induction of the gst4 and pqm1 transcripts was detected (Fig. 6A), though these genes were shown to be the most ROS-responsive in C. elegans (45Tawe W.N. Eschbach M.L. Walter R.D. Henkle-Duhrsen K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have found (Fig. 6A and Supplemental Table II) that RNAi inactivation of respiratory complexes I, III, and IV leads to induction of the major C. elegans heat-inducible gene (46Thakurta D.G. Palomar L. Stormo G.D. Tedesco P. Johnson T.E. Walker D.W. Lithgow G. Kim S. Link C.D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) for a cytosolic HSP70, hsp70.6 (but not of the highly homologous hsp70.4; not shown). Moderately increased were transcripts of hsp70A and, more prominently, those of the gene for mitochondrial HSP70 (hsp70F). Among the genes for sHSPs, no induction of hsp12.6 or change in transcript levels of hsp25 was detected (data not shown). The hsp-17 gene, whose expression had not been characterized before, was highly induced in the RNAi-treated cultures, although it did not respond to heat shock (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, the homologous hsp-16.1 and hsp-16.2 genes were induced although no expression of another homologous pair of sHSP genes, hsp-16.48 and hsp-16.41, was detected (Fig. 6A). In contrast, HS induced both types of hsp-16 genes (Fig. 6B). In the C. elegans genome, hsp16s are organized tandemly, hsp-16.1/hsp-16.48 and hsp-16.2/hsp-16.41. In each case, the shared bidirectional promoter regions contain identical heat shock elements, which correlates with co-regulation of tandemly organized hsp16 genes during heat shock by a single heat shock factor, HSF1 (47Jones D. Russnak R.H. Kay R.J. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12006-12015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential expression of hsp16 genes and activation of hsp17 gene detected in our RNAi experiments suggest that the induction of shsp genes in C. elegans carrying mitochondrial deficiencies is distinct from the HSF1-dependent HS response and may require other transcription factors and cis-recognition sequences. Here we report that acclimation to permanent mitochondrial dysfunction involves steady-state activation of specific sets of hsp genes encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial molecular chaperones. Using maize NCS mutants with defined deletions in mtDNA and cultures of C. elegans with RNAi-inactivated nuclear respiratory genes, we show that mitochondria-dependent hsp gene activation in different organisms has common but distinctive characteristics. (i) Activation of hsp genes depends on inhibition of the electron transfer chain regardless of the type of respiratory defect or its origin (loss of either mitochondrial or nuclear-coded product). In the transient in vivo assays, we have shown that in maize same sets of hsp genes can be induced by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Different kinetics of Δψm-dependent activation suggest different induction pathways for genes encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic HSPs. It is likely that the reduced Δψm, a common result of the ETC inhibition, serves as a primary signal to induce hsp genes coding for mitochondrially targeted proteins. Consequently, inefficient protein import into the de-energized mitochondria might lead to the accumulation of mitochondrial precursors in the cytosol, which was indeed detected in our experiments. This excess of non-native proteins might contribute to the induction of genes for cytosolic HSPs. (ii) In both maize and nematodes, mitochondrial deficiencies differentially activate some HS-inducible hsp genes and also cause high expression of some HS non-responsive hsp genes (including cryptic ones, like hsp22B in maize and hsp-17 in C. elegans). This pattern of hsp expression differs from a typical HS response that involves recognition of heat shock elements by an activated heat shock factor (28Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). It is likely that mitochondria-dependent activation of hsp genes may require additional transcription factors and cis-recognition sequences. (iii) Expression of hsp genes under conditions of permanent respiratory deficiency is not associated with oxidative stress and is not mediated by Ca2+, which clearly distinguishes this type of hsp induction from any others known to date. High expression of some of the tested maize hsp genes at the protein level indicates that activation of hsp genes by impaired mitochondria might be of physiological importance. The remarkable similarities in response to respiratory deficiency in plants and in animals indicate that the constitutive expression of the hsp gene network is a significant part of a program to cope with the disruption of the mitochondrial function. Permanent expression of hsp genes in respiratory-deficient individuals seems to be required for their development and may reflect different changes in genome expression patterns in comparison to the transient responses of normal organisms subjected to temporary biotic/abiotic stresses. Analysis of genome-wide expression in ρ0 mutants compared with wild-type cultures of S. cerevisiae treated with respiratory inhibitors confirmed that gene expression patterns upon mtDNA depletion and after transient inhibition of the ETC are different and overlap only partially (49Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV, W. Dave V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Our data on maize NCS mutants suggest that mitochondria-dependent hsp expression could be coordinated with another stress defensive mechanism associated with plant-specific mitochondrial alternative oxidase, AOX (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As a terminal ubiquinol oxidase, AOX acts as a mild uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and as an antioxidant (50Wagner A.M. Moore A.L. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and prevents an oxidative stress in NCS mutants (3Karpova O.V. Kuzmin E.V. Elthon T.E. Newton K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3271-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, in NCS mutants with high constitutive expression of AOX, effective inhibition of ROS generation occurs at the expense of further de-energization of the mitochondrial membrane. In turn, this decrease in Δψm triggers signaling to express cytosolic and mitochondrial HSPs that would have a protective effect on cells and particularly on dysfunctional mitochondria (5Polla B.S.

Orchestrated hsp gene expression contributes to a metabolically stable acclimation that prevents oxidative stress and apoptosis in respiratory-deficient mutants (Fig. 7). In experiments with C. elegans, we observed hsp gene induction upon RNAi inactivation of the same nuclear respiratory genes, whose RNAi silencing had been found to give a pronounced increase in lifespan (52Dillin A. Hsu A.-L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Science. 2002; 298: 2398-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 53Lee S.S. Lee R.Y.N. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). These results suggest that induction of hsp genes through the signaling from impaired mitochondria may represent one of the crucial links between mitochondrial state and longevity (reviewed in Ref. 54Tsang W.Y. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, we show here that in both plants and animals, there is the mitochondria-dependent hsp gene expression that is different from typical responses to heat shock or oxidative stress and could imply novel signaling pathways and induction mechanisms. Establishing the constitutive expression of hsp genes in the absence of exogenous stress may play a vital role in cell defense and adaptation to permanent respiratory deficiency. We thank J.

This enzyme preferentially catalyzes the conversion between UDP-GlcNAc and UDPGalNAc above UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal, using NAD+ as a cofactor. The crystal structures of WbpP in complex with cofactor and either UDP-Glc or UDP-GalNAc were determined at 2.5 and 2.1 Ǎ, respectively, which represents the first structural studies of a genuine UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase. These structures in combination with complementary mutagenesis studies suggest that the basis for the differential substrate specificity of WbpP is a consequence of the presence of a pliable solvent network in the active site. This information allows for a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between sequence and substrate specificity for UDP-hexose 4-epimerases and enables the formulation of consensus sequences that predict substrate specificity of UDP-hexose 4-epimerases yet to be biochemically characterized. Furthermore, the examination indicates that as little as one residue can dictate substrate specificity. Nonetheless, phylogenetic analysis suggests that this substrate specificity is an evolutionary and highly conserved property within UDP-hexose 4-epimerases.

The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviation used is: LPS, lipopolysaccharide. component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is critical in bacterium-host interactions. For example, LPS is responsible for triggering an innate immune response and plays an important role in septic shock (1Downey J.S. Han J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d468-d476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Du X. Poltorak A. Silva M. Beutler B. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally, in pathogenic bacteria, LPS has been identified as a major virulence factor (3Heumann D. Roger T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2002; 323: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The structure of LPS is comprised of three domains: Lipid A, core region, and O antigen. Although the first two domains remain buried or less exposed, O antigen is exposed to the surrounding environment and is often used as a target for serum recognition. Variation in the structural composition of O antigen has been linked to various aspects of bacterium-host interactions, including virulence potential (4Lerouge I. Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 17-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the clinically relevant human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O6, the O antigen is composed of a tetrasaccharide repeating unit of →α-d-3-O-acetyl,6-amino-GalNAc-(1→4)-α-d-6-amino-2-deoxy-2-formamido-d-galacturonic acid-(1→3)-α-d-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose-(1→2)-α-l-Rha-(1→ (5Knirel Y.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 273-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of this repeating unit is catalyzed by enzymes encoded in the wbp gene cluster (6Belanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, two of the saccharide moieties that participate in the tetrasaccharide repeating unit are derived from UDP-GalNAc, which is produced by C4-epimerization of the sugar moiety of UDP-GlcNAc, catalyzed by WbpP (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). WbpP is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily that contains a diverse collection of oxidoreductases sharing relatively high conservation of structural homology despite low sequence identity (15-30%) (8Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Samuel J. Tanner M.E. Nat. Prod.

It is a homologue of UDP-Gal 4-epimerase (GalE; ∼20-25% sequence identity between WbpP and GalE enzymes; >35% sequence identity among GalE enzymes), which has been the subject of extensive structural and functional studies. For example, crystal structures are known for the Escherichia coli, the human, and the Trypanosoma brucei enzymes (eGalE, hGalE, and tGalE, respectively) (8Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M.

In brief, these studies have shown that the GalE-like UDP-hexose 4-epimerases utilize NAD+ to alter the configuration of the chiral C4 atom of the saccharide moiety by transient oxidation-reduction, which involves a conserved tyrosine that functions as the active site base and a saccharide ring flip when in the oxidized state (Scheme 1). Based on overall sequence similarities with several active site residues shared between GalE and WbpP, it is likely that WbpP will employ a similar reaction mechanism. However, there are significant differences between WbpP and GalE with respect to substrate specificity. Specifically, unlike GalE, WbpP preferentially interconverts N-acetylated UDP-linked galactose and glucose, and hence it has been characterized as a genuine UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we describe three-dimensional crystal structures of WbpP in complex with NAD+ and either UDP-GalNAc or UDPGlc, and data from complementary site-directed mutagenesis experiments. These studies are aimed at elucidating the structural basis for the preference of N-acetylated saccharide moieties, observed for WbpP. These results represent the first structure elucidation of a genuine UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase, and provide further insights into factors governing substrate specificity for GalE-like UDP-hexose 4-epimerases. Crystallization and Data Collection—WbpP, containing an N-terminal His tag, was purified as previously described (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Crystals of two different ternary complexes of WbpP were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion. For successful crystallization, the reservoir solution consisted of 0.6 ml of 40-50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 600 and 0.1 m phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4.2-5.0, whereas the drop consisted of 2 μl of the reservoir solution and 2 μl of a solution containing 5 mg/ml WbpP, 3 mm NAD+, and either 3 mm UDP-Glc or 3 mm UDP-GlcNAc in 25 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.4. Note that, although NAD+ binds tightly to WbpP, and thus likely remains associated with the enzyme during purification, cofactor was provided in the crystallization solution to ensure complete saturation. Crystals with approximate dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm were obtained after 2-4 weeks incubation at 4° or 22 °C. Prior to data collection, crystals were briefly washed in reservoir solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 95 K at the X8C beam line of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories, Upton, NY, which was equipped with an ADSC Quantum 4 charge-coupled device detector. For each crystal form (grown in the presence of either UDP-Glc or UDPGlcNAc) a data set was obtained by exposing one crystal to synchrotron radiation. Data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) and showed that the crystals belonged to space group C2221 with typical unit cell dimensions of a = 61 Ǎ, b = 96 Ǎ, and c = 140 Ǎ, thus containing one protein molecule per asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of WbpP in the presence of NAD+ and UDP-Glc was solved by molecular replacement using the Crystallography and NMR System software suite (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). As a search model UDP-Gal 4-epimerase from E. coli was used (PDB code: 1XEL) (13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Solutions for the rotation and translation functions were readily obtained for the single WbpP molecule in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the model consisted of successive rounds of reciprocal space refinement and model building using the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Adjustments and additions to the model were performed based on σA-weighted difference electron density maps (2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc). Refinement was continued until no significant improvement could be obtained as judged by a decrease in the free-R value. During refinement, unambiguous density for the UDP moiety of UDPGlc could be observed. However, density for the saccharide moiety was weak and discontinuous, likely due to a high mobility for this group. Therefore the occupancy for the Glc part of UDP-Glc was set to zero (Fig. 1a). The crystal structure for WbpP grown in the presence of NAD+ and UDP-GlcNAc was determined by difference Fourier methods, using a partially refined model of WbpP·NAD+·UDP-Glc, in which the substrates were removed. Refinement for this crystal structure was performed using analogous procedures as described above. During the course of refinement, density for the entire UDP-linked saccharide substrate could be clearly seen in difference electron density maps, unlike in the WbpP·NAD+·UDP-Glc structure. However, the exact nature of the saccharide moiety required assessment, because the observed density was not consistent with the initially added substrate UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 1b). Based on σA-weighted simulated annealing omit maps and trial occupancy refinements with both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc in either substrate (i.e. catalytically productive conformation in which C4-OH is oriented away from the NAD cofactor) or product (i.e. non-productive conformation in which C4-OH is oriented toward the NAD cofactor) orientations, we concluded that the observed density is consistent with a model in which ∼70% of the saccharide moiety is UDP-GalNAc positioned in the catalytically productive substrate conformation. The remaining 30% is likely a mixture of the other three alternative species. However, due to the resolution of the diffraction data, we have included only the UDP-GalNAc productive conformation in the final model, and we will henceforth refer to this model as the WbpP·NAD+·UDP-GalNAc structure. Refinement statistics pertaining to the two models are presented in Table I. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Substrate Specificity Analysis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template for mutagenesis was the His-WbpP-pET vector (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two mutants were constructed: A209H and S306Y. After mutagenesis, DNA sequencing was performed on each mutant construct to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and eliminate constructs with unwanted secondary mutations. Protein expression and purification of WbpP variants were performed using analogous procedures as that for wild-type protein (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Analysis of kinetic parameters and substrate specificity for the two WbpP variants followed procedures previously used (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, after purification, enzymes were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in Tris 100 mm, pH 8. Reactions for activity assays were set up with 21 μl of enzyme adjusted to 0.57 or 0.28 mg/ml in Tris 100 mm, pH 8, 3.5 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8, and 3.5 μl of 5 mm UDP-linked saccharide substrate for a total reaction volume of 35 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated at the appropriate time by boiling for 6 min. Analysis of substrate conversion was performed by capillary electrophoresis (Beckman model P/ACE MDQ). Overall Structure of WbpP—The three-dimensional structure of WbpP is composed of two domains (Fig. 2a). The N-terminal domain (residues 1-192 and 238-264) is the site where the NAD cofactor binds. It possesses a modified Rossmann fold composed of a seven-strand parallel β-sheet flanked by nine α-helices. The C-terminal domain (residues 193-237 and 265-343) holds the UDP-linked hexose substrate and has an α/β motif consisting of four α-helices and four β-strands. Consistent with sequence comparison results, WbpP is structurally similar to UDP-Gal 4-epimerases, such as eGalE, and possesses all the features of a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The most notable difference between the WbpP and eGalE structures is that residues 3-16 in WbpP form an additional α-helix in the N-terminal domain. Additional differences between WbpP and eGalE are exclusively limited to loops located between secondary structure elements, where there are deletions and insertions observed. Overall, the root mean square difference for Cα atoms of structurally identical residues between WbpP and eGalE is 1.45 Ǎ (291 residues); separating for the N- and C-terminal domains these differences are 1.3 and 1.2 Ǎ, respectively, indicating that hinge motion between the two domains is minimal. Although the asymmetric unit only contains one WbpP molecule, analytical gel-filtration studies (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and dynamic light scattering studies (data not shown) indicate that the enzyme exists as a dimer in solution. Analysis of crystal packing contacts suggests that the physiological dimer species is created through the formation of a four-helix bundle with each protomer contributing two α-helices (residues 112-133 and 164-182; Fig. 2b). The interface between the two symmetry-related molecules participating in the four-helix bundle is 2530 Ǎ2, indicative of an oligomeric interface (20Janin J. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Other UDP-hexose 4-epimerases also exist as similar dimers in solution (8Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Architecture of the Active Site of WbpP—Examination of the NAD cofactor and UDP-hexose binding sites in WbpP reveal that they are homologous to those found in the human, E. coli and T. brucei GalE crystal structures (Fig. 3). Specifically, all of the residues, which have previously been implicated in catalysis for GalE enzymes, i.e. the SYK triad, are also conserved in WbpP (Ser-142, Tyr-166, and Lys-170). The exact role of these residues has been thoroughly examined by Holden and coworkers, and our structural data is in complete agreement with their analyses (11Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10675-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Here we focus on the notable distinction between WbpP and UDP-Gal 4-epimerases. Specifically, the binding site for the saccharide moiety in WbpP has revealed important modifications compared with hGalE, tGalE, and eGalE. Residue 102 is a glycine in WbpP, whereas in GalE enzymes the corresponding residue is either a lysine or a leucine. The equivalent residue for Ala-209 in WbpP is either asparagine (eGalE and hGalE) or histidine (tGalE). Finally, Ser-306 in WbpP is substituted for a leucine in tGalE, a tyrosine in eGalE, and a cysteine in hGalE. Based on these alterations, WbpP possesses a larger space for the saccharide moiety to reside in when compared with GalE enzymes. UDP-Glc Versus UDP-GalNAc Binding in WbpP—Crystal structures of WbpP were determined in complex with UDP-Glc and UDP-GalNAc. Comparison of the overall fold between the two complex structures reveals that there is a minor rotation between the N- and C-terminal domains of ∼1.4°, with the UDP-Glc complex being in a slightly more open conformation. Given the accuracy of the crystal structures, the nearly identical crystallization conditions and that the crystals were isomorphous, the observed difference in domain orientation is most likely caused by the difference in substrate. Concomitant with the difference in domain orientation, noticeable dissimilarities in the active site are also detected between the UDP-Glc- and UDP-GalNAc-bound WbpP complex structures, specifically at the saccharide-binding pocket. The most striking difference is that there is clear and well defined density observed for the saccharide moiety of UDP-GalNAc in the WbpP·NAD+·UDP-GalNAc structure, whereas comparable density for the Glc moiety is missing in the WbpP·NAD+·UDPGlc ternary complex (Fig. 1). The GalNAc moiety is in the catalytically competent substrate orientation and is appropriately positioned with respect to the catalytic base (Tyr-166 OH-GalNAc-C4-OH distance is 3.0 Ǎ) and cofactor (NAD+-C4-GalNAc-C4 distance is 3.2 Ǎ). The absence of well defined density for the Glc moiety in the WbpP·NAD+·UDP-Glc crystal structure indicates that the Glc moiety is less ordered in the WbpP active site than is GalNAc. The presumably more disordered nature of the Glc moiety is also mirrored in its immediate environment; specifically, differences in solvent structure within the saccharide-binding pocket are observed between the two WbpP ternary complexes (Fig. 4). Compared with WbpP·NAD+·UDP-GalNAc, the WbpP·NAD+·UDP-Glc structure lacks several ordered solvent molecules in the active site, and other water molecules are displaced. Combined, these differences result in a slightly more closed conformation of the UDP-GalNAc-bound ternary complex, which is reflected in the differences in domain orientation. Structural Basis for Substrate Specificity in WbpP—WbpP is ∼1000-fold more efficient in catalyzing the epimerization between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc than when the non-acetylated substrates UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal are used (7Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast eGalE and tGalE are unable to epimerize acetylated UDP-linked saccharides, whereas hGalE is equally capable of catalyzing the epimerization of UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal. Providing a rational explanation for the substrate specificity of eGalE, tGalE, and hGalE is relatively straightforward in that for eGalE and tGalE the saccharide-binding pocket is not large enough to perform the epimerization reaction for acetylated saccharide moieties, and for hGalE the binding pocket is sufficiently large to accommodate both classes of substrates (21Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15131-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, analogous reasoning cannot be used to explain the substrate specificity of WbpP. The differences observed between WbpP and GalE enzymes and between the WbpP·NAD+·UDP-GalNAc and WbpP·NAD+· UDP-Glc crystal structures provide insight into the structural basis of the preference of WbpP for UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc. Compared with tGalE, eGalE, and hGalE, the saccharide-binding pocket is spacious due to the small size of residues 102, 209, and 306 (Gly, Ala, and Ser, respectively; Fig. 3). The additional space in the active site allows for water molecules to participate in the binding of saccharide moieties. Our analysis suggests that the presence of an N-acetyl group in the saccharide moiety enables an ordering of solvent molecules in the active site of WbpP (Fig. 4). This in turn stabilizes the position of the saccharide moiety and places it in the correct location for catalysis. In the absence of an N-acetyl group, the saccharide moiety is less restrained in the WbpP active site, and thus it is, on average, less well positioned for catalysis, resulting in a significant reduction of efficiency for UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal substrates. Therefore, the preference of WbpP for UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc over UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal can be explained by orbital steering (24Mesecar A.D. Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1997; 277: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To test the validity of our analysis, we constructed two single-site variants of WbpP that were designed to have reduced preference for UDP-linked N-acetylated hexoses by shrinking the size of the saccharide-binding pocket: A209H and S306Y. The results for these mutagenesis studies are shown in Table II. In agreement with our analysis and prediction, the A209H mutant is much less efficient in catalyzing the epimerization of N-acetylated hexose moieties and is in fact more efficient in catalyzing the reaction for non-acetylated hexoses compared with wild-type. Unfortunately, the S306Y mutant proved to be completely inactive irrespective of the substrate tested, thus providing no further insights into the factors governing substrate specificity in WbpP.Table IIEquilibrium data for the substrate conversions by WbpPMutantSubstrate and value of percent conversionUDP-GlcNAcUDP-GalNAcUDP-GlcUDP-Gal%WT28.473.34.010.0A209H4.56.95.315.5S306Y0000 Open table in a new tab Substrate Spectrum in UDP-hexose 4-Epimerases—With the completion of the structure determination of WbpP, crystal structures are now available for three different groups of UDP-hexose 4-epimerases, namely: epimerases that preferentially catalyze the conversion between UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal (eGalE and tGalE, group 1); epimerases that do not show a preference for either UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal or UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc (hGalE, group 2); and epimerases that preferentially convert between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc (WbpP, group 3). This has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between sequence, three-dimensional structure, and substrate preference. Based on these analyses we have constructed an abstract model to facilitate a better understanding of the factors governing substrate spectrum in UDP-hexose 4-epimerases (Fig. 5). The generic saccharide-binding pocket in groups 1, 2, and 3 UDP-hexose 4-epimerases can be conceptualized as a hexagonal shaped box in which the bottom is formed by the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor and six walls are formed by different regions of the enzymes. The top of the box is open to accommodate the flip of the saccharide ring that is essential to the reaction mechanism. Three of the six walls are conserved and contain the Ser and Tyr residues of the SYK triad and a highly conserved Asn residue (Asn-195 in WbpP); these walls are necessary for chemistry. In our conceptual model the remaining three walls vary between groups 1, 2, and 3 UDP-hexose 4-epimerases, and their exact composition/placement dictates substrate preference. In group 1 enzymes, the walls are constructed such that only non-acetylated UDP-hexoses are able to bind in a manner that allows for catalysis. Analysis of tGalE and eGalE shows that there are at least two ways in which the walls can be constructed for this. In tGalE, the saccharide-binding pocket is too small to allow binding of any acetylated UDP-linked hexoses (group 1a). In eGalE, due to the substitution of a histidine for an asparagine, UDP-GlcNAc could bind and the 4-keto intermediate could be formed; however, rotation of the sugar moiety can not occur thus preventing formation of UDP-GalNAc (group 1b). In group 2 and 3 enzymes, two of the walls are (partly) removed to allow binding of a larger N-acetylated substrate. Furthermore, in group 3 enzymes, ordered solvent molecules become part of the box so as to result in preferential catalysis of UDP-GlcNAc and UDPGalNAc substrates. According to this model, one should be able to alter the substrate spectrum of UDP-hexose 4-epimerases by altering the composition of the walls. The mutagenesis study reported above (Table II), accomplished exactly this. We restored one of the walls absent in WbpP in the A209H variant, partially mimicking tGalE, thereby altering the substrate spectrum from a group 3 profile to a group 2 profile. Thoden et al. (25Thoden J.B. Henderson J.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have reported an analogous mutagenesis study where they essentially removed one of the walls in eGalE by mutating Tyr-299 to a cysteine thus changing the substrate spectrum from a group 1 profile to a group 2 profile. The model shown in Fig. 5 should also allow for the prediction of substrate spectrum solely based on sequence. Recently, functional studies of several UDP-hexose 4-epimerases have been performed. For example, WbgU from Pleisiomonas shigelloides and UAE from Giardia intestinalis have been identified as genuine UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc epimerases (26Kowal P. Wang P.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15410-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Lopez A.B. Sener K. Jarroll E.L. van Keulen H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and Gne from Yersinia enterocolitica and Bacillus subtilis has been shown to epimerize both UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc substrates (28Bengoechea J.A. Pinta E. Salminen T. Oertelt C. Holst O. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Piotrowska-Seget Z. Venho R. Skurnik M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4277-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Soldo B. Scotti C. Karamata D. Lazarevic V. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 319: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Predicting the substrate spectrum profile for WbgU, UAE and Gne based on their sequence classifies these enzymes as group 3, group 3, and group 2 UDP-hexose 4-epimerases, respectively, in complete agreement with experimental data. Evolution of Substrate Spectrum in UDP-hexose 4-Epimerases—Our mutagenesis study, as well as that of Thoden et al. (25Thoden J.B. Henderson J.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), show that substrate specificity in UDP-hexose 4-epimerases is dictated by a very limited number of residues, e.g. a single mutation can change the profile (Table II Ref. 25Thoden J.B. Henderson J.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This implies that, given appropriate selective pressures, it must be easy to alter the substrate spectrum of UDP-hexose 4-epimerases during evolution. Furthermore, it opens up the possibility that a particular substrate spectrum was re-discovered multiple times during evolution. To examine this possibility, a phylogenetic analysis was performed in conjunction with substrate spectrum prediction based on sequence (Fig. 6). The phylogenetic tree suggests that a major divergence into three clusters occurred very early in evolution. The substrate spectrum prediction advocates that these three clusters essentially correspond to the three groups defined by substrate spectrum, i.e. groups 1, 2, and 3. Thus, it can be inferred that substrate spectrum is an evolutionary conserved property of UDP-hexose 4-epimerases. However, it is not absolutely conserved; the phylogenetic tree suggests that the group 1b and group 2 enzymes are more closely related to each other than to the other groups and that the group 1b and/or the group 2 profile was re-invented multiple times during evolution. In conclusion, the crystal structure of WbpP represents the first structure of a UDP-hexose 4-epimerases that preferentially catalyzes the conversion between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc. The structural basis for substrate specificity is the result of WbpP better positioning N-acetylated hexose moieties for catalysis than non-acetylated UDP-linked hexoses, as effected by a pliable solvent network in the active site. When the knowledge on the structural basis for substrate specificity is applied to other UDP-hexose 4-epimerases, it is revealed that substrate preference developed very early in the evolution of these enzymes, though re-invention of substrate spectrum has likely occurred multiple times between group 1b and 2 enzymes.

Absorption spectra of the native protein, mutants H64L and K67L and double mutant H64L/K67L were recorded for the ferric and ferrous states over a wide pH range (pH 4–11), which allowed us to identify a number of different species with different ligands at the sixth coordination, to characterize their spectroscopic properties, and to determine the pK values of active site residues. In flash photolysis experiments on CO-ligated samples, reaction intermediates and the competition of ligands for the sixth coordination were studied. These data provide insights into structural changes in the active site and the role of the key residues His64 and Lys67. His64 interferes with exogenous ligand access to the heme iron. Lys67 sequesters the distal pocket from the solvent. The heme iron is very reactive, as inferred from the fast ligand binding kinetics and the ability to bind water or hydroxyl ligands to the ferrous heme. Fast bond formation favors geminate rebinding; yet the large fraction of bimolecular rebinding observed in the kinetics implies that ligand escape from the distal pocket is highly efficient.

Globins are small respiratory proteins that reversibly bind dioxygen and other small ligands at the central iron of a heme prosthetic group that is embedded in a highly conserved α-helical globin fold. They are widely distributed over many taxa, including unicellular eukaryotes, plants, fungi, and animals (1Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin (Hb) 1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; Ngb, neuroglobin; Mb, myoglobin; wt, wild type. and myoglobin (Mb) are the most prominent members of this protein family (2Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). Recently, two new members have been discovered in the vertebrate globin family, cytoglobin, also known as histoglobin, and neuroglobin (Ngb) (3Trent J.T. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol.

Whereas cytoglobin is ubiquitously found in vertebrate tissue, Ngb is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells of the brain (4Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. Dewilde S. Moens L.

Nevertheless, it displays all key determinants of the globin fold (9Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Ngb consists of a single chain of 151 amino acids and shares only 20–25% sequence identity with vertebrate Mb or Hb. Human and murine Ngb have 94% identical residues and are thus more similar than Hb and Mb in these species (77–85%) (5Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In the absence of an exogenous ligand, the heme iron is hexacoordinate in both ferric (Fe3+, met) and ferrous (Fe2+, deoxy) Ngb (5Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

The exogenous ligand replaces the endogenous one upon binding at the sixth coordination, and therefore, hexacoordination has been considered as a novel mechanism for regulating ligand binding affinity to the heme (13Pesce A.

The physiological role of hexacoordinate globins has not yet been clarified. For Ngb, the low expression level and moderate oxygen affinity (half-saturation pressure P50 ≈ 2.0 torr (5Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar)) suggests a function different from simple oxygen storage and transport (21Venis S. Lancet. 2001; 358: 2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported an up-regulation of Ngb under conditions of hypoxia or ischemia in vitro (21Venis S. Lancet. 2001; 358: 2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), thus promoting neuronal survival. The induction of Ngb expression by hemin indicates that more than one signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of Ngb expression, because heme availability and hypoxia-induced pathways are controlled through different mechanisms (24Zhu Y. Sun Y. Jin K. Greenberg D.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2494-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, ferric (but not O2-ligated ferrous) human Ngb interacts with the GDP-bound form of the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, thereby preventing neuronal death (25Wakasugi K. Nakano T. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36505-36512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). All of these results suggest that Ngb is a sensor responsive to oxidative stress. To understand the function of Ngb in the vertebrate brain and that of hexacoordinate globins in general, a thorough investigation of the structure, dynamics, and ligand binding (equilibrium and kinetic) properties is a prerequisite. Fig. 1 shows the essential features of the active site of murine met Ngb, as determined at 105 K (14Vallone B. Nienhaus K. Brunori M. Nienhaus G.U. Proteins. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The heme is inserted into the globin in two different orientations, as already suggested from NMR investigations by La Mar and co-workers (26Du W. Syvitski R. Dewilde S. Moens L. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8080-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which also affects the axial residues His64 and His96. Structural heterogeneity in the distal heme pocket was also apparent from infrared spectroscopy on CO-ligated Ngb (27Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have revealed extremely fast CO and O2 association to pentacoordinate deoxy Ngb and extremely slow binding to the hexacoordinate deoxy form. The latter process is governed by thermal dissociation of the His64 side chain from the sixth coordination (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C.

To examine structural and dynamic aspects of ligand binding, we have prepared Ngb mutants H64L, K67L, and H64L/K67L. Here we present steady-state optical absorption spectroscopy on the deoxy, met, and CO-ligated forms and time-resolved spectroscopy on the CO-ligated proteins. Measurements over a wide range of pH enabled us to examine the competition of endogenous and exogenous ligands for the sixth heme coordination as a function of the protonation states of the residues in the vicinity of the active site. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Murine Ngb (wt) was produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3)pLys by using the pET3a expression plasmid (27Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mutants H64L and K67L and double mutant H64L/K67L were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Custom designed primers were purchased from MWG (MWG-Biotech GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). The mutants were expressed and purified as described for the wt protein (27Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—Optical absorption spectra and flash photolysis kinetics at ambient temperature were measured on dilute aqueous samples, prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein in 100 mm sodium phosphate/citrate (pH 4–6), sodium phosphate (pH 6.2–8.6), and sodium carbonate buffer (pH > 8.6) to a final concentration of ∼10 μm. For cryospectroscopy, the protein was dissolved in 75% glycerol, 25% potassium phosphate buffer (v/v). To produce NgbCO samples, the solutions were equilibrated with 0.05 or 1 atm CO partial pressure under anaerobic conditions, and a 10-fold excess of sodium dithionite was subsequently added. Six-coordinate deoxy Ngb samples were prepared by adding dithionite solution anaerobically to ferric Ngb solutions after thorough purging with N2 gas. Absorption Spectroscopy—Spectra at ambient temperature were taken with a Cary 1 E spectrometer (Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) at a resolution of 1 nm. Low temperature spectra were recorded on an OLIS-modified Cary 14 spectrometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA) at a resolution of 0.3 nm. The samples were cooled with a closed cycle helium cryostat (model 22, CTI Cryogenics, Mansfield, MA) equipped with a Lakeshore Cryotronics model 330 digital temperature controller. To observe photolysis-induced spectral changes, the samples were illuminated at low temperature for 10 min prior to data collection by using a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser emitting ∼300 mW at 532 nm (model Forte 530–300; Laser Quantum, Manchester, UK). Flash Photolysis Experiments—In our home-built flash photolysis apparatus, photolysis was achieved by a saturating 6-ns (full width at half-maximum) pulse from a frequency doubled, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (model Surelite II; Continuum, Santa Clara, CA). Light-induced absorbance changes were monitored in the Soret region using light from a tungsten source (model A 1010; Photon Technology International Inc. (PTI), Brunswick, NJ). The wavelength of the monitoring beam was adjusted by a monochromator. The transmitted light intensity was measured with a photomultiplier tube (model R5600U, Hamamatsu Corp., Middlesex, NJ) and recorded with a digital storage oscilloscope from 10 to 50 μs (model TDS 520; Tektronix, Wilsonville, OR) and a home-built logarithmic time base digitizer (Wondertoy II) from 2 μs to 100 s. Between 100 and 500 individual transients were averaged for each data set. For single-wavelength kinetics, the absorbance change was measured at 436 nm and normalized to 1 at the earliest times (30 ns). We denote the normalized absorbance change by N(t); it is the fraction of molecules that have not yet rebound a ligand at time t after the photolyzing flash. Optical Absorption at Ambient Temperature—The spectra of Ngb mutant K67L in the different oxidation and ligation states of the heme iron are similar to those of wt Ngb (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The two (α and β) bands between 500 and 600 nm are indicative of hexacoordination of the heme iron in the oxidized (met) and reduced (deoxy) states without exogenous ligand as well as the CO-ligated state. The peak positions of the various bands are compiled in Table I. For the CO-ligated form, a small but significant spectral change with pH was noticed. With decreasing pH, the Soret (γ) band of wt NgbCO (K67L NgbCO) redshifts from 415.6 to 416.6 (416.5 to 417.2) nm according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch relation (Fig. 2a). This relation gives the fractional populations of the protonated (acid) and deprotonated (base) species, here denoted by c+ and c0, as a function of pH.c+(pH)=1−c0(pH)=11+10n(pH−pK)(Eq. 1) For the Henderson-Hasselbalch relation, which describes a single protonation, the parameter n equals 1; n > 1 signals a cooperative transition involving more than one protonation. The data in Fig. 2a show that a protonating group with a pK of 4.4 ± 0.1 (5.6 ± 0.1) resides in the vicinity of the heme. For the CO-ligated mutants with leucine at position 64, a similar shift of the Soret band was not observed.Table IPeak positions of the absorption spectra of Ngb and mutants H64L, K67L, and H64L/K67L in different ligation and oxidation states for the different pH regionsOxidation stateLigation statepHpKSoretVisible bandsnmnmWild type NgbaSpectra at pH 7 have been published previously (10, 12).FerricSix-coordinate (His64/His96)8411530/566FerrousSix-coordinate (His64/His96)8423528/558FerrousSix-coordinate (CO-His96)84.4415.6533/5683.5416.6533/568K67LFerricSix-coordinate (His64/His96)8412533/560FerrousSix-coordinate (His64/His96)8424529/559FerrousSix-coordinate (CO-His96)45.6416.5533/5688417.2533/568H64LFerricSix-coordinate67.3403500/6318409530/568119.9411532/568FerrousFive/six-coordinate6422/436530/560/571119.9436527/557FerrousSix-coordinate (CO-His96)8419536/569H64L/K67LFerricSix-coordinate68.8403499/530/6329407499/530/632119421540/571FerrousFive/six-coordinate6426/436529/550/57311425/437528/558/572FerrousSix-coordinate (CO-His96)8419537/564a Spectra at pH 7 have been published previously (10Dewilde S.

Open table in a new tab In the absence of an exogenous ligand, replacing His64 by leucine results in substantial pH-dependent spectral changes in both the ferric and ferrous forms (Fig. 3, a and b). At low pH, the deoxy form of H64L Ngb is characterized by a broad Soret band, with a maximum at 422 nm and a pronounced shoulder at 436 nm (Fig. 3b). The second derivative spectrum in Fig. 3c displays two minima, clearly indicating that the Soret consists of two peaks. The spectral region between 500 and 600 nm exhibits a broad absorption feature approximately 550 nm. It contains multiple bands, as seen from the (most pronounced) minima in the second derivative spectra at 530, 560, and 571 nm (Fig. 3c). The spectra are pH-independent between pH 5 and 8. At more alkaline pH, they change dramatically (Fig. 3, b and c). The Soret band becomes much larger and narrower; the shoulder at 436 nm disappears completely. Moreover, two narrow and tall bands at 527 and 557 nm arise from the broad 550-nm absorption. These changes clearly signal the appearance of a new low spin heme iron species. In Fig. 2b, the absorbance change at 557 nm is plotted as a function of pH after rescaling from 0 to 1. The line through the data is the result of a nonlinear least squares fit of the data with a Henderson-Hasselbalch relation, yielding a pK of 9.9 ± 0.1. This behavior suggests that an amino acid near the active site deprotonates and binds to the heme iron. At acidic pH, ferric Ngb H64L has a Soret peak at 403 nm (Fig. 3a). Above 500 nm, the spectrum exhibits the typical, multi-humped appearance of an aquomet globin species (2Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar), with the charge-transfer band at 631 nm, which is characteristic of a high spin ferric heme iron (29Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). With increasing pH, the Soret peak shifts to the red by ∼6 nm, and concomitantly, a double-humped spectrum appears above 500 nm, indicating that H2O at the sixth coordination is replaced by another ligand. Fig. 2b shows the scaled absorbance change at 409 nm in the Soret peak as a function of pH. The pH dependence is in excellent agreement with a Henderson-Hasselbalch relation with pK = 7.3 ± 0.1. Above pH 9, the absorption at 409 nm decreases slightly, which signals a protonation with pK ≈ 10. This is likely the same protonation that has already been much more obvious in the deoxy spectra. The ferric double mutant H64L/K67L also shows the acidic/alkaline transition (Fig. 3d). From the change in absorbance at 403 nm, a pK of 8.8 ± 0.3 was determined (Fig. 2c). At pH > 9, a second transition manifests itself in a pronounced and rather abrupt shift of the Soret band from 407–421 nm (shown scaled from 0 to 1 in Fig. 2c). The fit with Equation 1 yielded a cooperativity parameter n = 3.5. The α and β bands change very little, however (Fig. 3d). By contrast, the spectra of the ferrous species appear essentially pH-independent (Fig. 3e). The second derivative spectrum (Fig. 3f) only shows slight shifts of the bands with pH. Optical Spectra at Cryogenic Temperature—After photodissociation of CO or other small, gaseous ligands at ambient temperature, a pentacoordinate deoxy Ngb forms that is converted within milliseconds to the hexacoordinate deoxy species by bond formation between the heme iron and the His64 imidazole (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol.

Therefore, the His64 imidazole side chain is immobilized, and the CO rebinds to the pentacoordinate heme iron from the distal heme pocket. We have shown earlier that the enthalpy barrier for CO binding to pentacoordinate Ngb is extremely low in comparison with other heme proteins (27Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3988-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As a consequence, only at very low temperatures can a significant amount of pentacoordinate NgbCO photoproduct be trapped for longer periods of time after photolysis. Fig. 4a shows the Soret region of the NgbCO absorption spectrum before and after illumination at 10 K. Upon photodissociation, the intensity of the Soret peak at 414 nm decreases, concomitant with the appearance of the broad absorption of the pentacoordinate species with a maximum at 438 nm, as is evident from the difference spectrum. Essentially identical spectral changes are seen for mutant H64L (Fig. 4b), consistent with our expectation that His64 cannot bind to the sixth coordination in the native protein after photodissociation of CO at low temperatures. To further elucidate the complicated spectra of ferrous H64L Ngb at room temperature (Fig. 3b), we also performed cryospectroscopy on this species. The spectra in Fig. 4c were collected on a sample at pH 7.5. They show a pronounced and completely reversible temperature effect. With decreasing temperature, the peak at 438 nm gets weaker at the expense of the band at 418 nm. After laser illumination, this change is essentially reverted, which indicates that the band at 418 nm belongs to a hexacoordinate species with a small, photolyzable ligand at the sixth coordination, whereas the band at 438 nm belongs to pentacoordinate, high spin heme. Comparison of samples in the pH range 6–10 showed that the hexacoordinate species grows at the expense of the pentacoordinate form toward higher pH (data not shown). A third, rather weak feature at 428 nm is only visible in the better resolved spectra at 10 K, both before and after photolysis (Fig. 4, c and d). However, it is too weak to decide unambiguously from the data whether its fraction decreases or increases upon photolysis. CO Binding after Photodissociation at Ambient Temperature—The ligand binding reaction in NgbCO after photodissociation is a complicated process that can best be followed from the time dependence of entire optical spectra. Fig. 5 shows a contour plot of the spectral changes that occur after photodissociation of wt NgbCO, pH 4, 0.05 bar CO, logarithmically plotted as a function of time between 30 ns and 10 s. Negative contours (dotted lines) on the left represent changes in the Soret band of NgbCO, and positive contours (solid lines) on the right represent changes in the Soret band of the species that occur upon CO photodissociation. A geminate phase caused by CO molecules that do not exit into the solvent after photodissociation has been observed at 275 K at times below 100 ns (27Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). At room temperature, this process is faster than 30 ns and thus outside of the time window of our instrument. A large fraction rebinds in a bimolecular process on the time scale of ∼10–3 s, as is apparent from the decrease in the difference spectrum at that time. This process does not complete, however, but stalls for many orders of magnitude in time because the endogenous His64 binds to the heme iron, thus blocking the active site. Only after thermal dissociation of His64, which occurs on the 1-s time scale at pH 4, can the rest of the CO finally bind and the difference spectrum decay to 0. This interpretation is evident from the spectral changes in the Soret band of the photoproducts. The positive signal at early times is centered on ∼432 nm but shifts to 425 nm because of the binding of His64 to the sixth coordination. In most experiments, we take kinetic data only at a fixed wavelength, normally near the maximum of the pentacoordinate species at 436 nm (Fig. 5, vertical line). In Fig. 6, we compare CO rebinding in wt Ngb and its mutants with wt Mb and Mb H64L. All kinetic traces were taken on samples in 0.1 m buffer, pH 8, equilibrated with CO at a partial pressure of 0.05 bar, except for a single trace with wt NgbCO (open circles, 1 bar CO). In the time window of our experiments, the Ngb kinetics at 436 nm show two decays, characterized by apparent rate coefficients λ1 and λ2 and amplitudes N1 and N2. The first step in the kinetics at 1 bar is much faster than at 0.05 bar, as expected for bimolecular recombination of CO to the pentacoordinate deoxy form. The lines represent double-exponential fits to the data, and the resulting second order rate coefficients for CO binding to the pentacoordinate deoxy species are summarized in Table II. Note that the amplitudes in these traces do not represent the relative amounts of the two transient deoxy species because the first decaying species is measured near its absorption maximum, whereas the second, hexacoordinate species is measured in the wing of its absorption band (Fig. 5).Table IIBimolecular rate coefficientsProteinλ′COμm-1 s-1Ngb67 ± 6ak′CO = 72 μm-1 s-1 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 25 °C (10).Ngb K67L76 ± 6ak′CO = 72 μm-1 s-1 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 25 °C (10).Ngb H64L237 ± 60bk′CO = 200 μm-1 s-1 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 25 °C (10).Ngb H64L/K67L300 ± 60Mb0.5 ± 0.05ck′CO = 0.51 μm-1 s-1 in 0.1 m phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7, at 20-22 °C (33).Mb H64L26 ± 2dk′CO = 26 μm-1 s-1 in 0.1 m phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7, at 20-22 °C (33).Rice Hb17.2eIn 0.02 m Tris, pH 7, at 20 °C (17).Rice Hb1H73L170eIn 0.02 m Tris, pH 7,"

We have tested this model in the context of the full-length EGFR displayed at the cell surface, by introducing mutations in two regions (CR1 and CR2) of the extracellular domain thought to be critical for regulation of receptor activation. Mutations in the CR1 and CR2 domains have opposing effects on ligand binding affinity, receptor dimerization, tyrosine kinase activation, and signaling competence. Tyr246 is a critical residue in the CR1 loop, which is implicated in the positioning and stabilization of the receptor dimer interface after ligand binding; mutations of Tyr246 impair or abolish receptor function. Mutations in CR2, which weaken the interaction that restricts the receptor to the tethered (inactive) state, enhance responsiveness to EGF by increasing affinity for the ligand. However, weakening of the CR1/CR2 interaction does not result in spontaneous activation of the receptors' kinase. We have used an antibody (mAb 806), which recognizes a transition state of the EGF receptor between the negatively constrained, tethered state and the fully active back-to-back dimer conformation, to follow conformational changes in the wild-type and mutant EGF receptors after ligand binding. Our results suggest that EGFR on the cell surface can be untethered, but this form is inactive; thus, untethering of the receptor is not sufficient for activation, and ligand binding is essential for the correct positioning of the two receptor subunits to achieve kinase activation.

In this structure, not only is the distance between L1 and L2 too great to allow simultaneous binding to one EGF molecule, but L2 is also rotated away from the L1-bound EGF.

Work with the full-length, cellular EGFR has established a strong link between EGFR dimerization, high affinity binding, and receptor kinase activation. Whereas the crystal structures of the isolated ECDs provide an improved framework for the understanding of these observations (i.e. ligand will bind with higher affinity to the “untethered” form of the receptor, thus shifting the equilibrium away from the monomeric, autoinhibited receptor and favoring the formation of active dimers (9Ferguson K.M.

Thus in the full-length, cell surface EGF receptor, ligand binding is required not only to drive dimerization but also for the formation of the kinase active conformation.

The mAb 528 anti-EGFR hybridoma was purchased from ATCC. Anti-FLAG antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma; anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) and anti-EGFR (sheep polyclonal) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); and anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies and anti-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin and horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulin were obtained from Bio-Rad and Dako (Fort Collins, CO), respectively. Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Phenylarsine oxide was purchased from Sigma. The water-soluble, homobifunctional crosslinking reagents BS3 (spacer arm length 11.4 Å) and ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidyl succinate) (spacer arm length 16.1 Å) were obtained from Pierce. Generation of EGFR Mutant Constructs—Single point mutations of the wild-type EGFR were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template for each mutagenesis was the human EGFR cDNA (accession number x00588) (24Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J.

Automated nucleotide sequencing of each construct was performed to confirm the integrity of each EGF receptor mutation. Transfection of EGFR Constructs and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Wild-type and mutant EGFRs constructs were transfected into the interleukin-3-dependent murine hemopoietic cell line BaF/3 as described in Ref. 17Walker F. Hibbs M.L. Zhang H.H. Gonez L.J. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Transfected cells were selected in G418 for 10 days. Viable cells were screened for EGFR expression by FACS analysis on a FACStar (Becton and Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using antibodies to the FLAG tag (M2: 10 μg/ml in PBS, 5% FCS, 5 mm EDTA) and/or to the EGFR extracellular domain (mAb 528: 10 μg/ml in PBS, 5% FCS, 5 mm EDTA) followed by Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse Ig (1:400 final dilution). Background fluorescence was determined by incubating the cells with an irrelevant, class-matched primary antibody. Positive pools were sorted for the appropriate level of EGFR expression on a FACS-DIVA (Becton and Dickinson). After final selection, mRNA was isolated from each cell line, and all mutations in the EGFR were confirmed by PCR analysis. All cells were routinely passaged in RPMI, 10% FCS, 10% WEHI3B conditioned medium (25Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9312-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and 1.5 mg/ml G418. Ligand Binding—Murine EGF, purified from mouse submaxillary glands (26Burgess A.W. Lloyd C.J. Nice E.C. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was iodinated using IODO-GEN (27Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 5-8 × 105 cpm/pmol. Ligand binding to cells expressing the WT or mutant EGFR was determined at room temperature in the presence of the internalization inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (28Knutson V.P. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12139-12142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by cold saturation experiments as described in Ref. 17Walker F. Hibbs M.L. Zhang H.H. Gonez L.J. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. All experimental points were prepared in triplicate. At the end of the incubation, the cells were pelleted and washed twice in ice-cold PBS before transferring to fresh tubes for counting in a Wallac WIZARD γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Scatchard plots and estimates of ligand binding affinities and receptor numbers were obtained using the Radlig program (BioSoft, Cambridge, UK). Receptor Cross-linking, Tyrosine Phosphorylation, and MAPK Activation—BaF/3 cells expressing the WT or mutated EGFR were incubated in medium without interleukin-3 and FCS for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS, and incubated in PBS at room temperature with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. In cross-linking experiments, the cells were incubated with 1.3 mm BS3 or ethylene glycol-bis(sulfosuccinimidyl succinate) (Pierce) for 20 min at room temperature after PBS or EGF treatment. Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without reducing agent (100 mm β-mercapoethanol). Total cell lysates were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE on 3-8% Tris acetate or 4-12% bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes before immunodetection with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology; 1:1000 final dilution), anti-EGFR antibodies (sheep anti-EGFR; Upstate Biotechnology; 1:1000 final dilution) or anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies (1:1000 final dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse, anti-sheep, or anti-rabbit Ig, respectively (all at 1:3000 final dilution). Reactive bands were visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). To determine specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, membranes probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were stripped with a solution of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.1) and reprobed with anti-EGFR or anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies. The films were scanned on an Amersham Biosciences scanning densitometer, and band quantitation was performed with ImageQuant using wide line peak integration. Mitogenic Responses to EGF—Cells growing in log phase were harvested and washed three times to remove residual interleukin-3. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS and seeded into 96-well plates using the Biomek 2000 (Beckman) at 2 × 104 cells/200 μl and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. EGF was added to the first titration point and titrated in duplicate as 2-fold dilutions across the 96-well plate. [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added, and the plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before being harvested onto Unifilter 96 GF/c filter plates using an automatic harvester (all from Packard). The plates were air-dried for 1 h before the addition of scintillant (10 μl/well). Incorporated [3H]thymidine was determined using a β counter (TopCount; Packard). Reactivity with Conformation-specific Antibodies—Cells were preincubated with antibodies, EGF, or control medium prior to antibody staining and FACS analysis. Preincubation with antibodies (mAb 528, mAb 806, or a class-matched irrelevant antibody, all at 10 μg/ml) was carried out at 37 °C in RPMI, 10% FCS for times ranging from 30 min to 16 h. Preincubation with EGF (100 ng/ml in ice-cold FACS buffer) was carried out on ice for 20 min. After preincubation, cells were collected by centrifugation and stained with the control or test antibodies (all at 10 μg/ml in FACS buffer for 20 min on ice, washed in FACS buffer) followed by Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse Ig (1:400 final dilution, 20 min on ice). The cells were washed with ice-cold FACS buffer, collected by centrifugation, and analyzed on a FACScan; peak fluorescence channel and median fluorescence were determined for each sample using the statistical tool in CellQuest (Becton and Dickinson). Background (negative control) fluorescence was deducted from all measurements. The median fluorescence values were chosen as most representative of peak shape and fluorescence intensity and were used to derive the ratio of mAb 806 to mAb 528 binding. The aim of this work is to determine the role of CR1 loop/CR2 interactions on the conformational preferences, mechanism of activation, and signaling potential of the full-length, cell surface-expressed EGFR. We have introduced point mutations in the CR1 and CR2 domains, which would be expected to perturb the CR1/CR1 and/or CR1/CR2 interactions, and consequently alter the balance between the tethered, untethered, inactive, and/or active states of the EGFR. These constructs have been expressed in BaF/3, a hemopoietic cell line that, unlike the widely used 293 cells, does not secrete TGF-α or other EGFR ligands, is devoid of endogenous ErbB family members, and is therefore ideal for the biochemical characterization of the cell surface-associated EGFR (17Walker F. Hibbs M.L. Zhang H.H. Gonez L.J. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Walker F. Kato A. Gonez L.J. Hibbs M.L. Pouliot N. Levitzki A. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the effects of the mutations on the function of the EGFR by determining binding kinetics, dimerization, ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling, and the ability to induce DNA synthesis in an EGF-dependent manner. These parameters are, however, indirect measures of receptor oligomerization, configuration, or conformational changes; therefore, we have also used the binding of two conformationally specific anti-EGFR antibodies, mAb 528 (19Gill G.N.

A. 2003; 100: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), as a tool to assess the effect of mutations on the “resting” conformation of the EGFR and on the dynamics of ligand-induced conformational changes. Receptor Expression and Preliminary Characterization—Six point mutations have been analyzed in detail (see Fig. 1, A and B): three CR1 mutations at Tyr246 (Pro, Trp, and Asp) and three CR2 substitutions at Asp563 (to His), Glu578 (to Cys), and Val583 (to Asp). In an attempt to constrain the CR1/CR2 interaction with a disulfide link, we prepared a mutant with a substitution in each of CR1 and CR2 (Leu245 to Cys and Glu578 to Cys). After transfection in BaF/3 cells and selection in G418, receptor expression was monitored using the anti-FLAG antibody M2 as well as the monoclonal antibody 528, which is directed to the extracellular domain of the EGFR, blocks ligand binding (19Gill G.N.

Chem. 1984; 259: 7755-7760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is reported to recognize only the native form of the receptor. Based on the reactivity with these antibodies, all mutant receptors appear to be correctly folded and are expressed at the cell surface. After multiple rounds of FACS sorting, we obtained cell lines expressing similar levels (20,000-40,000 receptors/cell) of the mutant or WT EGFR (Fig. 2). It is essential that receptor expression is below 100,000 receptors/cell; transient expression experiments usually yield high levels of cell surface EGFR (>105/cell); however, at these levels of expression there often is spontaneous activation (i.e. ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation) of the EGFR; thus, we have sought to avoid this complication by producing cell lines expressing <50,000 receptors/cell.Fig. 2FACS analysis of BaF/3 cell lines stably expressing WT or mutant EGFR. Cells were incubated with mAb 528 followed by Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse Ig as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The plots represent fluorescence intensity on the abscissa and cell number per fluorescence channel on the ordinate.

The aim of this study was to develop a camptothecin-bombesin (CPT-BN) conjugate that interacts with all classes of BN receptors and possibly functions as a prodrug via a labile linker with site-specific cytotoxicity for cancer cells bearing these receptors. CPT was coupled to analogs of [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]BN-(6-14) (BA0) using carbamate linkers (L1 and L2) with built-in nucleophile-assisted releasing groups for intracellular cleavage of free cytotoxic agents. One conjugate, CPT-L2-BA3, bound to all three BN receptor classes with high affinity and functioned as a full agonist at each. 125ICPT-L2-BA3 was rapidly internalized by cells expressing each BN receptor class and, using fluorescent imaging, was found to co-localize with BN receptors initially and later to be internalized in cytoplasmic compartments. HPLC analysis of internalized ligand showed that 40% was intact, 25% was metabolized by releasing free CPT, and 35% was metabolized to other breakdown products. CPT-L2-BA3 inhibited the growth of NCI-H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cells in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and clonal growth assays. CPT-L2-BA3 was cytotoxic in an MTT assay for cells transfected with each class of BN receptor; however, it had significantly less effect in cells lacking BN receptors. These results indicate that CTP-L2-BA3 is a potent agonist that is cytotoxic for cells overexpressing any of the three BN receptor classes and functions as a prodrug for receptor-mediated cytoxicity. It therefore should be a useful prototype to explore the effectiveness of tumor-specific cytotoxicity delivery using a receptor-mediated mechanism.

It therefore should be a useful prototype to explore the effectiveness of tumor-specific cytotoxicity delivery using a receptor-mediated mechanism. In order to enhance tumor cytotoxicity and decrease side effects, there has been increased interest in the development of prodrugs that improve site-specific delivery of cytotoxic anti-cancer agents (1deGroot F.M.

Ther. 1999; 83: 67-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Prodrug conjugates have been described utilizing antibodies directed against specific tumor-associated antigens, hydrophilic polymers, and peptide or steroid hormones that interact with receptors overexpressed or ectopically expressed on the tumor (1deGroot F.M. Damen E.W. Scheeren H.W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 1093-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Dubowchik G.M. Walker M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 83: 67-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The goal of the prodrug is to deliver the therapeutic agent to the target cell, at which time a tumor-specific process (enzyme activity, specific cellular degradation, etc.) will site-specifically release the active drug (1deGroot F.M. Damen E.W. Scheeren H.W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 1093-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For peptide hormone receptor prodrugs, this requires coupling of the cytotoxic agent to a peptide hormone through a coupling mechanism that retains high affinity for the peptide hormone receptor and allows the cytotoxic drug to be released after receptor specific internalization and degradation (1deGroot F.M.

This analog binds with high affinity to each of the three BN receptor classes and is rapidly internalized by each class of BN receptors (11Mantey S.A. Weber H.C. Sainz E. Akeson M. Ryan R.R.

Schumuckli-Maurer J. Schaer J.C. Gugger M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1139-1146PubMed Google Scholar), and this ligand would still interact with high affinity with each. Furthermore, recently, a new novel carbamate linker system (3Fuselier J.A. Sun L. Woltering S.N. Murphy W.A. Vasilevich N. Coy D.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

This novel linker system (3Fuselier J.A. Sun L. Woltering S.N. Murphy W.A. Vasilevich N. Coy D.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) contains a built-in nucleophile-assisted releasing (BINAR) group that enables fine timing of intracellular cleavage rates of free cytotoxic agents containing reactive hydroxyl groups such as CPT or combretastatin (3Fuselier J.A.

In the present study, we have synthesized a number of CPT analogs coupled to universal bombesin agonists through different carbamate linkers (L1 and L2) to identify a potential general BN receptor cytotoxic prodrug. We have identified one analog, CPT-L2-BA3, which shows high affinity for all three mammalian BN receptors, is fully biologically active at each receptor, and is rapidly internalized by each receptor subtype. Furthermore, CPT-L2-BA3 is cytotoxic for NCI-H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, which possess native GRP receptors (13Moody T.W. Zia F. Venugopal R. Fagarasan M. Oie H. Hu V. J. Cell.

The ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture—NCI-H345 and NCI-H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). NCI-H1299 cells were split weekly 1:20 with trypsin-EDTA. NCI-H345 cells were diluted 1:1 into new media. Balb/c 3T3 cells stably expressing human BRS3 receptors (hBRS3), human NMB receptors (hNMBR), or human GRP receptors (hGRPR) made as described previously (11Mantey S.A. Weber H.C. Sainz E. Akeson M.

HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells (Balb/c 3T3 (mouse fibroblast), NCI-H345 (human SCLC), NCI-H1299 (human NSCLC), and HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were from ATCC, were mycoplasma-free, and were used when they were in the exponential growth phase after incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Preparation of Peptides—The peptide portions of the peptide-cytotoxin conjugates were synthesized by solid phase methods using the standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection strategy (3Fuselier J.A. Sun L. Woltering S.N. Murphy W.A. Vasilevich N. Coy D.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sequences were assembled on Rink amide resin (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY), and Trt group protection was employed for the imidazole NH of His, Boc for the indole NH of Trp, and tert-butyl group for the OH groups of Ser and Tyr. Bromoacetic acid was coupled to the N terminus of the protected peptide, which was then reacted with a 5 m excess of tertiary butyloxycarbonyl-1-N-methylamino,2-aminoethane (2 h). CPT (Roche Applied Science) was activated at its position 20 OH group by treating a suspension in anhydrous dichloromethane with dimethyaminopyridine (4 eq) and a 20% solution of phosgene in toluene (4 eq) (4 h) followed by removal of excess solvent and phosgene in vacuo. A 3 m excess of the resulting yellow oil was added to the above resin in anhydrous dichloromethane and allowed to react overnight. After washing and drying of the resin, the camptothecin-peptide conjugate was cleaved using the standard acid mixture, trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/ethanedithiol/triisopropylsilane, 95:2:2:1 (2 h), followed by evaporation of the trifluoroacetic acid and precipitation and washing of the peptide with ether. Conjugates were purified to >97% purity by preparative HPLC (C18 silica) and characterized by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. For the compounds shown in Fig. 1, BA0 had a calculated mass of 1133.3 and was found to have a mass of 1132.7; CPT-L1-BA1 had a calculated mass of 1661.8 and was found to have a mass of 1666.3; CPT-L2-BA1 had a calculated mass of 1675.5 and was found to have a mass of 1676.1; CPT-L1-BA2 (mixture of polymers) had an average mass of 3000; and CPT-L2-BA3 had a calculated mass of 1709.9 and was found to have a mass of 1709.1.

Briefly, 0.8 μg of IODO-GEN solution (0.01 μg/μl in chloroform) was added to a 5-ml plastic test tube, dried under nitrogen, and washed with 100 μl of 0.5 m potassium phosphate solution (pH 7.4 except for 125I-L2-BA3 and 125I-CPT-L2-BA3, which required pH 7.0). To this tube, 20 μl of potassium phosphate of the appropriate pH, 8 μg of peptide in 4 μl of water, and 2 mCi (20 μl) of Na125I were added and incubated for 6 min at room temperature (Na125I (2200 Ci/mmol) and myo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences). The incubation was stopped with 300 μl of water. For 125I-[d-Tyr0]NMB and 125I-[Tyr4]BN, which have COOH-terminal methionine groups, 300 μl of 1.5 m dithiothreitol was added and heated for 1 h at 80 °C. The radiolabeled peptides were separated using a C18 Sep-Pak (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) and further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column. The fractions with the highest radioactivity and binding were neutralized with 0.2 m Tris buffer (pH 9.5) and stored with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) at -20 °C. Binding of 125I-Labeled BN-related Peptides to Various Cells—Binding was performed as described previously (11Mantey S.A. Weber H.C. Sainz E. Akeson M. Ryan R.R. Pradhan T.K. Searles R.P.

The standard binding buffer contained 24.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 98 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm sodium fumarate, 0.01% (w/v) soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1% amino acid mixture, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% (w/v). Balb/c 3T3 cells stably expressing hGRPR (0.3 × 106), hNMBR (0.03 × 106), hBRS3 (0.3 × 106), or NCI-H1299 cells were incubated with 50 pm 125I-labeled ligand at 22 °C for 60 min. Aliquots (100 μl) were removed and centrifuged through 300 μl of incubation buffer in 400-μl Microfuge tubes at 10,000 × g for 1 min using a Beckman Microfuge B. The pellets were washed twice with buffer and counted for radioactivity in a γ counter. The nonsaturable binding was the amount of radioactivity associated with cells in incubations containing 50 pm radioligand (2200 Ci/mmol) and 1 μm unlabeled ligand. Nonsaturable binding was <10% of total binding in all the experiments. Receptor affinities (Ki) were determined using a least-square, curve-fitting program (KaleidaGraph) and the Cheng-Prusoff equation (16Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12259) Google Scholar). Internalization—Balb/c 3T3 cells stably transfected with hGRPR, hNMBR, or hBRS3 were incubated with radioligands as stated under “Experimental Procedures.” Internalization experiments were performed as described previously (14Benya R.V. Kusui T. Pradhan T.K. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 10-20PubMed Google Scholar, 15Benya R.V. Wada E. Battey J.F. Fathi Z. Wang L.H. Mantey S.A. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1058-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after the indicated incubation times, 100-μl samples were added to a 1.5-ml Microfuge tube with 1 ml of 4 °C acid-stripping solution containing 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.5) and 0.5 m NaCl to remove the surface-bound radioligand. After 5 min, the cells were pelleted, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed twice with incubation buffer. In all cases, parallel incubations were conducted in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand to determine changes in nonsaturable binding. Results are expressed as the percentage of saturable 125I-ligand added that is surface-bound (acid-stripped) or internalized (not acid-stripped). The internalization of 125I-CPT-BN conjugates was investigated in human NCI-H1299 NSCLC cells that naturally possess hGRPR (13Moody T.W. Zia F. Venugopal R. Fagarasan M. Oie H. Hu V. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1996; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 125I-CPT-L2-BA3 (50 pm) was incubated with NCI-H1299 NSCLC cells for 2 h at 4 °C. Two sets of cells were washed three times in receptor binding buffer to remove free peptide. One set was then treated with 0.5 m acetic acid and 0.15 m NaCl for 5 min at 4 °C to remove peptide bound to the cell surface. The supernatant was counted in a γ counter. A second set of cells was treated with 0.2 n NaOH to determine total binding at 4 °C. Also, two sets of cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and washed three times in receptor binding buffer to remove free peptide. One set was then treated with 0.5 m acetic acid and 0.15 m NaCl for 5 min at 4 °C to remove peptide bound to the cell surface. The supernatant was counted in a γ counter. A second set of cells was treated with 0.2 n NaOH to determine total binding at 37 °C. Characterization of Internalized Radioactivity—Balb/c 3T3 cells with no transfected bombesin receptors and Balb/c 3T3 cells stably transfected with hGRPR (2 × 106/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.4 nm 125I-CPT-L2-BA3 in standard binding buffer containing 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.02% (w/v) bacitracin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 50 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were then washed with standard binding buffer with protease inhibitors at 4 °C and underwent acid stripping to remove surface-bound ligand performed for 5 min at 4 °C with 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.5) and 0.5 m NaCl, as described under “Internalization.” After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of standard binding buffer with protease inhibitors containing 1% Triton X-100 (pH 6), and the resuspension was sonicated to solubilize the radioactivity. Nine hundred μl of the sonicated mixture was injected on an HPLC (Waters model 510, Milford, MA) equipped with a C-18 column and eluted with a linear gradient increasing at 0.8% acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) per min starting at 12% acetonitrile and ending at 80%. One-ml fractions were collected, and radioactivity in each fraction was determined by counting in a Packard γ counter. Measurement of [3H]Inositol Phosphates ([3H]IP)—Changes in total [3H]IP were measured as described previously (14Benya R.V. Kusui T. Pradhan T.K. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 10-20PubMed Google Scholar, 15Benya R.V. Wada E. Battey J.F. Fathi Z. Wang L.H. Mantey S.A. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1058-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hBRS3-, hGRPR-, or hNMBR-transfected Balb/c 3T3 cells were subcultured into 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in regular propagation medium and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were then incubated with 3 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol in growth medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h. Before assay, the 24-well plates were washed by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 ml/well of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) containing 20 mm lithium chloride. The wash buffer was aspirated and replaced with 500 μl of IP assay buffer containing 135 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm calcium chloride, 1.2 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm lithium chloride, 11.1 mm glucose, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and incubated with or without any of the peptides studied. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the experiments were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 1% (v/v) hydrochloric acid in methanol. Total [3H]IP was isolated by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (14Benya R.V. Kusui T. Pradhan T.K. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 10-20PubMed Google Scholar, 15Benya R.V. Wada E. Battey J.F. Fathi Z. Wang L.H. Mantey S.A. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1058-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were loaded onto Dowex AG1-X8 anion exchange resin columns, washed with 5 ml of distilled water to remove free [3H]inositol, and then washed with 2 ml of 5 mm disodium tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate solution to remove [3H]glycerophosphorylinositol. Two ml of 1 mm ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid solution were added to the columns to elute total [3H]IP. Each eluate was mixed with scintillation mixture and measured for radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Cytosolic Calcium [Ca2+]i Measurement—The ability of the CPT-BN conjugates to alter cytosolic [Ca2+]i was investigated as described previously (17Moody T.W. Venugopal R. Zia F. Patierno S. Leban J.J. McDermed J. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NCI-H1299 cells and NCI-H345 cells were harvested (2.5 × 106/ml) and incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells, which contained loaded Fura-2, were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min and resuspended at the same concentration in new SIT medium (RPMI 1640 containing 30 nm sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 10 μg/ml transferrin). After two washes with the same medium, cells were placed in a Delta PTI Scan 1 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) equipped with a magnetic stirring mechanism and temperature (37 °C)-regulated cuvette holder. The fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored at dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, using an emission wavelength of 510 nm prior to and after the addition of BN-like peptides. Proliferation Assays—Growth studies were performed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Growth studies in vitro were conducted using MTT (Sigma) colorimetric assays. NCI-H1299 cells, hGRPR-transfected Balb/c 3T3 cells, or Balb/c 3T3 cells (104/well) were placed in SIT medium (100 μl), and various concentrations of CPT-L2-BA3 were added. After 4 days, 15 μl (1 mg/ml) of MTT was added, and after another 4 h, 150 μl of Me2SO was added. After 16 h, the optical density at 570 nm was determined using an ELISA reader. The proliferation rates were calculated from the OD readings with various concentrations of CPT-L2-BA3 using the untreated cells as 100%. Clonogenic Assays—The effects of CPT-BN-containing peptides on the growth of NCI-H1299 and NCI-H345 cells were investigated using a clonogenic assay (18Mahmoud S. Staley J. Taylor J. Bogden A. Moreau J.P. Coy D. Avis I. Cuttitta F. Mulshine J.L. Moody T.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1798-1802PubMed Google Scholar). The base layer consisted of 3 ml of 0.5% agarose in SIT medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum in 6-well plates. The top layer consisted of 3 ml of SIT medium in 0.3% agarose (FMC Corp., Rockford, ME), CPT-BN conjugates, and 5 × 104 NCI-H1299 cells. Triplicate wells were plated; after 2 weeks, 1 ml of 0.1% p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet was added; and after 16 h at 37 °C, the plates were screened for colony formation. The number of colonies larger than 50 μm in diameter were counted using an Omnicon image analysis system. Preparation of HA-GRPR—The cDNA of the mouse GRPR used was identical to that described previously (14Benya R.V. Kusui T. Pradhan T.K. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 10-20PubMed Google Scholar, 19Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Pradhan T. Battey J.F. Kusui T. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2038436205,"Scaffold proteins of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have been proposed to form an active signaling module and enhance the specificity of the transduced signal. Here, we report a 2-Å resolution structure of the MAPK scaffold protein MP1 in a complex with its partner protein, p14, that localizes the complex to late endosomes. The structures of these two proteins are remarkably similar, with a five-stranded β-sheet flanked on either side by a total of three helices. The proteins form a heterodimer in solution and interact mainly through the edge β-strand in each protein to generate a 10-stranded β-sheet core. Both proteins also share structural similarity with the amino-terminal regulatory domains of the membrane trafficking proteins, sec22b and Ykt6p, as well as with sedlin (a component of a Golgi-associated membrane-trafficking complex) and the σ2 and amino-terminal portion of the μ2 subunits of the clathrin adaptor complex AP2. Because neither MP1 nor p14 have been implicated in membrane traffic, we propose that the similar protein folds allow these relatively small proteins to be involved in multiple and simultaneous protein-protein interactions. Mapping of highly conserved, surface-exposed residues on MP1 and p14 provided insight into the potential sites of binding of the signaling kinases MEK1 and ERK1 to this complex, as well as the areas potentially involved in other protein-protein interactions.

Eukaryotic cells respond to external stimuli through any of a number of signal transduction pathways. In general, transmembrane receptors are engaged by a ligand, setting off a series of specific protein-protein interactions. These interactions transduce the signal mainly by reversible protein phosphorylation of specific tyrosine or serine/threonine residues (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 2Kolch W. Biochem.

The kinases that make up the various branches of this pathway conform to a three-kinase module (3Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). One branch of the pathway responds to growth factors, leading to the activation of the MAPK kinase kinase (Raf). Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates the MAPK kinase (MEK1/2), which, in turn, phosphorylates the MAPK (ERK1/2) (2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 3Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Once activated, ERKs can phosphorylate a variety of substrates in different cellular locations (4Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the nucleus where they regulate the activity of several transcription factors (5Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar).Because many stimuli can lead to the activation of the MAPK pathway (6Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), a mechanism must exist to regulate the various branches in both a spatial and temporal fashion. One way this can be achieved is by the use of scaffolding proteins (7Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this class of proteins serves to prevent cross-talk among the different branches of the pathway (8Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), thus achieving a specific cellular response. In the Raf/MEK/ERK branch, scaffolds known to bind to MEK and ERK include KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras) (9Roy F. Laberge G. Douziech M. Ferland-McCollough D. Therrien M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), β-arrestin (10Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), and MP1 (MEK partner-1) (11Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). KSR is a family of large (∼70-100 kDa) proteins that translocate to the plasma membrane upon receptor activation. Binding of this scaffold to the membrane may be mediated by interaction with the γ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (12Bell B. Xing H. Yan K. Gautam N. Muslin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7982-7986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to this protein-protein interaction, KSR interacts with all kinases of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as well as with several other proteins (13Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 14Yu W. Fantl W.J. Harrowe G. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 56-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Stewart S. Sundaram M. Zhang Y. Lee J. Han M. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5523-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). β-arrestin, a protein of ∼45 kDa, can assemble a Raf/MEK/ERK complex (10Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and binds directly to the cytosolic domain of hepta-helical transmembrane receptors (16Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-arrestin is reported to bind to activated ERK1/2, thus preventing the kinase from entering the nucleus and directing its activity toward only cytosolic substrates (17DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar).MP1 is unique among the other scaffolds in this branch of the pathway for several reasons. First, its size of 14 kDa is much smaller than either of the other scaffolds, perhaps restricting the number of proteins with which it can interact. Second, although the functions of ERK1 and ERK2 are equivalent in most cases and the proteins have highly similar sequences (∼90% amino acid identity), MP1 favors the activation of ERK1 over ERK2 (11Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Finally, MP1 has not been reported to directly interact with the MAPK kinase kinase Raf.MP1 is localized to late endosomes via an interaction with an adaptor protein called p14 (18Wunderlich W. Fialka I. Teis D. Alpi A. Pfeifer A. Parton R.G. Lottspeich F. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although an MP1-MEK1 interaction can take place in the absence of p14, the MP1-ERK1 interaction is greatly reduced in the absence of the adaptor protein (19Teis D. Wunderlich W. Huber L.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mislocalization of p14 to the plasma membrane results in the formation of an MP1-p14 complex on this compartment, which fails to support signal transduction (19Teis D. Wunderlich W. Huber L.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both MAPK signaling and the levels of activated ERK are reduced in the absence of p14. Taken together, these results indicate that an intact and correctly localized MP1-p14 complex is required for MAPK signaling. The necessity of endosomal localization of the complex suggests the involvement of additional protein(s) in the activation of ERK.We now report the three-dimensional structure of the heterodimeric complex between MP1 and p14 at 2.0-Å resolution. The two proteins adopt a similar fold consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by three α-helices. The interaction between these proteins is primarily mediated by an edge-to-edge association of their β-sheets, creating a seamless 10-stranded sheet. Patches of highly conserved, surface-exposed residues on both proteins are likely sites for additional protein-protein interactions. This report presents the first known structure of a mammalian MAPK scaffold protein in a complex with one of its binding partners and lays the foundation for understanding how this small scaffold protein mediates several simultaneous interactions leading to a specific cellular response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of MP1 and p14 —Human MP1 was obtained by PCR amplification of a cDNA using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-AAAAAAGGATCCGCGGATGACCTAAAGCGATTCTT-3′ and 5′-AAAAAAGAATTCGGTACACACTGAAACCACTGTCAGA-3′ (the BamHI and EcoRI sites used for insertion in the vector are italicized). The resulting 400-bp fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the dual expression vector pETDuet-1 (Novagen) in which the first multiple cloning site had been modified to allow cloning, in-frame expression, and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage of the insert (kind gift from K. Baynton). This construct is designated pJW171.The cDNA of mouse p14 (which differs from the human ortholog at a single amino acid, S72N) was obtained by PCR amplification of a cDNA using the oligonucleotide pair 5′-AGCATATGCACCATCACCATCACCATCTGCGTCCCAAGGCTTTGACG-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCTTATGATGCTGCTACTTGGGT-3′ (the NdeI and BamHI sites used for insertion into the vector are italicized; the His6 tag used for purification is underlined). The resulting 403-bp fragment was first cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, WI) before removing the NdeI/BamHI fragment and subcloning into the NdeI/BglII of pJW171. The resulting dual MP1/p14 expression plasmid, designated pJW173, consists of the entire coding sequence of MP1 with an additional His8 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site at the amino terminus (MGSSHHHHHHHHENLYFQGS), as well as the entire coding region of p14 with the addition of a His6 tag at the amino terminus immediately following the initiator methionine.Cell Cultures—Bacterial BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmid pJW173 were used to inoculate 10 ml of the autoinducible Studier ZYP-5052 defined media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. 2F. W. Studier, Brookhaven National Laboratory, personal communication. The inoculum was added to 0.5 liters of Studier ZYP-5052 medium with ampicillin, and the cells were grown for 6 h at 37 °C before reducing the temperature to 20 °C. Growth was continued for 16 h at 20 °C before cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was stored at -20 °C overnight.Lemaster defined media was used for selenomethionine derivative (SeMet-labeled) protein production (20Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Media containing 25 μg/ml selenomethionine and 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a 100-ml pre-culture of the methionine auxotrophic DL41 Escherichia coli containing the plasmid pJW173. The culture was grown at 37 °C for 2 h, whereupon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After a 24-h induction at 20 °C, the cell pellet was harvested as described above.Protein Purification—Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 400 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and one tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet per liter of culture). After sonication on ice, Triton X-100 (to a final concentration of 0.1%) and 2 μl of Benzonase (Novagen) were added to the lysate. The lysate was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C in a type 60 Ti rotor. The supernatant was combined with 2 ml of a nickel (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. Binding took place on a rotating wheel for 1 h, after which the entire content was poured into a Poly-Prep Bio-Rad column. The resin was washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer (lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole). Proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 150 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 300 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was concentrated and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (HiLoad 16/60; Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 300 mm NaCl. The main peak was pooled, and the protein purity was tested by native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein solution was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 50 mm NaCl, concentrated, and used for crystallization experiments. The homogeneity of the protein solution was tested by dynamic light scattering using a DynaPro MSP-RII (Proterion Corporation, Piscataway, NJ).The SeMet-labeled protein was purified by the same procedure. The level of selenomethionine incorporation into the protein was determined using a LC/MS-ESI mass spectrometer (Agilent 1100 Series).Crystallization—Initial trials were performed by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with commercially available screens purchased from Hampton Research. The drop size was 0.8 μl of mother liquor and 0.5 μl of protein sample. Optimization trials were performed by the hanging drop method. 3 μl of the protein complex (3.7 mg/ml) were mixed with 1 μl of a reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, and 14% polyethylene glycol 3350). Within 2 days, the crystals grew to a typical size of 0.01 × 0.01 × 0.05 mm. Macroseeding was used to produce larger single crystals. Medium size crystals were washed in a diluted reservoir solution and transferred into a fresh drop (ratio 3:1; protein/reservoir solution). Plates with screw caps (Nextal Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) were used for macroseeding. These crystals belong to the space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 51.0, b = 64.1, and c = 73.2 Å.The purified SeMet-labeled protein was concentrated to 3.1 mg/ml. Crystallization trials were set up based on the optimum conditions used for native protein. Crystals for the SeMet-labeled protein grew on the surface of a native crystal seed. These crystals also belong to the space group P212121, but cell dimensions changed to a = 49.1, b = 64.9, and c = 74.5 Å.All crystals were cryoprotected in a solution containing 28% polyethylene glycol 3350, 12% glycerol and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5. Crystals were flash-frozen in a stream of N2 gas (100 K) on a goniometer head and used for data collection.Data Collection and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected at the X8C beamline, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using the Quantum-4 CCD detector. Three data sets at different wavelengths were collected from SeMet-labeled crystals to a highest usable resolution of 2.9 Å. Native crystals diffracted to 2 Å.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar) using three data sets from SeMet-labeled crystals. All four selenium sites were found, and the mean figure of merit (FOM) for phases after SOLVE was 0.46. Density modification was performed using RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and 58% of the main chain (145 residues) was automatically built. After RESOLVE, the mean figure of merit was 0.67.This model was then manually improved and completed to ∼70% of the main chain, refined as a rigid body, and used for molecular replacement against the native data set with REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13773) Google Scholar). Model improvement and building of the side chains were performed with ARP/WARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Finally, several loops were built manually using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar), and the model was refined with REFMAC5 to an R-factor of 0.201 and an Rfree factor of 0.271. The final model contains residues 1-119 of MP1, residues 3-118 of p14, and 230 water molecules. There was one heterodimer per asymmetric unit. The model has good geometry with no outliers as shown by PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the code 1SKO. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Structure of the MP1-p14 Complex—Both MP1 and p14 are of similar molecular mass, ∼13.5 kDa. They form a tight complex in the crystal (Fig. 1A). Whereas MP1 contains four methionines, p14 has none. Because the phasing was accomplished by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method from a SeMet-substituted complex, the two molecules were easily differentiated in the experimental electron density map. Both MP1 and p14 belong to α/β fold proteins with a central β-sheet flanked on both sides by α-helices. Quite unexpectedly, the fold of both proteins is very similar (Fig. 1, B and C). This was not foreseen, because no detectable sequence homology between these two proteins was noticed. Each molecule contains a slightly convex central five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with a strand order of 2↓-1↑-5↓-4↑-3↓. The polypeptide chain starts and ends with an α-helix (α1 and α3, respectively). These two helices are nearly antiparallel to each other and cover the convex face of the β-sheet. The concave face of the β-sheet is shielded by a long helix, α2, that runs diagonally across the strands. These three helices have a partial amphipathic character. The connections between the secondary structure elements are rather short, with somewhat longer loops connecting the α2 helix to the strands, in particular on the C-terminal side to the strand β3. The superposition of MP1 and p14 and the corresponding structure-based sequence alignment are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. These two molecules could be superimposed over 83 of 119 pairs of Cα atoms with a root mean square deviation of 1.6Å. The differences between the molecules are mainly in the conformation of the loop between helix α2 and strand β3 (Asp59-Ser67 in MP1 and Arg57-Asp66 in p14), which is more extended in p14, partly as a result of a shorter α2 and a shift of the C-terminal helix α3 by approximately half the helical pitch (Fig. 2A). The α2-β3 loop in p14 is also less well ordered in the crystal.Fig. 2Alignment of the MP1 and p14 structures. A, stereo view of the superposition of the backbones of MP1 and p14, showing their close structural similarity. The MP1 and p14 backbones are colored blue and yellow, respectively. Note the main difference between the α2-β3 loop region of both molecules, which is more extended in p14 (top of the figure). B, a structure-based sequence alignment of MP1 and p14, which indicates that there are only 17 identical residues in equivalent positions (*). The secondary structure is indicated above and below the MP1 and p14 sequences, respectively. C, a semi-transparent view of the surface near the aromatic cluster of MP1 (His44, Phe50, Tyr76, Tyr79, and Pro42). D, the corresponding surface on p14 (Thr39, Ile47, Cys75, Gly78, and Gly37), viewed from the same direction. Note the deep depression in the surface of p14 by virtue of the smaller side chain residues in this region. Panels A, C, and D were rendered with PyMol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The sequence identity between these two proteins based on the superposition of their three-dimensional structures is only 14%. Despite very similar backbone traces and virtually the same number of residues, the surface areas of MP1 and p14 are significantly different. The MP1 molecule has an area of 6712 Å2, whereas p14 has a larger area of 7351 Å2, indicating more cavities and protrusions in this protein. One particular area where the surface differences are pronounced is near the β3-β4 connection and the α2 helix; in MP1 there is a cluster of aromatic residues, namely His44, Phe50, Tyr76, Tyr79, and Pro42, filling the cavity (Fig. 2C), whereas in p14 these side chains are Thr39, Ile47, Cys75, Gly78, and Gly37, resulting in a deep depression in the surface (Fig. 2D).Characterization of the MP1-p14 Interface—The molecules of MP1 and p14 associate into a heterodimeric complex through an edge-to-edge (β3-β3) arrangement of their β-sheets that introduces a pseudo 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 1A) and creates a large 10-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The tips of strands β2 and β3 and the short loop connecting them fold inward in both molecules, creating a canyon-like surface along the β-sheet (Fig. 1A). The α2 helices from MP1 and p14 extend along this canyon in an antiparallel fashion, filling it completely and providing a relatively flat surface on this side of the complex. The direction of these two helices is approximately perpendicular to the α1 and α3 helices on the other side of the sheet. The residues that form the interface are located primarily within a contiguous stretch encompassing helix α2, strand β3, and the loop following this strand. Consistent with this observation is the finding that removal of residues 62-73 in MP1, encompassing a portion of the strand β3 and the preceding loop, prevents formation of the MP1-p14 complex. 3M. Weber, personal communication. The side chains involved in the interactions have a predominantly apolar character (Fig. 3). The intermolecular hydrogen bonds are, to a large extent, between the backbone atoms of the two β3 strands. Only four intermolecular hydrogen bonds between side chains are formed, namely Asn50... Gln60, Tyr55... Gln83, Asp66... Thr78, and Asp74... Lys70 in p14 and MP1, respectively. Several other residues are connected by water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The surface buried by the formation of the complex is 1221 Å2 on MP1 and 1219 Å2 on p14, corresponding to ∼17% of the total solvent accessible area of each molecule. An equal surface area buried on each molecule indicates a very good surface complementarity of the two molecules at their interface.Fig. 3The MP1-p14 interface. Stereo view of the MP1-p14 interface. The main chain and carbon atoms of MP1 and p14 are colored yellow and green, respectively. The side chains are colored by atom type for non-carbon atoms. Dashed lines show the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between MP1 and p14. N and C termini of main chain fragments are labeled with residue numbers.

This fold is not unique to MP1 and p14. A DALI search (27Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) revealed similarity between MP1/p14 and the following: (i) the amino-terminal regulatory domains of sec22b (1IFQ) (28Gonzalez Jr., L.C.

Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All of these close structural homologs belong to the superfamily of SNARE-like proteins according to the SCOP classification scheme (33Lo C.L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). MP1 aligns with these proteins with root mean square deviation values of 0.88-1.66Å over 47-73 Cα atoms, whereas p14 displays root mean square deviation values of 1.39-1.75Å over 54-60 Cα atoms.The MP1 and p14 proteins are most closely related structurally to the SNARE-like superfamily of proteins involved in protein trafficking. The basis for these structural similarities is unclear, as only sec22b and Ykt6p perform similar functions. Although the direct protein partners of sedlin are unknown, the protein is a component of a multiprotein complex (34Sacher M. Barrowman J. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Ferro-Novick S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to be involved in multiple protein-protein interactions (31Jang S.B. Kim Y.G. Cho Y.S. Suh P.G. Kim K.H. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49863-49869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, the SNARE proteins are involved in SNARE-SNARE interactions as well as in interactions with other components of the secretory pathway (35Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). The μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex interacts with tyrosine-based signals of various receptors, aiding in their clathrin-mediated endocytosis (36Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I.

https://openalex.org/W2149953491,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a component of the brain extracellular matrix environment that is synthesized and secreted by glioma cells. The primary cell surface receptor for HA is CD44, a membrane glycoprotein that is functionally regulated by a membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Both CD44 and MT1-MMP are partially located in Triton X-100-insoluble domains, but no functional link has yet been established between them. In the present study, we studied the regulation of HA cell surface binding in U-87 glioma cells. We show that an MMP-dependent mechanism regulates the intrinsic cell surface binding of HA as ilomastat, a broad MMP inhibitor, increased HA binding to glioma cells. HA binding was also rapidly and specifically up-regulated by 3-fold by type I collagen in U-87 cells, which also induced a significant morphological reorganization associated with the activation of a latent form of MMP-2 through a MT1-MMP-mediated mechanism. Interestingly, caveolae depletion with a cell surface cholesterol-depleting agent β-cyclodextrin triggered an additional increase (9-fold) in the binding of HA, in synergy with type I collagen. On the other hand, HA cell surface binding was diminished by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and by the overexpression of a recombinant, wild type MT1-MMP, whereas its cytoplasmic-deleted form had no effect. Taken together, our results suggest that MT1-MMP regulates, through its cytoplasmic domain, the cell surface functions of CD44 in a collagen-rich pericellular environment. Additionally, we describe a new molecular mechanism regulating the invasive potential of glioma cells involving a MT1-MMP/CD44/caveolin interaction, which could represent a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. Hyaluronan (HA) is a component of the brain extracellular matrix environment that is synthesized and secreted by glioma cells. The primary cell surface receptor for HA is CD44, a membrane glycoprotein that is functionally regulated by a membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Both CD44 and MT1-MMP are partially located in Triton X-100-insoluble domains, but no functional link has yet been established between them. In the present study, we studied the regulation of HA cell surface binding in U-87 glioma cells. We show that an MMP-dependent mechanism regulates the intrinsic cell surface binding of HA as ilomastat, a broad MMP inhibitor, increased HA binding to glioma cells. HA binding was also rapidly and specifically up-regulated by 3-fold by type I collagen in U-87 cells, which also induced a significant morphological reorganization associated with the activation of a latent form of MMP-2 through a MT1-MMP-mediated mechanism. Interestingly, caveolae depletion with a cell surface cholesterol-depleting agent β-cyclodextrin triggered an additional increase (9-fold) in the binding of HA, in synergy with type I collagen. On the other hand, HA cell surface binding was diminished by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and by the overexpression of a recombinant, wild type MT1-MMP, whereas its cytoplasmic-deleted form had no effect. Taken together, our results suggest that MT1-MMP regulates, through its cytoplasmic domain, the cell surface functions of CD44 in a collagen-rich pericellular environment. Additionally, we describe a new molecular mechanism regulating the invasive potential of glioma cells involving a MT1-MMP/CD44/caveolin interaction, which could represent a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. The principal molecules that have been identified in the normal brain extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EC, endothelial cell; EGCg, epigallocatechin-(3)-gallate; HA, hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, hyaluronate); MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Wt, wild type; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are hyaluronan (HA; also known as hyaluronic acid, hyaluronate) and chondroitin sulfate (1Asher R.

Sci. 1990; 100: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HA is an important glycosaminoglycan constituent believed to be implicated in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vasculature. Although the serum level of HA is already used as an indicator of progressive malignant disease (3Thylen A. Wallin J. Martensson G. Cancer. 1999; 86: 2000-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), its effects on in vivo angiogenesis and endothelial cell (EC) function are complex and have been reported to depend on HA concentration and molecular size (4Rooney P.

Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 187-201PubMed Google Scholar), low molecular weight HA stimulated EC proliferation, tubulogenesis (6West D.C. Kumar S. Ciba Found.

Dermatol. 1998; 103: 576-579Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, small HA polymers efficiently regulated CD44 cell surface functional expression and promoted tumor cell migration (9Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Astrocytic tumors of the central nervous system express CD44 among other cell adhesion receptors of the integrin or immunoglobulin superfamily. Although HA is the principal ligand of CD44, other CD44 ligands include the ECM components collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and chondroitin sulfate, whereas mucosal addressin, serglycin, osteopontin, and the class II invariant chain represent ECM-unrelated ligands of the molecule. CD44 is also implicated in the promotion of tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastatic potential in experimental and human cancers (10Gunthert U. Schwarzler C. Wittig B. Laman J. Ruiz P. Stauder R.

Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that CD44 provides a docking site for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 on the surface of melanoma and carcinoma cells and thus can indirectly contribute to pericellular proteolysis of types IV and V but not type I collagen (12Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Although several other cell surface receptors for HA have been reported, it has been shown that gliomas express significant levels of CD44 and that CD44 expression could be relevant in determining their highly invasive behavior (13Akiyama Y. Jung S. Salhia B. Lee S. Hubbard S. Taylor M. Mainprize T. Akaishi K. van Furth W. Rutka J.T. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 53: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Ranuncolo S.M. Ladeda V.

Several studies have revealed different molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating CD44-mediated processes. The most recent studies evaluated the role of CD44 in the rolling interaction of lymphoid cells with HA (15Gal I. Lesley J. Ko W. Gonda A. Stoop R. Hyman R. Mikecz K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11150-11158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the role of E-cadherin in CD44-mediated tumor invasion (16Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8661-8668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the role of intracellular Rho-mediated signaling leading to cytokine production and breast tumor progression (17Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Zhu H. Diedrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29420-29434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Moreover, molecular paradigms of cell migration that may be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis have also recently been highlighted by the common cell surface localization of CD44 with a membrane type (MT) 1-MMP at the leading edge of motile cells (lamellipodia) (18Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). These studies elegantly demonstrated that CD44 directed MT1-MMP to lamellipodia by associating with its hemopexin-like domain, and that cell surface MT1-MMP-mediated cleavage of CD44 subsequently played a critical role in promoting tumor cell migration. In addition, one other common feature between MT1-MMP and CD44 is that both partially localize within Triton X-100-insoluble and cholesterolenriched membrane domains (20Annabi B. Lachambre M.P. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Pagé M. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Puyraimond A. Fridman R. Lemesle M. Arbeille B. Menashi S. Exp.

Accordingly, the caveolar location of MT1-MMP has been suggested to provide a regulatory mechanism of glioma cells invasiveness by caveolin-1. Whether MT1-MMP, aside from its classical roles in cell migration, tubulogenesis, and activation of proMMP-2, also regulates CD44-mediated binding to HA is unknown. Moreover, very little is known about the common MT1-MMP/CD44 caveolar regulation of ECM protein recognition. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CD44 function in cells derived from a highly aggressive and vascularized brain tumor glioblastoma. Specifically, we addressed the importance of caveolae with respect to the potential MT1-MMP-dependent functional regulation of HA recognition/binding at the cell surface of glioma cells. More importantly, we provide the first evidence of a new regulatory cell surface functional cross-talk between MT1-MMP and CD44 that impacts on the ability of gliomas to bind HA. Finally, we show that type I collagen triggers an increased cell surface binding to HA in glioma cells, and that the cytoplasmic domain and caveolar location of MT1-MMP may in part regulate such effect through MAPK-dependent intracellular signaling. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new potential MT1-MMP/CD44/caveolin cross-talk that could regulate the invasive potential of glioma cells through their interaction with the brain ECM environment and that could represent a new potential target for anti-cancer therapies. Reagents—Agarose, (–)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCg), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), gelatin, β-cyclodextrin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), laminin-1, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). ilomastat (GM-6001) was from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), TRIzol reagent was from Invitrogen. FuGENE-6 transfection reagent and fibronectin were from Roche Diagnostics Canada (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Type I collagen was extracted from rat tail tendon according to classical protocols (24Silver F.H. Trelstad R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9427-9433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-CD44 R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (G44–26) and mouse IgG2bκ (clone 27–35) were from BD Pharmingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ). The anti-MT1-MMP polyclonal antibody AB-815, the anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody, the anti-ERK and anti-phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled hyaluronic acid (HA-FITC) and hyaluronic acid sodium salt were from CarboMer (San Diego, CA). The MEK inhibitor PD98059 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection Method—The U-87 glioma cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The MT1-MMP cDNA constructs were previously generated and validated by us (25Annabi B. Pilorget A. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. Wt encodes the full-length MT1-MMP protein (Met1–Val582); Δ1 encodes a protein, which lacks the entire C-terminal 20-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Met1–Phe562); ΔTM encodes a soluble secreted form of MT1-MMP, which lacks the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (Met1–Cys508). U-87 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA constructs using the nonliposomal formulation FuGENE-6 transfection reagent. Transfection efficiency was confirmed by Western blotting and zymography. All experiments involving these cells were performed 36 h after transfection. Mock transfections of U-87 cultures with pcDNA (3.1+) expression vector alone were used as controls. Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from monolayers of cultured U-87 cells using TRIzol reagent. One microgram of total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis, followed by specific gene product amplification with the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Primers for CD44s (forward, 5′-TTTGCCTCTTACAGTTGAGCCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTGCCATCACGGTTGACAATAG-3′) were derived from human sequences, and PCR conditions optimized so that the gene products were in the exponential phase of the amplification (94 °C for 2 min; then run for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; followed by a 7-min final elongation at 72 °C). PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Immunoblotting Procedures—Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in Trisbuffered saline (150 mm Tris, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.3% Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were further washed in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies (1/1,000 dilution) in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin, washed again in TBST, and followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1/10,000 dilution) in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Immunoreactive material was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada). Note that immunodetection of the recombinant MT1-MMP proteins was performed after a 30-s exposure to ECL, whereas that of the endogenous MT1-MMP required at least 2 min to obtain a significant signal. Gelatin Zymography—To assess the extent of functional recombinant MT1-MMP expression in transfected U-87 cells, we measured the activation of a latent, exogenous source of proMMP-2 by gelatin zymography as described previously (20Annabi B. Lachambre M.P. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Pagé M. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Beaulieu E. Kachra Z. Mousseau N. Delbecchi L. Hardy J. Béliveau R. Neurosurgery. 1999; 45: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot (20 μl) of the culture medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE in a gel containing 0.1 mg/ml gelatin. The gels were then incubated in 2.5% Triton X-100 and rinsed in double-distilled H2O. Gels were further incubated at 37 °C for 20 h in 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained in 10% acetic acid, 30% methanol in H2O. Gelatinolytic activity was detected as unstained bands on a blue background. All experiments were carried out with cells that had been serum-deprived by overnight incubation. Flow Cytometry Analysis and Fluorescein Isothiocyanate-labeled HA Binding Assay—Serum-deprived cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 with or without 5 mm β-cyclodextrin, 20 μm ilomastat, and 10 μm EGCg. For overnight treatments, serum-deprived cells were preincubated for 18 h at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 with 20 μm ilomastat. Cells were dislodged after brief trypsinization, washed extensively, resuspended in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 105 cells/ml, washed once with 0.1% PBS plus 0.1% BSA, and then incubated with 100 μg/ml HA-FITC for 1 h on ice with or without 100 μg/ml type I collagen. After washing with PBS/BSA, the cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS/BSA, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with the CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For assessment of cell surface CD44 expression, cells were detached from plates as described above and resuspended in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 106 cells/ml, washed two times, and blocked for 15 min at room temperature in PBS containing 5% inactivated fetal calf serum (PBS/FCS). The cells were then incubated in PBS plus 0.5% FCS with 0.5 μg/ml CD44 monoclonal antibody or mouse IgG2bκ at room temperature for 30 min, washed once, and resuspended in PBS plus 0.5% FCS. Results are expressed as the ratio of relative geometric mean values from the HA-treated cells to their untreated controls and are representative of three independent experiments. Extraction of Caveolae-enriched Membrane Fractions with Alkaline Carbonate, and Purification—Carbonate extraction was performed as described previously (27Gingras D. Gauthier F. Lamy S. Desrosiers R.R. Béliveau R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown to confluence in a F-75 dish and were washed twice in cold PBS. After aspiration of the PBS solution, 2 ml of 500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.0, was used to scrape the cells off the dish. The sample was transferred to a 5-ml polycarbonate tube and was homogenized with a Polytron instrument, followed by sonication. The resulting homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of 90% (w/v) sucrose prepared in 25 mm Mes, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 6.5) (MBS). The sample was then transferred to a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 35% (w/v) sucrose, 4 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose, both prepared in MBS lacking detergent). The samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g (39,000 rpm in a Beckman SWT-1 rotor) for 18 h at 4 °C. A light-scattering band was observed at the 5–35% sucrose interface. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and 20-μl aliquots from fractions 2–10 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Statistical Data Analysis—Data are representative of three or more independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's unpaired t test and was used to compare the relative HA cell surface binding of transfected or treated cells to untreated (mock or control) U-87 cells. Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant, and an asterisk (*) identifies such significance in each figure. HA Binding to U-87 Glioma Cells Is an MMP-regulated Event—Using flow cytometry, we first evaluated whether HA binding to U-87 glioma cells could be assessed. Because HA uptake/degradation was shown to occur at higher temperatures, we performed the FITC-labeled HA (HA-FITC) binding assay at 4 °C, at which no active internalization occurs (28Gustafson S. Forsberg N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Samuelsson C. Gustafson S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HA-FITC bound to the cell surface of glioma cells detached by trypsinization, as was demonstrated by the shift in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1, right panels, shaded plots). Similar levels of HA binding were obtained with cells detached by treatment with EDTA (data not shown). Excess nonfluorescent unlabeled HA is shown to compete for cell surface HA binding sites, as the shift in fluorescence is significantly diminished (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, an overnight (18 h) incubation of the cells with ilomastat, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor reported to block the activation of MT1-MMP (30Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and to tightly bind the recombinant catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (31Galardy R.E. Grobelny D. Foellmer H.G. Fernandez L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4715-4718PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bernardo M.M. Brown S. Li Z.H. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11201-11207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), resulted in an increase in basal HA binding (Fig. 1B). This observation suggests that a membrane-anchored MMP activity is involved in the long term regulation of the functional cell surface binding of HA because this effect could not be observed at a shorter time (1 h, see Fig. 5). Because such MMP-mediated regulation of HA binding has recently been shown to involve CD44 (19Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), we pre-incubated some U-87 cells with control IgG (Fig. 1C) or a blocking anti-CD44 antibody (Fig. 1D). The latter specific antibody inhibited CD44-mediated cell surface HA binding, but suggests that other alternate HA-binding cell surface molecules could also be involved because only partial inhibition was observed. Interestingly, whereas IgG had no effect on the ilomastat-induced HA cell surface binding, the anti-CD44 blocking antibody antagonized that increase in HA binding (data not shown). This further supports the cross-talk that links membrane-bound MMP activity to CD44 functions in binding HA.Fig. 5MMP-dependent mechanisms regulate the cholesterol depletion-induced up-regulation of HA cell surface binding in U-87 glioma cells. Serum-deprived U-87 glioma cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without 5 mm β-cyclodextrin to depleted plasma membrane cholesterol. Then 20 μm ilomastat or 10 μm EGCg were added to the cells in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml type I collagen. Cells were then trypsinized and 106 cells incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with HA-FITC. Flow cytometry was used to assess HA cell surface binding. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Type I Collagen Specifically Triggers HA Binding to the Cell Surface of U-87 Glioma Cells—To examine the effect and specificity of several matrix molecules on the binding of HA, we incubated glioma cells in the presence of several ECM proteins. Incubation of the cells with type I collagen triggered a significant, 2.5-fold increase in cell surface-associated HA binding (Fig. 2A), whereas neither fibronectin nor laminin had such an effect (Fig. 2B). Type I collagen treatment of U-87 cells also induced profound morphological changes (Fig. 2C). This cell morphology perturbation was accompanied by activation of a latent, secreted, soluble form of proMMP-2 into its active MMP-2 form, as assessed by gelatin zymography, and which activation was inhibited by ilomastat (Fig. 2D). Such activation by type I collagen was recently suggested to be mediated through an MT1-MMP process in cardiac fibroblasts (33Guo C. Piacentini L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46699-46708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether a similar MT1-MMP-dependent mechanism could functionally regulate HA cell surface binding in glioma cells was next investigated. MT1-MMP Overexpression Antagonizes HA Binding through CD44 Cell Surface Down-regulation—Aside from its well documented effect on proMMP-2 activation, MT1-MMP is also thought to be involved in CD44 regulation at the cell surface. However, the structure-function relationships of MT1-MMP to cellular HA binding are unknown. We transfected U-87 cells with cDNA constructs to overexpress three MT1-MMP recombinant forms. These were the full-length Wt MT1-MMP, the cytoplasmic-truncated domain (Δ1) MT1-MMP, and a complete cytoplasmic/transmembrane-domain truncated (ΔTM) MT1-MMP. All the MT1-MMP recombinant forms were overexpressed in cell lysates (Fig. 3A), but only the soluble ΔTM was secreted into the conditioned media (Fig. 3B). Moreover, only the plasma membrane-anchored Wt and Δ1 recombinant MT1-MMP forms were able to activate proMMP-2 (Fig. 3B), confirming that the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP is not required for this function, as previously documented by us (25Annabi B. Pilorget A. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gingras D. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Langlois S. Lachambre M.P. Annabi B. Béliveau R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas CD44 gene expression was not affected by overexpression of any of the recombinant MT1-MMP forms (Fig. 3C), only the Wt MT1-MMP recombinant protein was capable of down-regulating both the cell surface binding of HA as well as the CD44 cell surface protein expression. This was assessed by flow cytometry, quantified, and expressed as the ratio of relative geometric mean values from the respective cell conditions (Fig. 3D). Although total CD44 protein expression was not assessed in cell lysates, Wt-MT1-MMP expression did trigger, as previously demonstrated (18Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), CD44 shedding into the conditioned media of transfected U-87 cells (data not shown). The sum of these observations definitively proves that the intracellular portion of MT1-MMP, although not required for proMMP-2 activation, plays a crucial role in mediating the intracellular signaling necessary for CD44 cell surface expression and function. Cholesterol Depletion Increases the Cell Surface Binding of HA to U-87 Glioma Cells in Synergy with Type I Collagen—The recent finding that MT1-MMP and CD44 were partially localized within cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane domains (20Annabi B. Lachambre M.P. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Pagé M. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to evaluate the importance of this localization. Using β-cyclodextrin, we first showed that cholesterol depletion from U-87 cell plasma membranes did not modulate cell surface CD44 expression, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). Caveolae depletion of the cells did not modulate the expression of total plasma membrane-associated caveolin-1 in either Cos-7 epithelial or U-87 glioma cells, nor did it modulate total membrane-associated MT1-MMP in glioma cells (Fig. 4B). Cos-7 cells do not express endogenous MT1-MMP, and CD44 gene expression was not affected by either type I collagen or β-cyclodextrin treatments of U-87 cells (data not shown). A discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation further confirmed that, although total caveolin-1 or MT1-MMP protein expression was unaffected by a β-cyclodextrin treatment, cholesterol depletion triggered a redistribution of both MT1-MMP and caveolin-1 to the higher density fractions associated with low cholesterol content (Fig. 4C). More importantly, subsequent type I collagen treatment of caveolae-depleted glioma cells resulted in increased cell surface HA binding (Fig. 4D). The Type I Collagen-mediated Increase in HA Cell Surface Binding Is Regulated through a Caveolar Cell Surface-associated MMP Activity—We next evaluated whether the rapid, type I collagen-induced HA cell surface binding in glioma cells depleted of caveolae involved any caveolar cell surface-associated MMP activity. Glioma cells were thus co-incubated with either ilomastat or EGCg, a naturally occurring green tea catechin for which we have recently documented several crucial anti-angiogenic and anti-MMP in"
https://openalex.org/W2070383873,"Previous studies on the membrane-cytoplasm interphase of human integrin subunits have shown that a conserved lysine in subunits α2, α5, β1, and β2 is embedded in the plasma membrane in the absence of interacting proteins (Armulik, A., Nilsson, I., von Heijne, G., and Johansson, S. (1999) in J. Biol. Chem. 274, 37030–37034). Using a glycosylation mapping technique, we here show that α10 and β8, two subunits that deviate significantly from the integrin consensus sequences in the membrane-proximal region, were found to have the conserved lysine at a similar position in the lipid bilayer. Thus, this organization at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane (TM) domain seems likely to be general for all 24 integrin subunits. Furthermore, we have determined the N-terminal border of the TM domains of the α2, α5, α10, β1, and β8 subunits. The TM domain of subunit β8 is found to be 22 amino acids long, with a second basic residue (Arg684) positioned just inside the membrane at the exoplasmic side, whereas the lipidembedded domains of the other subunits are longer, varying from 25 (α2) to 29 amino acids (α10). These numbers implicate that the TM region of the analyzed integrins (except β8) would be tilted or bent in the membrane. Integrin signaling by transmembrane conformational change may involve alteration of the position of the segment adjacent to the conserved lysine. To test the proposed “piston” model for signaling, we forced this region at the C-terminal end of the α5 and β1 TM domains out of the membrane into the cytosol by replacing Lys-Leu with Lys-Lys. The mutation was found to not alter the position of the N-terminal end of the TM domain in the membrane, indicating that the TM domain is not moving as a piston. Instead the shift results in a shorter and therefore less tilted or bent TM α-helix. Previous studies on the membrane-cytoplasm interphase of human integrin subunits have shown that a conserved lysine in subunits α2, α5, β1, and β2 is embedded in the plasma membrane in the absence of interacting proteins (Armulik, A., Nilsson, I., von Heijne, G., and Johansson, S.

Each subunit has an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; aa, amino acids; MGD, minimal glycosylation distance. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; aa, amino acids; MGD, minimal glycosylation distance. region and a cytoplasmic domain. The human α- and β subunits constitute two unrelated protein families of 18 and 8 members, respectively (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).Integrins mediate cell adhesion to the pericellular matrix and to neighboring cells (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). In addition to the anchoring function, ligand binding to integrins generates intracellular signals required for several cellular processes, including cell migration and proliferation. The ability to bind ligands is regulated by mechanisms acting on the cytoplasmic part of the protein, an unusual receptor feature. Integrin activation by cytoplasmic signals has been shown to involve transmembrane conformational changes (3Takagi J. Petre B. Walz T. Springer T. Cell. 2002; 110: 599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 4Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Subsequent ligand binding induces further structural rearrangements, as monitored by exposure of new epitopes, in the extracellular as well as in the intracellular domains (5Leisner T.M.

The cytoplasmic protein talin was found to bind to the membrane-proximal region of the β1, β2, and β3 subunits and thereby activates the integrins (7Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Integrin activation has been shown to require separation of the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains from each other (9Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and this is presumably the way by which talin activates integrins. In addition, recent reports have suggested that the TM domains of the subunits mediate integrin clustering after ligand binding (12Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). TM domains therefore appear to contribute to signaling in both directions across the membrane rather than serving merely to connect the intra- and extracellular domains. Evidence for the important functions of integrin TM domains is further provided by their high degree of conservation within the integrin α- and β-protein families and also between species for individual subunits.Several models have been proposed to explain the transmembrane signaling of integrins. These are based on different types of movements of the TM domains, such as rotation, tilting, and piston movement (13Williams M. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H.

As a step toward the identification of the mechanisms used for outside-in and inside-out signaling, we have in the present study defined the borders of the TM domains from five selected integrin subunits. This information has allowed us to test the piston model for integrin α5β1.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymes and Chemicals—Unless stated otherwise, the enzymes were purchased from Promega, MBI Fermenta AB and New England Biolab. For PCR puReTaq™Ready-To-Go™PCR beads from Amersham Biosciences were used. PCR primers were from DNA Technology and TAG Copenhagen. DNA manipulations were made using the TOPO kit from Invitrogen, the Rapid Ligation kit from Roche Applied Sciences, and the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Ribonucleotides, the cap analogue m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, and [35S] Met were from Amersham Biosciences. Dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, plasmid pGEM1, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and amino acid mixture without methionine were from Promega. Spermidine was from Sigma.DNA Manipulations—The DNA sequence coding for the region containing the predicted TM domain of integrin subunits α2, α5, α10, β1, and β8 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from corresponding cDNAs. The following primers were used: for α2, α2TMs (5′-ATGATCACAGAGAAAGCCGAAG-3′) and α2TMas (5′-ATCATATGTTTTCTTTTGAAG-3′); for α5, α5TMs (5′-ATGATCACAGAAGGCAGCTATG-3′) and α5TMas (5′-ATCATATGGGAGCGTTTGAAG-3′); for α10 N-terminal, α10N-TMs (5′-ATGATCACACAGACCCGGCCTATCCT-3′) and α10N-TMas (5′-ATCATATGTTTCTTATGGGCAAAGAAGC-3′); for α10 C-terminal, α10C-TMs (5′-TTTATATTGATCACGGTTCAGACCCGGCCTATCC-3′) and α10C-TMas (5′-ATTTAATCATATGATTTCTTATGGGCAAAGAAGC-3′); for β1, β1TMs (5′-ATGATCACAGAGTGTCCCACTGG-3′) and β1TMas (5′-ATCATATGTCTGTCATGAATTATC-3′); for β8 N-terminal, β8N-TMs (5′-TTGATCACTTCAGAATGTTTCTCCAGC-3′) and β8N-TMas (5′-ATCATATGTATCACCTGTCTAATGATAAGGACTTTAAGC-3′); and for β8 C-terminal, β8C-TMs (5′-TTGATCACTTCAGAATGTTTCTCCAGC-3′) and β8C-TMas (5′-ATCATATGATATCACCTGTCTAATGATAAGGACTTTAAGC-3′). The sense primers introduced a BclI restriction site and the antisense primers an NdeI restriction site. In the primers β8N-TMas and β8C-TMas a nucleotide was changed without altering the amino acid sequence to avoid an unwanted BclI restriction site (marked in bold type). The pGEM1-based Lep vectors encoding the protein Lep (leader peptidase) with a glycosylation acceptor site at different positions have been described previously (18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amplified TM regions were cloned into the Lep vectors, replacing a transmembrane region in the translated leader peptidase (see Fig. 1). For α2 the amino acid residues 1126–1162 were inserted, for α5 residues 992–1029 were inserted, for α10 residues 1115–1154 were inserted, for β1 residues 722–760 were inserted, and for β8 residues 673–708 were inserted.The mutations L1023K in α5 TM and L753K in β1 TM (marked in bold type) were introduced using the following primers: α5L-Ks (5′-ATCCTCTACAAGAAGGGATTCTTCAAA-3′), α5L-Kas (5′-TTTGAAGAATCCCTTCTTGTAGAGGAT-3′), β1L-Ks (5′-CTGATTTGGAAAAAGTTAATGATAATT-3′), and β1L-Kas (5′-AATTATCATTAACTTTTTCCAAATCAG-3′). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM™ 310 Genetic Analyzer).Expression in Vitro—The Lep vector constructs were transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase and translated in reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of dog pancreas microsomes as described (19Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the bands were quantitated by phosphorimaging on a Fluorescent Image Reader FLA-3000 using the Image Reader 1.1 software. The extent of glycosylation of a given construct was calculated as the quotient between the intensity of the glycosylated band divided by the summed intensities of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated bands. In general, the glycosylation efficiency varied by no more than ±5% between different experiments. The “minimal glycosylation distance” (MGD), i.e. the number of residues between the acceptor site and the lipid bilayer required to reach half-maximal glycosylation efficiency, previously determined for poly-Leu TM segments (18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used to identify the water-lipid interface.RESULTSGlycosylation Mapping—The glycosylation mapping technique has previously been described in detail (18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay is based on the ability of the lumenally disposed endoplasmic reticulum enzyme oligosaccharyl transferase (20Dempski Jr., R.E. Imperiali B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to add a glycan to the Asn residue in Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) glycosylation acceptor sites in target proteins. The minimal number of residues between the end of the model transmembrane segment (25LV) composed of 25 consecutive leucines and one valine and flanked by polar residues and the acceptor Asn required for half-maximal glycosylation is ∼10 residues when the acceptor site is C-terminal to the TM segment and ∼14 residues when it is N-terminal to the TM segment (18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Using a glycosylation site scanning approach to identify the corresponding MGD for a TM segment of interest, one can thus estimate the position of this TM segment in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by comparison with the MGD for the model TM segment (15Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).To locate both the N- and C-terminal ends of integrin TM segments relative to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, TM regions of chosen integrin subunits were cloned into two series of vectors (boxes A and B in Fig. 1) based on the well characterized integral membrane protein Lep. The A series was used for determining the position of the C-terminal end, and the B series was used for determining the position of the N-terminal end of the TM segments. The vectors in each series differ only in the position of the glycosylation acceptor site relative to the TM segment. The constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence and absence of dog pancreas rough microsomes. The measured MGD values were used to estimate the positions of the chosen integrin TM segments in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by comparison with the 25LV model TM described above.Determination of N-terminal Borders of the Transmembrane Domain of Integrin Subunits—Five integrin subunits were selected for determination of the N-terminal border of their TM domains. α2, α5, and β1 were chosen as representatives of α and β subunits with TM domains typical for each of the two protein families, whereas α10 and β8 are examples of interesting deviations from the consensus sequences. For the analysis, segments of integrin subunits α2 (aa 1126–1162), α5 (aa 992–1029), α10 (aa 1115–1154), β1 (aa 722–760), and β8 (aa 673–708) were inserted into the B series vectors (Fig. 1).The results of in vitro transcriptions/translations of the constructs are summarized in Fig. 2. As expected, a rapid drop in glycosylation efficiency is seen when the acceptor site is moved closer to the TM segment (Fig. 2, B and C). For example, the glycosylation efficiency is reduced from 68% for the α2 TM domain in vector 14 (where the acceptor Asn is 14 residues upstream of Val1134) to 11% for same TM segment in vector 13 (where the acceptor Asn is 13 residues upstream ofVal1134; Fig. 2C). By comparison with the MGD value of 14 residues determined for the model 25LV TM described above (18Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the residue in the α2 TM domain located in the equivalent position in the membrane as the N-terminal Leu in the model segment is thus Val1134. We conclude that the N-terminal membrane border is approximately at Val1134 for α2, at Leu999 for α5, at Leu1123 for α10, at Pro731 for β1, and at Tyr682 for β8 (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Determination of the N-terminal borders of integrin TM segments.

The C-terminal part of the TM domain has been suggested to move out of the membrane either by sliding of the TM helices in a piston-like motion (13Williams M. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H.

In the piston model (A) the TM regions (red) are assumed to slide as a rigid piston through the membrane, moving the conserved lysine (K) of one or both subunits in and out of the membrane. In the coiled model (B) the two TM regions (red) are coiled around each other as a coiled coil. When uncoiled, the TM α-helices are too long to run perpendicular to the plasma membrane. Instead the C-terminal end of the TM region would be moved into the cytoplasm. In the tilting model (C) the TM regions adapt to the bilayer by tilting. Changes in the tilt angle will push the C-terminal end of the TM into the cytosol. The separation of the TM regions after talin binding is not included in these models because it is not clear in which conformation this occurs. If model B is correct, the coiled coil structure would correspond to a conformation before activation by talin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We have previously shown that the C-terminal end of the TM segment in β1 shifts relative to the membrane if a second lysine is introduced next to the conserved membrane-embedded lysine, i.e. by mutating Leu753 to Lys in β1 (15Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed whether the N-terminal end of the TM domain would move relative to the membrane when the C-terminal end is forced out of the membrane in this way. The MGD determination was repeated for α5 and β1 constructs carrying the L-to-K mutation at the C-terminal end (α5L1023K and β1L753K). The results show that no change in the position of the N-terminal end of α5 and β1 TM domains occurs (Fig. 5). Thus, the luminal N-terminal ends of the α5 and β1 TM segments do not move relative to the membrane when their C-terminal ends are forced out of the membrane on the cytoplasmic side.Fig. 5Comparison of N-terminal borders of the α5 and β1 TM segment with the borders of the α5L1023K and β1L753K TM segments. Glycosylation efficiencies of α5 and α5L1023K was analyzed in three different B vectors, and the same was done for β1 and β1L753K. As seen in the graph, the MGD values were not altered by the mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe role of the cytoplasmic domains of α and β subunits in integrin activation and signaling is well established (9Kim M.

Johansson S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), as well as for the membrane-proximal parts flanking the TM domains (8Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known what kind of molecular movements of the TM domains are linked to these events. To better understand the role of integrin TM domains, we previously determined the membrane-cytoplasm interface for α2, α5, β1, and β2 using an in vitro glycosylation mapping assay (15Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the transmembrane domain was found to include an additional 5–6 amino acids at the C-terminal end compared with earlier predictions; this result was subsequently confirmed by NMR studies of the β3 TM and cytoplasmic domains in dodecylphosphocholine micelles (26Li R. Babu C.R. Valentine K. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15618-15624Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A basic amino acid, which is conserved in all human integrin subunits residue, Arg in αV and β7 and Lys in all other subunits, is thus located in the plasma membrane in the absence of interacting proteins. A basic residue at this position is likely to influence interactions with membrane proteins and/or the orientation of the TM domain in the lipid bilayer.In the present study, the characterization of integrin TM domains has been extended with (i) determination of the C-terminal border of β1-associated subunit α10; (ii) determination of the N-terminal borders of α2, α5, α10, and β1; (iii) determination of both ends of the strongly divergent β8 TM domain; and (iv) a test of the validity of the piston model (13Williams M. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as a possible mechanism for propagating conformational changes across the plasma membrane.The amino acid motif (K/R)XGFFKR is present at the membrane-cytoplasm interface in all 18 integrin α subunits except α8 (KCGFFDR), α9 (KLGFFRR), α10 (KLGFFAH), and α11 (KLGFFRS). In view of the high degree of conservation of the motif, minor deviations such as those in α8 and α10 may be functionally significant. Analysis by the in vitro glycosylation assay showed that the α10 TM domain extends 1–2 amino acid residues further at the C terminus compared with the TM domain of other α subunits. This result is not unexpected considering the absence in α10 of the strongly charged dipeptide KR. Thus, the membrane-embedded lysine in α10 resides even deeper inside the membrane than in other α subunits.It is not obvious from the primary sequences where the N-terminal borders of integrin TM domains are located. The border has usually been predicted to be located 23 amino acids or more upstream of the conserved membrane-embedded lysine (e.g. Lys752 in β1) (27Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K.

Whether a protein substrate initiates insertion from its N or C terminus or in a random orientation has not been determined for any natural substrate. We used the labile enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is recognized by the proteasome via a 37-residue C-terminal tag, to answer this question. Three independent approaches were used to assess orientation as follows. 1) The 461-residue ODC protein chain was interrupted at position 305. The C-terminal fragment was degraded by purified proteasomes, but because processivity requires continuity of the polypeptide chain, the N-terminal fragment was spared. 2) A proteasome-inhibitory viral sequence prevented degradation when introduced near the C terminus but not when inserted elsewhere in ODC. 3) A bulky tightly folded protein obstructed in vivo degradation most effectively when positioned near the C terminus. These data demonstrate that the proteasome initiates degradation of this native substrate at the C terminus. The co-localization of entry site and degradation tag to the ODC C terminus suggests that recognition tags determine the site for initiating entry.

The co-localization of entry site and degradation tag to the ODC C terminus suggests that recognition tags determine the site for initiating entry. Flexibility of a polypeptide terminus may promote the initiation of degradation. Selective proteasome-mediated protein degradation plays a pivotal role in cellular life and function. The eukaryotic 26 S proteasome is an ATP-dependant, multisubunit, self-compartmentalizing protease (1Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). It performs regulated turnover of short-lived proteins involved in cell cycle control, cellular differentiation, signal transduction, and antigen presentation. It also ensures the efficient destruction of misfolded or aggregated proteins whose presence might damage the cell. The majority of proteins are targeted to the proteasome by the conjugation of multiple copies of ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid protein (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). These ubiquitin chains attach to one or more lysine residues of the proteasome substrate. A few proteins are degraded through cis-acting recognition signals that function independently of ubiquitin (3Orlowski M. Wilk S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome consists of a 20 S cylinder capped at one or both ends by a 19 S regulatory particle (1Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The proteolytic sites of the 20 S proteasome are sequestered in the interior of a nano-chamber formed by a stack of four seven-member rings. Entry into the chamber takes place through sites positioned at the central axis of the distal rings. A 19 S regulatory particle, containing six distinct but homologous ATPases and about a dozen other proteins, is juxtaposed to one or both ends of the 20 S proteasome. The regulatory particle is involved in substrate recognition, unfolding, and translocation into the proteolytic chamber. Because the entry portals of the 20 S cylinder are narrow, proteins must be in an unfolded state if they are to be threaded into the proteolytic chamber (4Matouschek A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we consider whether a substrate protein assumes a preferred orientation when entering the proteasome. In the simplest case, one end of the substrate polypeptide chain, either the N or C terminus, is recognized as the exclusive or strongly preferred site of entry. This end engages the portal, entry begins, and the rest of the protein then follows continuously, until ingestion and degradation are complete. In this model, merely specifying a privileged end of the polypeptide chain suffices as a complete description of orientation and processivity. Is this a generally adequate description of how proteasomes interact with genuine native substrates? Or do these behave instead according to less constrained models? Is directionality indeed restricted and processivity sustained? Although a variety of experimental approaches have previously been used to investigate these questions, they have employed artificially constructed model proteins (5Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Turner G.C. Varshavsky A.

Science. 2002; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) rather than those that are folded native substrates of the proteasome. In the present studies we have investigated the processing of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AZ1, antizyme 1; CHX, cycloheximide; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; GAr, glycine-alanine repeat sequence; HA, hemagglutinin; MTX, methotrexate. a rapidly degraded native substrate of the eukaryotic proteasome (10Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Its degradation does not utilize ubiquitin conjugation. The terminal 37 amino acids of ODC constitute a proteasome recognition signal that mimics polyubiquitin and that can function when artificially appended to other proteins (11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We constructed variants of ODC and used these to determine whether the C terminus, the structural element for proteasome recognition of ODC, is also the site of entry. Three independent experimental approaches showed that degradation of ODC begins at the C terminus. Plasmid Construction—All plasmid constructions utilized standard molecular biology techniques (12Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Constructions that utilized PCR steps were verified by sequencing; constructions that relied on restriction-ligation utilized fully sequenced constituents. Primer sequences are available on request. Vectors for expression of mouse ODC in Escherichia coli were generated from vector pQE30 (Qiagen) as described (11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) the CEN/ARS plasmid p414ADH, containing a TRP1 selectable marker, was used for expression of ODC proteins under control of an ADH promoter (13Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Recombinant ODC with the polypeptide interrupted at residue 305 was produced in E. coli using the pQE30 (Qiagen) plasmid encoding a bi-cistronic message (14Osterman A. Lueder D. Quick M. Myers D. Canagarajah B. Phillips M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The vector sequence provides an in-frame His6 tag. ODC codons 306–461 followed the His6 tag and were placed upstream of ODC codons 1–305. The ODC-coding regions were connected (by splice overlap extension PCR) through an 18-nucleotide untranslated linker region (TAAGAGGAGAAATTAACT) containing a TAA stop codon immediately after ODC codon 461 and a ribosome binding site. A construct with a C-terminal five-residue truncation and one with His6 on the N-terminal fragment (instead of the C-terminal fragment) were similarly made. The above linker region was omitted to make topologically inverted ODC, in which the chain is interrupted at 305 and residue 461 is connected to residue 1. ODC activity and its inhibition by AZ1 was measured as described (15Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mouse ODC containing internal insertions of a Gly-Ala repeat or DHFR (ODCN::GAr and ODCN::DHFR fusion proteins, where N = the position of insertion) were each made by a two-step process. In the first step, common to both classes of fusion proteins, splice overlap PCR extension was used to create ODC with additional unique MluI and NdeI restriction endonuclease sites corresponding to regions near the N terminus (between codons 32 and 33), near the C terminus (between codons 424 and 425), or near the middle (between codons 297 and 298) of the protein. The MluI and NdeI restriction sites were used for in-frame insertion of modules encoding the required glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) or DHFR proteins. ODCN::GAr constructs were made as described (16Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8635-8641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The synthetic protein module inserted into ODC encodes the following (single-letter amino acid code): GSTR (GAr linker 1)-DYKDDDDK (FLAG epitope)-AGAGGGAGAGGAGGAGGAGAGGAGAGGGAG (Gly-Ala repeat)-YP-YDVPDYA (HA tag)-HMID (GAr linker 2). The 30-residue GA repeat is identical to the amino acid sequence of human EBNA-1 protein, strain B95–8, GI:59074, residues 196–225 (17Laux G. Perricaudet M. Farrell P.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Baer R. Bankier A. Biggin M. Deininger P. Farrell P. Gibson T. Hatfull G. Hudson G. Satchwell S. Seguin C. Tuffnell P. Barrell B. Nature. 1984; 310: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). ODCN::DHFR constructs were made similarly. Inserts encoding human DHFR were PCR-generated using the plasmid pKT7HDR (19Schweitzer B.I. Srimatkandada S. Gritsman H. Sheridan R. Venkataraghavan R. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20786-20795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The sense primer contained a flanking MluI restriction site followed by a short peptide linker arm and a FLAG epitope tag. The antisense primer contained a flanking NdeI site followed by a short peptide linker arm and a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. The PCR fragment was cut with MluI and NdeI restriction endonucleases and ligated into the equivalent positions in the ODC constructs containing unique MluI and NdeI sites. This resulted in the insertion of a module consisting of DHFR flanked by linkers and epitope tags as follows: GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (DHFR linker 1)-DYKDDDDK (FLAG epitope)-(DHFR protein, 187 residues)-YPYDVPDYA (HA tag)-GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (DHFR linker 2). ODCN::DHFR fusion proteins with a truncation at the C terminus were made similarly using a C-terminal PCR antisense primer that had the 5 terminal codons of ODC deleted. Recombinant Substrate Preparation, in Vitro Degradation by Proteasomes—Expression, purification, and 35S-radiolabeling of proteins in E. coli for preparation of proteasome substrates and purification of proteasomes from rat liver were done exactly as described (11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Assays of the degradation of 35S-labeled ODC and variants were performed in a volume of 30 μl at 37 °C and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, an ATP regenerating system (2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.6 mg/ml creatine phosphate), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 nm rat 26 S proteasomes. At time point 0, 1, and 2 h, 10-μl aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were fractionated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (for chain-interrupted ODC) or 10% gels (for all other ODC variants). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Yeast Growth and Harvesting—Yeast expression vectors carrying ODC::DHFR fusion proteins were transformed into strain Y13 (Matα his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 spe1Δ::hisG spe2Δ::LEU2), a polyamine auxotroph with a mutation in the endogenous SPE1 ODC gene. 1 μm spermidine was added to cultures to support growth. Transformation, cell growth at 30 °C, and preparation of extracts were as previously described (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide Chase Experiments—Yeast cultures expressing each ODC::DHFR fusion protein or FLAG-ODC were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 0.5–0.8) at 30 °C. A cycloheximide chase was initiated by adding cycloheximide (CHX) to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Cells additionally treated with 20 μm methotrexate (MTX, Sigma) were preincubated with that reagent for 30 min before the addition of CHX. After preparation of cell extracts, protein concentration was determined (protein assay reagent, Bio-Rad), and 15 μg of protein extract per lane was fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. ODC::DHFR fusion proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with mouse anti-FLAG M2 primary antibody (Sigma, 1:2,000 dilution), sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:15,000 dilution), and the Amersham ECL detection kit. After stripping, immunoblots were reprobed with rabbit anti-HA primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000) and goat anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Sigma, 1:15,000). Metabolic Labeling of Yeast and Immunoprecipitation—Pulse-chase experiments were carried out as previously described (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 20 μm MTX was added to stabilize the DHFR portion of each ODC::DHFR fusion protein as required. SDS-PAGE autoradiogram band intensity was quantitated by scanning and analyzing with TotalLab Version 2.00 software (Phoretix) in fully automatic mode using rolling circle background subtraction. Thermolysin Protection Experiments—Yeast cells were pulse-labeled as described above and then immediately harvested and lysed. ODC::DHFR fusion proteins were affinity-purified with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel by incubation for 2 h at 4° C on a rocking platform. The buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fusion proteins were eluted in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 mm CaCl2 containing 150 ng/μl FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h at 4° C. 0, 5, 100, or 1000 ng thermolysin (Sigma) was added to 16 μl of immunopurified sample. MTX was added to a concentration of 20 μm as required. After digestion at 25° C for 30 min, SDS loading buffer was added, and samples were heated to 100° C for 5 min and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Chain Interruption—We interrupted the 461-residue ODC polypeptide at residue 305 by co-expressing two proteins in E. coli, one containing amino acids 1–305 and the second containing amino acids 306–461. Previously published observations (14Osterman A. Lueder D. Quick M. Myers D. Canagarajah B. Phillips M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) led us to expect that the two protein fragments would self-assemble into active ODC enzyme. This proved to be true; affinity purification (using a His6 tag positioned before either residue 1 or residue 306) yielded an enzymatically active protein containing both component polypeptides (Table I) that was reactive with antizyme 1 (AZ1), an endogenous regulator of ODC turnover (21Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13138-13141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon incubation with purified rat 26 S proteasomes under conditions that promote ATP-dependent degradation, proteolysis of intact ODC depended on AZ1 and was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1A), as previously described (11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When ODC(1–305 + 306–461) with an interruption of the polypeptide chain at position 305 (and His6 positioned before residue 306) was incubated under identical conditions, the C-terminal 306–461 fragment was degraded by rat 26 S proteasomes, but the N-terminal 1–305 fragment was not (Fig. 1B). Altering the position of the His6 tag from residue 306 to residue 1 did not change this outcome (results not shown). A 37-residue C-terminal truncation, which stabilizes native ODC, also stabilized the C-terminal fragment of the interrupted ODC (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that the presence of an artificial end (at residue 306, whether or not preceded by His6) is not sufficient to initiate processing of fragment 306–461. When continuity of the interrupted ODC-(1–305 + 306–461) protein was restored by joining residue 461 (the terminal amino acid of native ODC) to residue 1, the resulting topologically inverted single-chain protein was also enzymatically active and reactive with AZ1 but was not degraded (Fig. 1D). This confirms that the free N terminus at residue 306 cannot be used to initiate the processing of interrupted ODC and demonstrates that a free C terminus at residue 461 is required for initiating degradation. This series of experiments demonstrates in a reaction using purified components that chain continuity is needed to sustain processive degradation from beginning to end of ODC and that the process begins in the C-terminal portion of the protein.Table IActivity and AZ1 inhibition of ODC and interrupted chain variantsProteinApproximate purityODC activity% Inhibition by AZ1%μm/h/mg proteinA>9012080B>909575C>9010879D∼705572 Open table in a new tab Virus-derived Inhibitory Sequence Inserts—We recently reported (16Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8635-8641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that a viral sequence (22Leonchiks A. Liepinsh E. Barishev M. Sharipo A. Masucci M.G. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) composed solely of 30 glycine and alanine residues (GAr) inhibits proteasome degradation when inserted after ODC residue 424 (ODC424::GAr). In yeast cells the proteasome removes ∼20, 30, or 45 amino acids from the C terminus of ODC424::GAr, and degradation halts just short of the viral sequence. Using purified rat proteasomes and the reaction conditions described in Fig. 1, we also reported that insertion of the GAr at ODC position 424 inhibits in vitro degradation. Because the insertion of GAr does not perturb the initiation of degradation (16Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8635-8641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this result is consistent with a process of ODC degradation that begins at the C-terminal end and can be impaired by the presence of the repeat sequence near that end. To further test this, we compared the effect of inserting GAr after ODC residue 32, 297, or 424. We carried out these experiments both in vitro and in yeast cells. As previously reported, GAr insertion at position 424 prevented in vitro proteolysis. In marked contrast, insertion at positions 32 or 297 had no apparent effect; degradation of ODC32::GAr and ODC297::GAr was unimpaired (Fig. 2). The observed position-dependent inhibition of degradation by GAr is consistent with a degradation process that begins at the C-terminal end. A similar position-dependent inhibitory effect was seen when these constructs were expressed in yeast. In yeast, ODC424::GAr proteolysis initiates but then halts before reaching the repeat sequence (16Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8635-8641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, ODC32::GAr and ODC297::GAr were fully degraded in yeast (results not shown). Thus, both in vitro and in vivo results using GAr inserts are consistent with C-terminal initiation of degradation. Position-dependent Obstructive Inserts—Bulky adducts that interfere with proteasome processing or insertion can be used to obtain information about the direction and processivity of degradation by the proteasome (structural prediction algorithms suggest and NMR studies demonstrate (22Leonchiks A. Liepinsh E. Barishev M. Sharipo A. Masucci M.G. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that a viral GAr assumes an unfolded conformation and, therefore, cannot inhibit by creating a bulky obstruction to insertion). A suitable candidate for providing an obstruction should fold into a globular form, should not impair folding of the “host” protein when embedded in it, and should be stabilized (hence forming a more effective obstruction) when bound by a small ligand. DHFR is a well characterized molecule that fulfills these requirements (11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Thrower J.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Its folding properties are well characterized, and it can be stabilized by the ligand MTX (25Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A DHFR cassette was made that consisted of DHFR flanked on its N terminus by a FLAG epitope and on its C terminus by a HA tag. In addition, a linker was added at each end to form an additional separation between ODC and DHFR. We inserted this module after the same three positions described above, 32, 297, or 424, to form ODC32::DHFR, ODC297::DHFR, and ODC424::DHFR; these contain inserts positioned, respectively, near the N terminus, the middle, or the C terminus of the protein. All three regions chosen for insertion are disordered in the crystal structure (26Almrud J.J. Oliveira M.A. Kern A.D. Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), are poorly conserved, and should tolerate bulky inserts that do not obstruct formation of the ODC homodimer, the active form of the enzyme. Each of the three proteins containing the DHFR insert was expressed in yeast, as was a control ODC without insert but carrying a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus. We needed first to determine whether DHFR within the fusion proteins could fold properly and be stabilized by MTX. We used resistance to thermolysin proteolysis to test the integrity of folding. ODC::DHFR fusion proteins were purified from yeast and treated with various amounts of thermolysin, and the digestion products were examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The MTX-treated samples containing each of the three ODC::DHFR fusion proteins yielded a band with slightly less mobility than that of DHFR. Samples not treated with MTX or ODC without DHFR (results not shown) did not produce this band. All fusions showed similar protection (the thermolysin digest product was less highly labeled than the full-length parent protein because there are 22 methionines in the fusion protein versus only six in DHFR). We conclude that each of the three engineered ODC proteins contains a DHFR moiety in a native configuration competent to bind MTX. To assess protein stability in vivo, we used Western blot analysis with antisera to FLAG or HA epitope tags (which flank DHFR) and measured the extent of change in protein levels after treatment for 1 h with CHX, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. FLAG-ODC without DHFR served as a control. Cells were additionally treated with MTX or were left untreated to determine whether ligand-mediated stabilization of DHFR conformation could impair degradation. All three fusion proteins were efficiently degraded in the absence of MTX, as was the FLAG-ODC control (Fig 4A). However, when cells were preincubated with MTX for 30 min before the addition of CHX and maintained in MTX during the CHX chase period, a difference in degradation patterns among the fusion protein was seen. ODC424::DHFR was made fully stable by MTX. In contrast, degradation of ODC32::DHFR was only slightly impaired by MTX, and ODC297::DHFR not at all impaired. The changes in protein level are quantified in Fig. 4B. Similar results were observed using antiserum to the HA epitope tag (results not shown). The position-dependent effect of insertion of stabilized DHFR provides further evidence for a C- to N-terminal directionality of degradation. Metabolic pulse-chase analysis was used to further test the effect of DHFR position on turnover (Fig. 5, A and B). The experiment was performed with MTX present in the medium for 30 min before metabolic labeling. Over a chase period of 1 h the degradation of ODC424::DHFR was slower and less extensive than that of ODC32::DHFR or ODC297::DHFR. The pulse-chase data are, thus, consistent with the findings using CHX chase and Western blot analysis. Inserting DHFR has some inhibitory effect regardless of its position; turnover of ODC32::DHFR and ODC297::DHFR is somewhat prolonged, with a half-life of about 30 min, compared with that of ODC with no DHFR, for which the half-life is about 8–15 min in yeast cells (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is important to show that the degradation of composite ODC::DHFR proteins follows the proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-independent pathway normal for ODC and is not due to unrelated intracellular protease activity in yeast or to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal proteolysis associated with protein misfolding. The C-terminal 37-amino acid tail of ODC is a critical signal for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome. Moreover, deletion of just the terminal 5 amino acids abrogates degradation (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Ghoda L. Sidney D. Macrae M. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, a five-amino acid deletion at the C terminus was introduced into each ODC::DHFR fusion protein, and CHX chase was used to examine their degradation (Fig. 6). Unlike the corresponding full-length fusion proteins, the truncated forms were stable regardless of whether MTX was added or not. Full-length FLAG-ODC was efficiently degraded, whereas FLAG-ODC was also stabilized by the C-terminal deletion. Therefore, because the intact ODC C-terminal domain provides a signal specific for the normal mode of ODC turnover (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we conclude that the degradation of full-length ODC::DHFR fusion proteins utilizes that pathway. The proteasome must coordinate at least three tasks to degrade a native protein substrate: recognition, unfolding, and insertion. Recognition usually takes place through a polyubiquitin chain. The degradation signal of ODC cross-competes with polyubiquitin for proteasome recognition (11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); it thus presents the proteasome with a molecular mimic of the ubiquitin chain. The 37-amino acid C-terminal tail of ODC constitutes a physiologically functional signal for proteasome degradation (10Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 11Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P.

Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mammalian proteasomes recognize this as an association signal; interaction of ODC with the protein AZ1, a negative feedback regulator of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway initiated by ODC, improves proteasome-substrate binding about 8-fold. Because the structural features of ODC required for its proteasome interactions are well characte"

The goal of this study was to identify proteins that interact with endothelial-derived GATA transcription factors. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified hematopoietically expressed homeobox (Hex) as a GATA-binding partner in endothelial cells. The physical association between Hex and GATA was confirmed with immunoprecipitation in cultured cells. Hex overexpression resulted in decreased flk-1/KDR expression, both at the level of the promoter and the endogenous gene, and attenuated vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated tube formation in primary endothelial cell cultures. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Hex inhibited the binding of GATA-2 to the flk-1/KDR 5′-untranslated region GATA motif. Finally, in RNase protection assays, transforming growth factor β1, which has been previously shown to decrease flk-1 expression by interfering with GATA binding activity, was shown to increase Hex expression in endothelial cells. Taken together, the present study provides evidence for a novel association between Hex and GATA and suggests that transforming growth factor β-mediated repression of flk-1/KDR and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling involves the inducible formation of inhibitory Hex-GATA complexes.

The endothelium displays remarkable diversity in health and disease. Endothelial cell phenotypes are modulated in space and time by mechanisms that involve the highly coordinated combinatorial action of transcriptional modules (1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The GATA family of transcription factors consists of six members (GATA-1 to -6). Of the various GATA factors, GATA-2, -3, and -6 are expressed in vascular endothelial cells (2Umetani M. Mataki C. Minegishi N. Yamamoto M. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Initially, these transacting factors were believed to play a singular role in the differentiation of endothelial cells during development (3Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev.

Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recently, studies have provided evidence that GATA factors also function as “immediate early genes,” coupling changes within the extracellular environment to changes in downstream target gene expression (6Musaro A.

In addition to binding directly to their consensus motif (A/T)GATA(A/G), GATA factors have been shown to participate in a wide array of protein-protein interactions with Zinc finger type transcription factors, including SP1, EKLF, RBTN2, ER, and GATA itself (8Gregory R.C.

Taken together, these data suggest that GATA transcription factors are involved in highly complex regulatory pathways and that the dissection of these networks may provide valuable insight into the transcriptional control of endothelial phenotypes. To that end, the goal of the present study was to identify partner proteins that interact with GATA factors in endothelial cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we describe a physical interaction between GATA family of transcription factors and the homeobox protein Hex. The interaction between Hex-GATA is associated with reduced GATA binding activity and transcriptional activity, decreased expression of the GATA-2 target gene, flk-1/KDR, and secondary attenuation of VEGF-mediated 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); HEK, human embryonic kidney; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; UTR, untranslated region; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; IRES, internal ribosome entry sites; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); HEK, human embryonic kidney; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; UTR, untranslated region; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; IRES, internal ribosome entry sites; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. signaling. Finally, we present data supporting the notion that TGF-β exerts its anti-angiogenesis effect by a Hex-GATA-flk-1/KDR-dependent mechanism. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics, La Jolla, CA) were cultured in EGM-2 MV medium (Clonetics). Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) and COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. HUVEC were used within the first eight passages. Plasmids—The construction of the flk-1/KDR-luc, flk-1/KDR (GATA mut), and flk-1/KDR (SP1 mut) plasmids were previously described (30Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human GATA-2 expression plasmid (pMT2-GATA2) was a kind gift from Dr. Stuart H. Orkin (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Human GATA-3 and -6 and Hex cDNA fragments were amplified using PCR from reverse-transcribed HUVEC total RNA. To generate the Hex expression vector, Hex cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). To generate the plasmids expressing Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) fused with GATA-2, -3, and -6, each of the three GATA cDNA fragments was inserted into pGBKT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). To construct the plasmid expressing Gal4 activation domain (GAD) fused to Hex, the Hex cDNA fragment was subcloned into pGAD424 (Clontech). To generate a FLAG-tagged Hex (pFLAG-Hex) and FLAG-tagged GATA-2 (pFLAG-GATA2), Hex and GATA-2 cDNA fragments were subcloned into pFLAG (Sigma), respectively. For construction of pGEM-hflk, a 266-bp human flk-1/KDR cDNA fragment was amplified from reverse-transcribed HUVEC total RNA and subcloned into pGEM-T-easy (Promega). Similarly, pGEM-hHex and pGEM-hGAPDH were derived by ligating a 296-bp human Hex cDNA fragment and a 283-bp human GAPDH fragment into pGEM-T-easy. Orientation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and β-Galactosidase Assays—A HUVEC cDNA library was constructed using a two-hybrid cDNA library construction kit (Clontech). AH109 yeast were transfected sequentially with the GATA-6 bait vector and cDNA library and then spread on synthesized dropout medium plate in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. After 5 days of incubation at 30 °C, colonies complemented by histidine autotrophy were isolated and confirmed to be positive by β-galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer's instruction (Clontech; yeast protocols handbook). The plasmids from the positive colonies were purified, and the inserts were subsequently sequenced. To analyze the protein-protein interaction, Y190 yeast were co-transfected with pGAD-Hex and a plasmid in which GBD was fused either with GATA-2, -3, and -6. Similarly, Y190 yeast were co-transfected with pGBD-GATA2 and a plasmid containing GAD fused with Hex. The cells were spread and incubated on the synthesized dropout medium plate without tryptophan and leucine. Transfection of COS-7 Cells and Immunoprecipitation Assays— COS-7 cells were co-transfected with either pFLAG-Hex and pMT2-GATA2, or pFLAG-GATA2 and pcDNA3-Hex expression plasmids using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as instructed by the manufacturer. Two days later, the transfected cells were freeze-thawed three times and incubated for 30 min on ice with cell lysis buffer (0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The resulting mixture was then mixed and incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immobilized beads were washed five times with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer containing 1.5% IGEPAL CA-630. Each sample was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated either with anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-GATA-2 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA). Alternatively, subconfluent HUVEC (2 × 107 cells) were harvested for nuclear extracts according to the mild nitrogen cavitation method (31Brock T.G. Paine 3rd, R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to keep intact the protein-protein associations. 1 μg of nuclear extracts was precleaned by centrifugation with 4 μg of control IgG (Santa Cruz). The resulting supernatant was incubated with 30 μg of agarose-conjugated anti-GATA-2 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-267 AC) or an identical amount of isotype-matched mouse control IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-2343) overnight at 4 °C. The immobilized samples were separated and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then probed for Hex and GATA-2 by Western blot analysis, using anti-Hex antibody (generated by Dr. Tamio Noguchi, Japan) and anti-GATA-2 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-16044, and generated by Dr. Stuart H. Orkin, Harvard Medical School, Boston), respectively. The complexes were visualized with an ECL advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and RNase Protection Assays—HUVEC were serum-starved in EBM-2 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. 18 h later, HUVEC were treated with 2.5–10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Peprotec, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 18 h (for Hex) or 24h (for flk-1/KDR). Alternatively, HUVEC were infected with adenoviruses encoding the IRES-mediated green fluorescence protein (EGFP) (Adeno-Blank) or IRES coupled to Hex and EGFP (Adeno-Hex). Adeno-Blank and Adeno-Hex were generated with a ligation into adenovirus cosmid vector and a co-transfection into HEK-293 (32Chiba T. Kogishi K. Wang J. Xia C. Matsushita T. Miyazaki J. Saito I. Hosokawa M. Higuchi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1319-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 24 h. HUVEC were harvested for total RNA at the times indicated, using the Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene). For in vitro transcription, flk-1/KDR-, Hex-, and GAPDH-specific 32P-labeled riboprobes were synthesized from pGEM-hflk, pGEM-hHex, and pGEM-hGAPDH, respectively. Riboprobes were synthesized using SP6 (for flk-1/KDR and GAPDH) or T7 (for Hex) RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX) and purified with a G-50 spun column (Amersham Biosciences). RNase protection assays were performed with a RPA III kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of HEK-293 Cells or HUVEC and Analysis of Luciferase Activity—HEK-293 cells and HUVEC were transfected as described previously (30Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, either 2 × 105 cells/well of HEK-293 cells or 1 × 105 cells/well of HUVEC were seeded onto 12-well plates 18–24 h before transfection. 0.05 pmol of the luciferase reporter plasmid (either KDR-, KDR (GATA mut)-, or KDR (SP1 mut)-luc), 50 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega), 0.075 pmol of the GATA expression vector and either 0.0375 or 0.075 pmol of Hex expression vector were incubated with 2 μl of FuGENE 6. As a negative control, empty vector (pMT2 and pcDNA3) was transfected instead of GATA-2 and Hex expression vector, respectively. 24 h later for HEK-293 cells and 48 h later for HUVEC, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). Sandwich Tube Formation Assays—400-μl aliquots of type-I collagen gel (Koken) containing EGM-2 MV medium (Clonetics) without basic fibroblast growth factor were added to 24-well plates and allowed to gel for 1 h at37 °C. HUVEC infected with Adeno-Blank or Adeno-Hex were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h in 5% CO2. The medium was removed, and the HUVEC were covered with 400 μlofthe gel. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with 1 ml of EGM-2 MV media in the absence of basic fibroblast growth factor, in the presence or absence of SU1498 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Two days later, a branched capillary network was visualized under a microscope. Images from at least three different areas in each well were captured by a digital camera under a microscope. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (30Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment and purified by spun column (Amersham Biosciences). 10 μg of HUVEC nuclear extracts were incubated with 10 fmol of 32P-labeled probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 3 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA) for 20 min at the room temperature, followed by 30 min at 4 °C. The following oligonucleotides sequences were used for probes: 5′-UTR GATA motifs, 5′-GGCAGCCTGGATATCCTCTCCTA-3′; GATA-mut motifs, 5′-GGCAGCCTGTTTAAGCTCTCCTA-3′; flk-1/KDR SP1 motifs, 5′-GGTGAGGGGCGGGGCTGGCCGC-3′; and flk-1/KDR SP1-mut motifs, 5′-GGTGAGGTTCGGTTCTGGTTGC-3′. To test the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with monoclonal antibody to GATA-2 (we prepared from the antigen GATA-2 (amino acids 9–258)) or polyclonal antibody to p65 (Santa Cruz) for 30 min at the room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). The loaded gel was fixed with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid and then imaged by BAS-1800 (Fuji Film, Japan). The signals were quantified with NIH Image. Identification of Hematopoietically Expressed Hex as a GATA-interacting Protein by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The GATA family of transcription factors has been implicated not only in the early differentiation of endothelial cells but also in the transduction of extracellular signals in the adult endothelium. Several members of the GATA family have been identified in endothelial cells, including GATA-2, -3, and -6. Previous studies have shown that GATA-1 and -2 interact with partner proteins in erythroid and megakaryocyte cells (34Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Our goal was to identify the proteins that interact with GATA transcription factors in endothelial cells. To that end, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system in which full-length human GATA-6 served as bait. From a screen of 8.6 × 106 clones, a total of 58 clones demonstrated histidine auxotroph. After elimination of false positives, 16 clones were selected, one of which encoded a fragment (amino acids 75–270) of Hex (Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of interaction between Hex and GATA-6, constructs containing the Gal4-activating domain fused with full-length Hex (pGAD-Hex) and either the Gal4-binding domain fused with GATA-6 (pGBD-GATA6) or the Gal4-binding domain alone (pGBD) were co-expressed in yeast AH109. As shown in Fig. 1B, co-expression of pGAD-Hex and pGBD-GATA6 resulted in a 4.2-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity compared with co-expression of pGBD and pGAD-Hex. We next wished to determine whether Hex interacts with human GATA-2 and -3. To that end, pGAD-Hex was co-expressed in yeast AH109 with constructs containing the Gal4-binding domain fused either with GATA-2 or -3 (pGBD-GATA2 or GATA3, respectively) As shown in Fig. 1C, co-expression with human GATA-2 and -3 resulted in 5.8- and 4.7-fold induction of the β-galactosidase activity, respectively, compared with co-expression with Gal4-binding domain alone (pGBD). Taken together, these results suggest that Hex interacts with GATA-2, -3, and -6. Physical Interaction between Hex and GATA-2 in Mammalian Cells—Having identified the interaction between GATA and Hex in the yeast two-hybrid system, we wished to determine whether this interaction occurs in mammalian cells. Of the various members of the GATA family of transcription factors, GATA-2 is expressed most abundantly in cultured endothelial cells (data not shown) and is believed to play a predominant role in endothelial cell biology. Therefore, we chose to focus on the interaction between Hex and GATA-2. To that end, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for human GATA-2 (pMT2-GATA2), FLAG-tagged human GATA-2 (pFLAG-GATA2), FLAG- or Myc-tagged human Hex (pFLAG-Hex or pMyc-Hex), or vector alone (pMT2, pMyc or pFLAG) and then processed for immunoprecipitation. The transfected cells expressed high levels of GATA-2 and Hex (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1–3). In co-transfections (pMT2-GATA2 and pFLAG-Hex), GATA-2 co-precipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 6, closed arrowhead) but not with the nonimmune control (Fig. 2A, lane 7). In contrast, in experiments in which either (pMT2-GATA2 and pFLAG) or (pMT2 and pFLAG-tagged Hex) were transfected, GATA-2 did not co-precipitate (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, in cotransfections (pFLAG-GATA2 and pMyc-Hex), Myc-tagged Hex co-precipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2B, lane 6, closed arrowhead). Although in experiments in which either (pFLAG and pMyc-Hex) or (pFLAG-GATA2 and pMyc) were transfected, Hex did not co-precipitate (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). Next, we wished to identify the physical interaction between endogenous GATA-2 and Hex in endothelial cells. To that end, nuclear extracts were prepared and processed for immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitations. As shown in Fig. 2C, endogenous GATA-2 and Hex were detected in nuclear extracts from HUVEC but not COS-7. Endogenous Hex was co-precipitated with anti-GATA2 antibody but not with isotype-matched control IgG (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). In semi-quantitative calculations from two independent experiments, anti-GATA-2 antibody immunoprecipitated 75.2% of total GATA-2 in HUVEC. Moreover, 8.29% of total cellular Hex was physically associated with GATA-2. Collectively, these findings suggest that GATA-2 and Hex specifically interact with one another in cultured endothelial cells. Hex Inhibits GATA-2-mediated flk-1/KDR Promoter Activity—We next wished to study the functional relevance of the interaction between GATA-2 and Hex. We have previously shown that GATA-2 binds to a GATA motif in the 5′-UTR region of the flk-1/KDR promoter and that this effect is necessary for full expression (35Minami T. Rosenberg R.D. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5395-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Hex on GATA-2-mediated activation of flk-1/KDR, transactivation assays were carried out in HEK-293 cells (nonendothelial cells) and HUVEC (endothelial cells) co-transfected with KDR-luc (–115 and +296 flk-1/KDR coupled to luciferase) and an expression plasmid containing either human GATA-2 (pMT2-GATA2) or Hex (pcDNA3-HEX). As a negative control, the cells were co-transfected with vector alone (pMT2 or pcDNA3). Consistent with our previous findings, the basal level of flk-1/KDR promoter activity in HEK-293 cells was significantly transactivated by 4.2-fold with overexpression of GATA-2 (Fig. 3A). GATA-2-mediated stimulation of promoter activity was completely abrogated by co-expression of Hex in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, overexpression of Hex did not change the basal level of the promoter activity (Fig. 3A). In HUVEC, a high level of flk-1/KDR promoter activity (8.7-fold higher than SV40 promoter plus enhancer construct (pGL2-control), not shown) occurred, and overexpression of GATA-2 resulted in 2.8-fold transactivation of the promoter (Fig. 3B). More importantly, overexpression of Hex resulted in huge reduction of the flk-1/KDR promoter activity (15.9-fold compared without expression of GATA-2 and Hex). Co-expression of GATA-2 failed to recover the Hex-mediated attenuation of the flk-1/KDR promoter activity (2.3-fold induction compared Hex expression alone) (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the Hex-mediated down-regulation of the promoter activity was mediated by the 5′-UTR GATA motif on the flk-1/KDR gene, either the GATA element or the SP1 element (as a control) point-mutated plasmid was transfected into HUVEC. KDR promoter activity from SP1 point-mutated plasmid was down to 63.1% and markedly reduced to 3.4% by the co-expression with Hex. In contrast, the promoter activity from GATA point-mutated plasmid was down to 33.1%, whereas there was no significant reduction in the presence of Hex (Fig. 3B). Previous studies have shown that Hex directly binds to a consensus element (5′-CAATTAAA-3′) in the promoter region of its target genes, resulting in transcriptional activation (36Crompton M.R. Bartlett T.J. MacGregor A.D. Manfioletti G. Buratti E. Giancotti V. Goodwin G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5661-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A search of the 4-kb 5′-flanking region and 3-kb first intron of the flk-1/KDR failed to reveal such a motif. Taken together, these results suggest that Hex represses the GATA-mediated flk-1/KDR promoter activation. Hex Suppresses flk-1/KDR mRNA Expression in Primary Human Endothelial Cells—To determine whether Hex modulates the expression of the endogenous flk-1/KDR gene, HUVEC were infected with adenovirus expressing either IRES-mediated-EGFP (Blank) or IRES-mediated-rat Hex and EGFP (Hex) at a multiplicity of infection of 20. Using this approach, over 80% of the cells were infected as determined by EGFP expression. Western blot assays of infected cells demonstrated high levels of Hex protein (Fig. 4A). More importantly, overexpression of Hex in HUVEC resulted in a 85% reduction (mean of three independent experiments) in flk-1/KDR mRNA by RNase protection assay (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4 and 5). These findings indicate that Hex suppresses flk-1/KDR activity not only at the level of the promoter but also at the level of the endogenous gene. Hex Inhibits Binding of GATA-2 to the flk-1/KDR 5′-UTR GATA Motif—Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that Hex inhibits flk-1/KDR expression by interfering with GATA binding to the 5′-UTR. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays in which nuclear extracts derived from HUVEC either expressing IRES-mediated EGFP (Adeno-Blank) or IRES-mediated Hex and EGFP (Adeno-Hex) were incubated with a radiolabeled probe spanning the 5′-UTR GATA motif (+98 to +122). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), incubation of nuclear extract from Adeno-Blank infected HUVEC with the 32P-labeled probe resulted in the appearance of two specific DNA-protein complexes (closed and open arrows). These DNA-protein complexes were inhibited by the addition of 10-, 100-, and 500-fold molar excess unlabeled self-competitor (Fig. 5A, lanes 3–5) but not by 500-fold molar excess GATA mutant competitor (Fig. 5A, lane 6). The mobility shift pattern was identical in Hex-overexpressing cells (the more slowly migrated complexes designated with the open arrows appeared with longer exposure time). However, Hex overexpression resulted in a significant reduction (54.2% reduction by densitometry) in the intensity of the GATA-binding complexes (Fig. 5, A, compare lanes 3–5 and 9–11, and B, compare lanes 1 and 2). As previously reported, the DNA-protein complexes were inhibited by preincubation with the anti-GATA-2 antibody (34Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In contrast, the complex was"

In this study, we have investigated the effects of CpG ODNs on latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in human T cells. Treatment of the latently infected T cell line ACH-2 with CpG ODNs 2006 or 2040 stimulated HIV replication, whereas no effects were evident when ODNs without the CpG motif were used. CpG-induced virus reactivation was blocked by chloroquine, indicating the involvement of TLR9. In contrast to the responsiveness of ACH-2 cells, CpG ODNs failed to activate HIV provirus in the latently infected Jurkat clone J1.1. We also studied the effects of CpG ODNs on productive HIV infection and found enhancement of viral replication in A3.01 T cells, whereas again no stimulating effects were observed in Jurkat T cells. CpG ODN treatment activated NF-κB in ACH-2 cells, which was similarly triggered in uninfected A3.01 T cells following exposure to CpG ODNs, indicating that TLR9-induced signal transduction was not dependent on proviral infection. Our study demonstrates that CpG ODNs directly trigger the activation of NF-κB and reactivation of latent HIV in human T cells. Our results point to a novel role for CpG ODNs as stimulators of HIV replication and open new avenues to eradicate the latent viral reservoirs in HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy.

Stimulating the immune system during HIV infection may not only be useful in enhancing antiviral immune responses but may also resolve the problem of viral latency in antiviral treatment. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has had impressive results in the past few years, effectively suppressing virus replication in many patients and reducing virus titers to below clinical detection limits (20Gulick R.M.

However, as soon as antiviral therapy is interrupted, the virus load increases again, requiring HIV patients to receive life-long maintenance therapy (23Wong J.K. Hezareh M. Gunthard H.F. Havlir D.V.

A3.01 and Jurkat cells were infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB/LAI at an multiplicity of infection of 1.0 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) per cell. Chloroquine (Calbiochem) was dissolved in RPMI, and TPA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) (Calbiochem) and ionomycin (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO. Final Me2SO concentration in the experiments was below 0.05%. PTO-ODNs—Phosphothioate-modifiend (PTO)-oligodeoxynucleotides (MWG-Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany) were of high purity salt-free purified quality and dissolved in H20 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The following sequences were used (CpG motifs are underlined): CpG ODN 2006, TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT; Non-CpG ODN 2006 4xTG, TTGTTGTTTTGTTGTTTTGTTGTT; CpG ODN 2040, CTGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCTGG; non-CpG ODN 2041, CTGGTCTTTCTGGTTTTTTTCTGG. Flow Cytometry—To determine expression of HIV p24 and TLR9, cells were fixed with 4% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% saponin. Expression of HIV-p24 was detected with the mouse anti-HIVp24 mAb 183-H12–5C (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Expression of TLR9 was detected with the mouse anti-TLR9 mAb 26C593 (BioCarta, Hamburg, Germany). As a second antibody, we used a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Markers were set according to staining with an isotype-matched control antibody (DAKO). NF-κB EMSA—Following stimulation, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing in a high salt, Nonidet P-40 buffer on ice for 15 min (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 350 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad microassay. 10 μg of total protein was incubated with 0.5 ng of radiolabeled, double-stranded NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide sc-2505 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). The probe was end-labeled with [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and purified on a G-50 Sephadex quick spin column (Roche Applied Science). The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 20 min in a 20-μl volume (15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), Complete protease inhibitor). DNA-binding complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1) gel containing 0.4× Tris-borate-EDTA, dried and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax film. For specificity analysis, 100-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide or the mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide sc-2511 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. To confirm the composition of the DNA-binding complexes, antibodies against Rel A (sc-109X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p50 (sc-1190X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were preincubated with the extracts for 30 min on ice before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For densitometric quantification of NF-kB activation, the intensity of NF-κB bands as compared with background was determined with the software Quantity One (Bio-Rad). In this study, we have analyzed the effects of CpG ODNs on latent HIV infection in human T cells. We have exposed latently infected ACH-2 cells to different CpG and non-CpG phosphothioate ODNs and measured HIV-p24 production by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Under normal conditions, ACH-2 cell cultures produce only low amounts of virus with the majority of cells remaining in a latently infected state. Following an appropriate stimulus, transcription of the provirus begins, and cells start to produce HIV (32Folks T.M. Clouse K.A. Justement J. Rabson A. Duh E. Kehrl J.H. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2002; 19: 19Google Scholar). Treatment of ACH-2 cells for 24 h with CpG ODN 2006 resulted in a significant increase of cells producing HIV (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with CpG ODN 2040. Non-CpG sequences, such as ODN 2041 or a mutated analog of ODN 2006, in which all cytidine residues are exchanged for thymidine (ODN 2006 4xTG), did not stimulate HIV replication, indicating that the observed effects were sequence-specific for CpG sites and not related to phosphothioate modification of the ODNs. CpG-triggered reactivation of HIV was dose-dependent as shown for CpG ODN 2006 (Fig. 1B). The kinetics of CpG ODN 2006-mediated HIV expression is depicted in Fig. 1C. Since CpG ODNs have been reported to act via TLR9 (9Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar), we confirmed expression of TLR9 in ACH-2 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown) and by flow cytometry (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Expression of TLR9 on different T cell lines.A–D, expression of TLR9 was detected by intracellular staining (open line) as compared with an isotype-matched control antibody (filled line).

As a positive control, we have used TPA/ionomycin to show that the provirus in J1.1 cells can be activated. Our findings are consistent with previous studies in which it was reported that Jurkat T cells are insensitive toward CpG signaling, such as activation of NF-κB (11Takeshita F. Leifer C.A. Gursel I. Ishii K.J. Takeshita S. Gursel M. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3555-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Since J1.1 cells were positive for TLR9 mRNA (data not shown) and express TLR9 protein (Fig. 2B), we suggest either that a signaling defect is located downstream of the receptor or that additional factors (e.g. costimulatory events) are necessary to observe TLR9 signaling in these cells. Binding of CpG ODNs to TLR9 occurs after cellular uptake of the DNA and requires endosomal acidification (37Yi A.K. Tuetken R. Redford T. Waldschmidt M. Kirsch J. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4755-4761PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroquine, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, blocks TLR9 signaling and is therefore being used to study TLR9 activity (37Yi A.K. Tuetken R. Redford T. Waldschmidt M. Kirsch J. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4755-4761PubMed Google Scholar, 38Trevani A.S. Chorny A. Salamone G. Vermeulen M. Gamberale R. Schettini J. Raiden S.

Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2001; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To further confirm involvement of TLR9 in CpG-induced reactivation of HIV, we analyzed the effects of chloroquine on CpG-triggered virus reactivation in ACH-2 cells. As depicted in Fig. 4, chloroquine completely inhibited CpG-mediated virus reactivation at concentrations to inhibit endosomal acidification. Even at maximum chloroquine concentrations, no cell death was observed (according to the FSC/SSC criteria in flow cytometry, data not shown), indicating that inhibition of virus reactivation was not related to any cytotoxic effects. To analyze whether CpG sequences stimulate HIV replication in cells that are productively infected with HIV, we infected A3.01 T cells with HIV and measured HIV p24 expression by flow cytometry. The CpG ODN 2006 enhanced viral replication as compared with untreated cells, whereas no effects could be observed with the non-CpG sequence 2006 4xTG (Fig. 5). Similar to the situation with J1.1 cells, productively infected Jurkat T cells were insensitive toward CpG-induced enhancement of virus replication (Fig. 5B). NF-κB is an important transcription factor for replication of HIV (41Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Moreover, TLR9 signaling is known to activate NF-κB in antigen-presenting cells (42Yi A.K. Yoon J.G. Hong S.C. Redford T.W. Krieg A.M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Yi A.K. Peckham D.W. Ashman R.F. Krieg A.M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To address the role of NF-κB in TLR9-induced reactivation of HIV, we analyzed cellular extracts of CpG-treated ACH-2 cells by EMSA. Treatment with CpG ODN 2006 activated the p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimer. Increased DNA binding was detectable at 4 h, reaching a maximum at 8 h and declining thereafter (Fig. 6, B and C). In parallel to the NF-κB studies, we determined HIV expression by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6A, NF-κB induction preceded HIV expression, suggesting that CpG-induced HIV replication was initiated by NF-κB. It had been shown previously that CpG ODNs do not activate NF-κB in Jurkat cells, which correlates nicely with the inability of CpG ODNs to reactivate HIV in these cells (11Takeshita F. Leifer C.A. Gursel I. Ishii K.J. Takeshita S. Gursel M. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3555-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In contrast, CpG ODNs activated NF-κB in the uninfected A3.01 T cell line, indicating that CpG-triggered signal transduction in these T cells is not dependent on proviral infection but can also be observed in uninfected cells (Fig. 7). A further characterization of the NF-κB complexes showed that both the p50 homodimer and the p50/p65 heterodimer were formed in A3.01 T cells following CpG treatment (Fig. 7A). The same NF-κB complexes have also been found in CpG-stimulated B cells (44Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1240-1245PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the proximal signaling pathways triggered by CpG ODNs in T cells and “classical” CpG target cells are similar.Fig. 7CpG ODNs activate NF-κB in uninfected A3.01 T cells.A and B, A3.01 cells were treated with CpG and non-CpG ODNs for 24 h, and cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA to detect NF-κB activation.

The potential effects of CpG ODNs on HIV replication are currently a matter of debate. Equils et al. (45Equils O. Schito M.L. Karahashi H. Madak Z. Yarali A. Michelsen K.S. Sher A. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5159-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) recently observed a stimulatory effect of CpG ODNs on HIV replication in HIV-transgenic mouse spleen cells in vitro. It remained unknown, however, whether the increase in virus replication was caused by a direct stimulation of spleen cells by CpG sequences or mediated by indirect effects. Our findings now demonstrate that CpG ODNs can directly trigger signaling events in human T cells that lead to activation of NF-κB and reactivation of latent HIV in vitro. There is evidence that these results have some relevance for HIV reactivation in vivo. It has been reported that purified human T cells (mixed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) express TLR9 (12Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Despite their TLR9 expression effector and memory, CD8+ T cells did not respond to CpG ODN treatment (12Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). However, CD4+ T cells, which are the main target cells for HIV, have not been investigated in this study. Our current findings together with some anecdotal evidence from HIV patients suggest that CpG ODN might be able to directly stimulate at least certain subpopulations of CD4+ T cells in vivo. For example, it was observed that viral loads increase in HIV-infected patients with opportunistic bacterial infections (46Sulkowski M.S. Chaisson R.E. Karp C.L. Moore R.D. Margolick J.B. Quinn T.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 1642-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 47Rotchford K. Strum A.W. Wilkinson D. Sex. Transm. Dis. 2000; 27: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Further evidence that the observed effects could be operative in vivo came from Agrawal and Martin (48Agrawal S. Martin R.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1621-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), who recently suggested that the unexpected increase in viral loads observed in HIV-infected patients treated with HIV-gag antisense ODNs could have been due to CpG motifs within the administered sequences. We have recently shown that CpG ODNs are protective in post-exposure treatment of retrovirus-induced disease in the Friend virus mouse model (19Olbrich A.R. Schimmer S. Heeg K. Schepers K. Schumacher T.N. Dittmer U. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11397-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the timing of treatment was a critical factor in treatment efficiency: only post-exposure treatment was protective, whereas preinfection treatment resulted in an accelerated development of virus-induced erythroleukemia (49Olbrich A.R. Schimmer S. Dittmer U. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10658-10662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that CpG treatment, depending on the time point of inoculation, is able to enhance retroviral replication in vivo, and further studies will have to reveal whether mechanisms similar to those described in this manuscript are responsible for the observed effects. The biological effects of CpG ODNs on the human immune system are currently a matter of great scientific interest, and our study contributes to the understanding of the biological activities of these substances. Our data point to a novel role for CpG ODNs as stimulators of HIV replication. This effect might be used in the future to eradicate the latent viral reservoirs in HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy. To this end, the ability of CpG ODNs to reactivate the HIV provirus in vivo needs to be urgently explored. We thank Ingeborg Euler-Koenig and Simone Schimmer for excellent technical assistance.

To elucidate the role of PP2Cα in insulin signaling, we overexpressed wild-type (WT) PP2Cα by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of PP2Cα-WT enhanced the insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake without any changes in the early steps of insulin signaling. Infection with adenovirus 5 expressing PP2Cα-WT increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activities in the immunoprecipitate using antibody against the p85 or p110 subunit under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, followed by activation of downstream steps in the PI3K pathway, such as phosphorylation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and atypical protein kinase C. In contrast, overexpression of the phosphatase-defective mutant PP2Cα(R174G) did not produce such effects. Furthermore, overexpression of PP2Cα-WT (but not PP2Cα(R174G)) decreased the 32P-labeled phosphorylation state as well as the gel mobility shift of the p85 subunit, suggesting that dephosphorylation of the p85 subunit by PP2Cα activation might stimulate PI3K catalytic activity. Moreover, knockdown of PP2Cα by transfection of small interfering RNA led to a significant decrease in Akt phosphorylation. In addition, microinjection of anti-PP2Cα antibody or PP2Cα small interfering RNA led to decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In conclusion, PP2Cα is a new positive regulator of insulin sensitivity that acts through a direct activation of PI3K in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Phosphorylation state is regulated by both protein kinase and protein phosphatase and is critical for the regulation of cellular functions such as cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism (1Cantley L.C.

The protein phosphatases of eukaryotic cells are structurally and functionally diverse enzymes that can be divided into two distinct families (serine/threonine phosphatases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases) based on their specificities for phosphoamino acids (3Cohen P.

As does tyrosine phosphorylation, serine/threonine phosphorylation plays important roles in insulin signal transduction. A major role in the negative regulation of insulin action is attributed to agents that enhance serine/threonine phosphorylation of the receptor itself or its downstream effectors such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Serine/threonine phosphorylation of such molecules induces insulin resistance. Furthermore, Akt and atypical protein kinase Cλ (PKCλ) are serine/threonine kinases, and their kinase activities are regulated through the serine/threonine phosphorylation states. These lines of evidence suggest that serine/threonine phosphatases have important roles in insulin signal transduction. However, their roles in insulin signaling are not completely understood (12Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Marchand-Brustel L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As differentiation proceeds, adipocytes become sensitive to insulin stimulation in terms of glucose uptake. As a proposed molecular mechanism for acquired insulin sensitivity during adipocyte differentiation, the expression levels of important molecules in insulin signaling such as the insulin receptor and IRS-1 have been reported to be up-regulated (14Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the level of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) is also increased during adipocyte differentiation (15Garcia D. Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the amount of PP2A was decreased during differentiation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PP2A is reported to be a negative regulator of insulin signaling in terms of mitogenic signals (12Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the decreased expression of PP2A may be responsible for acquired insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In contrast, we observed that, during differentiation, PP2Cα protein expression was increased. Thus, this raises the interesting question of whether up-regulation of PP2Cα expression may be responsible for acquired insulin sensitivity by modulating insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, we clarified the role of PP2Cα in the acquisition of additional insulin sensitivity in differentiated adipocytes by three distinct approaches: overexpression of PP2Cα by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, knockdown of PP2Cα by transfection or microinjection of small interfering RNA (siRNA), and inhibition of PP2Cα function by microinjection of anti-PP2Cα antibody. In this study, we found that overexpression of PP2Cα enhanced the insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake. Furthermore, microinjection of PP2Cα siRNA or anti-PP2Cα antibody led to decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Decreased insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin responsiveness are two of the major characteristics of insulin resistance states. However, the molecular mechanism for moderation of insulin sensitivity is still unknown. Thus, we examined which step of insulin signaling is modulated by PP2Cα overexpression, and we found that PP2Cα overexpression directly activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to sequential activation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and atypical PKCλ without affecting the phosphorylation states of the insulin receptor and IRS-1. These results led us to propose a novel mechanism for potentiation of the PI3K pathway by PP2Cα. Thus, we propose that PP2Cα may be a new positive regulator of insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Materials—Human insulin was provided by Lilly.

Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown and maintained in high glucose DMEM containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS in a 10% CO2 environment. The cells were allowed to grow until 2 days post-confluence and then were differentiated as described previously (16Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell.

A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for mutagenesis. An oligonucleotide in which Arg174 of mouse PP2Cα was replaced with Gly was used as the primer in the in vitro mutagenesis reaction. Wild-type (WT) and phosphatase-defective (R174G) PP2Cα cDNAs were subcloned into the pACCMVpLpASR(+) plasmid (11Egawa K. Maegawa H. Shimizu S. Morino K. Nishio Y. Bryer-Ash M. Cheung A.T. Kolls J.K.

This plasmid contains 13 map units of the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) left end, cytomegalovirus early promoter, pUC19 polylinker site, and SV40 poly(A) signal sequences, followed by map units 9-18 of the Ad5 genome. The resulting recombinant plasmids were then cotransfected with the pJM17 plasmid (19McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) into packaging 293 cells, which carry Ad5 genomic DNA, and propagated as described previously (20Kolls J. Peppel K. Silva M. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mature recombinant Ad5 adenoviruses encoding PP2Cα-WT and PP2Cα-(R174G) were thus generated after in vivo homologous recombination between these two plasmids. Because 293 cells were originally derived from adenovirus transformation, the missing E1 gene function of pJM17 was provided in trans. The resulting recombinant viruses containing PP2Cα, denoted as Ad5-PP2Cα-WT and Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G), were replication-defective (at least in cells lacking the E1 region of the adenovirus), but fully infectious. Ad5-lacZ and Ad5-p110-CAAX (where “A” is aliphatic amino acid) were described previously (21Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Generation of His-tagged Wild-type and Mutant p85 Subunits of PI3K—Full-length bovine p85 was provided by Dr. Masato Kasuga (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan) (22Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). A QuikChange kit was used for site-directed mutagenesis. An oligonucleotide in which Ser608 of bovine pGEX-2T-p85 was replaced with Ala was used as the primer in the in vitro mutagenesis reaction. pGEX-2T-p85-WT and pGEX-2T-p85(S608A) were digested by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were denoted Hisp85-WT and His-p85(S608A), respectively. Cell Treatment—3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5-50 plaque-forming units/cell for 16 h with stocks of a control recombinant adenovirus (Ad5-ctrl) that contained the cytomegalovirus promoter, the pUC18 polylinker, and a fragment of the SV40 genome, and of the recombinant adenovirus containing lacZ (Ad5-lacZ), PP2Cα-WT (Ad5-PP2Cα-WT), or PP2Cα(R174G) (Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G)). Infected cells were incubated for 56 h at 37 °C in high glucose DMEM with 2% heat-inactivated serum, followed by incubation in the starvation medium required for the assay. The survival of the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was unaffected by incubation of cells with the different adenovirus constructs because the amounts of total cell protein were the same in infected and uninfected cells. HIRc B cells were transfected with 2 μg of each expression plasmid by the LipofectAMINE method. Cells cultured for 48 h were used in the experiments. Tranfection of siRNAs—siRNA for PP2Cα (guagucgacaccugcuugutt) and control siRNA (uucuccgaacgugucacgutt) were purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Germantown, MD). The 3T3-L1 adipocytes reseeded onto 12-well plates were transfected with 2 μg of each siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium prior to assays. Microinjection of Antibodies and siRNAs—Microinjection was carried out using a semiautomatic Eppendorf microinjection system. Antibodies for microinjection were concentrated and dissolved at 5 mg/ml in microinjection buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 100 mm KCl and were injected into the cytoplasm. Sheep IgG (5 mg/ml) was injected into the control cells. siRNA was dissolved at 5 μm in microinjection buffer (23Usui I. Imamura T. Huang J. Satoh H. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13765-13774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and injected into the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Western Blotting—The cells were starved for 16 h in regular glucose DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin; stimulated with 0-100 nm insulin for 5-10 min at 37 °C; and then lysed in solubilization buffer containing 20 μm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaF for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Whole cell lysates (20 μg of protein/lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 20% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specific antibodies. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody, followed by chemiluminescence detection according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The Western blot data were quantitated by scanning the film using NIH Image. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 20 μg of RNA samples were run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran N, Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). The cDNA probes were generated by PP2Cα expression vector by enzyme digestion. A cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a labeling kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) was hybridized to UV-cross-linked blots overnight at 68 °C in Perfecthybrid hybridization buffer (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) and washed at 68 °C for 40 min with 1× trisodium citrate dihydrate and 0.1% SDS. The blots were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film at -80 °C. The signal was quantitated with a densitometer, and loading differences were normalized to the signal generated with a probe for 18 S ribosomal RNA. 32P Labeling of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-ctrl, Ad5-PP2Cα-WT, or Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G) were starved for 16 h in regular glucose DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, followed by phosphate starvation for 2 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.25 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) was then added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 2 h. The cells were lysed and subjected to immunodepletion with protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated with anti-p85 antibody and protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were denatured by boiling and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film. There was no loading difference as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (data not shown). PP2Cα Phosphatase Assay—Phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (24Takai A. Mieskes G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with a phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (12Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Starved cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-PP2Cα or anti-HA antibody and protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mm calcium chloride), resuspended in assay buffer containing 2.5 mm nickel chloride and 900 μg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in the absence or presence of 10 mm Mn2+ and 60 mm Mg2+, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C because PP2Cα phosphatase activity is known to be dependent on Mn2+ and Mg2+. The amount of p-nitrophenol produced was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. PP2Cα Phosphatase Treatment—The p85 subunit was immunoprecipitated using anti-p85 antibody from lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with assay buffer, followed by incubation with phosphatase buffer (1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm magnesium acetate) with or without 0.4 milliunits of recombinant PP2Cα (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C. After several washes, samples were denatured by boiling and subjected to Western blotting. Immunostaining and Immunofluorescence—Staining of LacZ or immunostaining of GLUT4 was performed as described (21Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Satoh H. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13765-13774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—The procedure for evaluating glucose transport was a modification of a method described previously (26Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose uptake was determined in triplicate at various time points after the addition of 10 μl of substrate. 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose or l-[3H]glucose (0.1 μCi, 0.01 mm final concentration) was add to provide a concentration at which cell membrane transport is rate-limiting. The value for l-glucose was subtracted to correct each sample for the contributions of diffusion and trapping. PI3K Assay—Serum-starved cells (16 h for 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 24 h for HIRc B cells) were incubated in the absence (basal conditions) or presence of 100 nm insulin for 5 min; washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; lysed; and subjected to immunoprecipitation (500 μg of total protein) with anti-p110α (2 μg), anti-p85 (4 μg), anti-PP2Cα (4 μg), or anti-His (2 μg) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein A or G and washed as described (27Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The washed immunocomplexes were incubated with phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids) and [γ-32P]ATP (3 mCi/mmol) for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1); the reaction mixtures were centrifuged; and the lower organic phases were removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate (Merck) that had been coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, visualized, and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—The values are expressed as means ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. Scheffe's multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of any differences among more than three groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of Protein Phosphatases during Differentiation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Several proteins have been reported to be up-regulated upon 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, including the insulin receptor and IRS-1 (14Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and GLUT4 (15Garcia D. Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contribute to the regulation of insulin responsiveness and insulin sensitivity. To compare the relative abundance of protein phosphatases, the expression levels of PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2Cα were measured during differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibro-blasts into adipocytes. PP2Cα protein expression increased time dependently during differentiation (days 0-7) and reached a level comparable with that in well differentiated adipocytes (days 7-14) (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In contrast, the levels of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B decreased during differentiation. In well differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the expression levels of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B were only 11.7-32.0% of those in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1A, lower panel). In contrast, the expression level of PP2Cα in adipocytes was increased to 230% compared with that in fibroblasts (Fig. 1A, lower panel). We also observed a significant increase in PP2Cα mRNA expression during differentiation (days 0-14) (Fig. 1B). Expression of PP2Cα in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Gene transfer into 3T3-L1 adipocytes by conventional methods is inefficient. To achieve sufficient levels of expression, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in terminally differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To assess infection efficiency, we performed LacZ staining to examine expression of recombinant adenovirus containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Ad5-lacZ) following infection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes at m.o.i. = 50. The infection efficiency was assessed by determining the percentage of cells expressing Ad5-lacZ. >90% of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed positive staining on post-infection day 3 as judged by the number of blue cells/200 cells, whereas control adenovirus (Ad5-ctrl)-infected cells exhibited no blue color in the presence of the β-galactosidase chromogenic substrate (Fig. 2A). We next overexpressed PP2Cα by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-ctrl or with recombinant adenovirus expressing HA-tagged wild-type PP2Cα (Ad5-PP2Cα-WT) or phosphatase-defective PP2Cα (Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G)). Following a 72-h incubation, the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PP2Cα or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B). Small amounts of endogenous PP2Cα were observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-ctrl alone. PP2Cα-WT and PP2Cα(R174G) were expressed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a 43-kDa band was observed only in Ad5-PP2Cα-WT- or Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G)-infected cells when immunoblotting was performed using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B). A 6-fold increase in PP2Cα protein expression was observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-PP2Cα-WT or Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G) at m.o.i. = 50 compared with that in control cells. To evaluate the effect of PP2Cα overexpression on PP2Cα phosphatase activity, cell lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-ctrl, Ad5-PP2Cα-WT, or Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G) were immunoprecipitated with anti-PP2Cα antibody, and in vitro phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate with or without Mn2+ and Mg2+(Fig. 2C). Overexpression of PP2Cα-WT led to increased phosphatase activity in a dose- and Mn2+-dependent manner to as much as 5-fold at m.o.i. = 50. These enzymatic activities paralleled the PP2Cα protein expression levels. Expression of PP2Cα(R174G) did not increase phosphatase activity compared with that of PP2Cα-WT (Fig. 2C). We measured PP2Cα phosphatase activity in the immunoprecipitate using anti-HA antibody to avoid contamination of endogenous PP2Cα activity. Overexpression of PP2Cα-WT also led to a dose-dependent increase in phosphatase activity. The cells infected with Ad5-ctrl or Ad5-PP2Cα(R174G) had no phosphatase activity (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that expression of PP2Cα-WT specifically increases PP2Cα enzymatic activity and that PP2Cα(R174G) is a phosphatase-defective mutant. Effect of PP2Cα Overexpression on Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To examine whether up-regulated PP2Cα activity affects insulin-stimulated glucose up-take, we measured insulin-stimulated 2DOG uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Ad5-PP2Cα-WT or Ad5-PP2Cα-(R174G) (Fig. 3A). Insulin stimulated 2DOG uptake in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 = 0.49 ± 0.11 nm in Ad5-ctrl-i"
https://openalex.org/W1644392149,"In nanometer channels made from extremely pure semiconductors, the electrical conductance is quantized. Recent experiments have suggested that the electrons in such a structure can exhibit a spontaneous alignment of their spins, even if the material is nonmagnetic. In their Perspective, [Bird and Ochiai][1] discuss current work on this phenomenon. Consensus is growing that this spin polarization is real, and the results of ongoing experiments may have an important influence on the development of future devices that rely on electron spin.

Despite sharing ∼90% amino acid sequence identity, PP1β and PP1γ1 have distinct subcellular localizations that may be determined by selective interactions with PP1-binding proteins. Immunoprecipitation studies from brain and muscle extracts demonstrated that PP1γ1 selectively interacts with spinophilin and neurabin, F-actin-targeting proteins, whereas PP1β selectively interacted with GM/RGL, the striated-muscle glycogen-targeting subunit. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing residues 146–493 of neurabin (GST-Nb-(146–493)) or residues 1–240 of GM/RGL (GST-GM-(1–240)) recapitulated these isoform selectivities in binding and phosphatase activity inhibition assays. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that this isoform selectivity was not due to sequence differences between the canonical PP1-binding motifs (neurabin, 457KIKF460; GM/RGL, 65RVSF68). A chimeric GST fusion protein containing residues 1–64 of GM/RGL fused to residues 457–493 of neurabin (GST-GM/Nb) selectively bound to and inhibited PP1γ1, whereas a GST-Nb/GM chimera containing Nb-(146–460) fused to GM-(69–240) selectively interacted with and weakly inhibited PP1β, implicating domain(s) C-terminal to the (R/K)(V/I)XF motif as determinants of PP1 isoform selectivity. Deletion of Pro464 and Ile465 in neurabin (ΔPI) to equally space a conserved cluster of amino acids from the (R/K)(V/I)XF motif as in GM/RGL severely compromised the ability of neurabin to bind and inhibit both isoforms but did not affect PP1γ1 selectivity. Further analysis of a series of C-terminal truncated GST-Nb-(146–493) proteins identified residues 473–479 of neurabin as containing a crucial PP1γ1-selectivity determinant. In combination, these data identify a novel PP1γ1-selective interaction domain in neurabin that may allow for selective regulation and/or subcellular targeting of PP1 isoforms.

GM/RGL, spinophilin, and neurabin, like most PP1-binding proteins, contain the canonical (R/K)(V/I)XF-binding motif which is essential for stable PP1 binding (16Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P.

A short PP1-binding peptide from GM/RGL has been crystallized with recombinant PP1γ1, revealing multiple interactions between Arg65, Val66, and Phe68 in GM/RGL with a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the PP1 catalytic subunit opposite to the catalytic site (27Egloff M.P.

Consequently, this interaction has little direct effect on PP1 activity. However, domains outside of the canonical (R/K)(V/I)XF motif of several PP1-binding proteins play ancillary roles in PP1 binding and can variably modulate PP1 activity (28Bollen M. Trends Biochem.

This report describes experiments directed at understanding the molecular basis for isoform-selective subcellular targeting of PP1 catalytic subunits. The isoform selectivity of native GM/RGL and native spinophilin/neurabin was further explored using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Recombinant fragments of GM/RGL and neurabin were then used to isolate domains necessary for selectivity toward native brain PP1 catalytic subunit isoforms. Our data implicate a 6-amino acid domain (residues 474–479) C-terminal to the canonical (R/K)(V/I)XF PP1-binding motif as playing a critical role in the selective interaction of neurabin with PP1γ1. Forebrain Extraction—Frozen rat forebrains were partially thawed in 10 ml/forebrain of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 40 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/liter leupeptin plus 150 mm KCl at 4 °C and were homogenized first using a Polytron and then a motorized Teflon/glass homogenizer (detailed summary in Ref. 33Colbran R.J.

The rat or mouse muscle was excised, freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Frozen tissue samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen and then resuspended in 10 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmN-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mg/liter leupeptin. The tissue was homogenized with 15 passes using a motorized Teflon/glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 3800 × g for 30 min to isolate a soluble extract. Co-immunoprecipitations—Freshly prepared rat or mouse musclesoluble extracts or rat forebrain whole lysates (see above) were diluted to 1 mg/ml protein in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5), and 1 or 2 ml (respectively) was pre-cleared with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose or GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with 5–10 μl of indicated rabbit or sheep antiserum or 2 μg of affinity-purified mouse GM/RGL antibodies raised in rabbit (15Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.H.

Constructs—pGEX-2T or pGEX-4T vectors (Amersham Biosciences) containing the cDNA encoding amino acids 146–493 of rat neurabin or amino acids 1–240 of rabbit GM/RGL fused to glutathione S-transferase were previously described (18MacMillan L.B.

The GST-Nb-(146–460)/GM-(69–240) chimera was generated by PCR amplification from the pGEX templates. The region encoding Nb-(146–460) was generated from primers 5′-GATGCGTTCCCAAAATTAGTTTG-3′ (within the GST sequence) and 5′-CAAACTTAATTTTCCTATTTGCTGG-3′, and the resulting product was digested with BamHI, yielding a 5′ overhang with a 3′ blunt end. The region encoding residues 69–240 of GM/RGL was amplified using 5′-GATGCGTTCCCAAAATTAGTTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTC-3′ (within the pGEX vector) and then digested with EcoRI leaving a 5′ blunt end with a 3′ overhang. The two purified, digested PCR products were then ligated into a pGEX-2T vector digested with both BamHI and EcoRI. The GST-GM(1–64)/Nb-(457–493) chimera was generated using the same technique. The region encoding residues 1–64 of GM/RGL was amplified using 5′-GATGCGTTCCCAAAATTAGTTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCACCTGAGGATGCGG-3′. The region encoding Nb-(457–493) was amplified using 5′-GAAAATTAAGTTTAGTTGTGCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTGCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTC-3′ primers. GM/RGL and neurabin products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, respectively, and subcloned into pGEX-2T vector. Mutated neurabin constructs were generated from pGEX-2T-Nb-(146–493) by PCR using complementary forward and reverse primers containing mutated sequences; forward primers were: Nb(KIKF→RVSF), 5′-CAGCAAATAGGAGAGTTTCGTTTGCTTGTGCTCCG-3′; neurabin P436A, 5′-CAATTACTATCAGGCCGATATGGAGTAC-3′; neurabin P447A, 5′-ATTGTTGGCTTGGCGCAAGAGGAAG-3′; neurabin P453A, 5′-GAGGAAGAAATCGCAGCAAATAGG-3′, neurabin P464A, 5′-GTTTAGTTGTGCTGCGATTAAGGTTTTC-3′; neurabin ΔPI, 5′-AAGTTTAGTTGTGCTAAGGTTTTCAACACG-3′. Vectors (pGEX-2T) encoding the C-terminal truncations of GST-Nb-(146–493) at residues 479, 473, 460, and 453 were made by PCR amplification using a forward primer that introduced a BamHI restriction site and a series of reverse primers that introduced a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site at the desired location.

Glutathione-agarose Co-sedimentation Assays—10 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 15 μg of crude phosphatase catalytic subunit mixture (see above) in 14 ml (stringent condition) or 1 ml (standard condition) of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). About 20 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-agarose was added, and the incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C.

Far Western Overlay Assays—Purified GST fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were stained with Ponceau-S (Mallinckrodt). Membranes from preparative gels were cut into vertical 3-mm strips, with each strip containing about 10 nmol of fusion protein (0.2–0.9 μg of protein). Membranes were blocked (5 min, room temperature) with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), 2% milk (w/v) and then washed (5 min) with PP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA (w/v), 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)). Membranes were incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with or without crude phosphatase catalytic subunit mix diluted in PP buffer (1.2 μg/ml) and then were washed three times for 5 min with PP buffer at room temperature. Primary antibodies to PP1β, PP1γ1, PP2A, or GST were diluted in PP buffer and were incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min with PP buffer and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (rabbit, sheep, mouse, or goat) diluted in PP buffer (30 min, room temperature), washed again, and developed with alkaline phosphatase colorimetric assay (see details in Ref. 33Colbran R.J.

Active native PP1β and PP1γ1 were immunoisolated from the crude brain protein phosphatase catalytic mixture using specific antibodies (see above) coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). After elution in sodium thiocyanate, PP1 isoforms were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm DTT and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Immunopurified PP1 was incubated (30 min, 30 °C) with substrate, [32P]phosphorylase a, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm caffeine, 0.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine together with 0–2 μm GST fusion proteins. Enzyme dilutions were chosen such that less than 10% of the substrate was hydrolyzed. Assays were terminated with 50 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 15 min, and then proteins were pelleted (10,000 × g, 10 min). Supernatants (80 μl) were subjected to liquid scintillation counting to quantify 32P release. Native Spinophilin, Neurabin, and GM/RGL Display PP1 Isoform Selectivity—Previous studies have shown that the brain PP1actin holoenzyme, which contains spinophilin and neurabin, is selectively enriched in PP1γ1 (18MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PP1β isoform has been shown to associate with the skeletal muscle PP1glycogen holoenzyme containing GM/RGL (24Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although the PP1 isoform selectivity of this complex has not been addressed. To further examine the isoform selectivity of PP1-binding proteins in brain and skeletal muscle, PP1β and PP1γ1 were specifically immunoprecipitated from whole tissue extracts, and the presence of spinophilin, neurabin, and GM/RGL was determined by immunoblotting. Neurabin (not shown) and spinophilin selectively co-immunoprecipitated with PP1γ1 (but not PP1β) from rat forebrain lysates (Fig. 1A, left panel), extending previous observations using actin-enriched forebrain extracts (18MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PP1γ1 immune complexes from mouse (not shown) and rat (Fig. 1A, right panel) skeletal muscle also contained spinophilin, despite the fact that spinophilin is expressed at much lower levels in muscle as compared with brain (compare brain and muscle applied lanes in Fig. 1A). Neurabin is not expressed in muscle (17Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Spinophilin was not detected in PP1β immunoprecipitates from muscle extracts (Fig. 1A), even though there is 7-fold less PP1γ1 expressed in muscle relative to brain, whereas PP1β is expressed at similar levels in muscle and brain (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, immunoprecipitates of rat (Fig. 1A) or mouse (not shown) muscle PP1β, but not PP1γ1, contained GM/RGL. Likewise, immunoprecipitates of GM/RGL from mouse skeletal muscle contained PP1β but not PP1γ1 (Fig. 1B). As a control, PP2A immunoprecipitates from either rat brain or muscle tissue did not contain appreciable amounts of PP1β, PP1γ1, spinophilin, neurabin, or GM/RGL (Fig. 1A). Moreover, PP2A was not precipitated with antibodies to any of the other proteins investigated here (data not shown). In combination, the present immunoprecipitation data significantly extend previous reports that native spinophilin and neurabin selectively interact with PP1γ1, whereas native GM/RGL selectively interacts with PP1β. Recombinant Fragments of Neurabin and GM/RGL Selectively Interact with Specific, Native PP1 Isoforms—GST fusion proteins containing the PP1-binding domains of GM/RGL (residues 1–240) and neurabin (residues 146–493) were expressed in bacteria and purified (Fig. 2B). These proteins are referred to as GST-GM-(1–240) and GST-Nb-(146–493) in the remainder of this report. Selective interactions between native mammalian PP1 isoforms and these fusion proteins were investigated using three complementary methods: 1) far Western overlay assays, 2) glutathione-agarose co-sedimentation assays, and 3) PP1 isoform inhibition assays. We chose to use native, rat brain PP1 isoforms for these assays because of the difficulties in expressing fully functional recombinant isoforms, especially in regard to the stre"

They are hetero-multimer membrane proteins formed by at least three subunits, the poreforming α1-subunit and the auxiliary β- and α2δ-subunits. The β-subunit is essential for channel performance because it regulates two distinct features of voltage-gated calcium channels, the surface expression and the channel activity. Four β-subunit genes have been cloned, β1–4, with molecular masses ranging from 52 to 78 kDa, and several splice variants have been identified. The β1b-subunit, expressed at high levels in mammalian brain, has been used extensively to study the interaction between the pore forming α1- and the regulatory β-subunit. However, structural characterization has been impaired for its tendency to form aggregates when expressed in bacteria. We applied an on-column refolding procedure based on size exclusion chromatography to fold the β1b-subunit of the voltage gated-calcium channels from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. The β1b-subunit refolds into monomers, as shown by sucrose gradient analysis, and binds to a glutathione S-transferase protein fused to the known target in the α1-subunit (the α-interaction domain). Using the cutopen oocyte voltage clamp technique, we measured gating and ionic currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing cardiac α1-subunit (α1C) co-injected with folded-β1b-protein or β1b-cRNA. We demonstrate that the co-expression of the α1C-subunit with either folded-β1b-protein or β1b-cRNA increases ionic currents to a similar extent and with no changes in charge movement, indicating that the β1b-subunit primarily modulates channel activity, rather than expression.

Although the α1-subunit encompasses all the structural elements of a functional voltage-activated calcium channel, such as the ion-conduction pathway, the voltage sensor, and drug-binding sites, the β-subunit seems to be essential for channel performance (2Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Two highly conserved sequences have been identified as the primary interaction site between the α1- and the β-subunit, the α1-subunit interaction domain (AID) that lies within the cytoplasmic I-II loop of the α1-subunit (8Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori M. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), and the β-subunit interaction domain that lies within the second conserved sequence domain of the β-subunit (9De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Four β-subunit isoforms (β1–4) with molecular masses between 52–78 kDa from four nonallelic genes have been cloned, each encoding multiple splice variants. Sequence analysis of all β-subunits reveals five homology domains, two of them highly conserved among all β-subunits and known to be important for channel function (10Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Structural modeling based on homology searches has been carried out for one of the β-subunit isoforms, the β1b. This study proposes a modular structure of the protein containing a PDZ-like, an Src homology 3, and a guanylate kinase domain (11Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the functional relevance of these structural domains is yet to be established. Direct biochemical and structural characterization has been hampered by the lack of appropriate expression and purification protocols to produce soluble and stable protein in sufficient amounts. The β1b-subunit has a length of 597 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 65.679 Da, and although it expresses at high levels in Escherichia coli, the majority of the recombinant protein accumulates in inclusion bodies. We describe here a procedure to purify and refold the β1b-subunit from inclusion bodies using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Sedimentation profile in a sucrose density gradient is consistent with a monomeric state of the folded protein. This protein is stable in solution up to 5–6 mg/ml for about 2 weeks and displays binding affinity for the AID site of the cardiac isoform of the α1-subunit (α1C). We investigated the biological function of the β1b-subunit, either originated from cRNA or directly from the folded protein, by testing its ability to modify the activity of calcium channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To distinguish between the effect of the β-subunit on channel expression and activity, we used the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp technique (12Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to record simultaneously ionic currents and gating currents. The latter, being proportional to the number of channels in the membrane, reports changes in expression levels (6Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The injection of either β1b-cRNA or folded-β1b-protein into α1C-subunit-expressing oocytes increases ionic currents with little or no changes in charge movement, indicating that the β1b-subunit modulates primarily channel activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—The cDNA encoding the β1b-subunit (GenBank™ accession number X61394) residues 24–597 was subcloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites by conventional PCR methods into pRSETB vector containing a polyhistidine (His6) at the N-terminal end (Invitrogen). The entire cDNA was sequenced after being subcloned in pRSETB vector, and seven amino acid substitutions were detected (F158L, S348F, R417S, V435A, V449A, W492R, and V511A) when compared with the sequence reported by Pragnell et al. (13Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Swiss-Prot accession number P54283). The His6-β1b-tagged protein was used for Western blotting analysis with anti-His antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). E. coli BL-21 transformed with the β1b-pRSET vector were grown at 25 °C to an optical density of 0.7 and induced 90 min with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until use. After lysis by sonication and centrifugation, the pellet fraction was recovered, repeatedly washed using mild detergent (B-PER™, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, dissolved in denaturing buffer containing 6 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged for 5 mins at 10,000 × g to remove particulate. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the sample was incubated at 95 °C for 10 mins. The DTT-treated sample was allowed to cool down, and 5 ml were loaded onto a Superdex™ 200 column 26/60 (340 ml bed volume) attached to a fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and pre-equilibrated at 12 °C with refolding buffer A (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The elution profile was monitored at 280 nm with the use of a UV detector in all chromatography steps. The fractions containing the protein were verified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated to 3–6 mg/ml, and stored at 4 °C until use. The protein concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm using the absorbance coefficient of Amg/ml 280 = 1.3 (1-cm cell path length). The cDNA encoding the I-II loop residues 422–534 of the α1C calcium channel subunit (GenBank™ accession number X15539) that encompass the AID site, was subcloned by PCR methods into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). E. coli BL-21 pLysS transformed with the pGEX GST-AIDα1C vector were grown at 23 °C to an optical density of 0.7 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until use.The GST-AIDα1C fusion protein was purified from the cleared cell lysate by glutathione-affinity chromatography (glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 10 mm DTT and 1% reduced Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added to the buffers throughout the whole purification procedure, and the Tris-HCl elution buffer was replaced by phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The eluted fractions containing GST-AIDα1C and verified by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, concentrated 10–15 times, loaded onto a Superdex™ 200 column 10/30 (24 ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated at 12 °C with buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Triton and eluted at 0.5 ml/min. The fractions that contained the protein and eluted within the included volume of the column were collected and stored at 4 °C until use. The concentration of the GST-AIDα1C was estimated by the intensity of the band in a reducing SDS-PAGE and confirmed by bicinchoninic acid assay for protein quantitation (Uptima, Montluçon, France). The GST protein fused to 126 amino acid residues derived from the carboxyl-terminal end of the chloride channel from human skeletal muscle ClC-1 (Swiss-Prot accession number P35523, GST-ClC126) was kindly provided by Christoph Fahlke (RWTH Aachen, Germany)Binding Assay—4 μg of purified GST-AIDα1C fusion protein were diluted into 500 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton, pH 8.0, and added to ∼20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin previously washed and resuspended in binding buffer. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with binding buffer. The binding reaction was performed by adding 8 μg of purified β1b-subunit diluted in 500 μl of binding buffer, incubated 60 min at room temperature, and washed three times with binding buffer. The bound proteins were released from the resin with 20 μl of reducing SDS-loading buffer, incubated 5 min at 95 °C, spun down, and the supernatant was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Control binding assays were carried out with 4-fold excess of either GST alone or of GST-ClC126.Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Sucrose gradients 0–15% in buffer A were generated by a gradient mixer to a final volume of 4 ml. 200 μg of purified β1b-subunit together with protein markers or on separate gradients were layered on top of the gradient and centrifuged in a Beckman SW-56 rotor at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. After sedimentation, individual gradients were fractionated bottom-to-top by drop-wise collection into 16 tubes (250 μl each). Aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and UV-absorbance was measured at 280 nm (Ultrospec 2000, Pharmacia Biothec).Xenopus laevis Oocytes Injection and Electrophysiological Recordings—Xenopus laevis females were anesthetized with 0.5% ethyl 3-amino-benzoato methanesulfonic acid salt and the oocytes were removed, defolliculated by 1- to 2-h treatment with 3 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) at room temperature, washed, and kept at 18 °C in oocyte Ringer's solution (ND-96) containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, until used. Capped cRNA was synthesized from HindIII-linearized β1b and α1C-DN60 cDNA (14Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar) template using the MESSAGE machine (Ambion, Austin, TX), resuspended in 10 μl of water, and stored in 2-μl aliquots at –80 °C until use. The α1C-DN60 bears a deletion of 60 amino acids at the amino-terminal end that increase expression. The cRNA was injected using a nanoliter injector (nanoliter 2000, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and oocytes were kept at 18 °C in ND-96 solution supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate until recording. To assay the functional properties of the folded-β1b-protein, 4–6 days after cRNA injection, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of β1b (2–4 mg/ml in buffer A). Electrophysiological recordings were carried out as described (15Dzhura I. Neely A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 274-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) between 2–7 h after protein injection. Briefly, macroscopic currents were recorded using the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp technique (12Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The membrane of the oocyte exposed to the bottom chamber was permeabilized by a brief treatment with 0.1% saponin. The external solution contained 10 mm Ba2+, 96 mmn-methylglucamine, and 10 mm HEPES and was adjusted to pH 7.0 with methanesulfonic acid. The internal solution contained 120 mm n-methylglucamine, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (adjusted with methanesulfonic acid). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the pCLAMP system and software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Linear components arising from charging the membrane and voltage-independent leakage conductance were eliminated by P/–4 prepulse protocol, as described previously (6Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For the average current-voltage plot (see Fig. 5D), currents were evoked by 70-ms pulses from –40 to + 70 mV in 10 mV increments, and the amplitude (Im) was measured at the end of the pulse. The normalized conductance-voltage plot (see Fig. 5E) was obtained by using Eqs. 1 and 2 as follows: Eq. 1 was fitted to the I-V plot, and the values of Gmax and Erev were obtained from the fit used to calculated the normalized membrane conductances (Gm) according to Eq. 2. Im=Gmax⋅(Vm−Erev)1+exp(z⋅(V12−Vm)RT)(Eq. 1) where Gmax is the maximum conductance, Vm is the membrane potential, Erev is the reversal potential, z is the effective valence, and V½ is the voltage at which the conductance is 50% of Gmax. Gm=ImGmax⋅(Vm−Erev)(Eq. 2) RESULTSRefolding of β1b-Subunit—The β1b-subunit expressed in E. coli accumulates intracellularly in large insoluble aggregates or inclusion bodies (Fig. 1A) that are recovered in the pellet fraction following cell lysis and centrifugation (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Successive washes with B-PER™ reagent were done to remove contaminants (Fig. 1A, lane 7), and the purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in denaturing buffer containing 6 m GdmCl. After the refolding procedure was completed (see below), the β1b purified from the inclusion bodies was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His antibody (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1β1b expression and purification.A, SDS-PAGE (8% gel polyacrylamide gel) stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue showing protein fractions obtained along the expression and purification protocol of β1b-subunit.

Chaudhuri J.B. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 50: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Batas B. Chaudhuri J.B. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 864: A229-A236Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The method uses SEC to exchange the buffer, remove aggregates, and promote folding in a single step during elution with refolding buffer. The solubilized inclusion bodies were incubated for 10 mins at 95 °C under reducing conditions (10 mm DTT), loaded onto a Superdex-200 26/60 column equilibrated with refolding buffer (buffer A), and eluted at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min at 12 °C. The eluted fractions were monitored at 280 nm and further analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. The elution profile shows three peaks (Fig. 2A) containing pure β1b, as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). One peak eluted within the column void volume (V0), indicating the presence of higher aggregates of β1b. Two distinct peaks (peaks I and II) eluted within the column included volume, suggesting that the β1b-subunit may have been refolded into at least two relatively discrete states. When the higher molecular weight peak (peak I) was recovered from the column, concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml, and reloaded onto the column, a significant portion eluted in the void volume and became the predominant peak within a couple of days (data not shown), indicating that the protein aggregates over time. In contrast, when peak II was recovered and concentrated to 3.7 mg/ml, it eluted predominantly as a single peak with a minor shoulder (Fig. 2B). This profile remained essentially unchanged upon storage for about 2 weeks, even at higher protein concentrations, indicating that the protein was stable and likely in a fully folded conformation. Protein isolated from peak II was, therefore, referred to as folded-β1b and used for further studies. The integrity of the folded-β1b was confirmed by amino acid analysis.Fig. 2Refolding of β1b onto a Superdex™ 200 (26/60) SEC column.A, the β1b-subunit recovered from E. coli inclusion bodies was resuspended in 6 m GdmCl, loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and eluted at 2.5 ml/min. B, SEC elution curve of folded-β1b. Fractions collected during the elution encompassed by the line in panelA were concentrated up to 3.7 mg/ml, loaded onto Superdex™ 200 10/30 SEC column, and eluted with buffer A at 0.6 mg/ml. C, molecular mass calibration curve on Superdex™ 200. The numbers indicate the molecular masses (in kDa) of standard proteins (black circles): thyroglobulin, 669; ferritin, 440; catalase, 232; aldolase, 158; albumin, 67; ovalbumin, 43; chymotrypsinogen A, 25. The position of the folded-β1b is indicated by a white circle. Kav is equal to (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0), where Ve is the elution volume of the protein, V0 is the void volume of the column calibrated with blue dextran, and Vt is the total bed volume.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To optimize the buffer conditions for the folded-β1b, a 1 mg/ml protein stock solution was diluted six times in each different test buffer and loaded onto the Superdex 200 10/30 equilibrated column with the same dilution buffer. The SEC elution profiles for the folded-β1b were superimposable at pH 8.0 and above and at salt concentrations higher than 200 mm NaCl (data not shown). However, at lower salt concentrations or at pH below 6.2 no peak was detected. Removal of EDTA from buffer A did not alter the elution curve.A SEC calibration curve prepared with a set of globular protein standards yielded an apparent molecular mass of 188 kDa for the folded-β1b (Fig. 2C), more than twice the molecular mass predicted by the amino acid sequence (66 kDa). This finding may indicate either formation of oligomers (dimers or trimers) or alternatively, an anomalous SEC behavior due to molecule asymmetry, because the molecular mass of native proteins estimated by SEC depends highly upon the shape of the molecule (18le Maire M. Viel A. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Sucrose Gradient Analysis—We used sucrose gradient analysis to resolve independently from SEC whether or not the folded-β1b forms multimers. The folded protein was subjected to 0–15% sucrose gradient centrifugation either in a separate gradient or along with two protein markers, albumin that has a comparable molecular mass (67 kDa) and catalase that has a higher molecular mass (232 kDa) (Fig. 3). Analysis of the different sucrose gradient fractions by reducing SDS-PAGE and UV-absorbance at 280 nm showed that the folded-β1b sediments at one position along the gradient (Fig. 3A), indicating the presence of a homogenous protein population in a defined conformation. This analysis also shows that folded-β1b co-sediments with albumin while it separates from catalase (Fig. 3B). Albumin and catalase sediment at the same position of the gradient fraction when run alone (data not shown). It is readily apparent from Figs. 2C and 3B that, although catalase behaves as expected from the calculated molecular mass in SEC and sucrose gradient analysis, it migrates faster in SDS-PAGE. The same fast migrating band in SDS-PAGE was obtained when the catalase fraction was recovered from either the SEC column or the sucrose gradient and ran in parallel with fresh protein (data not shown). The recovery of the folded-β1b in the same fraction as the albumin indicates that the folded protein behaves as a monomer in sucrose gradient analysis and, accordingly, its larger apparent molecular mass, deduced by SEC, suggests an anomalous behavior common to asymmetric molecules.Fig. 3Sucrose gradient analysis for folded-β1b.A, analysis of β1b alone loaded onto the gradient. After sedimentation, the gradient was fractionated bottom-to-top into 16 tubes.

B, analysis for a mixture containing folded-β1b, albumin (67 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). The folded-β1b co-sedimented with albumin and separated from catalase. Notice that catalase behaves in SEC and sucrose gradient analysis accordingly with its molecular mass (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, but it migrates faster than predicted in reducing SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Binding in Vitro of the Folded-β1b to the AID Site—Because refolded proteins may not necessarily adopt their native conformation with retention of biological activity, we investigated the ability of the folded-β1b to bind to its natural target on the α1 pore-forming subunit, the highly conserved AID site. The I-II loop of the α1C-subunit (residues Gly422-Arg534) bearing the AID site was fused to GST (GST-AIDα1C) and used for in vitro binding assays, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The folded-β1b bound to the GST-AIDα1C fusion protein (Fig. 4A) but not to GST protein alone, even at a 4-fold excess over GST-AIDα1C (Fig. 4B) or to GST fused to an unrelated sequence, such as the carboxyl-terminal end of the hClC1 channel protein (Fig. 4C, GST-ClC126). These results show that the folded-β1b binds specifically to the AIDα1C site.Fig. 4Binding of the folded-β1b to a GST-AIDα1C fusion protein.A, binding of β1b to GST-AIDα1C. The folded-β1b was added to the GST fusion protein bound to glutathione agarose resin. After the binding reaction was completed, the resin was washed, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel).

We used the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp technique to simultaneously record ionic and gating currents. The ability to measure gating and ionic currents in the same oocyte allow us to discriminate between the effect of the β-subunit on channel expression from the one on channel activity as follows. The movement of charged residues in the channel protein, as it undergoes conformational changes, gives rise to gating currents reflected as small outward transients preceding ionic currents at the onset of depolarizing pulses (19Bezanilla F. Stefani E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 331-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The integral of these gating currents yields the charge movement during channel activation and is a function of the number of channels present in the membrane and the number of charged residues per channel that move within the electric field during activation (20Noceti F. Baldelli P. Wei X. Qin N. Toro L. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amplitude"

The initiating events in diabetic nephropathy are triggered by hyperglycemia and, possibly, advanced glycation end products. Subsequently, excess levels of vasoactive peptides (especially endothelin-1 (ET-1)) accumulate in the diabetic kidney, and there is evidence that these peptides mediate many of the pathophysiological changes associated with diabetic renal disease. These changes include an excess deposition of extracellular matrix proteins into the glomerular basement membrane and renal mesangial cell hypertrophy. Our transcriptional profiling studies have revealed that the p8 gene, which encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix protein, is strongly induced in ET-1-treated renal mesangial cells and in an animal model of diabetic nephropathy. RNA interference experiments indicated that the p8 gene is required for ET-1-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy. Here, we show that the p8 polypeptide is a phosphoprotein subject to constitutive degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. This degradation is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt. By contrast, stabilization of the p8 protein requires glycogen synthase kinase-3. Finally, short interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference experiments indicated that ET-1-stimulated mesangial cell hypertrophy and p8 mRNA induction require the NFAT4 transcription factor. Thus, p8 levels in the cell are likely maintained by a balance between signal-dependent transcriptional induction and proteolysis. Renal disease is a common complication of diabetes.

Mesangial cell hypertrophy is characterized at the cellular level as an increase in overall protein synthesis in the absence of a concomitant increase in overall DNA synthesis. Multiple extracellular stimuli are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic mesangial cell hypertrophy. Prominent among these are vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), 1The abbreviations used are: ET-1, endothelin-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Ub, ubiquitin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; RNAi, RNA interference; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; FBS, fetal bovine serum; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA. vasopressin, angiotensin II, and transforming growth factor-β (2Bonventre J.V.

Our recent findings indicate that renal mesangial cell hypertrophy is controlled by mechanisms similar to those governing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In particular, in addition to the recruitment of MAPKs, mesangial cell hypertrophy requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our studies have been aimed at the identification of mechanisms coupling signaling pathways with more distal elements that trigger renal mesangial cell hypertrophy. Using a combined pharmacological and transcriptional profiling approach, we have identified genes induced by ET-1 after the period of treatment needed to trigger hypertrophy. Seven genes were identified; of these, one transcript, encoding the small basic helix-loop-helix protein p8, was strikingly and stably induced by ET-1 (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The p8 gene has been conserved evolutionarily, with homologs found in man, rat, mouse, and Xenopus. p8 was initially isolated as a gene strongly induced during acute pancreatitis (10Mallo G.V.

Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In several cell lines, the p8 gene is transiently induced in response to stress and thus may be part of a general defense mechanism protecting against cellular injury (10Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Calvo E.L. Ortiz E.M. Vasseur S. Keim V. Morisset J. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32360-32369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Bodeker H. Canepa E. Moreno S. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, targeted disruption of the murine p8 gene, although not lethal, does result in higher mortality in the lipopolysaccharide injection model of sepsis (13Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Barthet M. Saint-Michel L. Berthezene P. Fiedler F. Closa D. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. BMC Gastroenterol. 2003; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/3/25PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have implicated p8 gene expression with metastatic potential (14Ree A.H. Tvermyr M. Engebraaten O. Rooman M. Rosok O. Hovig E. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Bruland O.S. Fodstad O. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4675-4680PubMed Google Scholar), and the p8 gene may also be involved in the control of cell proliferation, although the precise function of p8 in cell proliferation is unclear. Thus, disruption of the p8 gene suppresses transformation associated with ectopic expression of ras and adenoviral E1A, blunting the growth of these transformed cells in soft agar and preventing the formation of tumors in mice injected with ras/E1A-transformed p8–/– cells (15Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia S. Bagnis C. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By contrast, p8–/– cells proliferate more rapidly in culture and are resistant to chemical stress-induced apoptosis (16Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Mallo G.V. Fieil R. Kühbander S. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The product of the human p8 gene is an 82-amino acid protein with no significant homology to any other known eukaryotic protein. Analysis of the primary structure of p8 revealed a canonical bipartite nuclear localization signal and a potential DNA interaction motif (see Fig. 1A) (13Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Barthet M. Saint-Michel L. Berthezene P. Fiedler F. Closa D. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. BMC Gastroenterol. 2003; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/3/25PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, recombinant p8 has been shown to bind in vitro to DNA, an interaction enhanced in vitro by phosphorylation of the recombinant protein with protein kinase A (17Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2742-2751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with the possibility that p8 is regulated by phosphorylation, 17% of the amino acid composition of p8 is composed of phosphorylatable residues (17Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2742-2751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, the p8 protein contains an N-terminal PEST (Pro/Glu/Ser/Thr-rich) region, suggesting regulation of p8 levels by the ubiquitin (Ub)/proteasome system (see Fig. 1A) (18Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). We have previously dissected the rat renal mesangial cell molecular signaling events activated by ET-1 that are required for hypertrophy and found that hypertrophy requires activation of the ERK and JNK MAPKs as well as PI3K-dependent signaling, possibly through NFAT proteins (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ET-1 induction of the p8 gene requires activation of these same signaling pathways. The p8 gene is also strongly induced in the kidneys of rats made diabetic with streptozotocin. Experiments using RNA interference (RNAi) to specifically silence mesangial cell p8 mRNA identified the p8 gene as a necessary component in the ET-1-stimulated transcriptional program that triggers mesangial cell hypertrophy (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although there is a substantial understanding of the regulation of p8 gene expression and even of the putative biological function(s) of the p8 gene product, little or nothing is known about the regulation of the p8 polypeptide itself or of the regulation p8 protein levels in the cell. In our initial studies of the endogenous mesangial cell p8 polypeptide, we were intrigued to find that p8 was almost undetectable unless cells were preincubated with inhibitors of the Ub/proteasome system. Under these circumstances, we could detect a modest ET-1-stimulated increase in the p8 protein; however, the significance of this increase was unclear given the conditions necessary to visualize it, and we were compelled to ascertain whether or not p8 protein stability, as with p8 mRNA, is regulated by extracellular signaling pathways. Here, we show that the p8 protein is heavily phosphorylated in vivo. We found that the regulation of p8 polypeptide levels runs counter to the regulation of p8 mRNA. p8 is a predominantly nuclear protein that is constitutively degraded through a proteasome-dependent mechanism, and this degradation is regulated by the Akt pathway. Accordingly, p8 stability requires in vivo GSK3, the activity of which is inhibited by Akt. GSK3 also directly phosphorylates p8 in vitro. Overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt mutant or the addition of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, stabilized the p8 protein and confirmed that destabilization of p8 is mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin substantially enhanced the levels of endogenous and recombinant p8. LiCl, a GSK3 inhibitor, destabilized p8 by a process that could be reversed with proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin). Finally, our RNAi experiments indicated that ET-1-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy and p8 mRNA induction require NFAT4, a transcription factor that is itself inhibited by GSK3 and activated by Akt-mediated GSK3 inhibition. Cell Culture—Primary rat renal mesangial cells were isolated as described (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human embryonic 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% FBS. ET-1, lactacystin, LY294002, and SB203580 were from Calbiochem. Calyculin A was from Cell Signaling Technology. Immunofluorescence studies of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were performed as described (19Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4442-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DNA and Vectors—pcDNA-p8-His5 was obtained by mutating by PCR the stop codon of the full-length human p8 cDNA and introducing in-frame a short sequence coding for five histidines, followed by a stop codon. The construct was subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/hygro. pEGFP-p8 was obtained by cloning full-length human p8 in-frame at the C terminus of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Vectors encoding wild-type and kinase-dead GSK3β have been described (20Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). pUSEamp vectors expressing dominant-negative and membrane-targeted, constitutively active Akt1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Transfections, Kinase Assays, and Western Blot Analysis—293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells at 70–80% confluency were transfected as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were used after 24 h. Drugs (LY294002 (20 μm), SB203580 (20 μm), lactacystin (10 μm), and calyculin A (0.1 μm)) were added to the medium 3 h prior to lysing the cells. In cotransfection experiments, cells were lysed in 400 μl of Laemmli denaturing loading buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed with either our rabbit anti-p8 polyclonal antibody or commercial antibody against histidine (G-18), NFAT4 (F-1), NFAT1 (7A6), Ub (FL-76), or c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polypeptides were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Mesangial cells at 70% confluency were serum-starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.5% FBS and then stimulated for 24 h with vehicle or 100 nm ET-1 in the presence or absence of vehicle or 10 μm lactacystin. Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and 60 μg of total proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-p8 polyclonal antibody. To detect endogenous p8, the membrane was developed using the SuperSignal system (Pierce). For treatment of the recombinant p8 protein with λ-phosphatase, 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA-p8-His5 as described above. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in 900 μl of 8 m urea and 100 mm Tris (pH 8) containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The recombinant p8 protein was immobilized for 3 h at 4 °C on 60 μl of nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (QIAGEN Inc.). The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris (pH 8), and twice with λ-phosphatase buffer. The immobilized p8 protein was distributed into three aliquots. One was left untreated. The others were treated at 30 °C for 40 min with 10 units/μl λ-phosphatase in the presence or absence of 2 mm MnCl2, which is required for λ-phosphatase activity. Phosphatase reactions were stopped with 25 mm NaF. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. In experiments of p8 ubiquitination, p8-His5 was transfected alone or together with Myc-tagged Ub and purified from the total cellular lysates as described above. The immunoblots were decorated using anti-Ub or anti-Myc antibody and ECL solutions. For the kinase assays, 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged wild-type or kinase-dead GSK3β. The next day, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 900 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of total protein extracts were incubated with 2 μg of antibody 9E10 for 2 h at 4 °C with 60 μl of protein G-agarose (50%). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Mops (pH 7.2), 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 1 μg of bacterially expressed p8 protein, 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. In Vivo Labeling with 32PO4 and [35S]Methionine—293 cells transfected as described above were incubated for 3 h in 3 ml of phosphate-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 1 mCi/ml carrier-free 32PO4. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described above in 900 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal cpm of labeled extract were incubated with 4 μg of either anti-His or anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C with 60 μl of protein G-agarose (50%), and the immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Mesangial cells were serum-starved for 48 h in a 6-cm Petri dish, stimulated with 100 nm ET-1, and then labeled for 4 h with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) and 0.5% FBS. Cells were lysed in 800 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of either preimmune serum or anti-p8 antiserum as described above. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Mammalian Cell RNAi— Complementary RNA oligonucleotides derived from the rat nfat4 target sequence (AAGGGAATATTTGGAAAGGCCTT) were from Dharmacon. The method for rat p8 RNAi has been reported previously (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Deprotection and annealing of the oligonucleotides were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Procedures for RNAi were essentially as described by Elbashir et al. (22Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNAs were introduced into mesangial cells at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μg of oligonucleotide/6-cm dish. After an overnight incubation with the siRNA, mesangial cells were serum-starved for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium and 0.5% FBS before proceeding. Analysis of ET-1-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy has been described previously (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Regulation of p8 Protein Levels by the Ub/Proteasome System—We have recently shown that p8 mRNA expression is rapidly induced by ET-1 during the onset of mesangial cell hypertrophy (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about how this induction is reflected in changes, if any, in the in vivo levels of p8 protein. To our surprise, we were unable to detect p8 protein in lysates of mesangial cells by immunoblotting, even after treatment with ET-1 (Fig. 1B, left two lanes). We were able to detect mesangial cell p8 only after immunoprecipitation from extracts of cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 1C). In this instance, 35S-labeled p8 was immunoprecipitated only with anti-p8 antiserum, and not with preimmune serum. Of note, ET-1 treatment for 24 h, which is sufficient to induce maximally p8 mRNA (see Fig. 4C) (9Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), did not trigger increases in the p8 polypeptide (Fig. 1C). Thus, ET-1 stimulated a very large increase in p8 mRNA expression, but failed to trigger a concomitant increase in the p8 protein (compare Figs. 1C and 4C). Given this observation and the difficulty in detecting the endogenous p8 protein, we wondered whether p8 might be constitutively degraded. Examination of the primary sequence of p8 indicated the presence of a PEST sequence (Fig. 1A). PEST sequences are present in many polypeptides that are subject to rapid degradation by the Ub/proteasome system (18Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effects on p8 protein levels of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (23Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Preincubation of mesangial cells with lactacystin enables detection of endogenous p8 by immunoblotting. Under these circumstances, we observed a modest increase in the p8 protein upon subsequent treatment with ET-1 (Fig. 1B, right two lanes); however, given that this increase was apparent only upon examination of lactacystin-treated cells (Fig. 1, compare B and C), its physiological significance is unclear. Still, it is evident from Fig. 1B that endogenous p8 was destabilized by the Ub/proteasome system. Recombinant p8 expressed in 293 cells behaved in a similar manner. Thus, Fig. 1D shows that p8 immunoreactivity was present in extracts expressing pcDNA-p8, but not in mock-transfected 293 cells. Interestingly, even after ectopic overexpression, p8 protein levels remained extremely low. The addition of 10 μm lactacystin to the culture medium stimulated a significant accumulation of the p8 polypeptide (Fig. 1D), indicating regulation of p8 levels by the Ub/proteasome system. Ub is attached to target proteins via a covalent bond between a specific Lys residue in the Ub polypeptide (typically Lys48 for proteins destined for proteasomal degradation) and a Lys residue in the target protein. We found that p8 was ubiquitinated in vivo either in cells expressing p8 alone or in cells expressing p8 and Myc-tagged recombinant Ub (Fig. 1E). Of note, Fig. 1 (B–D), which examines total p8 protein levels, indicates that p8 migrated at ∼18 kDa. By contrast, Ub-p8 (Fig. 1E) migrated at ∼25 kDa, indicating an increase in size of ∼7 kDa, the predicted size of the Ub polypeptide. Thus, detectable Ub-p8 appears to be monoubiquitinated. We could not detect poly-Ub-p8; whether this is due to the overall extremely poor expression of endogenous or ectopically expressed p8 or to the fact that p8 is indeed monoubiquitinated remains to be determined. Nevertheless, taken together, these results strongly indicate that p8 stability is regulated by the Ub/proteasome system. p8 Is a Nuclear Protein—Analysis of the primary structure of p8 revealed a canonical bipartite nuclear localization signal and a potential DNA interaction motif (Fig. 1A) (13Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Barthet M. Saint-Michel L. Berthezene P. Fiedler F. Closa D. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. BMC Gastroenterol. 2003; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/3/25PubMed Google Scholar). We thus investigated the protein localization by overexpressing pEGFP-p8 in different cell lines. (The N-terminal EGFP tag stabilized the recombinant p8 protein, rendering it resistant to degradation. 2S. Goruppi, unpublished data. ) When overexpressed as a fusion with GFP, p8 was localized in the nuclear compartment of both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A, left panels), even in absence of external stimuli. The control EGFP protein was localized throughout the cell (Fig. 2A, right panels). This cellular localization was not significantly modified by stimulation of the cells with epidermal growth factor or after osmotic stress with sorbitol (data not shown). Taken together, these results thus strongly suggest that p8 functions in the nuclear compartment. p8 Is a Phosphoprotein: Regulation of Proteasomal Degradation by Protein Kinase Signaling Pathways—p8 is a highly charged protein with a large percentage of residues that are potential targets for protein kinases (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this, p8 has been reported to be an in vitro substrate for protein kinase A and casein kinase-2 (17Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2742-2751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We thus asked if p8 is phosphorylated in vivo. Given the low abundance of endogenous p8, we decided to examine recombinant p8 expressed in 293 cells. Cells were separately transfected with empty vector, pcDNA-p8-His5, or pEGFP-p8 and then metabolically labeled with 32PO4. p8 was immunoprecipitated with either anti-GFP or anti-His antibody. Both the His5- and EGFP-tagged p8 proteins were heavily phosphorylated (Fig. 3A). Both p8-His5 and endogenous p8 migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels at an apparent molecular mass of 18-kDa, more than two times larger than the expected molecular mass based on amino acid composition. To determine whether this discrepancy was due to phosphorylation of the protein, we incubated the recombinant protein in vitro with λ-protein phosphatase. p8-His5 was purified from transfected 293 cells and either left untreated or incubated with λ-phosphatase in the presence or absence of MnCl2, a necessary cofactor for λ-phosphatase activity (24Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1989; 260 (P. T. W.): 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After the treatment, the reactions were stopped with NaF, and the samples were analyzed by anti-His immunoblotting. In the presence of MnCl2, phosphatase selectively enhanced the mobility of p8 on SDS gels. It should be noted, however, that the dephosphorylated p8 polypeptide still migrated on SDS gels more slowly than expected, indicating that the observed migration of p8 upon SDS-PAGE cannot be attributed solely to phosphorylation. Endogenous p8 is present at extremely low levels in vivo; and even after ectopic expression, it is difficult to detect the C-terminally tagged recombinant p8 protein in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. Many targets of the Ub/proteasome system are degraded in a manner stimulated by extracellular signaling pathways (25Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wished to determine whether the signaling pathways known to regulate p8 mRNA levels might also regulate the stability of the p8 protein in vivo. Thus, 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA-p8-His5 and treated for various times with calyculin A, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 and -2A (26Resjo S. Oknianska A. Zolnierowicz S. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Calyculin A rapidly destabilized p8 to a point at which the overexpressed protein was nearly undetectable (Fig. 3C). This destabilization was reversed with lactacystin, indicating that inhibition of a calyculin-sensitive phosphatase triggers the proteasome-dependent degradation of p8. Bacterially expressed p8 has been reported to be a target in vitro for protein kinase A and casein kinase-2, but its regulation in vivo is still poorly understood (15Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia S. Bagnis C. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Mallo G.V. Fieil R. Kühbander S.

https://openalex.org/W1975009732,"In egg-laying species, such as the chicken, the mode of transport of lipoprotein particles from the capillary plasma to endocytic receptors on the oocyte surface is largely unknown. Here we show by molecular characterization that the large prominent heparan sulfate proteoglycan of extracellular matrices, termed perlecan or HSPG2 (the product of the hspg2 gene), is a component of ovarian follicles that may participate in this process. However, although normally a major HSPG of basement membranes or basal laminae, in chicken follicles, perlecan is absent from the membranous structure between the theca interna and granulosa cell layers, which to date has been considered a bona fide basement membrane. Rather, the protein is localized in the extracellular matrix of theca externa cells, which produce this HSPG. Furthermore, in chicken testes, perlecan is localized in the peritubular spaces but in less organized fashion than the classical basement membrane components, agrin and laminin. All five domains and structural hallmarks of chicken perlecan (4071 residues) have been conserved in its mammalian counterparts. We have produced the recombinant domain II (containing low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-like binding repeats) of chicken perlecan and demonstrate its capacity to bind LDL and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins ultimately destined for uptake into oocytes via members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. Binding to perlecan heparan sulfate side chains may facilitate the interaction of lipoproteins with domain II. Based on the current results and on domain-domain interactions revealed by recent ultrastructural investigations of the LDL receptor, nidogen, and laminin (Rudenko, G., Henry, L., Henderson, K., Ichtchenko, K., Brown, M. S., Goldstein, J. L., and Deisenhofer, J. (2002) Science 298, 2353-2358 and Takagi, J., Yang, Y., Liu, J. H., Wang, J. H., and Springer, T. A. (2003) Nature 424, 969-974), we propose a novel role of perlecan in mediating plasma-to-oocyte surface transport of VLDL particles. In egg-laying species, such as the chicken, the mode of transport of lipoprotein particles from the capillary plasma to endocytic receptors on the oocyte surface is largely unknown. Here we show by molecular characterization that the large prominent heparan sulfate proteoglycan of extracellular matrices, termed perlecan or HSPG2 (the product of the hspg2 gene), is a component of ovarian follicles that may participate in this process. However, although normally a major HSPG of basement membranes or basal laminae, in chicken follicles, perlecan is absent from the membranous structure between the theca interna and granulosa cell layers, which to date has been considered a bona fide basement membrane. Rather, the protein is localized in the extracellular matrix of theca externa cells, which produce this HSPG. Furthermore, in chicken testes, perlecan is localized in the peritubular spaces but in less organized fashion than the classical basement membrane components, agrin and laminin. All five domains and structural hallmarks of chicken perlecan (4071 residues) have been conserved in its mammalian counterparts. We have produced the recombinant domain II (containing low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-like binding repeats) of chicken perlecan and demonstrate its capacity to bind LDL and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins ultimately destined for uptake into oocytes via members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. Binding to perlecan heparan sulfate side chains may facilitate the interaction of lipoproteins with domain II. Based on the current results and on domain-domain interactions revealed by recent ultrastructural investigations of the LDL receptor, nidogen, and laminin (Rudenko, G., Henry, L., Henderson, K., Ichtchenko, K., Brown, M.

(2003) Nature 424, 969-974), we propose a novel role of perlecan in mediating plasma-to-oocyte surface transport of VLDL particles. During the development of the cellular architecture of ovarian follicles in the laying hen, the formation of extracellular matrices and laminar structures by differentiating cells are important processes. The regulation of their synthesis and assembly is one of the prerequisites for the normal growth of the central giant germ cell of the follicles, the oocyte. In the final 7-day period of rapid growth, the oocyte is surrounded by a concentric arrangement of, from the periphery inwards, (i) vascularized connective tissue representing an extension of the follicle stalk; (ii) the theca proper, which can be divided into the theca externa, a broad layer of stratified cells with embedded capillaries, and the theca interna, a narrower zone of loosely packed cells also containing capillaries; (iii) an acellular layer commonly designated as “basal lamina” (iv) an epitheloid layer of granulosa cells; and (v) the zona pellucida.

Chem. 1998; 379: 965-971PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that oocyte growth and development are achieved through the unprecedentedly efficient uptake of hepatically synthesized yolk precursor proteins by multifunctional oocytic plasma membrane receptors belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LR) 1The abbreviations used are: LR, lipoprotein receptor; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RAP, receptor-associated protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MBP, maltose-binding protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HS, heparan sulfate; N-CAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; LE, laminin EGF-like; LA, LDL receptor ligand binding. gene family. We have previously shown that at least two such receptors, termed LR8 (3George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol.

The size of serum-borne VLDL particles, on the order of 40-nm diameter (7Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 257-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nimpf J. Radosavljevic M. Schneider W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), poses a question. How do these large complex molecules gain access to the oocytic plasma membrane in the core of the follicle? Detailed ultrastructural studies in the late 1970s (9Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 481-497PubMed Google Scholar) established that the endothelium of capillaries within the theca layer shows extensive fenestrae with widths of up to 50 nm, many of which appear to provide direct access from the lumen to the pericapillary space. Thus, when macromolecules are released from the capillary serum compartment, they first encounter extracellular matrices, from where they must be free to diffuse across the basal lamina, through gaps between granulosa cells, and past the zona pellucida, to home in on high affinity endocytic receptors on the oocyte surface. The so-called basal lamina or basement membrane, which separates granulosa cells from theca interna, has previously been shown to be permeable to serum-derived VLDL particles (10Evans A.J. Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Shen X. Steyrer E. Retzek H. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the high concentration of the particles residing within the membrane is related to its permeability for VLDL in the fluid phase (11Shen X. Steyrer E. Retzek H. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as previous studies have not addressed the molecular nature of this follicular membrane to any extent, and as it is generally accepted that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan, is an important functional component of basement membranes, we have initiated studies on chicken perlecan. Mammalian perlecans (12Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Noonan D.M. Fulle A. Valente P. Cai S. Horigan E. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22939-22947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are comprised of five domains, of which only the first, a heparan sulfate-containing region, is unique. The other four domains, from the N terminus, are homologous to the LDL receptor, the N-terminal region of laminin A and B short arms, N-CAM, and the globular C terminus of the laminin A chain, respectively. Molecular characterization of the first avian perlecan shows that this protein has been well conserved in mammalian species and is synthesized by theca cells but is absent from the membrane that separates the theca from the granulosa cell layer. Based on ligand binding results with the recombinant LDL receptor-homologous domain of perlecan, we propose that it may function in extracellular transient retention of yolk precursor molecules released from the capillary bed. Experimental Animals—Derco Brown laying hens and roosters (30-40 weeks old) were purchased from Heindl (Vienna, Austria) and maintained on layer's mash with free access to water and feed under a daily light period of 14 h. Isolation of Chicken Perlecan cDNA—The mouse HSPG2 cDNA fragments BG5 (2.0 kb) and BG7 (2.2 kb) (14Noonan D.M. Horigan E.A. Ledbetter S.R. Vogeli G. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16379-16387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. J. Hassell, Shriners Hospital for Children, Tampa, FL) were used as probes for screening an oligo(dt)- and random-primed chicken eye λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech). cDNA probes, derived from the first chicken HSPG2 clone confirmed by sequencing and from subsequently isolated clones, were used to screen further cDNA libraries to obtain full-length chicken HSPG2 cDNA: a chicken muscle λgt11 cDNA library, oligo(dt)and random-primed (Clontech); a chicken embryo λgt11 cDNA library, oligo(dt)-primed (Clontech); a chicken follicle λgt11 cDNA library, oligo(dt)- and random-primed (Bujo et al. (5Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)); and a laying hen liver ZAP II cDNA library, oligo(dt)- and random-primed (Takara). Inserts were cloned and sequenced. The 5′-end of the coding sequence was obtained by using the 5′-/3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends Kit (Roche Applied Science) and poly(A)-mRNA isolated from the theca layer with the primer 5′-CACGCTGCCCTCCAGCTCCTTGAT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 412-435; for the first PCR reaction, the primer 5′-GCCATCTGCAGACGCTTCATCTGC-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 172-195, was used, and for the second PCR reaction 5′-CGTGTCCTCAGGGAAGGAGCTCTC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 76-99, was used. Further cloning details are available upon request. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from various chicken tissues using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Total RNA (30 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of glyoxal (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Argentine J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), blotted, and covalently bound by UV cross-linking onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The following probes were used: for chicken perlecan, a 339-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 6872-7210; for chicken agrin, the cDNA-clone pBG5 (16Tsen G. Halfter W. Kroger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); for chicken laminin B1, 845 bp corresponding to nucleotides 363-1207; and for chicken β-actin, 340 bp corresponding to nucleotides 627-966, respectively. The probes were labeled with dCTP32 by random priming, and hybridization was performed under standard conditions. The blots were subsequently exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at -80 °C. Cloning of the Chicken Perlecan LA Repeats 2-4 into the pMAL Vector—PCR of the chicken HSPG2 ligand-binding domain repeats 2-4, designated perl2-4, was performed using the forward primer 5′-GCGGATCCGCCCCACGGCTGCCGCC-3′ with a BamHI site (underlined) corresponding to nucleotides 805-823 and the reverse primer 5′-AGCCCGGGCGGCGGCATGCAGCCGAC-3′ with an XmaI site (underlined) corresponding to nucleotides 1165-1183. The PCR product (392 bp) was cloned into the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs), which had been modified to provide a His tag at the C-terminal end of the resulting fusion protein (a kind gift of Dr. D. Blaas in our Department). The construct pMAL-perl-LA2-4 was confirmed by sequencing. Expression of pMAL-perl2-4, GST·RAP, GST·RAP-Myc, and RAPMyc, Purification and Refolding—The vectors pMAL-perl2-4, pGEXRAP (receptor-associated protein), and pET-15b-MycRAP (17Koch S. Strasser V. Hauser C. Fasching D. Brandes C. Bajari T.M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain Top10F′ (Invitrogen). After induction with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, the proteins were purified and folded essentially as described (18Hummel S. Lynn E.G. Osanger A. Hirayama S. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 1: 1Google Scholar). GST·RAP-Myc was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). As described previously (18Hummel S. Lynn E.G. Osanger A. Hirayama S. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 1: 1Google Scholar), the pMAL-perl2-4 was refolded by dialysis in the presence of RAP-Sepharose. The bound and refolded protein was then eluted from the RAP-Sepharose with 0.5 × TBS + 2 mm CaCl2 (TBS-C), 1 m NH4OH. The eluted proteins were immediately adjusted to pH 8 with 0.1 m HCl and dialyzed against TBS-C for 24 h. Preparation of Lipoproteins and Cell Uptake Studies—VLDL and LDL were isolated from the serum of laying hens by differential floatation as described previously (19Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-VLDL was generated by the iodine monochloride method as described (18Hummel S. Lynn E.G. Osanger A. Hirayama S. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 1: 1Google Scholar) and extensively dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) before use and stored at 4 °C. Indicated concentrations represent the protein content. Mouse NIH3T3 cells were grown overnight on culture slides in medium supplemented with lipoprotein-deficient serum in the presence of 1 μm NK104 to maximally induce LDL receptor expression (18Hummel S. Lynn E.G. Osanger A. Hirayama S. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 1: 1Google Scholar) and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with LDL alone or in the presence of perl2-4 at the indicated concentrations. Following incubation, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol/acetone (1/1, by volume) at -20 °C, incubated with rabbit anti-chicken apoB antiserum (1:500) (20Nimpf J. George R. Schneider W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 657-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by 5 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Electrophoresis, Transfer to Nitrocellulose, and Ligand and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by one-dimensional 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Molecular weights were estimated with a broad range molecular mass standard (6.5-200 kDa) from Bio-Rad. After electrophoresis, proteins were either visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or electrophoretically transferred to WESTRAN clear signal PVDF membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.4, for 60 min at 14 V on a semidry trans-blot SD transfer cell (Bio-Rad). After transfer, proteins were visualized by staining the membrane with Ponceau S (Sigma) and destaining with H2O. For Western blot analyses, the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) antiserum (New England BioLabs; 1:1000), anti-perl2-4 antiserum (1:1000), or anti-perl2-4 preimmune serum (1:1000). Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Sigma) and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pierce). For ligand blotting with receptor-associated protein (RAP), blocking was with 5% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free, Sigma) in TBS-C. Following incubation with the indicated concentrations of RAP-Myc and GST·RAP, bound RAP-Myc was detected with monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (1:500), horseradish peroxidase-goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:40,000; Sigma), and an ECL system. For ligand blotting experiments using 125I-VLDL, PVDF membranes were blocked and incubated with 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml 125I-VLDL (specific activity, 530 cpm/ng; protein concentration 1.5 μg/ml) as described previously (19Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For competition experiments, 125I-VLDL was coincubated with the indicated concentrations of EDTA, GST·RAP, or unlabeled VLDL. Bound 125I-VLDL was detected by exposing the membrane to x-ray film with intensifying screens at -80 °C. Immunohistochemical Studies—For immunohistochemistry, the follicles (5-7 mm diameter) and rooster testes were embedded in freezing agent (Microm Austria) and immediately frozen. Cryostat sections of 15 μm were prepared and fixed on SuperFrostR Plus slides (Menzel) with aceton/methanol (1:1) for 10 min. The slides were blocked with 3% inactivated goat serum, 1% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with different antibodies and antisera for 1 h. After three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, they were incubated with 1:500 fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies or goat anti-mouse antibodies (both from Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, the specimens were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO) and photographed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 135). Counterstaining of cellular nuclei was performed with DAPI. Where indicated, heparinase III (heparitinase; Sigma) treatment of tissue sections was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 units of heparinase III for 3 h at 37 °C. Antibodies and Antisera—Polyclonal antibodies directed against the isolated major component (termed ggBM1) of the membrane separating the granulosa from theca cells, or against the bacterially expressed perl2-4, were raised in adult female New Zealand White rabbits (4Barber D.L. Sanders E.J. Aebersold R. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18761-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are designated anti-ggBM1 or anti-perl2-4. Rabbit antiserum against MBP was obtained from New England Biolabs. For immunohistochemistry, the following additional rabbit polyclonal antisera were used: against chicken agrin (22Halfter W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); against mouse perlecan (kindly provided by the late Dr. R. Timpl, MPI Martinsried, Germany); against chicken fibronectin (Chemicon); furthermore, anti-perl2-4 and anti-ggBM1 antiserum as described above. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: mAb 3H11 against embryonic chicken laminin (22Halfter W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); mAb COL I against collagen I (Sigma); mAb 2E9 against Syndecan-1/Syndecan-3; mAb 3G10 against heparitinase-treated heparan sulfate chains (kindly provided by Dr. G. David, Center of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); and mAb 5C9 against chick perlecan. 2M. Balasubramani, M. E. Bier, S. Hummel, W. J. Schneider, and W. Halfter, submitted. Cloning of Chicken HSPG2—The contiguous 12,216-bp coding sequence of chicken HSPG2 was obtained from aligning multiple overlapping clones obtained by screening several cDNA libraries. In a screen of the oligo(dt)- and random-primed chicken eye λgt11 cDNA library with two murine HSPG2 cDNAs (14Noonan D.M. Horigan E.A. Ledbetter S.R. Vogeli G. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16379-16387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we obtained seven overlapping cDNA clones ranging in size from 260 to 6300 bp that covered the central ⅔ of the expected full-length sequence. To obtain clones covering the 5′-end as well as the 3′-end of chicken HSPG2, oligo(dt)- and/or random primed chicken muscle, ovarian follicle, and liver λgt11 cDNA libraries were screened with flanking clones, and 5′/3′rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR cloning was performed. A total of 18 overlapping clones for chicken HSPG2 were sequenced on both strands and span a total of 12,255 bp. They encoded one contiguous open reading frame plus 39 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequence. The nucleotide and the predicted amino acid sequence have been submitted to the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (accession number AJ584653). The open reading frame of 12,216 bp encodes 4071 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular size of 432 kDa. Structural Organization of Chicken Perlecan—Amino acid sequence alignment demonstrated that human, murine, and chicken perlecan core proteins are highly homologous. A schematic summary of the domain organization of perlecans from human, mouse, chicken, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila is shown in Fig. 1. The deduced avian protein contains all five domains conserved in the murine molecule (13Noonan D.M. Fulle A. Valente P. Cai S. Horigan E. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22939-22947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): domain I (D I), a globular N-terminal domain with putative heparan sulfate (HS) attachment sites; domain II (D II), four copies of LDL receptor ligand-binding (LA) repeats; a central domain III (D III), resembling the short arm of laminin chains with three globules and four cysteine-rich repeats; domain IV (D IV), containing 18 IgG repeats; and domain V (D V), a large globular C-terminal domain resembling part of the G domain of the laminin A chain. Domains II and III are separated by one copy of an Ig repeat-like sequence (IgR1). The domain structure is in accordance with electron microscopy and protein analyses of mammalian perlecans, which indicate that the core protein folds into about 60-80-nm-long linear arrays of globular domains (hence the name perlecan) with extensive secondary structure (23Ledbetter S.R. Fisher L.W. Hassell J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Paulsson M. Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The N terminus of mature chicken perlecan is presumed to be valine 17, in accordance with the rules of von Heijne (25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) and further suggested by alignment with human and murine homologues. The N-terminal portion of domain I (178 amino acids) contains two closely spaced Ser-Gly-Asp/Glu (SGD and SGE) sequences, which are potential attachment sites for HS side chains (26Dolan M. Horchar T. Rigatti B. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4316-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of domain I (∼90 residues) shows similarities to a conserved sequence called SEA (sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin) module, which has diverse functions in O-glycosylated proteins (27Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Domain II, characterized by homology to the LDL receptor, is comprised of 199 residues and contains four LA repeats, which are 40-residue-long motifs with clusters of negatively charged residues typically in the sequence Ser-Asp-Glu (SDE), and with 6 cysteines each (28Herz J. Willnow T.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As in mammalian perlecans, the first LA repeat is separated from the other three by a cysteine-free, proline-rich linker sequence. In chicken perlecan, the linker comprises 38 residues with a proline content of 37%; in human perlecan, it comprises 50 residues (22% proline), and in the murine protein, it comprises 50 residues (26% proline). Shorter linker sequences between two LA repeats are a hallmark property of LA repeat clusters in practically all members of the LR supergene family. The presence and structure of the single 96-residue Ig-like repeat between domains II and III have been conserved from the chicken to mammals and is also present in the C. elegans homologue (29Rogalski T.M. Williams B.D. Mullen G.P. Moerman D.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 30Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Bush J.A. Gilchrist E.J. Moerman D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 171-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1168-residue-long domain III contains four subdomains consisting of internal cysteine-rich repeats similar to those typically found in domains III and V of the short arm of the laminin A and B chains (31Ehrig K.

Overall, the domain III of the chicken protein is over 60% identical to the primary sequence of murine and human perlecan. Domain IV contains 18 consecutive copies of homologous repeats, which are similar to the Ig repeats in N-CAM (41Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Bracken-bury R. Edelman G.M.

https://openalex.org/W1993493630,"Polo-like kinases comprise a family of evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinases that play multiple roles in cell cycle regulation. In addition to the N-terminal catalytic domain, polo-like kinases have one or two highly conserved C-terminal non-catalytic regions, termed polo boxes. These motifs are required for targeting these kinases to subcellular mitotic structures. Here we report that kinase-dead Xenopus polo-like kinase (Plx1NA) functions as a competitor of endogenous Plx1 for polo box binding site(s) and inhibits the activation of Cdc25C and the G2-M transition in vivo. However, kinase-dead Plx1 with a point mutation in the polo box region (Plx1NAWF) did not have inhibitory effects. The ability of Plx1NA to block activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome also requires an intact polo box. Microinjection of Plx1NA but not Plx1NAWF mRNA into Xenopus embryos caused cleavage arrest and formation of monopolar spindles, an effect previously seen in embryos injected with anti-Plx1 antibody. Spindle assembly experiments in vitro also showed that only monopolar spindles formed in Xenopus egg extracts supplemented with recombinant Plx1NA and that the spindle assembly process was delayed. Taken together, these results indicate that the polo box is required for Plx1 function in both the G2-M and the metaphase/anaphase transitions during the cell cycle.

Polo-like kinases (Plks) 1The abbreviations used are: Plk, polo-like kinase; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CSF, cytostatic factor; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: Plk, polo-like kinase; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CSF, cytostatic factor; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are a family of conserved mitotic serine/threonine kinases. Several members of this kinase family have been found in both mammalian cells and Xenopus, including mammalian Plk1 (Xenopus Plx1), Plk2/Snk (Xenopus Plx2), Plk3/Prk/Fnk (Xenopus Plx3), and Sak (1Duncan P.I.

In other species, however, only one form of the kinase has been found, including Polo in Drosophila, Plo1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Cdc5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plks participate in several stages of mitosis, including mitotic entry, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis (reviewed in Ref. 4Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). All Plks share a closely related catalytic domain in the N terminus and one or two characteristic sequence motifs, the polo boxes, in the non-catalytic C terminus (reviewed in Ref. 4Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The polo boxes are thought to localize the respective kinase to various mitotic structures during cell cycle progression, including centrosomes in early M phase, the spindle midzone in early and late anaphase, and the midbody in cytokinesis, presumably to promote interaction of the kinase with specific substrates and effectors (5Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The same motifs may also regulate Plk activity by binding to and inhibiting the kinase domain (6Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recently, the C-terminal motifs were implicated in stabilizing the protein level of polo-like kinases by interacting with Hsp90 (7Simizu S. Osada H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 852-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sak has only one polo box, and the crystal structure of murine Sak revealed the formation of intermolecular homodimers both in vitro and in vivo (8Leung G.C. Hudson J.W. Kozarova A. Davidson A. Dennis J.W. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that Plks with two polo boxes might also form heterodimers. A single point mutation, W414F in Plk1, which most likely destroys the integrity of the polo box domain structure, dramatically affects the ability of human Plk1 to complement the cdc5-1 defect in yeast and disrupts Plk localization at spindle poles and septin ring structures (5Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Plx1 positively regulates the G2-M transition by phosphorylating and activating Cdc25C, which in turn dephosphorylates and activates Cdc2 (9Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both Plx1 and the related kinase, Prk, have been shown to physically associate with Cdc25C (10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 11Ouyang B. Li W. Pan H. Meadows J. Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At the beginning of mitosis, various proteins including Plks are recruited to the centrosomes during the “maturation” process (12Sunkel C.E. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 25-38PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Centrosomal localization may underline the requirement of Plks for establishment of a bipolar spindle (13Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), a function first observed in a Drosophila polo mutant (12Sunkel C.E. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 25-38PubMed Google Scholar, 15Llamazares S. Moreira A. Tavares A. Girdham C. Spruce B.A. Gonzalez C. Karess R.E. Glover D.M. Sunkel C.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This is a conserved function, inasmuch as microinjection of Plx1 or Plk1 antibody into Xenopus embryos or HeLa cells results in the formation of monopolar spindles (13Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate the important role of Plks in mitotic exit, possibly by participating in activation and inactivation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The vertebrate APC/C is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), a 20S multiprotein complex consisting of at least 10 core subunits, which, in combination with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2 or UBC), and an activator protein, Cdc20/Fizzy, promotes degradation of substrate proteins by the 26S proteasome (16Peters J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Peters J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Kotani S.

Of the three ubiquitination components, the APC/C seems to be the only one whose activity oscillates during the cell cycle. It has been reported that in some systems Plks are able to phosphorylate APC/C subunits, including Cdc16 and Cdc27, jointly with Cdc2-cyclin B (18Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation may be required for Fizzy to fully activate the APC/C (21Shteinberg M. Protopopov Y. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The activated APC/C subsequently ubiquitinates and promotes degradation of mitotic regulators, including cyclin B, leading to the inactivation of Cdc2 and exit from mitosis. The polo box of Plo1 interacts with Cut23 (APC/C8), a subunit of the APC/C in fission yeast, during mitosis (22May K.M. Reynolds N. Cullen C.F. Yanagida M. Ohkura H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the disruption of this interaction results in metaphase arrest. This finding suggests that the interaction is crucial for mitotic exit by directing Plo1 activity toward the APC/C and activating the complex. This idea is supported by the ability of kinase-dead Plx1 to block APC/C activation in Xenopus egg extracts (23Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Descombes P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Plks also appear to promote the onset of cytokinesis in a polo box-dependent manner. Cdc5 with conservative mutations in the polo box is unable to localize to cytokinetic neck filaments and fails to induce elongated cells with ectopic septin ring structures (5Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25Song S. Grenfell T.Z. Garfield S. Erikson R.L. Lee K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, Cdc11 and Cdc12, two septins thought to be the major structural components of the neck filaments (26Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), have been identified as polo box-interacting proteins (27Song S. Lee K.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 451-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although Plks play a pivotal role in the cell cycle, especially during mitosis, so far much of the work about the role of the polo box has focused on subcellular localization and cytokinesis, and little is known about the role of the polo box in mitotic entry and exit. To better understand the role of the polo box for Plk function, we have used the Xenopus system to examine the involvement of the polo box in mitotic entry and exit. For this purpose, we generated three Xenopus Plx1 mutants (Fig. 1): Plx1NA, a kinase-dead Plx1 whose kinase activity is abolished by a N172A point mutation in its kinase domain (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); Plx1NAWF, a kinase-dead Plx1 with a point mutation, W408F, in its first polo box, equivalent to the W414F mutation in Plk1, which has been demonstrated to dramatically abolish the localization capability of the motifs (5Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); and Plx1WF, a protein with the same polo box point mutation but with intact kinase activity. In this report, we show that the activation of Cdc25C and the G2-M transition is dependent on the polo box of Plx1 and that Plx1-dependent regulation of APC/C activity during exit from mitosis requires an intact polo box. Constructs—A W408F mutation in polo box 1 was introduced into Plx1 and Plx1-N172A by PCR using pOTV-Plx1 (Plx1) and pOTV-Plx1-N172A (Plx1NA) (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as templates, with primers having the following sequences: 5′-ATATTCTGGATCAGCAAATTCGTGGATTACTCGGACAAATACG-3′ and 5′-CGTATTTGTCCGAGTAATCCACGAATTTGCTGATCCAGAATAT-3′. These constructs, which encode proteins with a FLAG tag at the C terminus, were used for transcription of mRNA for Plx1NA and Plx1NAWF. Baculovirus expression constructs were created by PCR using the above-mentioned four constructs as templates, with pairs of primers having the following sequences: 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGCTCAAGTGGCCGGTAAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTGCCGAGGCCTTTACGTGTG-3′. The underlined sequences are Plx1 sequences, and the non-underlined sequences are Sf9 expression vector pBac-2cp LIC (Novagen) overhang-compatible sequences. In the case of the second primer, the non-underlined sequence also includes a His6 tag and a stop codon. The full-length Plx1, Plx1WF, Plx1NA, or Plx1NAWF cDNAs were then subcloned into pBac-2cp. Generation of mRNAs and Recombinant Proteins—Plx1NA and Plx1NAWF mRNAs were transcribed with the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion), phenol/chloroform purified, and dissolved in nuclease-free H2O (Ambion) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The Plx1, Plx1WF, Plx1NA, or Plx1NAWF recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells by the University of Colorado Cancer Center Core facility for tissue culture, and the proteins were purified as described previously (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Oocyte Microinjection and Detection of Cdc25C—Stage VI oocytes were injected with 40 nl of mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF proteins (1 mg/ml) and incubated in 2% Ficoll and 0.1× MMR (10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm HEPES) at 17 °C overnight. After addition of progesterone (final concentration, 10 μm) to the medium, groups of three oocytes were harvested at the indicated times, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Extracts were prepared, and Cdc25C was detected with rabbit anti-Cdc25C antibody as described previously (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Preparation and Manipulation of CSF Extracts, Immunoblotting, and H1 Kinase Assay—Metaphase II-arrested (CSF) extracts were prepared as described previously (28Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Due to the activity of CSF, these extracts are arrested at meiosis II with a high level of cyclin B/Cdc2 activity. The arrest can be released by addition of calcium, causing exit from metaphase arrest and proteolysis of cyclins by the APC/C. Each individual reaction was made by transferring 100 μl of extract into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube on ice and then adding 7 μl of buffer or recombinant Plx1 proteins (1.5 mg/ml), as indicated. After a 20-min incubation on ice, CSF arrest was released by addition of 1 μl of 50 mm CaCl2, and incubation was carried out at 21 °C. Samples of 2.5 μl were taken at the indicated times, mixed with 22.5 μl of extraction buffer (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C. For immunoblotting, 8 μl of the above-mentioned diluted sample was used. Cyclin B1 and B2 were detected with sheep anti-cyclin B1 and anti-cyclin B2 antibodies prepared as described previously (28Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), Cdc27 was blotted with anti-Cdc27 monoclonal antibody (BD Sciences), and histone H1 kinase activity was determined as described previously (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In Vitro Spindle Assembly, Microinjection, Immunofluorescence, and Microscopy—To assess the effect of Plx1NA on mitotic cyclin degradation, 30 μl of CSF extract was supplemented with 1.2 μl of buffer or Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF recombinant protein (1.5 mg/ml) on ice for 20 min. Xenopus sperm nuclei (final concentration, 100-300/μl) were then added, followed by addition of calcium to release CSF arrest. After 60 min, 1 μl of extract was mixed with 4 μl of fixation/stain buffer (48% glycerol, 11% formaldehyde, 1× MMR (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES), and 1 μg/ml DAPI), and the sample was monitored with an Olympus BH2 fluorescence microscope. The remaining extract was centrifuged onto a coverslip through 5 ml of BRB80 (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 40% glycerol) in a HB-4 rotor in a Sorvall centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The sample on the coverslip was fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 5 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in BRB80 for 1 h, and blotted with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody for 1 h, followed by three 5-min washes with PBS and staining with donkey anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated antibody and DAPI (Molecular Probes). The sample was observed with a Nikon microscope. To assess the effect of Plx1NA on spindle assembly during re-entry into mitosis in a CSF extract, 20 μl of CSF extract was supplemented with Xenopus sperm nuclei (final concentration, 100-300/μl), and CSF arrest was released by the addition of 0.2 μl of 50 mm CaCl2. Forty-five min after the release, 1.5 μl of buffer or Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF recombinant protein was added, and the extract was further incubated at room temperature for another 35 min. Then, 20 μl of fresh CSF extract was added to drive the extract back into mitosis. Sixty min later, 1 μl of the extract was subjected to DAPI staining, and nuclear morphology was assessed as described above. Seventy min after the addition of the fresh CSF extract, the spindles were spun down onto a coverslip (29Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), stained, and observed as described above. To assess the effect of Plx1NA on cell division, embryos at the two-cell stage were injected in both blastomeres with 40 nl of mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF proteins (1 mg/ml), cultured in 0.1× MMR for 5 h, and fixed with Dent's solution (20% Me2SO in methanol). α-Tubulin was detected with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and visualized by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes), and DNA was stained with SYTOX Green (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed with a PCM2000 microscope (Nikon). Immunoprecipitation—In each individual immunoprecipitation, 15 μl of Dynabeads protein G (Dynal) was washed and equilibrated with PBS and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. The Dynabeads protein G was conjugated with 10 μl of anti-His monoclonal antibody (200 μg/ml; Sigma) by rotation in 1 ml of PBS at 4 °C for 1.5 h, followed by three 5-min washes with cold PBS at 4 °C. In the case of Cdc27 immunoprecipitation, 5 μl of His6-tagged recombinant Plx1 protein (1.5 mg/ml) was incubated with the protein G beads-antibody complex, followed by three 5-min washes with cold PBS at 4 °C. The protein G immunocomplex was then incubated with 100 μl of CSF extract in 1 ml of cold PBS in the presence of 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times (15 min each) with 1 ml of cold PBS at 4 °C, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The Activation of Cdc25C by Plx1 in Xenopus Oocytes Is Polo Box-dependent—Entry into mitosis depends on phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C, a dual-specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates the Cdc2-cyclin B complex (28Izumi T.

A variety of evidence indicates that Plx1 functions upstream of Cdc25C and triggers the activation of the phosphatase, although Cdc2-cyclin B can also phosphorylate Cdc25C in a positive feedback loop (9Izumi T.

The observation that microinjection of anti-Plx1 antibody or Plx1NA recombinant protein (see Fig. 2) into Xenopus oocytes significantly delays the activation of Cdc25C (14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether the phosphorylation of Cdc25C by Plx1 is polo box-dependent. We reasoned that if Plx1NA competes with endogenous Plx1 for binding to Cdc25C, then it likely would inhibit the phosphorylation of this substrate by endogenous Plx1 and delay or inhibit the maturation of Xenopus oocytes. On the other hand, Plx1NAWF should have a minimal effect on oocyte maturation because the W408F point mutation abolishes the binding capability of the polo box. We injected either Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF mRNA into G2-arrested stage VI Xenopus oocytes and sampled groups of three oocytes at the indicated times. The activation of Cdc25C is evident as slower-migrating phosphorylated forms on SDS-PAGE (28Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 36Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G.

As shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A), the activation of Cdc25C from oocytes injected with Plx1NA mRNA was delayed for 2.5 h compared with control oocytes injected with buffer. The delay in Cdc25C activation also delayed the G2-M transition as monitored by nuclear envelope breakdown (germinal vesicle breakdown). Oocytes injected with Plx1NAWF mRNA, however, were only slightly delayed relative to the buffer control. Plx1NA, but not Plx1NAWF, Delays Entry into Mitosis in Vitro—To further investigate whether a functional polo box is needed for mitotic entry, we used an in vitro system to monitor the effect of Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF on entry into mitosis. Xenopus egg extracts arrested at meiotic metaphase II by CSF activity can be released by addition of calcium, leading to entry into interphase (38Lohka M.J. Maller J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). At room temperature, the extracts replicate DNA, and upon addition of fresh CSF extract, they reenter mitosis (29Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 38Lohka M.J. Maller J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To observe the effect of Plx1NA and Plx1NAWF on mitotic entry, we added the recombinant proteins to the extracts in interphase after calcium release. Sixty min after addition of fresh CSF extract, which drove the extracts back into mitosis (29Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), both extract incubated with buffer and extract incubated with Plx1NAWF recombinant protein had re-entered mitosis (Fig. 2B, a and c), as evidenced by the morphology of the sperm nuclei. However, mitotic entry in extracts incubated with Plx1NA was significantly delayed, and interphase nuclei were observed. This result strongly suggests that the polo box is required for Plx1 to regulate mitotic entry, presumably by mediating interaction between Plx1 and Cdc25C. Both Kinase Activity and the Polo Box Are Needed for Plx1 to Regulate APC/C Activity at Mitotic Exit—At the end of mitosis, the APC/C is activated and cyclin B is destroyed, leading to reduction of histone H1 kinase activity and exit from mitosis. Plks have been reported to be involved in the regulation of APC/C activity in two different ways. First, they are thought to phosphorylate the APC/C jointly with Cdc2-cyclin B to enable Fzy/Cdc20 to activate the APC/C (19Golan A. Yudkovsky Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15552-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Second, their activity is required to prevent premature inactivation of the APC/C, possibly by antagonizing the effect of an unidentified microcystin-sensitive phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the APC/C and inactivates it (39Brassac T. Castro A. Lorca T. Le Peuch C. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Galas S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3782-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Kinase-dead Plx1 inhibits the reduction of histone H1 kinase activity and the degradation of cyclin B during CSF release initiated by addition of calcium (23Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Descombes P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), thereby blocking mitotic exit. The inhibitory effect of Plx1NA on cyclin B degradation was thought to be due to the suppression of Plx1 activity that keeps APC/C active. However, subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Plx1NA did not irreversibly reduce endogenous Plx1 activity. 2Y. W. Qian and J. L. Maller, unpublished data. The discovery that the polo box of Plo1 interacts with Cut23 (22May K.M. Reynolds N. Cullen C.F. Yanagida M. Ohkura H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a subunit of APC/C in fission yeast, led us to examine the possibility that Xenopus Plx1 might regulate APC/C activity in a polo box-dependent way. The previous observation that kinase-dead Plx1 inhibited the release of CSF activity might reflect competition with endogenous Plx1 for polo box-binding site(s), as in the case of Cdc25C activation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of Plx1NA and Plx1NAWF on CSF release. We reasoned that because Plx1NAWF has no polo box-dependent localization/binding capability, it should not compete with endogenous Plx1 for its substrates and therefore should have a minimal effect on CSF release. CSF-arrested Xenopus egg extracts containing either Plx1NA or Plx1NAWF recombinant protein were released by the addition of calcium. Samples taken at the times indicated were immunoblotted for cyclin B1 and B2 levels (Fig. 3A). Because the mobility of Cdc27 is another indicator of APC/C activation and cyclin B degradation (40Vorlaufer E. Peters J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1817-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we also blotted Cdc27 for its mobility change reflective of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Extracts not released by calcium served as a negative control showing stabilized cyclin B levels and unchanged Cdc27 mobility (Fig. 3A, left panel). Consistent with"

Although all three channels are low voltage-activated, they display considerable differences in their kinetics, with Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels activating and inactivating much faster than Cav3.3 channels. The goal of the present study was to determine the structural elements that confer the distinctively slow kinetics of Cav3.3 channels. To address this question, a series of chimeric channels between Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Kinetic analysis showed that the slow activation and inactivation kinetics of the Cav3.3 channel were not completely abolished by substitution with any one portion of the Cav3.1 channel. Likewise, the Cav3.1 channel failed to acquire the slow kinetics by simply adopting one portion of the Cav3.3 channel.

Calcium influx via T-type Ca2+ channels immediately causes depolarization of the plasma membrane and a rise in intracellular calcium. The calcium rise can mediate diverse physiological functions such as hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, smooth muscle contraction, fertilization, and cell differentiation (1Hille B.

The inactivation processes of voltage-dependent ion channels including Na+, K+, and HVA Ca2+ channels play important roles by preventing continual depolarization, hyperpolarization, and overloading of calcium inside cells, respectively. The fast inactivation process of Na+ channels is attributed to blocking of the ion conduction pathway by the IFM (Ile-Phe-Met) motif contained in the intracellular loop between domains III and IV (16West J.W.

The kinetics of T-type channels resemble those of Na+ channels, albeit on a slower time scale, suggesting that they may also inactivate by a ball-and-chain mechanism. However, preliminary evidence indicates that T-type channels inactivate by similar processes as HVA Ca2+ channels. For example, Marksteiner et al. found that both channel families contain important inactivation determinants in the domain III S6 segment (33Marksteiner R. Schurr P. Berjukow S. Margreiter E. Perez-Reyes E. Hering S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 27-34Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, intracellular loops also play a role in T-type channel inactivation, as evidenced by the alternatively spliced variants of the III–IV loop in Cav3.1 and the C terminus in Cav3.3 (34Chemin J.

Chimeric studies using Cav3.1 and Cav1.2 (L-type) channels identified a negatively charged region in the C terminus as critical for fast inactivation of Cav3.1 channels (37Staes M. Talavera K.

The goal of the present study was to identify structural determinants that confer slow kinetics onto Cav3.3 channels using chimeras with Cav3.1. The main finding of these studies is that the more donated by Cav3.3 to the chimeric channels, the more Cav3.3-like the currents became. These findings suggest that there is no single inactivation ball, but as for HVA channels, there are multiple structural elements that contribute to inactivation of low voltage activation channels. The cloning of the rat Cav3.1 (GenBank™ accession number AF027984) and Cav3.3 (GenBank™ accession number AF086827) was reported previously (12Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E.

Chimeric channel cDNAs were constructed from modifications of cDNAs encoding the Cav3.1 (α1G) and Cav3.3 (α1I) channels. The plasmids carrying chimeric cDNAs are composed of the following fragments.

The cDNA constructs were linearized at the 3′ end by NotI or AflII. Transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase according to the supplied protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX). The concentrations of the synthesized cRNAs were measured spectrophotometrically. Several ovary lobes were surgically removed from mature female Xenopus laevis frogs (Xenopus One, Ann Arbor, MI) and torn into small clusters in SOS solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.6). The follicular membranes were removed by digestion in Ca2+-free OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) containing 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma). The oocytes were injected with 3–10 ng of cRNA using a Drummond Nanoject pipette injector (Parkway, PA) attached to a Narishige micromanipulator (Tokyo, Japan) under a stereo-microscope. Barium currents were measured at room temperature 4–8 days after cRNA injection using a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (OC-725C, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Microelectrodes (Warner Instruments) were filled with 3 m KCl, and their resistances were 0.2–1.0 MΩ. The 10 mm Ba2+ bath solution contained 10 mm Ba(OH)2, 90 mm NaOH, 1 mm KOH, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). The currents were sampled at 5 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz using the pClamp system (Digidata 1320A and pClamp 8; Axon instruments, Foster City, CA). Peak currents and exponential fits to currents were analyzed using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments), and a graphical presentation of the data was obtained using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. The data were tested for significance using Student's unpaired t test with p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001 as the levels of significance. Functional expression of Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels was measured using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Their biophysical properties were consistent with previous findings, with Cav3.1 generating quickly inactivating currents and Cav3.3 generating slowly inactivating currents (12Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M. P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.-H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.-H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A.P. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates representative traces of the Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 currents evoked during a test pulse to –20 mV. At this potential, the activation and inactivation rates of Cav3.1 currents were about 10-fold faster than those of the Cav3.3 currents (Fig. 1, B and C). Significant kinetic differences were also observed at other test potentials (Fig. 1, D and E). To determine the structural element(s) in Cav3 channels that lead to these striking kinetic differences, nine chimeras between the Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, all of the chimeras were constructed by substitution of certain regions of the Cav3.3 with the corresponding regions of the Cav3.1 or vice versa. Then we compared the kinetic properties of the nine chimeras with those of the parent channels. Recently, Staes et al. (37Staes M. Talavera K. Klugbauer N. Prenen J. Lacinova L. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 35-45Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have reported that substitution of the Cav3.1 C terminus with the same region of Cav1.2 dramatically slowed down the inactivation kinetic of the chimeric channel currents, suggesting that the C terminus of Cav3.1 channels contains a critical element that mediates fast inactivation. Accordingly, we first compared the kinetics of GIΔC and IGΔC channels constructed by reciprocal exchanges of the C termini of Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 (Fig. 2). Fig. 3A illustrates representative current traces of these C-terminal chimeras recorded during test pulses to –20 mV and then normalized for comparison. On average, activation and inactivation time constants of the GIΔC currents were 2.0 ± 0.3 and 15.4 ± 0.8 ms, whereas those of the Cav3.1 were 1.4 ± 0.1 and 7.2 ± 0.4 ms, respectively. Thus, substitution of the Cav3.1 C terminus with that of Cav3.3 produced a 2-fold slowing of the inactivation rate, with a negligible effect on the activation rate (Fig. 3, B and C). Conversely, substitution of the Cav3.3 C terminus with that of Cav3.1 (IGΔC) slowed activation by 72% and accelerated inactivation by 32% (39.3 ± 5.6 and 66.1 ± 0.9 ms, respectively) when compared with Cav3.3 currents (22.8 ± 1.5 and 97.0 ± 3.8 ms). The difference in current kinetics was greater at hyperpolarized test potentials, whereas the voltage-independent rates observed at depolarized potentials were more similar (Fig. 3, D and E). To assess the contribution of the intracellular loops to current kinetics, three loop chimeras, GIΔ12L, IGΔ12L, and IGΔ23L, were constructed (Fig. 2). Fig. 4A illustrates normalized peak currents of the loop chimeras. Unexpectedly, the activation and inactivation of GIΔ12L currents became faster than those of Cav3.1 (Fig. 4, D and E). Replacement of the I–II loop in Cav3.3 (IGΔ12L) exerted little effect on inactivation kinetics compared with Cav3.3 (Fig. 4C). However, activation of IGΔ12L was much faster than Cav3.3 and IGΔ23L at most voltages tested (Fig. 4D). In the case of IGΔ23L, inactivation kinetics were significantly slower than Cav3.3 and IGΔ12L channels, whereas activation kinetics were slightly faster than Cav3.3 and much slower than IGΔ12L channels (Fig. 4, C and E). Overall, switching of any loop failed to produce a dramatic transition from a slow phenotype to a fast one and vice versa. Thus, it is unlikely that either the I–II or the II–III loop alone is a major structural element determining the activation and inactivation kinetics of T-type channels. Next, we tested whether kinetics are controlled by multiple structural regions including both membrane spanning domain(s) and intracellular loop(s). Chimeric channels containing each half of Cav3.1 and Cav3.3, denoted as IGΔ12D and IGΔ34D (Fig. 2), were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As illustrated in Fig. 5, both chimeras displayed similar inactivation kinetics with time constants that lie halfway between those of the Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 currents. These results suggest that no single half portion determines inactivation kinetics and that each half contributes equally. Notably, IGΔ34D displayed much faster activation kinetics than IGΔ12D at low voltage ranges. This finding suggests that the III–IV domain might play a more critical role than the I–II domain of Cav3.1 in determining activation kinetics. Because the experiments using the half:half chimeric channels failed to localize a specific gating particle that determines activation and inactivation kinetics, we expanded the study to three-quarter:quarter chimeras (IGΔ234D, IGΔ34D, and IGΔ4D). Each chimera derived from Cav3.3 contained different structural regions of the Cav3.1 channel, i.e. domain IV (IGΔ4D), domains III and IV (IGΔ34D), or domains II through IV (IGΔ234D; Fig. 2). As illustrated in Fig. 6, increasing the proportion of Cav3.1 in the chimera steadily shifted the kinetic phenotype toward Cav3.1. These results also show that multiple structural elements are involved in determining the kinetics of Cav3 channels. Normalized current-voltage relationships of the Cav3.1, Cav3.3, and different chimeric channels were compared in Fig. 7A. Although the thresholds for all of the chimeras were around –60 mV, differences were noted in the positions of their peak currents. Maximum current amplitudes were detected at potentials ranging between –28 and –16 mV in the following order: GIΔC ≤ GIΔ12L ≈ IGΔ12L ≈ IGΔ34D ≈ IGΔ234D ≈ IGΔ4D < IGΔ23L ≈ Cav3.1 ≤ Cav3.3 ≤ IGΔ12D ≤ IGΔC. The thresholds and peak currents of most chimeras tend to be slightly shifted toward negative potentials when compared with their parent channels (Cav3.1 and Cav3.3), whereas those of IGΔ12D and IGΔC are shifted toward positive potentials. These results were quantitated by calculating the chord conductance and fitting these data with a Boltzmann equation (Fig. 7B). Similar shifts were observed in the steady-state inactivation curves of these channels (Fig. 7C).

Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E. Pereverzev A.P. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15McRory J.E. Santi C.M. Hamming K.S.

The goal of our study was to determine the structural elements(s) responsible for these differences. To address this question, various G-I chimeric channels were constructed and heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The major finding in this study was that structural elements conferring the slow kinetics of Cav3.3 currents or the fast kinetics of Cav3.1 currents are not restricted but spread over the whole α1 subunit. Reciprocal switching of the C terminus between Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels partially conferred the original inactivation properties of the parent channels to the chimeras (Fig. 3). Previously, Staes et al. (37Staes M. Talavera K. Klugbauer N. Prenen J. Lacinova L. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 35-45Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) proposed that the C terminus contains a negatively charged region that is critical for determining the fast inactivation kinetics of Cav3.1 currents. However, sequence alignment reveals that the negatively charged residues are well conserved in the same positions of Cav3.1 and Cav3.3. Thus, it remained a possibility that the nonconserved portion of the C terminus might determine subtype-specific kinetics. This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that splice variation at exon 33 in the C terminus of Cav3.3 channels alters kinetics (35Chemin J. Monteil A. Dubel S. Nargeot J. Lory P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1678-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Murbartian J. Arias J.M. Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Perez-Reyes E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, there were few kinetic effects found in rat splice variants of exon 34 that delete most of the C terminus (36Murbartian J. Arias J.M. Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Perez-Reyes E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that substitution of the C terminus induced just partial changes in current kinetics led us search for additional structural elements. Our guiding hypothesis was that introduction of different regions from a slow channel into a fast channel might transfer the slow phenotype. Therefore it was quite surprising that the introduction of the I–II loop from Cav3.3 into Cav3.1 produced the opposite result and accelerated current kinetics (Fig. 4). Similarly, introduction of the Cav3.1 I–II loop into Cav3.3 conferred faster activation kinetics (IGΔ12L; Fig. 4). Although these results cannot be explained simply, they do indicate that the I–II loop does not contain the structural region that confers subtype-specific kinetics and suggest other structural portion(s) are also required for establishing channel kinetics. This notion is supported by the fact that substitution of the Cav3.1 II–III loop with the corresponding region of Cav3.3 decreased the activation time constants but had the opposite effect on inactivation time constants (Fig. 4). In the case of HVA Ca2+ channels, auxiliary β subunits (25Pragnell M. Waard M.D. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P.

However, conserved binding sites of β subunits, G-proteins, or syntaxin were not found in the intracellular loops of Cav3 channels. Nevertheless, it is still possible that unidentified auxiliary subunits and diverse signaling molecules including enzymes can regulate T-type channel kinetics. These possible mechanisms might be supported by the following two examples. It is known that the activation and inactivation kinetics of Cav3.3 channels are quite different depending on the heterologous expression systems used (14Lee J.-H. Daud A.N. Cribbs L.L. Lacerda A.E.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we also observed that the current kinetics of Cav3.3 channels expressed in HEK cells could be modulated after activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. 2S.-W. Jeong, B.-G. Park, and J.-H. Lee, unpublished data. In voltage-activated Na+ channels, the IFM motif of the III–IV loop has been found to play a pivotal role as an inactivation ball (16West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, IFM-like sequences are not present in the III–IV loops of Cav3 channels. The III–IV loops of all three Cav3 channels share high sequence similarity, and their lengths are also similar. According to recent reports (2Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 34Chemin J. Monteil A. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Lory P. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1238-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), three Cav3.1 splice variants in the III–IV loop were found, and their expressed currents were not profoundly different in terms of their biophysical properties. Moreover, replacement of the III–IV loop of Cav3.1 with the corresponding portion of a slowly inactivating Cav1.2 had little effect on inactivation kinetics (37Staes M. Talavera K. Klugbauer N. Prenen J. Lacinova L. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 35-45Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the III–IV loops of Cav3 channels do not contain an inactivation ball as described for Na+ channels. Our results show that replacement of any of the cytoplasmic loops could not confer kinetics from the parental to the donor channel. This finding led us to examine domain(s) including membrane-spanning portions as well as loops, using half-half chimeras (IGΔ12D and IGΔ34D) and serial chimeras (IGΔ234D, IGΔ34D, and IGΔ4D). A general pattern obtained from comparing the current kinetics of the two parent and chimeric channels is that the more Cav3.3 donated to the chimeric channels, the more Cav3.3-like its kinetics became. This pattern can be more easily appreciated by plotting the percentage of amino acids from Cav3.3 in the chimeric channels versus the inactivation or activation time constants (Fig. 8). The general pattern strongly supports our main conclusion that structural elements that determine the kinetics of Cav3 channels are not localized but distributed over the whole structure.

However, the detailed mechanism regarding how activated T cells are protected from GC-induced apoptosis is unclear. Previously, we have shown that the expression level of SRG3, a murine homolog of BAF155 in humans, correlated well with the GC sensitivity of T cells either in vitro or in vivo. Intriguingly, the expression of SRG3 decreased upon positive selection in the thymus. Here we have shown that TCR signaling inhibits the SRG3 expression via Ras activation and thereby renders primary thymocytes and some thymoma cells resistant to GC-mediated apoptosis. By using pharmacological inhibitors, we have shown that Ras-mediated down-regulation of the SRG3 gene expression is mediated by MEK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. Moreover, TCR signals repressed the SRG3 transcription through the putative binding sites for E proteins and Ets family transcription factors in the proximal region of the SRG3 promoter. Introduction of mutations in these elements rendered the SRG3 promoter immune to the Ras or TCR signals.

In addition, by observing thymocyte development in mice with altered levels of GCs or GR, it has been shown that in interplay with TCR, GCs affect thymic development (14King L.B. Vacchio M.S.

Reciprocally, proper stimulation through TCR/CD3 antagonized GR activity and might contribute to GC resistance in T cells largely through the Ras activation of MEK/ERK cascade (18Jamieson C.A. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras alone, instead of TCR/CD3 engagement, was sufficient to inhibit GC-mediated apoptosis by activating Raf and Ral.GDS as mediators of the survival signals. Clonal deletion of immature T cells, which are nonfunctional or self-reactive, is crucial for maintenance of the normal immune system. In particular, glucocorticoids (GCs) have been suggested to trigger programmed cell death of T cells and may help to eliminate developing thymocytes that fail to differentiate properly (17Vacchio M.S. Lee J.Y. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1327-1333PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev.

They are either produced by thymic epithelium and possibly thymocytes themselves or are transferred from the adrenal gland in an endocrine manner (9Vacchio M.S. Papadopoulos V. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1835-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Due to their lipophilic properties, GCs can diffuse into the cytoplasm of target cells including thymocytes, bind to and activate their receptor, GR, which upon ligand binding translocates into the nucleus and associates with specific GC-response elements (GREs) to evoke various effects by modulating the expression of specific genes either positively or negatively depending on cell and gene context. GC sensitivity of thymocytes is developmentally regulated during maturation in the thymus. Immature CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes are known to be exquisitely susceptible to GC-induced apoptosis, whereas mature CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells are relatively resistant (4Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gruber J. Sgonc R. Hu Y.H. Beug H. Wick G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the immature thymocytes to be positively selected should be protected from apoptotic actions of GCs. Thus far, many studies have addressed the cross-talk pathway for the inhibition of GC-induced apoptosis by TCR- or Notch-mediated signaling (6Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Deftos M.L. He Y.W. Ojala E.W. Bevan M.J.

Only a small population of DP thymocytes that acquire GC resistance by signaling through TCR/CD3 or NotchI appear to survive GC-triggered cell death and differentiate into mature SP thymocytes. Relatively little is known, however, regarding the specific nuclear target that couples these surface signals with GC resistance and thereby contributes to distinguishing thymocytes fated to die by GCs from those destined to survive. SRG3 (for SWI3-related gene), a murine homolog of yeast SWI3 or human BAF155, was originally isolated as a gene expressed at higher levels in the thymus than in the periphery (24Jeon S.H. Kang M.G.

It is presumed to play crucial roles as a core component of the SWI/SNF complex by remodeling chromatin structure (25Kim J.K. Huh S.O. Choi H. Lee K.S. Shin D. Lee C. Nam J.S. Kim H. Chung H.

Recently, we found that the level of SRG3 expression is critical in determining GC sensitivity of developing thymocytes (24Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The SRG3 protein was required for GC-induced apoptosis of the S49.1 thymoma cells (24Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SRG3 associated with the GR and enhanced GC-induced apoptosis by potentiating its transcriptional activity (28Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice, the SRG3-GR complex was readily detected in GC-sensitive immature thymocytes but barely detectable in GC-resistant mature T lymphocytes. Intriguingly, the sensitivity to GCs in T cells could be modified by altering the expression level of SRG3 in transgenic mice, demonstrating clear correlation between SRG3 protein levels and GC sensitivity. Peripheral T lymphocytes in transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 became more susceptible to GCs than in wild-type mice because of the increase in the SRG3-GR complex (28Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conversely, immature thymocytes in transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 mRNA in an antisense orientation were more GC-resistant than wild-type controls (27Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that TCR/CD3 signaling inhibits GC-induced apoptosis of primary thymocytes and immature DP cells through SRG3 down-modulation. Signals from TCR/CD3 repressed the SRG3 transcription via Ras activation. As a result, the physical interaction between SRG3 and GR was inhibited, resulting in GC desensitization. However, thymocytes in transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 were more sensitive to GC-triggered apoptosis compared with wild-type controls, and TCR signals did not suppress the cell death as potently as in wild-type mice. TCR repression of SRG3 expression was largely mediated through activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK or PI3K pathway, which was previously suggested to be critical for TCR inhibition of GC-induced apoptosis. In addition, we found that TCR signals suppress the SRG3 transcription through the putative binding sites for E proteins and Ets family transcription factors in the SRG3 promoter. Collectively, these observations suggest a model for the role of SRG3 in the cross-talk pathway for inhibition of GC-mediated apoptosis by TCR signals. Mice and Cells—Transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 in FVB background were previously described (28Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The S49.1 murine thymoma cell was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The murine T cell hybridoma, KCIT1-8.5, was obtained from Dr. Y. Choi (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia) and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS supplemented with 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The murine double-positive (DP) thymoma, 16610D9, was provided by Dr. C. Murre (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and cultured in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS supplemented with 50 μm 2-ME. All media were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Reagents and Antibodies—We purchased PD98059 and SB203580 from Calbiochem; wortmannin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), A23187 (ionomycin), and dexamethasone (Dex) from Sigma; anti-actin (sc-1615), anti-GR (M-20), anti-HEB (A-20X), and anti-hamster IgG (H-4772) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD69 (01504D), FITC-conjugated annexin V (556419), anti-Lck (554281), anti-E47 (554077), and anti-E12 (556509) antibodies from Pharmingen; and anti-Ras (R02120) antibody from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-TCRβ, anti-CD3ϵ, and anti-CD4 antibodies were purified from hybridoma supernatants from the H57.597, YCD3, and GK1.5 lines, respectively. Antiserum against SRG3 was raised from rabbits in our laboratory as described previously (28Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions of thymocytes (1–2 × 106) from 4- to 5-week-old mice were suspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 50 μm 2-ME supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin and cultured in medium alone or treated with PMA + ionomycin for 3 h. After further incubation for 12 h in the absence or presence of Dex treatment, the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PI-negative (live) cells were electronically gated and analyzed by flow cytometry (20,000–30,000 events) with the CellQuest™ software using FACStar (BD Biosciences). Whole-cell extracts from the cells unstimulated or stimulated with PMA + ionomycin for 12 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-GR antibodies (M-20x; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (29Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoblotting (28Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For stimulating thymoma cells, 6-well plates were coated with appropriate antibodies at 10 μg/ml at 4 °C overnight followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Five million cells at 106 cells/ml were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. For stimulation of T cell lines by PMA + ionomycin, cells were treated with 7.4 ng/ml PMA and 0.26 μg/ml ionomycin or 0.2 ng/ml PMA and 0.25 μg/ml ionomycin. The cells (106 cells) were then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD69 antibody and propidium iodide (PI). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the surface expression of CD69 was analyzed by flow cytometry. The remaining cells were used for immunoblotting. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cells by resuspension in TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (7.5–10 μg) was resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and then blotted to Hybond™-N (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blots were probed with Id3 and SRG3 probes. The 405-bp Id3 probe was generated by random priming using the EcoRI fragment of Id3/S-003 vector, and the specific probe for SRG3 was generated as described previously (27Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

Yonehara (Kyoto University, Japan). H-RasV12 was from Dr. Han W. Lee (Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Korea). Mutagenesis of the E box sequences (CATCTG into CTGCAG) or Ets-binding site (CCGGAAGA to CCGAGAGA) in the SRG3 promoter, transient transfection, and luciferase assay were performed as described previously (27Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PCR primers for the mutagenesis are as follows: E84 element, 5′-AGGAGGTGGCTGCAGCGCGCGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCGCGCGCTGCAGCCACCTCCT-3′; EBS130 element, 5′-CCGCGCCTCGAGCCGAGAGAGGGTTGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCCAACCCTCTCTCGGCTCGAGGCGCGG-3′. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as described (30Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as follows. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified over a MicroSpin™ G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (2–5 μg) were incubated with an appropriate probe and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. For antibody-mediated supershifts or competition experiments, the extracts were pre-incubated with each antibody for 30 min or DNA competitor for 30 min at room temperature, respectively, before addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. The resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved in a nondenaturating 5% acrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The sequence of each oligonucleotide used for EMSA is as follows: Sp152, 5′-GGTCCAGAAGGGGCGTGGCCGCGCCTCGAG-3′; Sp114, 5′-AGGGTTGGCTGGGCGGGGCTAGGAGGAGGA-3′; EBS130, 5′-CCGCGCCTCGAGCCGGAAGAGGGTTGGCTG-3′; E84, 5′-AGGAGGTGGCATCTGCGCGCGCGG-3′; μE5, 5′-TCGAAGAACACCTGCAGCAGCT-3′; Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; and Oct-1, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′.

Repression of SRG3 Expression upon TCR/CD3 Engagement Independently of TCR-induced Cell Death—We found previously that SRG3 acts as a coactivator for GR to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of this receptor and thereby render thymocytes sensitive to GC-mediated apoptosis (24Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H.

The relative sensitivity of developing thymocytes to the GCs was modulated depending on the expression level of SRG3 proteins. Intriguingly, the level of SRG3 mRNA in the positively selected thymocytes (CD3highCD69+) in the thymus was about three times lower than in the pre-selected thymocytes (CD3lowCD69–) (27Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because selection events in the thymus are active processes that involve various signals emanating from TCR/CD3 complex and other accessory molecules, and TCR/CD3 signaling has been shown to antagonize GC-induced apoptosis of T cells (19Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), it is possible that TCR-mediated signals render thymocytes resistant to GCs by modulating the SRG3 expression level. To assess whether SRG3 expression is directly modulated by antibody-mediated TCR/CD3 engagement, the murine DP thymoma cell line, 16610D9, was cultured in plates coated with anti-CD3ϵ or anti-TCRβ antibody, alone or in combination with anti-CD4 antibody. The 16610D9 cell line is derived from a spontaneous thymoma in a p53-deficient mouse and exhibits characteristics typical of primary DP thymocytes (HSAhighTCRmedCD5lowCD44lowCD69low) (31Bain G. Quong M.W. Soloff R.S. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The expression of CD69, an early T cell activation marker (32Swat W. Dessing M. von Boehmer H. Kisielow P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), was specifically induced by antibody-mediated TCR/CD3 engagement, whereas it remained unchanged when treated with anti-hamster IgG control antibody (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, the level of SRG3 proteins in the whole-cell extracts from control and TCR-stimulated cells was examined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression level of SRG3 protein decreased maximally by 55.3% upon T cell activation, whereas that of GR did not. The degree of SRG3 down-regulation correlated well with that of CD69 induction, suggesting that SRG3 repression may depend on the intensity of TCR/CD3 signals. When another thymoma cell line, S49.1, was activated with anti-CD3ϵ, the expression of SRG3 also decreased maximally by 64% (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that the expression of SRG3 in immature thymoma cells is down-regulated in response to signals through TCR/CD3 ligation. In addition to antibody-mediated TCR/CD3 cross-linking, cotreatment of a defined combination of PMA, a protein kinase C activator and ionomycin, a calcium ionophore also resulted in a decrease in SRG3 protein expression (Fig. 1D). Intracellular signaling triggered by the combinations of these drugs was shown to mimic the anti-apoptotic effect of proper cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 complex and induce thymocyte survival and differentiation (6Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Wilkinson B. Chen J.Y. Han P. Rufner K.M. Goularte O.D. Kaye J. Nat.

Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because combination of PMA + ionomycin may bypass the early consequences of TCR cross-linking, including membrane proximal signals in thymocytes, these results suggest that TCR-proximal signals are not required for TCR-mediated repression of SRG3 gene expression. The viability of the activated cells was not significantly affected by antibody-mediated TCR/CD3 cross-linking, although cotreatment of PMA + ionomycin led to a slight increase in cell death (data not shown). However, to exclude the possibility that the TCR/CD3-mediated SRG3 down-regulation resulted from nonspecific protein degradation in cells undergoing TCR-induced cell death, a T cell hybridoma, KCIT1-8.5, was used. The KCIT1-8.5 cell line is resistant to TCR-induced apoptosis due to the defect in the T cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51), which couples TCR stimulation with CD95 (Fas) expression but is still competent to be activated by TCR triggering (39Park C.G. Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Choi Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 40Wong B. Park C.G. Choi Y. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stimulation of KCIT1-8.5 with anti-CD3ϵ or anti-TCRβ antibody alone was sufficient for CD69 induction with no significant effect on the cell viability (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1E, activation of KCIT1-8.5 also resulted in a dramatic reduction in SRG3 proteins by 82%. These results indicate that SRG3 expression is reduced upon T cell activation independently of TCR-induced cell death. TCR-mediated Repression of SRG3 Transcription via Ras Activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K Pathways—To determine whether TCR signals modulate the SRG3 expression at the transcriptional level, 16610D9 DP cells were stimulated with PMA + ionomycin for varying amounts of time, and the mRNA levels of SRG3 and Id3 were quantified by Northern blot analysis. As reported previously (41Bain G. Cravatt C.B. Loomans C. Alberola-Ila J. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 165-171Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar), activation of these T cells rapidly induced Id3 transcripts (Fig. 2A). Id3 induction became much stronger as the period of stimulation lasted longer than 6 h. However, the level of SRG3 transcripts began to be down-regulated, albeit slowly, in the early phase but led to a dramatic decrease 6 h after T cell activation (Fig. 2A). The suppression of SRG3 transcription upon T cell stimulation by either antibody-mediated TCR/CD3 cross-linking or cotreatment of PMA + ionomycin was well reflected by a change in the SRG3 protein expression (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Because protein expression of the SRG3 gene seemed to depend on the strength of TCR signals (Fig. 1, A and C), we further investigated how SRG3 transcription is regulated when much weaker activation signals are transduced. At lower concentrations of PMA + ionomycin, Id3 transcripts were not significantly induced until 18 h (Fig. 2B). Concomitantly, SRG3 transcripts were not reduced until 18 h. Collectively, these results indicate that SRG3 transcription is repressed upon T cell activation. Engagement of TCR/CD3 complex was shown to activate intricate intracellular signaling networks, including Ras/MAPK pathway (42Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A.

To investigate how decorin is induced, human EA.hy 926 ECs and/or human umbilical vein ECs were treated with interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6. Both treatments induced decorin mRNA in human ECs. IL-6 and IL-10 led to a dose-dependent mRNA increase with a maximum at 10 and 50 ng/ml, respectively. The combination of both interleukins together had a stronger effect than one alone. Immunostaining demonstrated that both interleukins caused decorin synthesis in ECs and the formation of capillary-like structures in a collagen lattice. However, immunoprecipitations of interleukin-treated ECs cultured on plastic were negative. Only interleukin-stimulated ECs grown on a collagen type I matrix or growth factor-reduced Matrigel were able to synthesize the proteoglycan. Acid-soluble collagen type I did not support decorin protein synthesis. The addition of antibodies to α1 or α2 integrins or the α2 integrin inhibitor rhodocetin led to an inhibition of synthesis. These data show that IL-10 and IL-6 induce decorin mRNA transcription, but additional signals from the extracellular matrix are necessary for its translation.

The functional state of endothelial cells (quiescent or angiogenic) goes along with the expression of specific small leucinerich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs). 1The abbreviations used are: SLRP, small leucine-rich proteoglycan; TGF, transforming growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IL, interleukin; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. Resting endothelial cells in large blood vessels as well as confluent primary endothelial cells in vitro do not synthesize decorin, but they express biglycan, which becomes up-regulated when endothelial cells start to migrate (1Kinsella M.G.

Similar observations were made in EA.hy 926 cells, a cell line derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W.

However, when endothelial cells form capillaries, they express decorin (1Kinsella M.G. Tsoi C.K. Järveläinen H.T. Wight T.N. J. Biol.

This could be observed in vivo in human capillary endothelium during inflammation-induced angiogenesis, as well as in vitro in a co-culture model with EA.hy 926 cells and rat fibroblasts grown in a floating collagen lattice to mimic the situation during angiogenesis in vivo (2Schönherr E.

Decorin is the most well known member of the SLRP family. These small proteoglycans are characterized by core proteins containing several leucine-rich repeat motifs flanked by cysteine-rich clusters. As proteoglycans they are linked to at least a single glycosaminoglycan chain. Decorin is almost ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in the control of collagen fibril formation and the regulation of TGF-β activity (for review, see Refs. 3Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar and 4Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. Glycoconj. J. 2003; 19: 249-255Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown to influence directly the behavior of several different types of cells. For example, it can interact with members of the ErbB receptor family on tumor cells and lead to a more differentiated phenotype of these cells (5Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells decorin induction initiates the alignment of cells in cord-like structures on top of a collagen matrix or leads to the formation of endothelial cell-lined cavities inside the collagen matrix (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These morphological changes are accompanied by an induction and activation of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14) (7Schönherr E. Schaefer L. O'Connell B.C. Kresse H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, it could be shown that endothelial cells that synthesize decorin escape apoptosis (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All these changes were only observed in decorin-synthesizing cells, independent of the mode of decorin induction. Thus decorin production could be induced either by co-culture with fibroblasts or by infection of the cells with a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the human decorin cDNA, indicating that decorin is instrumental in the formation of capillary-like structures in collagen lattices. The physiological regulation of decorin synthesis in different cell types is still a matter of discussion, as the same cytokine can have opposite effects on decorin synthesis; TGF-β has been shown to up-regulate decorin in mesangial cells but to down-regulate the proteoglycan in most other cell types (8Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 689-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 9Breuer B. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Besides TGF-β, several other cytokines have been implicated in the regulation of decorin synthesis on a transcriptional as well as on a translational or posttranslational level (IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, TGF-α, epidermal growth factor, etc.; Ref. 4Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. Glycoconj. J. 2003; 19: 249-255Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, no cytokine that has been associated with angiogenesis (VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, TNF-α, IL-1, and TGF-β) could be identified as an inducer of decorin synthesis in endothelial cells (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As decorin induction in endothelial cells in vivo is observed during inflammation (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Nelimarkka L. Salminen H. Kuopio T. Nikkari S. Ekfors T. Laine J. Pelliniemi L. Järveläinen H. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) cytokines released during this process are potential candidates for its induction. One of these cytokines is IL-6. It can react with a variety of cells by a trimeric receptor complex that consists of a membrane-bound signaling receptor (gp130), which is expressed ubiquitously, and a species-specific IL-6 receptor, which can be expressed by a limited number of cells and which has no signaling function by itself. However, the IL-6 receptor can be shed or synthesized without transmembrane domain and thereby react as soluble protein (sIL-6R) with the cytokine. This cytokine-receptor complex (sIL-6R·IL-6) can bind to gp130 and transfer sensitivity for the cytokine to cells that normally do not express the IL-6 receptor (11Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Another inflammatory cytokine, which has been shown to induce decorin mRNA expression in fibroblasts, is IL-10 (12Yamamoto T. Eckes B. Krieg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). IL-10 is a multifunctional cytokine that was first recognized for its inhibition of inflammatory processes. Later, multiple cell-dependent effects on differentiation and proliferation have been described (for review, see Ref. 13Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5364) Google Scholar). In macrophages IL-10 activates the JAK/STAT pathway and leads to inhibition of cell activation, and in endothelial cells it causes a down-regulation of cell adhesion molecules (13Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5364) Google Scholar). But in general the effects of IL-10 on cells of non-immunological origin have not been investigated in detail. In this study we analyzed the role of IL-6 and IL-10 in decorin expression in endothelial cells. For the first time we could show that cytokine stimulation is only sufficient for inducing mRNA expression but that integrin-mediated adhesion to fibrillar collagens is necessary to induce translation at least in endothelial cells. Materials—Human IL-10 and IL-6 were from TEBU (Frankfurt, Germany). Chondroitin ABC lyase was from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Secondary antibodies were from BioRad. Monoclonal antibodies to α1 integrin (AGF1 (14Szulgit G. Rudolph R. Wandel A. Tenenhaus M. Panos R. Gardner H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 409-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. H. Gardner, Biogene Idec, Cambridge, MA) and α2 integrin (P1E6, Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany) and a control isotypic monoclonal mouse antibody (IgG1, X0931, Dako, Hamburg, Germany) were used. Rhodocetin was purified as described previously (15Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—EA.hy 926 cells were maintained in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, hypoxanthine (100 μm), aminopterin (0.4 μm), thymidine (16 μm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml, all from Invitrogen). For experiments cells were cultured in serum-free Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium supplemented with selenite, transferrin, and insulin (all from Sigma), Ciprobay (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), Zinacef (GlaxoSmithKline), and penicillin/streptomycin overnight before adding different concentrations and combinations of interleukins and/or conditioned medium (see below). Cells were harvested at the indicated times. Cell culture in floating collagen lattices was done as described previously (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with the exception that acid-soluble rat tail tendon collagen was used. The purity of the collagen preparation was proven by SDS-PAGE. Collagen type I was the major protein in the preparation, but the presence of collagen type III could not be ruled out (result not shown). This collagen was also used to coat cell culture dishes. Briefly, acid-soluble collagen was neutralized and spread on hydrophilic dishes. After gel formation (30 min, 37 °C) cells were plated as usual. Semiquantitative Real Time PCR—RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Quality of isolated RNA was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reverse transcription was performed with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system and SYBR Green PCR core reagents (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) according to the specifications of the manufacturer with the indicated primers: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; sense, GTCAGTGGTGGACTGACCT-3′, and antisense, ACCTGGTGCTCAGTGTAGCC (amplification product 123 bp); and decorin; sense, AGCTGAAGGAATTGCCAGAA, and antisense, TGGTGCCCAGTTCTATGACA (amplification product 132 bp). Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Specificity of PCR products was verified by dissociation curve analysis. Specific mRNA expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and augmentations were calculated under stimulated versus non-stimulated conditions (ΔΔCt method). Immunoprecipitation—EA.hy 926 (3 × 106 cells) or human skin fibroblasts (as positive control) were seeded in a 75-cm2 flask. EA.hy 926 cells were cultured on plastic or on collagen as described and subsequently preincubated with IL-10 and IL-6 for 8 h. Interleukins were renewed, and cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]leucine (20 μCi/ml of medium, ICN Biomedical, Eschwege, Germany) for 16 h. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously with a monospecific rabbit anti-human decorin antiserum (16Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When indicated, samples were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Signals were detected on X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). For inhibition experiments EA.hy 926 cells (2.5 × 106) were preincubated with the respective antibodies (5 ng/ml) and seeded on collagen type I matrices in Waymouth medium (see above) with 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 24 h the medium was changed to serum-free medium with the respective antibodies plus IL-6 and IL-10 for 8 h. Then the cells were metabolically labeled in the presence of the same additives for 16 h, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described. In inhibition studies with rhodocetin the integrin inhibitor was added in the indicated concentrations together with the interleukins, and the rest of the experiment was carried out as described. For the analysis of different matrices tissue culture plastic was coated with fibrillar collagen, acid-soluble collagen, and collagen type VI (1 mg/ml, prepared according to Trueb and co-workers (17Trueb B. Schreier T. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). In addition, cell culture dishes were coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), which was additionally extracted over night with serum-free medium, before EA.hy 926 cells were plated. The cells were stimulated, metabolically labeled, and harvested as described above. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining of collagen gels was performed as described previously (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), except that in addition to chondroitin ABC lyase (2 h, 37 °C) in 5% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, proteinase XXIV (0.005%, 10 min, 37 °C, Sigma) was used to unmask epitopes. Induction of Decorin mRNA in Endothelial Cells by IL-10 and IL-6—In previous experiments we excluded a large number of growth factors and cytokines associated with angiogenesis as inducers of decorin synthesis in endothelial cells (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study IL-6 and IL-10 were tested because both are released during inflammation in vivo. In addition, IL-10 has been shown previously to induce decorin mRNA synthesis in fibroblasts (12Yamamoto T. Eckes B. Krieg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that IL-10 can dose dependently increase decorin mRNA production in endothelial cells in a concentration range between 12.5 and 50 ng/ml. The expression of decorin mRNA doubled after 8-12 h and reached a maximum at 16 h (n = 3, result not shown). Therefore, mRNA was harvested after 16 h in the following experiments. In several experiments (at least n = 3) IL-10 (50 ng/ml) led to a 5-fold increase in amplification, while higher doses had no further effect or reduced specific mRNA synthesis (Fig. 1A). IL-6 also caused a 5-fold increase in decorin mRNA levels, but the highest decorin expression was achieved with 10 ng/ml. Higher concentrations of IL-6 reduced decorin mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Using both cytokines at optimal concentrations a stronger effect on decorin mRNA expression was observed (Fig. 2). These results indicate that IL-10 and IL-6 may influence decorin mRNA synthesis by at least partially different pathways. The addition of cytokines to endothelial cells cultured on a fibrillar collagen matrix led to a reduced increase in the expression rate (13-29%) compared with uncoated dishes (Fig. 2). This reduction is very likely due to increased unspecific binding of cytokines to the collagen coat compared with the plastic surface.Fig. 2Influence of combined IL-10/IL-6 application on the expression of decorin mRNA in EA.hy 926 cells. Samples were processed as described in Fig. 1. The stimulation of decorin (DCN) mRNA synthesis could be enhanced further by combined IL application compared with single application of IL-10 (50 ng/ml) and IL-6 (10 ng/ml), respectively. Black bars, plastic dishes; gray bars, collagen-coated dishes. Collagen coating of cell culture plastic reduced the effect of the cytokines on decorin stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Decorin Protein Synthesis—Immunohistochemical studies showed that EA.hy 926 cells in collagen gels start to synthesize decorin protein after stimulation with IL-10 and IL-6 (Fig. 3). After 6 days of culture cells treated with IL-10 (Fig. 3A) or the combination of IL-10 and IL-6 (result not shown) showed tubular structures surrounded by decorin, while untreated cells neither showed any staining for decorin nor any formation of capillary-like structures (Fig. 3B). A comparable effect due to IL-6 stimulation was temporally delayed (Fig. 3C). Thus decorin core protein was detectable at day 12 of the incubation (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the two cytokines can induce decorin synthesis in this angiogenesis model in cell culture. In the next series of experiments we attempted to immunoprecipitate decorin from the medium and the cell layer of endothelial cells growing on plastic dishes as used in routine cell culture. Even when these cells were actively synthesizing decorin mRNA as shown in Fig. 1 no decorin could be found by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we tested various conditions (different time points, concentrations, and types of labeled metabolites; different concentrations and combinations of interleukins; and fibroblast conditioned medium), but translation of decorin mRNA into core protein and posttranslational modification to proteoglycan were not observed. Only when EA.hy 926 cells were seeded on a collagen type I matrix similar to the matrix in the angiogenesis model synthesis of decorin could be detected (Fig. 4A). An increased effect of the combination of IL-10 and IL-6 was also observed on the level of protein synthesis (Fig. 4A). To test whether protein synthesis like mRNA synthesis is dependent on the amount of interleukin in the medium, dosages from 25 to 100 ng/ml IL-10 and from 5 to 20 ng/ml IL-6 were added to endothelial cells growing on a collagen matrix. Immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled decorin showed that there is no dose dependence on the amount of interleukin added. Under conditions when cells are cultured on fibrillar collagen and a 5- to 6-fold increase in the mRNA level is observed, translation is induced. Higher concentrations of interleukins, which do not lead to a further mRNA increase on plastic (see Fig. 1), still induce the same increase in decorin translation on collagen-coated dishes. These results demonstrate that the collagen matrix has two effects on decorin induction: a positive effect on translation of decorin (Fig. 4B) and a negative effect on mRNA transcription because of sequestration of the interleukins (Fig. 2). In addition, these results prove that the interaction of endothelial cells with their surrounding matrix is of crucial importance for decorin protein synthesis in endothelial cells. To investigate whether this behavior is specific for EA.hy 926 cells, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with IL-6 and IL-10 under similar conditions. Immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled decorin showed that also primary cells are dependent on the collagen matrix for decorin protein synthesis (Fig. 5). Matrix Requirements for Decorin Synthesis—To further investigate the requirements for the stimulation of protein synthesis different types of coatings were compared. Neutralized collagen type I from rat tail tendon or from calf skin (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which forms a fibrillar matrix, supported decorin synthesis. However, a coat of the same collagen in its acid-soluble form had no effect (Fig. 6A). Also a coat of monomeric collagen type VI did not have any effect. However, growth factor-reduced Matrigel, which by itself had no effect on decorin synthesis, could support interleukin-stimulated decorin translation (Fig. 6A). These data show that the interaction with a fibrillar matrix of collagen type I or a network-forming matrix of collagen type IV, laminin, and entactin is necessary for the induction of decorin protein synthesis. To analyze the cellular interactions, antibodies to α1 and α2 integrins were applied to endothelial cells plated on a fibrillar collagen type I matrix. In previous experiments (using 50 μg/ml-0.5 ng/ml) a concentration of antibody was determined that does not lead to cell detachment and apoptosis within 24 h (result not shown). Addition of 5 ng/ml antibodies directed against α1 or α2 integrin subunits at the time of cell seeding and during incubation with the cytokines led both to a reduction in decorin synthesis (Fig. 6B) compared with culture conditions without antibodies or isotypic control antibodies. Antibodies to α1 integrin inhibited decorin synthesis by 70%, while antibodies to α2 integrin led to 85% inhibition compared with the control. These results were corroborated by incubation with the integrin inhibitor rhodocetin, which abolished decorin synthesis completely at a concentration that was shown previously to inhibit cell adhesion by about 50% (15Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rhodocetin blocks collagen binding of α2β1 integrin in a arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-independent manner and presumably antagonizes α2β1 integrin signaling by binding to the A-domain of the α2 subunit proximal to the collagen binding site (18Eble J.A. Tuckwell D.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data indicated that α2β1 integrin as well α1β1 integrin is involved in the induction of decorin translation in endothelial cells. This study shows that IL-6 and IL-10, two cytokines that are released during inflammation and wound healing, can induce decorin synthesis in endothelial cells. Decorin synthesis has been observed previously in endothelial cells in different cell culture models of angiogenesis (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Järveläinen H.T. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Sage E.H. Wight T.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and also in vivo (2Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Nelimarkka L. Salminen H. Kuopio T. Nikkari S. Ekfors T. Laine J. Pelliniemi L. Järveläinen H. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two independent in vivo investigations showed that the inflammatory component is of special importance, as decorin was only found in newly formed capillaries in granulomatous tissue or in neovessels in temporal arteritis but not in capillaries of the ovary in different phases of follicle and corpus luteum formation. Both IL-6 and IL-10 are released during inflammation and wound healing. The importance of IL-6 has been emphasized recently by wound healing studies in the IL-6-null mouse. Without challenge the mouse does not show any obvious phenotype, but during wound healing leukocyte infiltration and re-epithelialization as well as angiogenesis and collagen accumulation are reduced (20Lin Z.Q. Kondo T. Ishida Y. Takayasu T. Mukaida N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-10 has been associated with antiangiogenic processes. Thus an increase in angiogenesis was observed in the IL-10-null mouse in the hindlimb ischemia model. This increase in angiogenesis was associated with a prolonged up-regulation of VEGF and increased matrix metalloproteinase activity (21Silvestre J.S. Mallat Z. Duriez M. Tamarat R. Bureau M.F. Scherman D. Duverger N. Branellec D. Tedgui A. Levy B.I. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, these findings in the constitutive IL-10-null mice cannot rule out that a regulated induction of IL-10 expression during inflammation-induced angiogenesis may be necessary to down-regulate VEGF expression and to induce decorin synthesis in endothelial cells. Furthermore the constitutive lack of IL-10 may induce other mechanisms that are not involved in angiogenesis under normal circumstances. The influence of IL-6 and IL-10 on the metabolism of proteoglycans has not yet been analyzed in detail. In synovial cells IL-6 increased the synthesis of versican, a large hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan, but changes in other proteoglycans were not observed (22Eklund E. Broberg K. Westergren-Thorsson G. Bjardahlen A. Hedlund M. Malmstrom A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In chondrocytes the total proteoglycan content was reduced by IL-6 (23Jikko A. Wakisaka T. Iwamoto M. Hiranuma H. Kato Y. Maeda T. Fujishita M. Fuchihata H. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the IL-6-null mouse showed a stronger reduction in proteoglycan content in an arthritis model than the wild type mouse (24van de Loo F.A. Kuiper S. van Enckevort F.H. Arntz O.J. van den Berg W.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that IL-6 has not only inhibitory effects on proteoglycan synthesis. Even less is known about the effect of IL-10. Yamamoto and co-workers (12Yamamoto T. Eckes B. Krieg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) found a stimulation of decorin expression in fibroblasts, and van Roon and co-workers (25van Roon J.A. van Roy J.L. Gmelig-Meyling F.H. Lafeber F.P. Bijlsma J.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) described a direct stimulation of cartilage proteoglycans. In this study we show for the first time that IL-6 and IL-10 both induce decorin in vascular endothelial cells. The concentrations that are necessary to induce decorin synthesis are similar to the ones used in previous studies (12Yamamoto T. Eckes B. Krieg T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Eklund E. Broberg K. Westergren-Thorsson G. Bjardahlen A. Hedlund M. Malmstrom A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These concentrations exceed the concentration found in human plasma. However, plasma concentrations may not reflect the actual concentration of cytokine molecules, which are present close to the endothelial cell surface during inflammation, because both IL-6 and IL-10 can be bound and concentrated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the vicinity of or on the surface of endothelial cells (26Mummery R.S. Rider C.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5671-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Salek-Ardakani S. Arrand J.R. Shaw D. Mackett M. Blood. 2000; 96: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The less than additive effect of the combined addition of IL-6 and IL-10 on decorin expression may be due to the fact that both interleukins are using intracellularly the JAK/STAT pathway (13Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5364) Google Scholar, 28Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar), and both can activate STAT3 and STAT1, which may be limiting for a further increase of decorin transcription. This possibility needs to be investigated. The importance of the surrounding matrix for the induction of decorin can be clearly seen by the fact that decorin protein synthesis could only be observed in the presence of a collagen type I matrix and was not observed with acid-soluble collagen type I or collagen type VI. In addition, experiments by Järveläinen and co-workers (19Järveläinen H.T. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Sage E.H. Wight T.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that in spontaneously sprouting bovine aortic endothelial cells collagen type I and decorin synthesis are simultaneously induced during endothelial tube formation. Furthermore we showed by using inhibitory antibodies as well as the integrin inhibitor rhodocetin that integrin signaling in endothelial cells is necessary for decorin protein synthesis. Rhodocetin is a specific snake venom inhibitor specifically directed against the α2β1 integrin. Its effects against tumor invasion and other α2β1 integrin-related functions in fibrosarcoma cells have been shown recently (29Eble J.A. Niland S. Dennes A. Schmidt-Hederich A. Bruckner P. Brunner G. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we show that it is also functional on endothelial cells. As Matrigel contains ligands for the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins as well, it also could induce decorin translation. Our data emphasizes the role of collagen-binding integrins α1β1 and α2β1 in angiogenesis that has been revisited recently (30Hynes R.O. Nat.

Our results show that these integrins may regulate neovascularization in yet another way. After the primary induction of angiogenesis by e.g. VEGF endothelial cells may be induced to migrate and degrade the extracellular matrix (MMP-1 and MMP-14 expression). However, when this primary stimulus is reduced the endothelial cells would encounter intact fibrillar collagen. If the contact with fibrillar collagen occurs simultaneously with a cytokine stimulus (IL-6 and IL-10) decorin synthesis would be induced. The newly synthesized decorin again could control collagen fibrillogenesis as well as MMP-1 and MMP-14 synthesis (7Schönherr E. Schaefer L. O'Connell B.C. Kresse H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which could lead to further migration into the direction of the stimulus but also to a feedback inhibition of decorin synthesis. These data directly show the complex interactions between matrix/cytokine/matrix-modifying enzymes. They further demonstrate that in a complex process like angiogenesis determination of mRNA expression alone is not enough to predict the synthesis and availability of a functional protein.

Previous studies have shown that T cell receptor (TCR) signals rapidly induce Id3, a dominant negative antagonist of E2A activity and allow thymocytes to survive selection events in the thymus. Here we show that SRG3 acts as a novel downstream target of E2A/HeLa E box-binding (HEB) complex and modulates glucocorticoid (GC) susceptibility in thymocytes in response to TCR signals. We have identified a putative E box element in the SRG3 promoter that is required for optimal promoter activity. The transcription factors E2A and HEB specifically associate with the E box element. Moreover, E2A-HEB heterodimers cooperated to activate SRG3 transcription, which was inhibited by the expression of Id proteins. TCR-mediated signals rapidly induced Id3 via MEK/ERK activation and thereby kept the E2A/HEB complex from binding to the E box element in the SRG3 promoter. Retroviral transduction of Id3 also repressed the SRG3 expression by inhibiting the E box binding activity of the E2A/HEB complex. Intriguingly, enforced Id3 expression conferred thymocyte resistance to GCs, which could be overcome by the overexpression of SRG3. Taken together, these results suggest that Id3 may enhance the viability of immature thymocytes by at least rendering them resistant to GCs through SRG3 down-regulation.

The mammalian E proteins consist of E2A, E2-2, and HeLa E box-binding (HEB) proteins (15Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R.

Although HEB and E2-2 are encoded by distinct genes, E2A gene encodes two E proteins, E12 and E47, through alternative RNA splicing (13Henthorn P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T.

Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). E proteins share a highly conserved domain called helix-loop-helix (HLH), which allows for dimerization between HLH family members (19Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

The conserved basic domain immediately NH2-terminal to HLH domain facilitates the binding of HLH dimers to the canonical E box element. All of the E proteins have the potential to interact with DNA in a dimeric configuration either as an E protein homodimer/heterodimer or, more commonly, as a heterodimer containing an E protein family member together with one of several cell type-specific bHLH proteins. Upon DNA binding, E proteins regulate the transcription of target genes through NH2-terminal transactivation domains (20Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell.

In thymocytes, the E2A/HEB heterodimer is known as a major basic HLH (bHLH), whereas E2A homodimer is predominant in B-lineage cells (23Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5620-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Shen C.P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4518-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). By analyzing various knockout mice deficient in E protein member(s), it is well characterized that E2A and HEB activity is required at multiple stages of thymocyte maturation. Mice deficient in E2A or E47 exhibited hypocellularity in the thymus and a partial block at the CD44+CD25– (double-negative 1, DN1) stage (8Bain G. Engel I. Robanus Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P.

Med. 1999; 190: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of HEB also led to thymic hypocellularity and a strong developmental block at the immature single-positive stage (10Barndt R. Dai M.F. Zhuang Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3331-3343PubMed Google Scholar). Mice expressing HEBbm, a dominant negative HEB that inhibits both E2A and HEB activity, displayed a developmental arrest at the CD44–CD25+ (DN3) stage (11Barndt R.J. Dai M. Zhuang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6677-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, for the proper progression at some checkpoints, E2A activity is negatively regulated by signals emanating from antigen receptors. For example, E2A deficiency allowed the developmental progression and proliferation of DN thymocytes that have failed β-selection (7Engel I. Johns C. Bain G. Rivera R.R. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). E2A or E47 deficiency also promoted the positive selection of CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes expressing the relevant αβTCR (8Bain G. Engel I. Robanus Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P. Voland J.R.

In addition, E2A protein played positive regulatory roles in apoptosis and growth arrest, suggesting that inactivation of E2A may allow survival of thymocytes that would have otherwise died during thymic selection processes (25Engel I.

Romanow W.J. Murre C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Id proteins act as functional antagonists of E protein activity in a dominant negative manner since they do not bind to DNA because of the lack of a basic DNA-binding domain while efficiently forming highly stable heterodimers with selected E proteins through the HLH domain (15Murre C.

Johns C.P. Quan J. Johnson R.S. Murre C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have demonstrated that Id3 is essential for proper thymocyte maturation in both class I- and class II-restricted TCR transgenic mice (42Rivera R.R. Johns C.P. Quan J. Johnson R.S. Murre C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, inactivation of both E47 and Id3 restored normal thymocyte maturation, which clearly indicates genetic interaction between them in the thymus (42Rivera R.R. Johns C.P. Quan J. Johnson R.S. Murre C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Upon pre-TCR-mediated signaling in DN thymocytes, Id3 proteins were rapidly induced and thereby down-regulated E protein DNA binding to promote β-selection (7Engel I. Johns C. Bain G. Rivera R.R. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that Id3 expression by TCR activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway also promotes the maturation of immature DP cells by inhibiting the E box binding activity of E2A (9Bain G. Quong M.W. Soloff R.S. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43Bain G. Cravatt C.B. Loomans C. Alberola-Ila J. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 165-171Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results imply that only the DP thymocytes that repress E2A activity by Id3 upon TCR/CD3 engagement may survive thymic selection and are able to differentiate into SP thymocytes. However, the specific nuclear target that is regulated by this interaction between E2A and Id3 protein at this transition has yet to be identified.Here we showed that SRG3 acts as a novel nuclear target whose expression is regulated by the E2A-Id3 interaction. E2A/HEB specifically bound to the E box element in the SRG3 promoter and activated its activity. Upon TCR-triggered signals, Id3 was rapidly induced and prevented the E2A/HEB activator complex from binding to the E box element in the SRG3 promoter, resulting in SRG3 down-regulation. Additionally, ectopic overexpression of Id3 by the retroviral transduction system decreased SRG3 expression by inhibiting E2A/HEB binding. It also rendered primary thymocytes and immature thymoma cells resistant to GC-triggered apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of SRG3. Taken together, these observations suggest that Id proteins may enhance the viability of DP thymocytes by rendering GC resistance by down-regulating SRG3 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice, Cells, Reagents, and Antibodies—Transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 in the FVB background were described previously (44Han S.

The PCR primers for the mutagenesis of E84 element are as follows: 5′-AGGAGGTGGCTGCAGCGCGCGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCGCGCGCTGCAGCCACCTCCT-3′.Retroviral Transduction—The retroviral vector LZRSpBMN-linker IRES-EGFP (NotI–) (S-003) and Id3/S-003 was from Dr. C. Murre (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The ϕNX-eco packaging cell line was transfected with S-003 or Id3/S-003 vector by calcium phosphate precipitation and incubated in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin for 4 weeks. Retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected following incubation of the selected retroviral producer cells for 24 h and stored at –80 °C after filtering. For transduction, the retroviral supernatant (1 ml) was supplemented with Polybrene (8 μg/ml), incubated on ice for at least 10 min, and transferred to the standard 6-well tissue culture plates containing target cells (1 × 106 cells in 1 ml of fresh medium), followed by centrifugation at 2,800 rpm for 90 min at 32 °C. After centrifugation, growth medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were harvested and analyzed 36–48 h after infection. For the transduction of primary thymocytes, cells were pre-treated with 3 μg/ml concanavalin A (Vector Laboratories) for 2 days and spininfected as described.Cell Death Measurement—Single cell suspensions of thymocytes derived from 4- to 5-week-old wild-type or hCD2-SRG3+ Tg FVB mice were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. A portion of apoptotic cells was assessed by annexin V staining. At the end of each treatment, cells were harvested and resuspended in biotin-conjugated annexin V, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, washed, resuspended in quantum red-conjugated streptavidin, and analyzed by flow cytometry (20,000–30,000 events) with the CellQuest™ software using FACStar (BD Biosciences).RESULTSOverexpression of Id3 Proteins Represses the SRG3 Gene Expression—In thymocytes, E2A protein mostly binds to the E box element with the consensus CANNTG sequence as a complex with the HeLa E box-binding (HEB) protein, another bHLH family transcription factor highly expressed in developing T cells (23Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5620-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We found that the putative E box element (designated E84) CATCTG exists at the –84 region in the SRG3 promoter and that it plays crucial roles in TCR signaling-mediated repression of the SRG3 gene expression to render thymocytes resistant to GC-mediated apoptosis (55Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21903-21915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the E2A/HEB protein complex is specifically associated with the putative E box element in the SRG3 promoter. It was suggested that expression of the E-protein inhibitor Id3 interferes with E-protein DNA binding activity because of the lack of the basic DNA-binding domain (29Quong M.W. Romanow W.J. Murre C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that Id3 proteins negatively regulate SRG3 gene expression by antagonizing the binding of E2A/HEB to the E84 element in the SRG3 promoter. To examine the regulatory role of Id3 in modulating SRG3 expression, Id3 was retrovirally transduced into 16610D9 cells by using a retroviral vector, S-003. The Id3/S-003 retroviral vector allows translation of both FLAG-tagged mouse Id3 and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) from a bicistronic retroviral transcript (Fig. 1A). To transduce Id3 into 16610D9 cells, we used supernatants from ϕNX-eco retroviral packaging line into which Id3/S-003 or S-003 empty vector had been stably transfected. The transduction level was determined by flow cytometric analysis of transductants expressing EGFP (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we assessed the level of SRG3 proteins in the whole-cell extracts from control and Id3-infected cells by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, ectopic overexpression of Id3 reduced SRG3 protein expression by more than half, whereas the expression of GR and actin remained unchanged, suggesting that SRG3 gene expression is negatively controlled by Id3 expression. To determine whether the decrease in SRG3 protein levels upon Id3 transduction resulted from suppression of SRG3 transcription, we next proceeded to analyze the level of various transcripts in control and Id3-transduced cells by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, mRNAs for FLAG-tagged Id3 whose expression is driven by the Id3 retroviral construct were detectable only in Id3-infected cells. As a result, the level of SRG3 mRNAs was reduced by approximately half (Fig. 2A), which was comparable with the decrease in SRG3 proteins upon Id3 transduction (Fig. 1C). The same result was reproduced by RT-PCR analysis showing repression of SRG3 transcription by Id3 overexpression, whereas the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase control transcripts was not affected (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that Id3 represses the SRG3 gene expression at the transcriptional level.Fig. 2Id3 transcriptionally represses SRG3 gene expression.A, Northern blot analysis. Equal amounts of total RNAs prepared from vector- and Id3-transduced 16610D9 cells were resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and then blotted to Hybond™-N (Amersham Biosciences). The Northern blots were probed with specific SRG3 and FLAG-Id3 probes. 18 S and 28 S rRNAs are shown. B, RT-PCR assay using cDNAs prepared from total RNAs of vector- or Id3-transduced 16610D9 cells. Each PCR amplification was carried out with primers specific to each transcript as labeled and in three different numbers of cycles. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) served as controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)E2A/HEB Complex Activates the SRG3 Promoter Activity through the E84 Element, Which Is Inhibited by Id Proteins— Because Id3 was well known to repress the E box binding activity of E proteins in a dominant negative manner and E protein family members such as E47, E12, and HEB directly associated with the putative E box element in the SRG3 promoter (55Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21903-21915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it is possible that E2A and HEB proteins act to activate SRG3 expression, and Id3 protein represses SRG3 transcription by preventing E2A/HEB binding to the E box element in the SRG3 promoter, leading to a decrease in SRG3 protein level. To clarify the contribution of the E2A/HEB complex to the activation of SRG3 gene expression, we generated pSRG3–210-Luc, a luciferase reporter construct driven by SRG3 proximal promoter encompassing the 210-bp nucleotides upstream of the SRG3 translation start site. Next, we measured the SRG3 reporter activity in NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with combinations of E47, E12, or HEB expression vector. This cell line is appropriate for this assay because the SRG3 gene was expressed at low levels in the absence of E2A/HEB binding to the E box element (E84) in the SR"

By modulating extracellular adenosine, this “ecto-ADA” may regulate adenosine receptor signaling implicated in various cellular functions. CD26 is expressed on the surface of human prostate cancer 1-LN cells acting as a receptor for plasminogen (Pg). Since ADA and Pg bind to CD26 at distinct but nearby sites, we investigated a possible interaction between these two proteins on the surface of 1-LN cells. Human ADA binds to CD26 on the surface 1-LN cells and immobilized CD26 isolated from the same cells with similar affinity. In both cases, ADA binding is diminished by mutation of ADA residues known to interact with CD26. ADA was also found to bind Pg 2 in the absence of CD26 via the Pg kringle 4 (K4) domain. In the presence of 1-LN cells or immobilized CD26, exogenous ADA enhances conversion of Pg 2 to plasmin by 1-LN endogenous urinary plasminogen activator (u-PA), as well as by added tissue Pg Activator (t-PA), suggesting that ADA and Pg bind simultaneously to CD26 in a ternary complex that stimulates the Pg activation by its physiologic activators. Consistent with this, in melanoma A375 cells that bind Pg, but do not express CD26, the rate of Pg activation was not affected by ADA. Thus, ADA may be a factor regulating events in prostate cancer cells that occur when Pg binds to the cell surface and is activated.

Humans with inherited ADA deficiency have a profound lymphopenia causing severe combined immunodeficiency disease (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Although mainly cytosolic, an “ecto” form of ADA also exists on activated human T lymphocytes and epithelial cells of many organs because of the association of ADA with a multifunctional cell membrane glycoprotein, CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV (3Nishihara H.

A high affinity between ADA and CD26 also prevails in some other mammalian species such as rabbits and cattle, but not in others, such as mice and rats (8Schrader W.P. West C.A. Miczek A.D.

It has been suggested that CD26-associated ecto-ADA regulates the level of extracellular adenosine and thereby controls signal transduction via a family of adenosine receptors (10Dong R.P. Kameoka J.

Rev. 1998; 161: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). CD26 is a co-stimulator of T lymphocyte activation (12Fox D.A. Hussey R.E. Fitzgerald K.A. Acuto O. Poole C. Palley L. Daley J.F. Schlossman S.F. Reinhertz E.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1250-1256PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro studies suggest that ADA binding modulates this co-stimulatory function (10Dong R.P. Kameoka J. Hegen M. Tanaka T. Xu Y. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1349-1355PubMed Google Scholar, 11Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C. Blanco J. Immunol.

It has been proposed that a lack of “ecto-ADA” contributes to severe combined immunodeficiency in patients with inherited ADA deficiency (10Dong R.P. Kameoka J. Hegen M. Tanaka T. Xu Y. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1349-1355PubMed Google Scholar, 11Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C. Blanco J. Immunol.

Human ADA binds to CD26 via a carboxyl-terminal amino acid segment of the peripheral α2 helix, comprising residues 128–143 (14Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D.

Binding of recombinant human ADA to CD26 was greatly reduced by mutating Arg142 to Gln, the amino acid occupying this position in mouse ADA, which does not bind CD26 (14Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ADA from a healthy adult who expressed only the enzyme with a R142Q mutation (16Santisteban I. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Kelly S. Loubser M. Meydan N. Roifman C. Howell P.L. Bowen T. Weinberg K.I. Schroeder M.L. Hershfield M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2081-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed markedly reduced binding to CD26, suggesting that, as in mice, binding of ADA to CD26 is not essential for immune function in humans (14Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CD26 expressed at high levels on 1-LN human prostate tumor cells has been shown to act as a receptor for plasminogen type 2 (Pg 2) (17Gonzalez-Gronow M. Grenett H.E. Weber M.R. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting Pg 2 activation by urinary-type Pg activator (u-PA), CD26-associated Pg 2 also initiates a signal transduction cascade, which regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) by these cells (17Gonzalez-Gronow M. Grenett H.E. Weber M.R. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pg 2 binds via its α2,3-linked sialic acid residues of the Thr345 O-linked carbohydrate chain to a region of CD26 located between amino acids 313 and 319 (18Gonzalez-Gronow M. Weber M.R. Shearin T.V. Gawdi G. Pirie-Shepherd S.R. Pizzo S.V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 1998; 12: 366-374Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This epitope responsible for binding to Pg 2 is conserved in human and mouse CD26 (19Bernard A.M. Mattei M.G. Pierres M. Marguet D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15204-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Misumi Y. Hayashi Y. Arakawa F. Ikehara Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ADA binding occurs at a region between amino acids 340 and 345 of human CD26 (21Dong R.P. Tachibana K. Hegen M. Murakata Y. Cho D. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6070-6076PubMed Google Scholar). The Pg and ADA binding regions are located in close proximity in the crystal structure of CD26 (22Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated binding of ADA to 1-LN cells and to isolated, immobilized CD26 purified from 1-LN cell membranes, in the absence or presence of Pg 2. ADA binding to human melanoma cells, which do not express CD26 (23Houghton A.N. Albino A.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Davis L.J. Eisinger M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was also examined. The specificity of binding to CD26 was determined in experiments with recombinant wild type human ADA and a mutant ADA with greatly reduced affinity for CD26. Our findings indicate that activation of Pg 2 by its physiologic activators u-PA and tissue-type Pg activator (t-PA) are stimulated by ADA when both Pg 2 and ADA are bound to either 1-LN cells or immobilized CD26. However, the rate of Pg 2 activation was not enhanced when ADA bound to melanoma cells, which lack the CD26 receptor. ADA activity is not affected by Pg 2. These results are the first evidence demonstrating a connection between the Pg activation system and the protein complex CD26-ADA. Materials—Culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent for protein iodination was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Proteins—ADA was purified from human monocytic leukemia U937 cells grown in 10 liters of RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The protein was purified to homogeneity using a combination of ion-exchange and affinity chromatographies as described by Aran et al. (24Aran J.M. Canela E.I. Franco R. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 532: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Human Pg was purified and separated into its two classes of isoforms, Pg 1 and Pg 2, as described previously (25Deutsch D.

Antibodies—Antibodies to CD26 were raised in rabbits according to standard protocols, using purified CD26 (17Gonzalez-Gronow M. Grenett H.E. Weber M.R. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem.

The IgG fraction specific against CD26 was purified on a column containing CD26 covalently attached to Sepharose 4B. The mouse monoclonal antibody 1C5 was prepared against ADA purified from human T cell leukemia cells as described previously (14Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D.

Cell Cultures—The human prostate tumor cell line 1-LN, a generous gift of Dr. Philip Walther of the Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The human melanoma A375 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Ligand Binding Analysis—Cells were grown in tissue culture plates until the monolayers were confluent. The cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution. All binding assays were performed at 4 °C in RPM1 1640 containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled ADA were incubated with cells for 60 min in 96-well strip plates. Free ligand was separated from bound ligand by aspirating the incubation mixture and washing the cell monolayers rapidly three times with RPMI 1640 containing 2% BSA. Wells were stripped from the plates, and radioactivity was determined in an Amersham Biosciences LKB Biotechnology® 1272-γ counter. Molecules of ligand bound were calculated after subtraction of nonspecific binding measured in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled ADA. Estimates of dissociation constants (Kd) and maximal binding of ADA (Bmax) were determined by fitting data directly to a nonlinear regression program using the statistical program SYStat® for Windows 98. Solid-phase Radioligand Binding Studies—To study specific binding of ADA to immobilized CD26 purified from 1-LN cells, 96-well strip plates were coated with CD26 (1 μg/ml in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.6; 200 μl/well; 37 °C; 2 h). After coating, plates were washed with 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate/100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 80 (PBS-Tween) to remove unbound protein. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS-Tween containing 2% (w/v) BSA at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were rinsed twice with 200 μl of PBS-Tween, air-dried, and stored at 4 °C. For assays, increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled ADA, with or without a 50-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, were added to triplicate wells and incubated at 22 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the supernatants were removed, and the plates were rinsed three times with 200 μl of PBS-Tween. Wells were stripped from the plates, and radioactivity was measured in an Amersham Biosciences LKB Biotechnology® 1272-γ counter. Specific binding was calculated by subtraction of nonspecific binding measured in the presence of unlabeled ligand. A similar technique was used to immobilize Pg on 96-well culture plates. Conditions for binding of 125I-labeled ADA to immobilized Pg and measurements of radioactivity were similar to those described above. Cellular Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (CELISA) to Measure Binding of Cloned Human ADA to Cell Surface CD26 —Binding of wild type and hybrid human ADA (H1–125/M126–143/H144–363) to 1-LN or A375 cells was evaluated with a CELISA assay (30Smith D.D. Cohick C.B. Lindsley H.B. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 96-well plates until confluent. Cell monolayers were incubated in RPMI 1640 with increasing concentrations of wild type and hybrid human ADAs for 90 min at 4 °C. To avoid nonspecific binding of primary antibody, the cell monolayers were then blocked with 2% BSA. Excess ADA and BSA were removed by rinsing the plates three times with 0.2 ml of methanol at -20 °C for 20 min. At this time, cells were rinsed three times in PBS and then incubated with 0.2 ml of PBS containing 100 ng of anti-human ADA monoclonal antibody 1C5 at 22 °C for 90 min or with a nonspecific mouse antibody/monoclonal antibody. Then, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with a goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (0.2 ml of PBS containing 50 ng of secondary antibody) at 22 °C for 90 min. Bound IgG was monitored by hydrolysis of the alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate at a wavelength of ΔA405 nm using an Anthos Labtec® kinetic plate reader. Bound ADA was expressed as ΔA405 nm/min. Plasmin Generation on the Surface of 1-LN Cells or Immobilized CD26 —Plasmin generation by endogenous u-PA was measured on confluent 1-LN cell monolayers grown in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, without phenol red, with Pg 2 (0.2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the plasmin substrate l-valine-l-lysine-l-glycine-p-nitroanilide (S-2251) at a final concentration of 0.3 mm. The hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored at a wavelength of 405 nm using an Anthos Labtec® kinetic plate reader. Pm activity was expressed as ΔA405 nm/min. Measurement of ADA Enzymatic Activity—The enzymatic activity of ADA was determined in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm adenosine. The reaction velocity was measured by a change in absorbance at 265 nm resulting from the deamination of adenosine. ADA activity was expressed as ΔA265 nm/min. Gel Electrophoresis—Electrophoresis was performed on polyacrylamide gels (1.2 mm thick; 14 cm × 10 cm) containing 0.1% SDS. A discontinuous Laemmli buffer system was used (31Laemli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Visualization of the proteins was carried out by staining the gel with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 45% (v/v) methanol/10% (v/v) acetic acid. The dye-conjugated Mr markers (Bio-Rad) used were: BSA (Mr 86,000), carbonic anhydrase (Mr 44,000), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Mr 33,000). Binding of ADA to 1-LN Cells and Immobilized CD26 Isolated from 1-LN Cell Membranes—Analyses of the binding isotherm resulting from incubation of 1-LN cells with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled human ADA (Fig. 1A), purified from U937 cells (Fig. 1A, inset), suggest that ADA binds to these cells in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity (Kd of 20 ± 3.7 nm) and to a large number of sites (Bmax of 28 ± 4.3 × 105 sites/cell). Analyses of the binding isotherm of ADA to CD26 immobilized on cell culture plates (Fig. 1B) indicates a single class of binding sites (a Kd of 18 ± 5.4 nm and a Bmax of 0.8 nmol of bound ADA/nmol CD26). This Kd value is within the same order of magnitude to previous estimates of Kd determined for the binding of recombinant human ADA to purified rabbit CD26 (15Richard E. Munir Alam S. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19720-19726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding of Recombinant ADAs to Purified CD26 and to CD26-expressing versus CD26-nonexpressing Cells—We examined the capacity of recombinant ADA constructs expressed in lysates of Escherichia coli S3834 to compete for binding of purified, 125I-labeled human ADA to human CD26 immobilized on culture plates. These experiments (Fig. 2) show that only wild type recombinant human ADA competed significantly for CD26 binding. Lysates expressing mouse ADA or the human ADA mutant H1–125/M126–143/H144–363, in which the mouse α2 helix is substituted for the human segment, showed no more evidence of binding to human CD26 than did a lysate of E. coli S3834 transformed with the carrier plasmid pZ alone, used as a negative control. These data confirm that the amino acid segment 126–143 of human ADA comprises the functional epitope for binding to CD26. The binding of recombinant ADAs to 1-LN cells was compared with their binding to human melanoma A375 cells, which do not express CD26, using a CELISA assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As was found with purified CD26, wild type recombinant human ADA, but neither mouse ADA nor the H1–125/M126–143/H144–363 mutant, showed binding to 1-LN cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that ADA binding to 1-LN cells was exclusively via cell surface CD26. Consistent with this conclusion, and with previous studies of 125I-labeled ADA binding to several other melanoma cell lines (23Houghton A.N. Albino A.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Davis L.J. Eisinger M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), neither wild type nor mutant recombinant human ADA constructs showed any specific binding to A375 cells (Fig. 3B). Binding of ADA to Immobilized Human Pg 2—A close examination of the human and murine CD26 segment containing amino acids 310–350 (19Bernard A.M. Mattei M.G. Pierres M. Marguet D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15204-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Misumi Y. Hayashi Y. Arakawa F. Ikehara Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Pizzo S.V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 1998; 12: 366-374Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Confirming our previous finding (18Gonzalez-Gronow M. Weber M.R. Shearin T.V. Gawdi G. Pirie-Shepherd S.R. Pizzo S.V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 1998; 12: 366-374Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Fig. 5 shows that 125I-labeled ADA binds to Pg 2 immobilized on cell culture plates in a dose-dependent, saturable manner. 125I-labeled ADA also binds to Pg 2 electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane after electrophoresis (Fig. 5, inset, lane 2). Analysis of the binding isotherm demonstrates that ADA binds to Pg 2 with high affinity (Kd of ∼0.28 μm and Bmax of 0.93 nmol of bound ADA per nmol Pg).Fig. 5Binding of ADA to immobilized human Pg 2. Increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled ADA were added to Pg 2-coated 96-well culture plates and were incubated at 22 °C for 1 h. Bound ADA was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset, SDS/10% PAGE of purified Pg 2 (10 μg) which was examined under reducing conditions and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by the Western blot method.

Data represent means ± S.D. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since both Pg 2 and ADA bind to CD26, and ADA binds directly to Pg 2, we investigated the capacity of Pg 2 to influence the binding of ADA to CD26 (Fig. 6). Increasing concentrations of Pg enhanced the binding of ADA to the complex CD26-Pg 2 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the binding of 125I-labeled ADA to immobilized Pg 2 was not affected by either K1–3 or K5 domains of Pg, whereas the K4 domain was an effective inhibitor (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the interaction of ADA and Pg 2 is mediated by K4. Effect of the Interaction between Pg 2 and ADA on Pg Activation or ADA Enzymatic Activity—Pg 2 binds to CD26 on 1-LN cells, where it is rapidly activated by u-PA, the primary Pg activator at the surface of these cells (17Gonzalez-Gronow M. Grenett H.E. Weber M.R. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of increasing concentrations of ADA on Pg 2 activation by 1-LN cell monolayers at a single Pg 2 concentration (0.2 μm) (Fig. 7A) and also on Pg 2 activation by t-PA on plates containing immobilized CD26 isolated from 1-LN cell membranes (Fig. 7B). In both cases, ADA stimulated Pg 2 activation in a dose-dependent manner, when either u-PA or t-PA was the activator. The enzymatic activity of ADA (0.1 μm) was not affected by increasing concentrations of Pg 2 (values of ΔA265 nm/min of 0.15 and 0.14 in the absence or presence of 1 μm Pg 2, respectively). These experiments suggest that ADA facilitates Pg 2 activation, possibly by inducing a conformational change in Pg 2. We next assessed Pg 2 activation by t-PA in the presence of ADA and poly-d-lysine, which mimics a fibrin surface, a physiological substrate for Pg activation by t-PA. In this system, we studied the effect of Pg K1–3, K4, and the anti-fibrinolytic amino acid 6-AHA, which inhibits binding of Pg or t-PA to fibrin. The results (Table I) demonstrate that poly-d-lysine enhances the effects of ADA on Pg activation by t-PA. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrate that K4 effectively suppresses the ADA effect, suggesting again that K4 is the region in Pg responsible for the interaction with ADA. 6-AHA was an effective inhibitor of ADA-induced Pg activation. This raises the possibility that Pg and its activators must be closely localized by substrate molecules, such as fibrin or CD26, in order for ADA to enhance the rate of Pg activation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of ADA on Pg activation by A375 cells, which do not express CD26 on their surface (Table II). In contrast to results with 1-LN cells, Pg activation was not substantially changed in the presence of two concentrations of ADA. Taken together, these results suggest that ADA-facilitated Pg activation observed with 1-LN cells was mediated by a specific interaction of ADA, Pg, and CD26 on the cell surface.Table IEffect of ADA on poly-d-lysine enhanced t-PA activity Assays were performed in 96-well culture plates in a final volume of 0.2 ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing Pg (0.2 μm), ADA (0.2 μm), S-2251 (0.2 mm), t-PA (0.5 nM), poly-d-Lys (1 mg/ml), K1-3 (0.5 μm), K4 (0.5 μm), and 6-AHA (50 mm).

Costanzi S. Lambertucci C. Lupidi G. Vittori S. Volpini R. Camaioni E. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32Spychala J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). For example, in cerebellar neurons, exogenous ADA increased the influx of 45Ca2+ and hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides (33Catania M.V. Sortino M.A. Rampello L. Canonico P.L. Nicoletti F. Neuropharmacology. 1991; 30: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since the binding regions for Pg and ADA in CD26 are in close proximity (18Gonzalez-Gronow M. Weber M.R. Shearin T.V. Gawdi G. Pirie-Shepherd S.R. Pizzo S.V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 1998; 12: 366-374Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Dong R.P. Tachibana K. Hegen M. Murakata Y. Cho D. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J.

Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we investigated the possible influence of the interaction of these proteins on Pg 2 activation. Our findings suggest a novel role for the complex CD26-ADA, which may not require the catalytic activity of ADA. We have shown that ADA binds to CD26 on 1-LN cells and that ADA binds to Pg 2, either alone or when Pg 2 is bound to immobilized CD26. The enzymatic activity of ADA was not affected by binding to Pg 2. ADA stimulated the activation of Pg by u-PA on the surface of 1-LN cells or by t-PA when Pg 2 was bound to immobilized CD26. ADA also stimulated Pg 2 activation by t-PA in the presence of poly-d-lysine, which mimics a fibrin surface, thereby suggesting that extracellular ADA may act as a pro-fibrinolytic factor. The interaction between ADA and Pg is mediated by K4. ADA appears to mimic the effect of tetranectin, a specific K4-binding protein occurring in plasma at ∼10 mg/liter, which enhances Pg activation by t-PA in the presence of poly-d-lysine (34Clemmensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This effect of tetranectin on Pg activation is inhibited by 6-AHA, suggesting a mechanism mediated by the l-lysine binding site on K4 (34Clemmensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All these effects are similar to those described above for the interaction between ADA and Pg 2. Our data suggest a mechanism that permits acceleration of the rate of Pg activation when both Pg and ADA are bound to CD26 in prostate carcinoma 1-LN cells, which is not available in A375 melanoma cells, which do not express CD26. However, Pg is found colocalized with tetranectin at the invasive front of malignant melanoma lesions, suggesting a coordinated role for tetranectin and Pg, mediated by the l-lysine binding site on K4 (35De Vries T.J. De Witt P.E.J. Clemmensen I. Verspaget H.W. Weidle U.H. Brocker E.B. Rutter D.J. Van Muijen G.N.P. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); this Pg 2 activation may facilitate the migration of melanoma tumor cells (35De Vries T.J. De Witt P.E.J. Clemmensen I. Verspaget H.W. Weidle U.H. Brocker E.B. Rutter D.J. Van Muijen G.N.P. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the evolution of melanoma and prostate cancer may depend on the interaction of ligands specific for Pg K4 to regulate the rate of Pg activation at their invasive fronts. In this context, the levels of CD26 and ADA have been evaluated in prostate cancer. The specific activity of ADA in cancerous human prostate has been reported to be similar or slightly less than in normal prostatic tissue (36Tritsch G.L. Murphy G.P. Eur. Urol. 1980; 6: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 37Biri H. Ozturk H.S. Kacmaz M. Karaca K. Tokucoglu H. Durak I. Cancer Investig. 1999; 17: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, ADA levels in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) tissue were significantly higher than in normal prostate (36Tritsch G.L. Murphy G.P. Eur. Urol. 1980; 6: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). CD26 levels are significantly elevated in prostate cancers relative to BPH tissues, but CD26 levels were similar to those of the tumor in BPH tissue adjacent to the tumor (38Wilson M.J. Ruhland A.R. Quast B.J. Reddy P.K. Ewing S.L. Sinha A.A. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 220-226PubMed Google Scholar). These studies, along with our observations, suggest that one of the local factors influencing growth of epithelial cells in prostate cancer may be high levels of the protease plasmin generated by BPH tissue in the immediate growth environment of the tumor, resulting from high levels of CD26 and ADA, which facilitate Pg localization and activation on the surface of these cells."

(2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 41171-41182) are found only in organisms of the animal kingdom and share several structural and enzymatic features. The presence of serine/arginine (S/R) dipeptide repeats in their C-terminal tail suggests that these enzymes belong to the SR protein family involved in the regulation of gene expression. The function of this group of cyclophilins is currently unknown. However, their C-terminal tails contain a highly conserved polypeptide signature segment (the moca domain), which may well be involved in the functional regulation of these proteins. We report here the identification of five Cdc2-type phosphorylation sites gathered in and around the moca domain of SRcyp, a human cyclophilin belonging to the Moca family. The segment of SRcyp containing the identified sites is specifically phosphorylated in mitotic cells. This mitosis-specific phosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of the cells with roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, suggesting that the unknown activity of the moca domain of SRcyp requires mitotic regulation by the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex. The Cdc2-cyclin B complex was found to phosphorylate four of the five identified phosphorylation sites in vitro, providing further support for this possibility. Like many factors stored in nuclear speckles and involved in the regulation of gene expression, this nuclear cyclophilin displays a predominantly diffuse cytoplasmic distribution at the onset of mitosis. Only in late telophase is SRcyp recruited to the newly formed nuclei. The transit of SRcyp through mitotic interchromatin granule clusters, before re-entering the nucleus, suggests that the timing of the appearance of this cyclophilin in the telophasic nuclei is tightly coordinated with post-mitotic events. Human SRcyp is the first cell cycle-regulated cyclophilin to be described. Cyclophilins of the Moca family (Cavarec, L., Kamphausen, T., Dubourg, B., Callebaut, I., Lemeunier, F., Metivier, D., Feunteun, J., Fischer, G., and Modjtahedi, N. (2002) J. Biol.

Cyclophilins belong to the class of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIase 1The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase; CsA, cyclosporin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNA pol II, RNA polymerase II; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MIGs, mitotic interchromatin clusters; IGCs, interchromatin granule clusters; RRMs, RNA recognition motifs; CTD, C-terminal domain. ; EC 5.2.1.8), which also includes two other enzyme families (FK506-binding proteins and parvulins; for reviews see Refs. 2Fischer G.

The first cyclophilin to be isolated was the cellular receptor for the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Other members of this family have since been identified in various cell compartments. Their functions are poorly understood but have been linked to cellular processes, such as protein folding (4Schiene C. Fischer G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), trafficking (5Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S.

Recent studies have shown that cyclophilins may also be involved in nuclear events such as gene transcription and mRNA splicing. For example, the nuclear cyclophilin Cyp33, which harbors an RNA-binding motif (RRM (10Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)) binds to and modulates the gene regulatory function of the human myeloid/lymphoid leukemia (MLL/HRX/HTRX/All1) protein (11Fair K. Anderson M. Bulanova E. Mi H. Tropschug M. Diaz M.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3589-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Another cyclophilin, Snucyp-20, is a specific component of the human U4/U6 small nuclear-ribonucleoprotein particle (12Teigelkamp S. Achsel T. Mundt C. Gothel S.F. Cronshagen U. Lane W.S. Marahiel M. Luhrmann R. RNA (New York). 1998; 4: 127-141PubMed Google Scholar) and is involved in the nuclear splicing of pre-mRNA (13Horowitz D.S. Lee E.J. Mabon S.A. Misteli T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Moca family of nuclear cyclophilins, which we described recently (1Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B. Callebaut I.

The Moca family includes Moca-cyp, isolated from Drosophila melanogaster (1Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B. Callebaut I. Lemeunier F. Metivier D. Feunteun J. Fischer G. Modjtahedi N. J. Biol.

The members of this subfamily have much lower levels of PPIase activity than the prototypical cyclophilin, Cyp18, possibly reflecting specific substrate requirements. Indeed, the D. melanogaster Moca-cyp and B. malayi cyp1 enzymes have been shown to display a preference for a hydrophobic amino acid immediately N-terminal to the proline residue (1Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B. Callebaut I. Lemeunier F. Metivier D. Feunteun J. Fischer G. Modjtahedi N. J. Biol.

Inhibition of the PPIase activity of the members of Moca family requires much higher concentrations of CsA apparently due to two amino acid substitutions in the catalytic domain. In addition to the structural and enzymatic features characterizing their PPIase domains, members of the Moca family have several structural characteristics in common in their C-terminal tails (1Cavarec L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41171-41182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All carry multiple nuclear localization signals, and the presence of SR and RS dipeptide repeats suggests that these proteins belong to the family of serine/arginine (SR)-rich nuclear phosphoproteins involved in the splicing and processing of mRNA (21Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 22Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Finally, a highly conserved polypeptide segment (the “moca” domain) within the C-terminal tail is the signature of Moca family members. We speculate that the conservation of this domain reflects a specific regulatory function required for the unknown activity of this subfamily of cyclophilins (1Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B. Callebaut I. Lemeunier F. Metivier D. Feunteun J. Fischer G. Modjtahedi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41171-41182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We report here the cell cycle regulation of the nuclear cyclophilin SRcyp 2SRcyp has also been named CARS-cyp (14Nestel F.P. Colwill K. Harper S. Pawson T. Anderson S.K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and CASP10 (15Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Meier P. Moosmann P. Silke J. Baechi T. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). According to the nomenclature proposed by Fischer (2Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar), this cyclophilin is also designated hCyp89. (14Nestel F.P. Colwill K. Harper S. Pawson T. Anderson S.K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Meier P. Moosmann P. Silke J. Baechi T. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a human protein belonging to the Moca family. The presence of five Cdc2-type phosphorylation sites gathered in and around the moca domain of SRcyp prompted us to investigate its phosphorylation during the cell cycle. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the moca domain of this cyclophilin was specifically phosphorylated during mitosis and that the master mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase, the Cdc2-cyclin B complex, was probably responsible for this phosphorylation. We also observed, in indirect immunofluorescence experiments, that the cellular location of SRcyp changed during the course of mitosis. SRcyp passed through cytoplasmic structures called mitotic interchromatin clusters (MIGs) (23Lamond A. Spector D.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) before entering the newly formed nuclei of the late telophasic cell. These properties of SRcyp suggest that this protein may be involved in the regulation of gene expression in post-mitotic cells. Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—We cloned the SRcyp cDNA as follows. Poly(A)+ mRNA was extracted and purified (mRNA purification kit, Amersham Biosciences) from human U2OS cells (ATCC number, HTB-9624), synchronized at the S phase of the cell cycle (see below). The resulting RNA was used for reverse transcription (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit; Clontech), and a 2267-bp fragment corresponding to the full-length open reading frame of the human SRcyp gene (nucleotides 153-2420 of the published sequence (15Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Meier P. Moosmann P. Silke J. Baechi T. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) was amplified by PCR using the specific primers 5′-(XbaI)-GAGCCATGGGAATAAAGG-3′ and 5′-(BamHI)-TCCGCTTTTGTCTTCATCTG-3′ and inserted into the pGEM-T/Easy vector (pGEM-T Easy kit, Promega). The resulting recombinant plasmid, pGEM-T/SRcyp, was completely sequenced. For in vivo expression experiments, pGEM-T/SRcyp was digested with XbaI and BamHI, and the 2267-bp fragment was released, purified, and ligated between the corresponding cloning sites in p3xFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma) to generate the recombinant plasmid pCMV-SRcyp. The recombinant plasmid pCMV-SRcypdelmoca, harboring an internal deletion in the moca domain of the SRcyp cDNA (between nucleotides 1133 and 1252), was derived from pCMV-SRcyp as follows. We used pCMV-SRcyp as a template for the PCR amplification of two fragments of SRcyp: 5′-fragment, nucleotides 153-1133, and 3′-fragment, nucleotides 1252-2420, located 5′ and 3′ of the segment to be deleted. The 5′-fragment was amplified with a vector-specific primer (5′-CGGCCGCGAATTCATCGATA-3′) containing an EcoRI site and a gene-specific primer (5′-CTAAAAGTCGTCTCTGGTATG-3′) supplemented with an SacII site. The 3′-fragment was amplified with a gene-specific primer (5′-GATGCAGAGAGCTCAAAGAA-3′) flanked by an SacII site and a vector-specific primer (5′-CCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTC-3′). The amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI+SacII and with SacII+BamHI, respectively, and were then coligated into p3xFLAG-CMV-14 digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The recombinant plasmid pCMV-CAD, containing the moca domain sequence of the SRcyp cDNA, was also derived as follows. We used pCMV-SRcyp as a template for PCR amplification of the CAD fragment of the SRcyp cDNA (nucleotides 916-1412 of the published sequence), using the primers 5′-(EcoRI)-ATGGGGAGTGCATCTAGTGAGAG-3′ and 5′-(BamHI)-TCTGTTTGGACTCTCAGATAC-3′. The amplified CAD fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding cloning sites of p3xFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma) to generate the recombinant plasmid pCMV-CAD. To obtain the recombinant plasmids pGEX-CBC, pGEX-CBD, pGEX-CAC, and pGEX-CAD, overlapping fragments of the human SRcyp cDNA corresponding to segments B-C, B-D, A-C, and A-D (nucleotides 1105-1315, 1105-1410, 916-1315, and 916-1410 of the published cDNA sequence (15Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Meier P. Moosmann P. Silke J. Baechi T. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) were amplified by PCR (Advantage 2 PCR kit, Clontech) using gene-specific primers as follows: A, 5′-(EcoRI)-GAGTGCATCTAGTGAGAG-3′; B, 5′-(EcoRI)-GCCTGCTTCATACCAGAGAC-3′; C, 5′-(BamHI)-ACTCTTATCCCCCTTGATCC-3′; and D, 5′-(BamHI)-CTGTTTGGACTCTCAGATAC-3′. The amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction and ligated between the corresponding cloning sites of pGEX-2TKL. The plasmid construction procedures resulted in the loss of Cdc2 phosphorylation site P5 (ESPNRK) from pGEX-CAD and pGEX-CBD (nucleotides 916-1410 and 1105-1410, respectively, of the published sequence). This site was lost because the terminal residue at the 3′ end of both insert fragments was an asparagine (Asn-417), which is part of the consensus Cdc2 phosphorylation site P5 (ESPNRK). This residue was immediately followed by a serine residue translated from a linker sequence, replacing the arginine (Arg-418) present in the original P5 site. We used a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) and the primers 5′-GAGTCCAAACAGAGGGATCCAATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATTGGATCCCTCTGTTTGGACTC-3′ to replace the serine by an arginine in both plasmids, giving pGEX-CADn and pGEX-CBDn. We generated pGEX-CAB (SRcyp nucleotides 916-1144 of the published sequence (15Bourquin J.-P. Stagljar I. Meier P. Moosmann P. Silke J. Baechi T. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) from pGEX-CAD. Briefly, pGEX-CAD was digested with BglII (which cuts into the CAD fragment) and BamHI (3′-cloning site in the vector). The resulting 5.2-kb fragment corresponding to the vector and the 5′ portion of CAD was religated and used to transform bacteria. The resulting plasmid was named pGEX-CAB. All these recombinant plasmids were used for GST fusion protein production (24Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were produced in bacteria and recovered on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), from which they were eluted for 15 min at 4 °C with 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 120 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris, pH 8. After quantification (Bio-Rad protein assay), eluted proteins were used as substrates for the in vitro kinase assay. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Synchronization—U2OS cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and transfected using an Invitrogen calcium phosphate transfection kit and procedures. Clones of transfected U2OS cells stably expressing pCMV-SRcyp, pCMV-Srcypdelmoca, and pCMV-CAD were established by cotransfection with the plasmids described above and the pPuro plasmid (Clontech) followed by selection in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml of puromycin (Clontech) and 0.5 mg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen). For cell cycle synchronization, cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells per plate and incubated for 24 h. We then added 0.5 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma) to the medium and incubated the plates for a further 16 h. The cells were washed twice with drug-free medium and then incubated for 4 h in the presence of drug-free medium, for the collection of S phase cells, or for 8 h, after which nocodazole (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma) was added. Loosely attached mitotic cells were collected after 12 h of incubation with nocodazole. Nocodazole-treated cells were washed twice and replated in drug-free medium and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to obtain cells in the G1 phase of the cycle. Where indicated, mitotic cells obtained by nocodazole treatment were incubated in the presence of 100 μm roscovitine (Calbiochem) for 1-3 h at 37 °C. Samples corresponding to synchronization at various stages were fixed in 40% ethanol and stained with 46 μg/ml propidium iodide in the presence of 5 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Roche Applied Science). Cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry with a Coulter XL Analyzer, and data were analyzed with Phoenix Flow Systems Inc., Multicycle AV software. Antibodies—We used the following antibodies: anti-FLAG (mAb M2; Sigma), anti-cyclin B1 (mAb C23420; Transduction Laboratories), anti-Cdc2(p34) (mAb sc-54; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (mAb 374; Chemicon International), 3C5 mAb (provided by B. Turner), and anti-lamin A/C rabbit polyclonal serum (provided by B. Buendia). Cell Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—For extract preparation, cells were harvested, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl), and lysed by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C in one of the following buffers: Net.N-300 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal), NetN-150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal), or RIPA 1× (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), supplemented with protease inhibitors (EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science), aprotinin (Sigma), leupeptin (Roche Applied Science), pepstatin (Roche Applied Science) (20 μg/μl each), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4). The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g to eliminate cell debris. The proteins present in the supernatant were quantified (Bio-Rad protein assay) and resolved directly by SDS-PAGE after boiling in 1× SB (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol) or subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or Western blot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, we coated protein G-Sepharose CL-4B beads (40 μl of a 50% slurry, Amersham Biosciences) with the antibodies indicated, by incubating for 2 h at 4 °Cin600 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Igepal). The antibody-coated beads were washed three times in binding buffer and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 500 μg of cell lysate, in a final volume of 600 μl. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and were then used for the in vitro kinase assay. For Western blot analysis, SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), using Towbin buffer (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and a semi-dry electrotransfer device (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked by incubating with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide for 2 h and then for a further 3 h at room temperature with the specified primary antibody diluted in the same incubation mixture. The membrane was washed four times in TBST buffer and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and antibody binding was detected with the ECL+ chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). λ Protein Phosphatase Treatment—We used 400 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) per 100 μg of cell extract and 100 μl of reaction buffer. The reaction buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Igepal, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 2 mm MnCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. The cell extract was then added and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. We added an equal volume of 1× SB to the reaction mixture, and the sample was then boiled and analyzed by Western blotting. Where indicated, the phosphatase treatment was carried out in the presence of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors: 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 nm microcystin. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The Cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of mitotic U2OS cell extract using an anti-cyclin B1 (mAb C23420, Transduction Laboratories) or an anti-Cdc2(p34) (mAb sc-54, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) mAb bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The bound kinase complex was washed three times with lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The beads were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the substrate (histone H1 (1 μg) or the indicated amount of GST fusion protein). The reaction was stopped by boiling the sample with 50 μl of 1× SB. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). This filter was first placed against x-ray film and was then probed with an anti-Cdc2 mAb (1:1000 dilution). Where indicated, peptides were used as substrates for the in vitro kinase assay. For this purpose, 14-mer peptides, each encompassing one of the Cdc2 phosphorylation sites identified in SRcyp, were synthesized, purified, subjected to mass spectrometry to check their sequences, and then biotinylated as described by Lobl et al. (26Lobl T.J. Deible M.R. Yem A.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the in vitro phosphorylation assay, each peptide, used at a final concentration of 10 μm, was incubated with Cdc2 kinase buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.015% Brij 35) supplemented with 6 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 500 μm unlabeled ATP, and 0.04 units of recombinant Cdc2-cyclin B complex (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in a final volume of 11 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of ATP (1 mm). The mixture was transferred to a streptavidin-coated scintillation plate, which was incubated for 20 min, and washed three times, and the amount of bound 33P-labeled biotinylated peptide was determined with a Wallac Microbeta Jet 1450 scintillation counter. As a control, each peptide was incubated without the kinase. For each sample, the background value was subtracted from the radioactivity count obtained in the presence of kinase. Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis—Stably transfected cells were arrested in prometaphase by nocodazole treatment (65 ng/ml) for 14-16 h. Loosely attached mitotic cells were harvested, washed twice with drug-free medium, and seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated (Sigma) chamber slides (Lab-Tek). Various times after the removal of nocodazole, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by incubation with an anti-FLAG mAb (M2, Sigma) (1:4000 dilution), followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Where indicated, cells were costained with a polyclonal rabbit antilamin A/C serum (1:400 dilution), which was detected with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Costaining with the anti-FLAG (IgG1) and 3C5 (IgM) monoclonal antibodies was achieved by fixing nocodazole-treated cells in methanol for 5 min at -20 °C and permeabilizing them by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton, 2% normal goat serum for 15 min at room temperature. Following incubation with the anti-FLAG (1:4000 dilution) and 3C5 (1:50 dilution) antibodies, staining was detected by incubation with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and a tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotechnology). We stained the DNA in the samples with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Samples were then mounted using Vectashield H-1000 (Vector Laboratories) and observed by microscopy. The Moca Domain of SRcyp Is Phosphorylated in a Cell Cycle-dependent Manner—Analysis of the primary amino acid sequences of cyclophilins of the Moca family (1Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B.

We investigated possible links between the cell cycle machinery and the moca domain of these cyclophilins (1Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B. Callebaut I. Lemeunier F. Metivier D. Feunteun J.

Alignment of the moca domains of several of these cyclophilins (Fig. 1A) showed the presence of two potential Cdc2-type phosphorylation sites. The first consensus site (RTPSR, Fig. 1A, asterisk) is conserved in human, mouse, rat, and Drosophila but is absent from the cyclophilins identified in nematodes. The second phosphorylation site identified (ETPPH, Fig. 1A, asterisk) was atypical and was conserved in all the proteins studied. The moca domain of the human SRcyp (14Nestel F.P. Colwill K.

Furthermore, a cyclin-binding motif (RXL) (27Adams P. Sellers W. Sharma S. Wu A. Nalin C. Kaelin W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28Chen J. Saha P.

https://openalex.org/W2060831404,"There are several lines of evidence showing that synaptic activity regulates the level of expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) in neurons. In this study, we examined the effect of chronic activity blockade on the localization and level of IP3R1 expression in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that chronic blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), one of the major Ca2+-permeable ion channels, increased the number of neurons that express a high level of IP3R1 without any apparent changes in its intracellular localization. Interestingly, this up-regulation was time-dependent; there was no clear change in IP3R1 expression level up to day 5 of the NMDAR blockade, but expression increased at day 6, and the increased expression level persisted for at least a week. The up-regulation of IP3R1 depended on transcription and protein synthesis and required cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Moreover, although most of the control neurons did not respond to the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) stimulation, the 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid-treated neurons with high IP3R1 expression became sensitive to mGluR stimulation. Furthermore, we also found that hippocampal neurons transiently overexpressing green fluorescent protein-tagged IP3R1 released Ca2+ in response to mGluR and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation. These findings suggested that chronic NMDAR blockade increased the IP3R1 expression and enhanced sensitivity to mGluR stimulation. The change in IP3R1 expression level in response to alteration of synaptic activity may be an important determinant of the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation and would help to maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in hippocampal neurons.

Thus, the precise regulation of Ca2+ release through IP3R1 is one of the important factors in these physiological functions in the brain. IP3R channel activity largely depends on direct modulation by numerous intracellular signals, including Ca2+, ATP, calmodulin, FKBP12, calcineurin, BANK, IRAG, chromogranin, and Huntington-associated protein-1A, which acutely control the channel opening (3Patel S.

Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In addition, several recent studies suggest that, by changing the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to IP3, the level of IP3R expression may also be an important factor affecting intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (19Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For example, retinoic acid up-regulates IP3R1 expression in HL-60 cells, a human leukocyte cell line, and HL-60 cells exposed to retinoic acid show a 2-3-fold increase in Ca2+ mobilization in response to IP3 stimulation (20Bradford P.G. Wang X. Jin Y. Hui P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20959-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of IP3R1 in Xenopus oocytes results in an increased velocity of Ca2+ wave propagation (21DeLisle S. Blondel O. Longo F.J. Schnabel W.E. Bell G.I. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse L fibroblasts stably expressing approximately an 8.5-fold amount of IP3R1 show 4-fold increase in the sensitivity to IP3-induced Ca2+ release compared with control cells (22Mackrill J.J. Wilcox R.A. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These cells also show a greater frequency of agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillation and have a lower threshold of agonist concentrations for the transition from oscillatory to peak-and- plateau Ca2+ patterns (23Davis R.J. Challiss J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 813-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Ca2+ release and Ca2+ oscillation patterns profoundly affect the activity of downstream targets that play crucial roles in a myriad of cellular functions (24Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), it is important to determine how the IP3R expression level is controlled in various types of cells. In neurons, control of the IP3R1 expression level is closely related to synaptic activity. In cerebellar granule cells, Ca2+-influx through L-type Ca2+ channels and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) increases the expression level of IP3R1 (25Genazzani A.A. Carafoli E. Guerini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5797-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of L-type Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors increases IP3R1 expression through the calcineurin/NFATC4 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) pathway in hippocampal neurons (26Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In terms of more long term effects of synaptic activity, chronic activation of muscarinic or metabotropic glutamate receptors results in down-regulation of the IP3R1 expression level in neuroblastoma cells and cerebellar granule cells, respectively (27Wojcikiewicz R.J. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Simpson P.B. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2369-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, although many studies have examined the effects of various stimuli on IP3R1 expression, little is known about the effect of chronic activity blockade on IP3R1 expression in neurons. In this study, we examined the effect of chronic activity blockade on IP3R1 expression and its intracellular localization in cultured hippocampal neurons that have spontaneous synaptic activity (29Ogura A. Iijima T. Amano T. Kudo Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 78: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The results showed that chronic NMDAR blockade by 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) increases the IP3R1 expression level in hippocampal neurons. Transcription, protein synthesis, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity were also found to be necessary for APV-induced IP3R1 expression. In addition, chronic NMDAR blockade increased the number of neurons that released Ca2+ in response to the mGluR stimulation, and sensitivity to mGluR stimulation was correlated with the IP3R1 expression levels. Furthermore, we showed that neurons transiently overexpressing GFP-tagged IP3R1 become sensitive to mGluR and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation. Thus, these results indicate that chronic NMDAR blockade increases IP3R1 expression, which in turn enhances sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to mGluR stimulation. Control of the IP3R1 expression level, which was regulated by the extracellular environment, may be one of the important mechanisms in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Cell Culture—Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from 17-18-day embryonic ICR mice as described previously (30Rao A. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were dissociated by trypsin treatment and trituration, and were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 15-mm culture dishes at a density of 5.0-6.0 × 104 cells/cm2 in 1.0 ml of medium. After plating, cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2/air, and 400 μl of medium was replaced once a week. The composition of the medium is Neurobasal™ medium (Invitrogen) containing 2.0% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5% insulin-transferrin-selenium A (Invitrogen), 1 mm l-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. When medium was replaced, medium of the same composition except l-glutamine was used. Pharmacological Agents—d-APV (100 μm; Tocris Cookson Ltd., Bristol, United Kingdom), cycloheximide (5.0 μm; Calbiochem), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (25 μm; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 8-bromo-cAMP (10 μm; Calbiochem), KT5720 (2.0 μm; Calbiochem), and (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (100 μm, Tocris Cookson Ltd.). Immunocytochemistry and Quantification—Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min and subsequently in 100% methanol (-20 °C) for 10 min, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were blocked with 5% skim milk/PBS and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% skim milk/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Double-label immunostaining was done with combinations of rat anti-IP3R1 monoclonal (18A10, 5.0 μg/ml; see Ref. 31Maeda N. Niinobe M. Nakahira K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and mouse anti-MAP2 monoclonal (1:200, Sigma) antibodies. Generally, five view fields were blindly and randomly chosen from each piece of coverslip, and fluorescence images were taken and analyzed with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Spot model 1.3.0, Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) mounted on a Olympus BX50 using a custom-made software, TI Workbench. Neuronal somata were identified by MAP2 signal, fluorescence intensity of IP3R1 immunostaining of pixels corresponding to each soma was averaged, and background fluorescence was subtracted. Because absolute fluorescence intensity varied among different experiments, quantitative comparison of IP3R1 expression levels were always normalized by values of control cells treated in the same experiments if necessary. Western Blot Analysis—The hippocampal cell cultures were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 150 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The cell lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The homogenates were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, the membrane was probed with anti-IP3R1 (18A10, 1.0 μg/ml), mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibodies (1:5000, Sigma), or rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with PBS, the membrane was probed with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. To detect signals, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with AttoPhos substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned on FluorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were analyzed using ImageQuaNT software (version 4.1, Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of RNA and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from hippocampal cell cultures by using TRIzol reagent according to instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was prepared from the total RNA, using reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligonucleotide (dT) primers. PCR was performed using specific primers for IP3R1 isoform (forward, 5′-CGTGGATGTTCTACACAGACCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTTGAAGAACTTCTCTGATTTC-3′) (32Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The primers used for β-actin were as follows: forward, 5′-GGAAATCGTGCGTGACATCAAAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCGATCCACACAGAGTACTTGCGC-3′. After an initial cycle of 2 min at 94 °C, the reaction was cycled 30 times for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 70 s at 72 °C. We confirmed that the PCR fragments were exponentially amplified at least from 25 to 35 cycles (data not shown). For analysis, the PCR products were separated on 3.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and stained with ethidium bromide. We performed densitometry by scanning the gel on FluorImager and analyzed the band intensities using ImageQuaNT software. The IP3R1 mRNA levels were normalized relative to those of β-actin. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, extracted, and purified with the GeneClean kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA). Nucleotide sequencing was performed using a DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 377; PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Intracellular Ca2+ Imaging—The hippocampal neurons were grown on cover glass engraved with grids (CELLocate, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) coated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Nacalai Tesque) and treated with or without 100 μm APV for 7 days from 14 to 21 days in vitro (DIV). The neurons were loaded with 5 μm fura-2-AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 30 min at room temperature in recording solution containing (in mm): 115 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 20 Hepes, 10 glucose, 1 μm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4, washed once, and then kept in the recording solution in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Fura-2 fluorescence images were analyzed using an inverted microscope (IX50, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a video image analysis system (Argus-50/CA, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) with excitation filters at 340 ± 10 and 380 ± 10 nm, dichroic beam splitter at 400 nm, and a band pass emission filter at 520 and 550 nm. After taking basal fura-2 fluorescence images every 10 s for 2.5 min, the cells were stimulated with 50 mm KCl for 15 s to fill Ca2+ stores. After another 4.5 min, the cells were stimulated with 100 μm DHPG for 3 min. During these periods, fura-2 fluorescence images were taken every 5 s. After Ca2+ imaging, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton/PBS for 5 min, and subjected to immunostaining for IP3R1 and MAP-2 as described above. Scoring of IP3R1 staining intensity was done by two independent observers who were blind to the result of the DHPG sensitivity. The cells showing no IP3R1 staining intensity were counted as IP3R1-negative cells and indicated as (-); the cells showing saturated levels of staining (maximally stained cells) were considered as having strong staining intensity and indicated as (++); the cells labeled with intermediate intensity between these two categories were considered to be moderately stained and expressed as (+). Transfection of Hippocampal Neurons—Hipppocampal neurons (1 × 105/well) were transfected with GFP-IP3R1 or GFP expression vectors with calcium phosphate method as described previously (33Kohrmann M. Haubensak W. Hemraj I. Kaether C. Lessmann V.J. Kiebler M.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After 36 h, the neurons were subjected to Ca2+ imaging described above. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and were statistically evaluated by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Chronic NMDA Receptor Blockade Increased the IP3R1 Expression Level in Hippocampal Neurons—We cultured mouse embryonic hippocampal neurons and examined their level of IP3R1 expression and its intracellular distribution immunocytochemically with anti-IP3R1 and anti-MAP2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A (Control), individual neurons showed various levels of IP3R1 expression at 21 DIV in culture. In neurons that were intensely immunoreactive for IP3R1 (e.g. arrowhead in Fig. 1A), IP3R1 was predominantly localized in the cell body and proximal dendritic shafts in a diffuse punctate pattern, as reported previously (Fig. 1B, Control) (34Seymour-Laurent K.J. Barish M.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2592-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there were few such neurons, and the IP3R1 expression level was relatively low in most of the neurons in the control cultures. To examine the effect of chronic activity blockade on expression of IP3R1 and its intracellular localization, we exposed hippocampal neurons to 100 μm APV, an NMDAR antagonist, for the 7 days from 14 to 21 DIV. As shown in Fig. 1A, chronic exposure to APV increased the number of hippocampal neurons with intense IP3R1 immunoreactivity in their cell bodies (arrowheads in Fig. 1A, APV), but did not induce any apparent change in the intracellular localization of IP3R1; IP3R1 clusters remained diffused within the dendritic shafts and soma in a punctate pattern, and there was no apparent change in the size of IP3R1 clusters after APV exposure (Fig. 1B). Because IP3R1 immunoreactivity in the proximal dendritic shafts was similar in both the APV-treated neurons and control neurons, translocation of IP3R1 from dendrites to the cell body was unlikely to be the mechanism for the increase in IP3R1 intensity observed in the cell body (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Fig. 1C shows a histogram of the intensity of IP3R1 immunoreactivity in neuronal cell bodies (MAP2-positive cells), confirming the increased number of neurons with high IP3R1 immunoreactivity (arbitrary units, 9-20) in the APV-exposed neurons (black bar) compared with the control neurons (white bar). To further confirm the increase in IP3R1 expression level, we analyzed the amount of IP3R1 expression by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D, the IP3R1 expression level in the chronically APV-exposed neurons was clearly increased compared with the control cells, but there was no difference in expression level of β-actin and calreticulin between the groups. Quantitative analysis revealed that the IP3R1 protein level in APV-exposed neurons was 1.64 ± 0.34-fold higher than in the control cells (Control; n = 65 wells, APV; n = 24 wells, p < 0.01). Taken together, these results indicated that the chronic NMDAR blockade increased the IP3R1 expression level in hippocampal neurons. Time Course of the APV-induced Increase in IP3R1 Expression Level in Hippocampal Neurons—To examine the time course of the APV-induced increase in IP3R1 expression, as shown in Fig. 2A, we exposed hippocampal neurons to 100 μm APV for various times (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 14 days), and determined the IP3R1 expression level by Western blot analysis at 21 DIV. At days 1-5 of APV-treatment, there was no apparent change in IP3R1 expression level, except for slight decrease in IP3R1 expression at day 1 (Fig. 2B). Because NMDAR activation is known to increase the IP3R1 expression through L-type Ca2+ channel activation (26Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the slight decrease after 1 day of APV exposure was probably because of the suppression of basal NMDAR activity. After 6 days of APV exposure, however, the IP3R1 expression level clearly increased (Fig. 2, B and C), and the increase was observed until day 14. Thus, these results indicated that long term APV exposure, i.e. for more than 6 days, increases the IP3R1 expression level in hippocampal neurons. Transcription and Protein Synthesis Were Required for the APV-induced Increase in IP3R1 Expression—To assess the contribution of protein synthesis to the APV-induced increase in IP3R1 expression level, a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), was added to the APV-exposed cultures from 20 to 21 DIV, when the IP3R1 expression level had greatly increased (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, CHX significantly inhibited the APV-induced increase in IP3R1 expression and there was no significant difference in IP3R1 expression level between the APV+CHX-exposed and CHX-exposed neurons, indicating that IP3R1 degradation occurred to a similar extent irrespective of the presence of APV (Fig. 3, B and C). Next we examined the contribution of transcription of IP3R1 to the APV-induced increase in IP3R1 expression by measuring IP3R1 mRNA by RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared from cultured hippocampal cells exposed to and unexposed to APV for 7 days, and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using specific primers for IP3R1. As shown in Fig. 3D, the amount of IP3R1 mRNA in the APV-exposed neurons increased compared with the controls, whereas the β-actin mRNA level and the SERCA 2b mRNA level (data not shown) did not change significantly. Normalization of the amount of IP3R1 mRNA to that of β-actin revealed that the amount of IP3R1 mRNA had increased by 177 ± 34% in the APV-exposed neurons (n = 3, p < 0.02). These results demonstrated that long lasting NMDAR blockade increases the IP3R1 expression level through a mechanism involving transcription and protein synthesis rather than decreased IP3R1 degradation. Involvement of PKA Activity in the APV-induced IP3R1 Expression—Chronic NMDAR blockade has been shown to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (36Crump F.T. Dillman K.S. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of PKA activity in the APV-induced IP3R1 expression, we added a specific PKA inhibitor, KT5720, to the APV-exposed cells for the 24 h from 20 to 21 DIV (Fig. 4A). The result was complete abolition of the increase in IP3R1 expression by APV (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, activation of PKA by a mixture of IBMX (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase), and 8-bromo-cAMP, a membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP, for the 48 h from 19 to 21 DIV was sufficient for the increase in IP3R1 expression level (Fig. 4, C and D). The histograms of IP3R1 immunoreactivity in neuronal soma (MAP2-positive; Fig. 4B) clearly show a decreased population of cells with relatively high IP3R1 immunoreactivity (arbitrary units, 9-12) and an increased population of cells with relatively low IP3R1 immunoreactivity (arbitrary units, 1-3) among the APV+KT5720-exposed neurons compared with the APV-exposed neurons. These results demonstrated that the APV-induced increase in IP3R1 expression required PKA activity. APV-exposed Hippocampal Neurons with High IP3R1 Expression Are More Sensitive to mGluR Stimulation—To explore the functional effect of the increased IP3R1 expression on IP3-induced calcium release, we imaged Ca2+ signals evoked by application of 100 μm DHPG, an agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, in chronically APV-exposed and unexposed hippocampal neurons. To distinguish neurons from other types of cells and quantify the IP3R1 expression level, we immunostained neurons with anti-IP3R1 and anti-MAP2 antibodies after Ca2+ imaging and analyzed only the Ca2+ signals from MAP2-positive cells. Glial cells were also distinguished from neurons by the sustained shape of Ca2+ transients (data not shown; see Ref. 37Yoshida Y. Matsumoto N. Tsuchiya R. Morita M. Miyakawa H. Kudo Y. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 92: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the control cultures (Control), application of 100 μm DHPG did not evoke Ca2+ release in any of the hippocampal neurons except for transient Ca2+ release by two neurons (control: 0.6%, 2 of 353 MAP2-positive cells; Fig. 5), a finding that is consistent with the previous observations (37Yoshida Y. Matsumoto N. Tsuchiya R. Morita M. Miyakawa H. Kudo Y. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 92: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast to the control cells, however, some of the APV-exposed neurons responded to DHPG application and transiently released Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores (Fig. 5, lower panels). The number of DHPG-responding cells among the chronically APV-exposed neurons significantly increased by approximately 10 times compared with the unexposed control cells (APV: 6.9%, 31 of 448 MAP2-positive cells; Fig. 5). Although many strongly IP3R1-positive (++) neurons did not respond to the mGluR stimulation (e.g. neurons indicated by asterisks in Fig. 5, lower panel), there was a correlation between IP3R1expression level and sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to mGluR stimulation in the chronically APV-exposed neurons; only 3.6% (13 of 366) of the IP3R1-negative or weakly positive neurons (e.g. neurons with red and yellow-green arrows in Fig. 5, lower panel; - or +) responded to DHPG stimulation, whereas 22% (18 of 82) of strongly IP3R1-positive neurons (e.g. neurons with pink, orange, light blue, and blue arrowheads in Fig. 5, lower panel; ++) transiently released Ca2+ in response to mGluR stimulation. Thus, a"
https://openalex.org/W1986368424,"Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) is a well characterized activity in skeletal and cardiac muscles mediated by the ryanodine receptors. The present study demonstrates CICR in the non-excitable parotid acinar cells, which resembles the mechanism described in cardiac myocytes. Partial depletion of internal Ca2+ stores leads to a minimal activation of Ca2+ influx. Ca2+ influx through this pathway results in an explosive mobilization of Ca2+ from the majority of the stores by CICR. Thus, stimulation of parotid acinar cells in Ca2+-free medium with 0.5 μm carbachol releases ∼5% of the Ca2+ mobilizable by 1 mm carbachol. Addition of external Ca2+ induced the same Ca2+ release observed in maximally stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained by a short treatment with 2.5-10 μm cyclopiazonic acid, an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump. The Ca2+ release induced by the addition of external Ca2+ was largely independent of IP3Rs because it was reduced by only ∼30% by the inhibition of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors with caffeine or heparin. Measurements of Ca2+-activated outward current and [Ca2+]i suggested that most CICR triggered by Ca2+ influx occurred away from the plasma membrane. Measurement of the response to several concentrations of cyclopiazonic acid revealed that Ca2+ influx that regulates CICR is associated with a selective portion of the internal Ca2+ pool. The minimal activation of Ca2+ influx by partial store depletion was confirmed by the measurement of Mn2+ influx. Inhibition of Ca2+ influx with SKF96365 or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate prevented activation of CICR observed on addition of external Ca2+. These findings provide evidence for activation of CICR by Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells, demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Ca2+ influx in triggering CICR, and indicate that CICR in non-excitable cells resembles CICR in cardiac myocytes with the exception that in cardiac cells Ca2+ influx is mediated by voltage-regulated Ca2+ channels whereas in non-excitable cells Ca2+ influx is mediated by store-operated channels.

Ca2+ release from the ER is followed by activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ influx into the cells. Subsequently, the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase pump and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump remove Ca2+ from the cytosol to stabilize [Ca2+]i at a steady state that is determined by the relative activities of Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ extrusion (1Berridge M.J.

At physiological agonist concentrations, the Ca2+ signal is in the form of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). In most cells, but particularly in polarized cells, the Ca2+ signal initiates at discrete sites and proceeds as a propagating Ca2+ wave (3Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y.

The various features and the proteins that mediate each phase of the Ca2+ signal that depends on IP3-mediated Ca2+ release have been extensively studied in many cell types and are reasonably well understood. Another aspect of the Ca2+ signal that is poorly understood compared with IP3-mediated Ca2+ release is Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in non-excitable cells. CICR is mediated by the ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the function of which is well characterized in skeletal and cardiac muscles (8Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) where they play a central role in excitation-contraction coupling. The family of RyRs includes three isoforms that are thought to be expressed in a cell-specific manner: RyR1 is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, RyR2 is expressed primarily in cardiac muscle, and RyR3 is expressed ubiquitously (8Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The primary activator of RyRs in muscle cells is Ca2+. However, the source of the trigger pool of Ca2+ is cell-specific. In skeletal muscle, RyR1 directly interacts with the voltage-regulated L-type Ca2+ channel. The L-type channel functions as a voltage sensor that causes membrane depolarization to undergo a conformational change and activate RyR1. The initial Ca2+ released through RyR1 further activates RyR1 to result in the explosive Ca2+ release that mediates muscle contraction (8Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 9Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in cardiac muscle the L-type channel is not directly coupled to RyR2. Rather, the L-type channel is localized adjacent to RyR2. Membrane depolarization results in the activation of the L-type Ca2+ channel and Ca2+ influx. The incoming Ca2+ serves as the trigger to activate RyR2 in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and cause the explosive Ca2+ release and muscle contraction (8Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 10Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar). Accumulating molecular, biochemical, and functional evidence in recent years indicated that non-muscle cells (11Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), including secretory acinar cells (5Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L.

However, their function and mechanism of regulation in non-muscle cells remain elusive. There is good evidence that RyRs in non-muscle cells are activated by the nucleotide cADPR (16Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 17Galione A. Churchill G.C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In fact, activation of a Ca2+ signal by cADPR generally is accepted as evidence for the involvement of RyRs in generating the Ca2+ signal. Response to cADPR or the presence of RyRs was demonstrated in several secretory cells, including pancreatic acinar cells (12Zhang X. Wen J. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Lee B.

The proposed main function of RyRs in these cells was to facilitate the propagation of the luminal-to-basal Ca2+ wave (18Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H.

All models to explain the role of RyRs in non-muscle cells depict them to be sensitized to Ca2+ by cADPR but, notably, to be activated by Ca2+ released from the IP3 pool. No other pool of Ca2+ is considered to participate in the regulation or activation of RyRs in non-muscle cells. The present work re-examined this premise in parotid acinar cells that have a robust CICR activity. We report that Ca2+ influx through SOCs is critical for Ca2+ release in parotid acinar cells and suggest that CICR in non-muscle cells occurs in a mechanism similar to that in cardiac myocytes, except that in cardiac myocytes Ca2+ influx is mediated by the L-type Ca2+ channel whereas in non-muscle cells Ca2+ influx is mediated by SOCs. Materials—Cyclopiazonic acid and 1,4,5- and 2,4,5-IP3 were purchased from Alexis. Fura-2/AM was from Tef Labs (Austin, TX). 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and SKF96365 were from Calbiochem. Heparin was from Sigma. The standard bath solution A contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Ca2+ concentration in this solution was adjusted between 0.5-7.5 mm by the addition of CaCl2. Ca2+-free solution was prepared by the addition of 0.2 mm EGTA to solution A. Solution A was supplemented with 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to form the solution that was used for gland digestion and named PSA. Preparation of Parotid Acini and Single Acinar Cells—Mouse parotid acini and single cells were prepared as described (22Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, to prepare acini the parotid glands were washed with PSA and minced finely with dissection scissors. The minced tissue was transferred to a flask and suspended in PSA containing 3 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Applied Science). The flask was gassed with 100% O2 and capped. After 2 min of digestion at 37 °C, the tissue was partially dispersed by pipetteting with a 5-ml plastic pipette tip, and digestion continued for an additional 4-5 min. The digested tissue was washed with PSA, filtered through a 75-μm nylon mesh to remove the large clamps, and the acini were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 and kept on ice until use. To prepare single cells, mouse parotid glands were minced and washed once with Ca2+-free solution A. The minced tissue was incubated for 7 min at 37 °C with a solution containing 0.025% trypsin that was prepared by a 1:1 dilution of a trypsin/EDTA solution from Sigma with phosphate-buffered saline. Trypsin treatment was terminated by washing the cell with PSA containing 1.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the tissue was further digested for 20 min with 70 units/ml collagenase CLSPA (Worthington). The cells were washed with PSA and kept on ice until used. [Ca2+]i Imaging—[Ca2+]i was measured by imaging Fura-2-loaded parotid acini as detailed before (6Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J.

The Fura-2 fluorescence ratio was monitored at excitation wavelengths of 355 and 380 nm using a PTI image acquisition and analysis system. [Ca2+]i was determined from calibration of the signals by incubating the cells in medium containing 10 mm EGTA and 5 μm ionomycin and then medium containing ionomycin and 10 mm Ca2+ as detailed before (4Xu X.

To measure Mn2+ influx, cells in Ca2+-free medium were stimulated for 2.5 min and then exposed to medium containing the agonists and 0.5 mm Mn2+. Fura-2 fluorescence quench was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 mm. Results are given as the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Electrophysiology—The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to measure the Ca2+-activated Cl- or K+ current as a reporter of [Ca2+]i(5Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J.

The Ca2+-activated Cl- current was recorded at a holding potential of -60 mV, whereas the Ca2+-activated K+ current was recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV. The bath solution for current recording was solution A, and the pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.2 EGTA, 5 ATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with KOH) with or without cADPR and Heparin. Seals of 6-10 gigaohms were produced on the cell membrane, and the whole cell configuration was obtained by gentle suction or voltage pulses of 0.5 V for 0.3-1 ms. Recording started as soon as possible after establishing the whole cell configuration because the high concentrations of cADPR activated the current by rapidly releasing Ca2+ from internal stores. The patch clamp output (Axopatch-1B, Axon Instruments) was filtered at 20 Hz. Recording and analysis were performed with patch clamp 6 and a Digi-Data 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). Recordings were at room temperature. CICR in Parotid Acinar Cells—CICR has been demonstrated in many non-muscle cells, yet regulation of this mode of Ca2+ release is not fully understood. To study regulation of CICR, we selected the parotid acinar cells for two reasons. First, there is ample evidence for expression (12Zhang X. Wen J. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Wojcikiewicz R.J.

Second, as illustrated in Fig. 1, cADPR is capable of releasing the entire agonist-mobilizable Ca2+ pool. Thus, infusing parotid acinar cells with cADPR concentrations higher than 3 μm tended to induce broad oscillatory changes in the Ca2+-activated Cl- current (Fig. 1, C and D), a reporter of [Ca2+]i(5Lee M.G.

At a concentration of 1 μm cADPR induced either sporadic Ca2+ oscillations (3 cells) or a single broad peak (2 cells). Stimulation of cells infused with 10 μm or higher concentrations of cADPR with 1 mm carbachol resulted with a diminished response (4 cells). These results are similar to those found in submandibular acinar cells (5Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Hence, parotid acinar cells express RyRs mRNA and protein (12Zhang X. Wen J. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Lee B. Rubin R.P. Biochem.

Another indication of robust CICR activity in parotid acinar cells was apparent from measurement of [Ca2+]i. Fig. 1E shows that when cells bathed in medium containing 1 mm Ca2+ were maximally stimulated with 1 mm carbachol there were two events of [Ca2+]i increase, an abrupt immediate increase and a secondary increase marked by an arrow. Fig. 1F shows that removal of external Ca2+ resulted in the reduction of [Ca2+]i to basal levels. Re-addition of external Ca2+ caused a rapid [Ca2+]i increase with an overshoot. Such protocols generally are used to demonstrate the contribution of Ca2+ influx to the agonist-evoked Ca2+ signal. However, the rapid and large [Ca2+]i increase seen on the addition of external Ca2+ is not typical of Ca2+ influx through SOCs (see below also). The abundance of RyRs in parotid acinar cells raised the possibility that the rapid increase in [Ca2+]i is caused by activation of CICR. Two Events of Ca2+ Release—To clearly separate Ca2+ release and influx we measured the effect of extracellular Ca2+ on the Ca2+ signal evoked by carbachol. Fig. 2A shows that the removal of external Ca2+ reduced the extent and duration of the increase in [Ca2+]i. In the absence of external Ca2+, maximal stimulation increased [Ca2+]i from about 49 ± 6nm to only 186 ± 21 nm (n = 17). Subsequently, [Ca2+]i was rapidly reduced to the basal level such that the total amount of Ca2+ mobilized by the agonist (area under the curve) was reduced by nearly 90%. This indicates that in the absence of external Ca2+, and thus Ca2+ influx, agonist stimulation mobilizes only a fraction of the intracellular Ca2+ pool of parotid acinar cells. Ca2+ entry then was initiated by the addition of various concentrations of CaCl2 to the perfusion solution. Addition of 0.5 and 1.5 mm CaCl2 was followed by a slow [Ca2+]i increase. Once [Ca2+]i reached a certain level, an abrupt change in the rate on [Ca2+]i increase occurred (marked by an arrow), indicating a second event of Ca2+ release. The secondary Ca2+ release was very dramatic when the cells were exposed to an external CaCl2 concentration of 7.5 mm. Under these conditions [Ca2+]i increased to 435 ± 39 nm, which is approximately three times the level evoked by the agonist in the absence of external Ca2+ (n > 50 acini and >250 cells). Importantly, at the continued incubation with 7.5 mm Ca2+, the cells reduced [Ca2+]i to stabilize it at a plateau of about 165 ± 10 nm (n = 6) above resting levels. The response in Fig. 2A raised the question of whether 7.5 mm external Ca2+ increased [Ca2+]i primarily by the activation of CICR to release Ca2+ from internal stores or whether parotid acinar cells have a very robust Ca2+ influx that undergo partial desensitization/inactivation. This question can be addressed by complete depletion of the stores prior to the addition of external Ca2+. To do so, the cells were incubated with 100 μm of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) for about 20 min. Fig. 2B shows that addition of 7.5 mm external Ca2+ to such treated cells only slowly increased [Ca2+]i, and [Ca2+]i stabilized at ∼138 ± 11 nm (n = 5) above the resting level. In an additional protocol, cells stimulated with 1 mm carbachol were repeatedly and alternately exposed to 7.5 and 0 mm external CaCl2 until no explosive increase in Ca2+ was observed. Fig. 2C shows that the addition of 7.5 mm external Ca2+ could elicit several events of rapid, transient [Ca2+]i increases (2-3 in various experiments), after which the addition of 7.5 mm external Ca2+ resulted in a slow [Ca2+]i increase that by the fourth addition stabilized at 142 ± 16 nm (n = 8) above the resting level. It is evident that the type of signal illustrated in Fig. 2 and described below is likely caused by activation of CICR by Ca2+ entering the cells through the plasma membrane. This can be by activation of the RyRs and perhaps the IP3Rs because both are activated by Ca2+ (see below). Well characterized pharmacological agents that modify the activity of the RyRs in muscle cells are caffeine and ryanodine. However, in agreement with previous work in parotid acinar cells (26Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol.

Although previous work reported inhibition of cADPR-mediated Ca2+ release by ryanodine in parotid cells, all the effects were observed with microsomes (29Yamaki H. Morita K. Kitayama S. Imai Y.

Therefore, to determine the nature of the Ca2+ signal evoked by 7.5 mm external Ca2+, we proceeded to determine the role of Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx in this signal and then examined the contribution of RyRs and IP3Rs to the observed signal. Minimal Store Depletion Is Sufficient to Activate a Large Ca2+ Release—The next issue we addressed is the relationship between the extent of cell stimulation, Ca2+ release from internal stores, and the explosive [Ca2+]i increase evoked by 7.5 mm external Ca2+. For this, parotid acini were incubated in a Ca2+-free medium and stimulated with carbachol concentrations ranging from 0.1 μm to1mm. Two min later, the cells were exposed to media containing the same carbachol concentrations and 7.5 mm Ca2+. Remarkably, stimulating the cells with only 0.5 μm carbachol was sufficient to evoke the same [Ca2+]i increase by 7.5 mm external Ca2+ as that observed when the cells were stimulated with 1 mm carbachol (Fig. 3A). The concentration of carbachol sufficient to trigger the explosive [Ca2+]i increase by high external Ca2+ varied somewhat between experiments. When the cells were stimulated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1.5 μm carbachol, 7.5 mm Ca2+ induced the explosive [Ca2+]i increase in 1/9, 7/13 and 25/25 acini, respectively, and was the same as that induced by stimulated with 1"

We now show that the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death is dependent on a functional LXCXE-binding site in Rb, thereby suggesting that proteins that bind the LXCXE-binding site in Rb may regulate the anti-apoptotic activity of Rb. HDAC1, an LXCXE protein that plays a critical role in Rb-mediated transcription repression, abrogates the effect of Rb on E2F-1-induced cell death. In contrast, RF-Cp145, another LXCXE protein, cooperates with Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death. Both proteins exert their effect in an LXCXE-dependent manner. Rb regulates E2F-induced cell death by acting upstream of p73. Rb represses the p73 promoter. Our results further suggest a model in which Rb-E2F-1 complexes mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of Rb through active repression of target genes without recruiting HDAC1.

Our results further suggest a model in which Rb-E2F-1 complexes mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of Rb through active repression of target genes without recruiting HDAC1. The Rb tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in many kinds of tumors. Rb functions in part through interaction with E2F family of transcription factors. Rb represses the transcription of E2F-responsive genes by at least two mechanisms. Rb binds to E2F transcription factor family members such as E2F-1 and directly represses transcriptional activation by E2F. In addition, the Rb-E2F complex that forms at the promoter actively represses transcription by recruiting chromatin modeling enzymes (1Weintraub S.J. Prater C.A. Dean D.C.

The AB pocket residues 379–772 of Rb are highly conserved through evolution. The majority of germ line mutations found in hereditary retinoblastoma and most tumor-derived mutations in the Rb gene map to the AB pocket. Viral oncoproteins also bind to the AB pocket and inactivate Rb (20Templeton D.J. Park S.H. Lanier L. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These Rb mutants retain the ability to bind E2F, repress E2F-1-dependent transcription, and inhibit growth comparable with wild type Rb (26Chen T.-T. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell.

The transcription factor E2F-1 induces both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. E2F-1-induced cell death acts via two parallel pathways. In the p53-dependent pathway, E2F activates p19ARF transcription. p19ARF binds MDM2 and relieves p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation (28Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 29Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I.

This pathway is therefore impaired by inactivation of either the INK4a or the p53 locus. The second pathway is p53-independent and has been suggested to act via the p53-related gene p73 (30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). E2F-1 transactivates the p73 gene (31Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Disruption of p73 function impairs E2F-1-induced apoptosis in p53-/- cells (30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that activation of p73 is required for p53-independent E2F-1-induced cell death. We have previously shown that the LXCXE interaction is critical for the ability of Rb to inhibit cell death induced by a variety of DNA-damaging agents (14Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A.

Proteins that bind the LXCXE-binding site in Rb would be expected to regulate the anti-apoptotic activity of Rb. Indeed, we have shown that RF-Cp145, an LXCXE-containing protein, cooperates with Rb to mediate cell survival after DNA damage. In this paper we have investigated the mechanism of Rb-mediated inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death. We find that in contrast to the wild type Rb, which promotes cell survival, the LXCXE nonbinding N757F Rb mutant fails to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death. Unlike RF-Cp145, HDAC1, which also interacts with the LX-CXE-binding site in Rb, does not cooperate with Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death. In contrast, HDAC1 inhibits Rb-mediated cell survival, which is independent of its deacetylase activity but dependent on the IXCXE motif in HDAC1. Interestingly, Rb-E2F-1 complexes mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of Rb through active repression without recruiting HDAC1. Plasmids, Cell Culture, and Transfection—The mammalian expression vectors for wild type Rb, the N757F Rb mutant, RF-Cp145, BRG1, and HDAC1 have been described (14Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I.

The H141A HDAC1 mutant was generated by site-specific mutagenesis by standard methods, and the mutation was verified by sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the cDNA. The HDAC1 ΔIXCXE mutant has been described (7Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A.

The mammalian expression vectors of p73α, p73β, the p73 dominant negative mutant (p73 DNM) and point mutant of the p73 dominant negative mutant (p73 DNM L-P) were as described (30Irwin M. Marin M.C.

The mammalian expression vector of N-terminal DNA-binding domain of E2F-1 (1–368) and the chimeric E2F-1/Rb protein (N-terminal DNA-binding domain of E2F-1 (1–368), and the pocket domain of Rb (379–792)) have been described (2Sellers W.R.

The N757F mutant of the E2F-1/Rb chimeric protein was generated by PCR, and its sequence was verified by sequencing. C33A cells (Rb null human cervical carcinoma) from ATCC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C33A cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate transfection method. The cells co-transfected with puroB-ABE vector (where indicated) were selected with 2.5 μg/ml of puromycin for 3 days as described previously (14Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H.

Survival Assay—The cells were transfected with E2F and other vectors. The calcium phosphate precipitates were washed off 24 h later, the cells were washed, and fresh medium was added, and cell survival was determined 17 h later. Cell survival was measured 17 h after UV irradiation. In all survival assays, the cells were co-transfected with β-galactosidase expression vector. The cells were then fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde and incubated for 12 h in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; 1 mg/ml) to detect β-galactosidase activity as described (14Pennaneach V.

The relative number of surviving cells in the presence of the appropriate transfected vector was determined by counting the number of blue cells in >200 nonoverlapping fields in the presence or absence of transfected E2F-1. We compared the number of surviving cells in the absence or presence of E2F-1 for each transfection condition to determine the percentage of survival (Supplementary Figure III). The data shown (means ± S.D.) are derived from five different experiments done at different times. Antibodies, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Anti-pRb antibody (IF-8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA 1The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin. antibody (BabCo), anti-E2F-1 antibody (Santa Cruz), and a polyclonal Rb specific antibody 851 (33Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) were used. Whole cell extracts were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. The proteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and detected by immunoblotting using the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The LXCXE-binding Site in Rb Is Essential for Rb-mediated Inhibition of E2F-1-induced Cell Death—To investigate the role of the LXCXE-binding site in Rb in regulating E2F-1-dependent cell death, we utilized the β-galactosidase assay (14Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this assay, the cells are co-transfected with a vector expressing β-galactosidase, and the percentage of surviving β-galactosidase-positive cells (blue cells) is determined (Fig. 1D). We compared the number of surviving cells in the absence or presence of E2F-1 for each transfection condition to determine the percentage of survival. The data shown (means ± S.D.) are derived from five different experiments done at different times. Transfection of the Rb-deficient C33A cell line with vectors expressing E2F-1 induces cell death. Increasing amounts of wild type Rb inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the LXCXE nonbinding N757F Rb mutant (hereafter referred to as Rb N757F mutant) fails to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death (Fig. 1A). Increasing amounts of E2F-1 were also less efficient at inducing cell death in the presence of Rb as compared with the Rb N757F mutant (Fig. 1B). The selective inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death by wild type Rb but not the Rb N757F mutant is not due to an effect on E2F-1 protein levels (Fig. 1C). Both wild type Rb and the Rb N757F mutant stabilize E2F-1 protein levels with similar efficacy (Fig. 1C) as shown previously (34Campanero M.R. Flemington E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that E2F-1-induced cell death in p53 -/- cells is mediated in a p73-dependent manner (30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Because C33A cells lack p53, we determined whether Rb inhibits E2F-1-induced cell death by regulating the ability of p73 to induce cell death. We first determined whether E2F-1-induced cell death in C33A cells is p73-dependent. We used a dominant negative mutant of p73 (p73 DNM) that selectively inhibits p73-mediated transactivation but not p53-dependent transactivation (30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This p73 DNM inhibited E2F-1-induced cell death in C33A cells (Fig. 2A). A point mutant of the p73 dominant negative mutant (p73 DNM L-P) had no effect on E2F-1-induced cell death in C33A cells (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death by p73 DNM is not due to its effect on E2F-1 protein levels (Fig. 2D). Because p73 has been shown to induce cell death (30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), we determined whether Rb inhibits p73α- or p73β-induced cell death. Rb did not inhibit p73α-induced (Fig. 2B) or p73β-induced (Fig. 2C) cell death in C33A cells. Rb had no effect on p73 protein levels (Fig. 2E). Because E2F-1 activates the p73 promoter (Ref. 30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Effect of HDAC1, BRG1, and RF-Cp145 on Rb-mediated Inhibition of E2F-induced Cell Death—Our demonstration that a functional LXCXE-binding site is required for Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death prompted us to investigate whether cellular LXCXE proteins such as HDAC1 (7Magnaghi-Jaulin L.

HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, contains an LXCXE motif that is essential to bind and cooperate with Rb in mediating optimal transcriptional repression of promoters containing E2F-binding sites (7Magnaghi-Jaulin L.

BRG1, a member of the SW12/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling ATPases contains an LXCXE motif, binds Rb (4Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

The large subunit of RF-C (RF-Cp145) enhances cell survival after DNA damage in Rb null cells in a strict Rb- and LXCXE-dependent manner (14Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H.

C33A cells, in addition to lacking Rb, lack BRG1 and functional Rb-HDAC1 complexes and have been used to clarify the role of BRG1 and HDAC1 in Rb function (4Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). RF-Cp145, the large subunit of RF-C, enhances the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In the absence of Rb, RF-Cp145 by itself was unable to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death (Fig. 3A), thus showing that RF-Cp145 enhances cell survival only in the presence of Rb. BRG1 on the other hand had no significant effect in either enhancing or inhibiting the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death (Fig. 3A). BRG1 also had no effect on E2F-1-induced cell death in the absence of Rb (Fig. 3A). In contrast, HDAC1 abrogates the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death in a dose-dependent fashion but had no effect on E2F-1-induced cell death in the absence of Rb (Fig. 3A). BRG1, HDAC1, and RF-Cp145 had no effect on E2F-1 or Rb protein levels (Fig. 3B). These data show that the three LXCXE containing cellular proteins we tested had distinct effects on Rb-mediated inhibition of E2F-1-induced apoptosis. We then determined whether these distinct effects of LXCXE-containing cellular proteins on Rb-mediated inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death was due to their effect on transcriptional repression. Because E2F-1-induced cell death is p73-dependent (Fig. 2A), we used the p73 promoter (-883 to +77) driving the expression of a luciferase reporter to monitor repression for these studies. This p73 promoter has been used to show that E2F activates the p73 promoter (30Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). As expected Rb repressed p73 promoter activity (Fig. 2F). We find that RF-Cp145 cooperates with Rb to mediate transcriptional repression, whereas HDAC1 does not (Fig. 2F). We find that RF-Cp145 has no effect on reporter activity in the absence of Rb (Fig. 2F, right panel). These results suggest that the effects of HDAC1 and RF-Cp145 on cell death are probably mediated via effects on Rb-mediated transcriptional repression. HDAC1 Inhibits the Ability of Rb to Promote Cell Survival in a LXCXE Motif-dependent Manner—To further investigate the effect of HDAC1 on cell death, we compared the ability of wild type HDAC1 and its deacetylase mutant to abrogate Rb mediated inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death in C33A cells. The removal of acetyl groups from the tails of histone octamers by HDAC1 facilitates condensation of nucleosomes into chromatin, which in turn blocks access of transcription factors, leading to gene repression. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the HDAC1 active site has been resolved (38Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Based on these studies the H141A HDAC1 mutant (H141A) was shown to lack deacetylase activity (39Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We find that both wild type HDAC1 and the H141A HDAC1 deacetylase mutant are equally effective at abrogating the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-mediated cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). The ability of HDAC1 to regulate Rb-mediated inhibition of E2F1-induced cell death is therefore not dependent on its catalytic activity. We next determined whether the IXCXE motif in HDAC1 is required for HDAC1 to abrogate the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F1-induced apoptosis. An HDAC1 mutant in which the IXCXE motif has been deleted (termed HDAC1 ΔIXCXE mutant) has a dramatically reduced ability to bind Rb (7Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the ability of wild type HDAC1 with the HDAC1 ΔIXCXE mutant to abrogate Rb-mediated inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death. We find that although wild type HDAC1 abrogates the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death, the HDAC1 ΔIXCXE mutant does not (Fig. 4A). We show that RF-Cp145 cooperates with Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death (Fig. 3). We therefore ascertained whether HDAC1 also abrogates the ability of Rb+RF-p145 to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death. Indeed both wild type HDAC1 and the H141A HDAC1 mutant abrogate the ability of Rb+RF-Cp145 to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the HDAC1 ΔIXCXE mutant does not influence cell survival by Rb+RF-Cp145 (Fig. 4A). From these studies we conclude that the IXCXE motif in HDAC1 is required for HDAC1 to abrogate the ability of Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death. RF-Cp145 Enhances Rb-mediated Inhibition of E2F-induced Death in a LXCXE Motif- and ATPase-dependent Manner—We find that RF-Cp145 did not inhibit E2F-1-induced death in the absence of transfected Rb in Rb -/- C33A cells but enhances in a dose-dependent manner the ability of co-transfected Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). RF-Cp145 cotransfected with Rb N757F mutant, does not inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death (Fig. 5). The LXGXK RF-Cp145 mutant, in which the LXCXE motif has been mutated to LXGXK, was unable to cooperate with Rb to inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death (Fig. 5). The LXGXK RF-Cp145 mutant as expected also did not inhibit E2F-1-induced cell death in the absence of co-transfected Rb or the Rb N757F mutant (Fig. 5). These results suggest that both the LXCXE motif in RF-Cp145 and the LXCXE-binding site in Rb are required for inhibition of E2F-1-induced cell death. The RF-C complex has been known to have ATPase activity that is stimulated in the presence of other co-factors like DNA (40Cai J. Gibbs E. Uhlmann F. Phillips B. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J.

The ability to assemble recombinant RF-C subunits in vitro into active RF-C complexes has allowed a characterization of mutants that selectively affect ATPase activity of RF-C. The RF-Cp145 Lys657 residue, which maps to the conserved Walker A motif, is essential for the ATPase activity of the RF-C complex (41Cai J. Yao N. Gibbs E. Finkelstein J. Phillips B. O'Donnell M.
