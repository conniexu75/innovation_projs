https://openalex.org/W1968006472,"Small, DNA-containing particles were separated from preparations of a simian adenovirus. These particles differed antigenically from the adenovirus. Replication of the particles in cell cultures was obtained only when theywere inoculated simultaneously with adenoviruses. This suggests that these adenovirus-associated particles behave as defective viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2004426798,"A quotidian-type parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, has been found as a ndtural infection in man. The infection was acquired by a white male during a short visit to peninsular Malaysia. This occurrence constitutes the first proof that simian malaria is a true zoonosis."
https://openalex.org/W1977780224,"Drosophila pachea, which breeds only in the stems of senita cactus (Lophocereus schottii) throughout the Sonoran Desert, requires the cactus as a dietary supplement when reared on laboratory media. Delta(7)-Stigmasten-3beta-ol, isolated from the cactus or synthesized, can replace the cactus in the diet of flies reared nonaseptically or axenically. Delta(7)-Cholesten-3beta-ol and Delta(5, 7)-cholestadien-3beta-ol could be substituted for the cactus sterol; Delta(5, 7)-stigmastadien-3beta-ol produced infertile females. Cholesterol, 4alpha-methyl-Delta(7)-cholesten-3beta3-ol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol, and Delta(7)-ergosten- 3beta-ol did not support larval growth."

https://openalex.org/W2048906963,"Mouse mammary tissue grown in primary cell culture did not display specialized characteristics of the parent tissue. When implanted into gland-free mammary fat pads, not only did some of these cultured cells grow and produce normal mammary outgrowths, but some of the outgrowths formed glands which displayed a variety of culture-induced abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2095560369,"Rats were trained in a Skinner box to approach the food cup when a distinct click was sounded. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from the brains of these rats and injected into untrained rats. The untrained rats then manifested a significant tendency (as compared with controls) to approach the food cup when the click, unaccompanied by food, was presented."

https://openalex.org/W2066650439,"Ants of different sexes and castes produce different odorous compounds. In Pheidole fallax Mayr, soldier ants produce an indole base, probably skatole, whereas minor workers produce a trial substance, Males of certain species of Lasius and Acanthomyops produce mixtures of terpenes and an indole base. These mixtures are discharged during mating pheromones. The terpene mixtures are qualitatively similar, but each species produces a blend of distinctive proportions. Citronellol and 2,6-dimethyl-5-hepten-1-ol have been identified in the mixtures by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2017545711,"The metabolism of (131)I-labeled thyroxine-binding prealbumin was studied in four normal subjects and in five hospitalized patients with nonthyroidal disease. The average half-time of total-body thyroxine-binding prealbumin, calculated on the basis of a two-compartmental model, was 1.90 daysin normal subjects. Increased fractional degradation or diminished synthesis, or both, contributed to the depression of thyroxine-binding prealbumin in the serum of patients with nonthyroidal disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2000904192,"The pineal gland of the rat shows a circadian rhythm in its serotonin content, the amount of serotonin decreasing at night. This decrease can be prevented by inhibiting the action of monoamine oxidase. Reserpine abolishes the circadian rhythm in pineal serotonin in the same manner as does interruption of the sympathetic nervous connections of the central nervous system and the pineal gland. These observations suggest that circadian changes in release and binding of serotonin may occur in the pineal gland, and that a central mechanism in which monoamines participate may control the circadian pineal-serotonin rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2022727174,"Mitotic figures from the bone marrow of three parthenogenetic species of Cnemidophorus (whiptail lizards) exhibit chromosome numbers in the triploid range. The species are C. velox with 68 chromosomes, C. tesselatus with 69, and C. exsanguis with 70. A fourth parthenogenetic species, C. perplexus, has 46 chromosomes, the same number as the bisexual subspecies C. tigris septentrionalis."

https://openalex.org/W2036935994,"Transient inhibition of DNA synthesis immediately after infection of cells with Rous sarcoma virus prevents subsequent morphological transformationof the cells. Inhibition of DNA synthesis for an identical period before infection, or later in the course of infection, has only slight effect on transformation. Thus DNA synthesis is a specific requirement in the transformation of cells by Rous sarcoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W2010181721,It is well known that electrical stimulation in portions of the lateral hypothalamic area is positively reinforcing and induces eating in satiated rats. We have found that continuous stimulation of this kind can also motivate satiated and previously untrained rats to learn the location of food in a T-maze. Efficient acquisition and reversal of discriminations for food indicate that lateral hypothalamic stimulation exerts motivational effects which are functionally equivalent to those of food deprivation.
https://openalex.org/W2041862122,"Cycasin, methylazoxy-methanol-beta-glucoside, a carcinogenic compound that occurs naturally in cycad plants, induces chromosome aberrations in the root-tip cells of Allium cepa. Germination and growth in an aqueous solution of cycasin at a concentration of only 3 percent of that found in Cycas circinalis induced as many aberrations in chromosomes as did about 200 roentgens of gamma irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2080972898,Burtt and Catton suggested that insects can resolve striped patterns finer than the theoretical limit set by the small diameter (30 microns) of the ommatidial lenslets. Events at the edges of the window behind which the patterns are moved explain these experiments without transgressing diffraction limitations. This interpretation leads to successful quantitative predictions of the effects of changing the boundary conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1988370666,Polyribosomes can be rapidly extracted from Escherichia coli by sequential passage of the cells through solutions of a chelating agent and lysozyme in a centrifugal field. Biosynthesis of protein in whole cells and in a cell-free system occurs almost exclusively in the polyribosomes.
https://openalex.org/W2045423862,"The clearance from the plasma of purified lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme No. 5, which is increased in the plasma of mice infected with Riley virus, is impaired during the infection. That the clearance of purified isoenzyme No. 1 is unchanged by infection with Riley virus provides an explanation of why only the lactate dehydrogenase-5 isoenzyme activity is elevated in the plasma of infected mice."

https://openalex.org/W2081092027,"Rhythmic changes occur in the activities of enzymes in both the neurons and neuroglia isolated from the caudal part of the reticular formation of rabbits killed during sleep and wakefulness. During sleep, enzyme activity is high in the neurons and low in the glia; during wakefulness, this situation is reversed. In the oral part of the reticular formation rhythmic enzyme changes occur only in the neurons. No rhythmic changes occur in the hypoglossal and trigeminal mesencephalic neurons and glia. These findings indicate that the caudal part of the reticular formation reflects in metabolic changes the biological clock behind the sleep rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W1966910651,"Movement of a grating behind a fixed aperture can be detected by human subjects when the grating is well below the diffraction limit of the pupil and below acuity measured with stationary gratings. With movement one sees a flicker or ripple at the edges, and it is argued that these edge effects lead to spurious estimates of optical resolution in insects and man."
https://openalex.org/W2054905162,"White blood cell preparations from patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia have more S-adenosylmethionine, an important metabolic intermediate, than normal peripheral white cells or thoracic-duct lymphocytes. The previously reported elevation of cyanocobalamine (vitamin B(l2)) in the serum of patients with this disease is corroborated. The possible usefulness of methylation antimetabolites in cancer chemotherapy is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2025089861,"After administration of pregnenolone-4-C(14) to Holarrhena floribunda leaves, radioactive progesterone was isolated and purified to constant specific activity by chromatography, conversion to a derivative, and recrystallization. The result suggests that the biogenetic sequence leading to progesterone is the same in plants as in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2072406686,"Goldfish were taught to press a lever for food reinforcement and were placed on a 1-minute fixed-interval schedule. They developed the characteristic temporal discrimination (scalloping) seen in rats and pigeons. There was no change in their relative response rate through the 1-minute interval when ambient temperature was decreased by 10 degrees C. This 10 degrees C temperature drop, which approximately halves the metabolic rate, approximately halved the absolute response rate. These results indicate that a temporal discrimination can be established in the goldfish, and suggest that discriminations of short intervals in fish are not dependent on a mechanism tied directly to metabolic rate."
https://openalex.org/W2080798143,"A number of pteridine derivatives stimulate photosynthetic phosphorylation in spinach chloroplasts. In general, tetrahydro or dihydro compounds are highly active, as is one aromatic, naturally occurring compound, biopterin. The physiological characteristics of this photosynthetic phosphorylation are the same as those described for phosphodoxin. A pteridine-containing fraction from spinach, with the same R(F) value as phosphodoxin, is also active."
https://openalex.org/W2086596627,"Long-term monolayer cultures of mouse thymus and spleen cells, chronically infected with Rauscher virus, showed only a very attenuated leukemia-producing capacity. Material from these cultures prepared from normal BALB/ c mouse tissue was used to immunize isologous mice against subsequent challenge with fully active Rauscher virus. The centrifuged supernatant of the culture had some immunizing properties. However, the most efficient protectionwas obtained when cell suspensions from these cultures were used in the form of a series of three intraperitoneal and intramuscular injections and onebooster injection."
https://openalex.org/W2073084300,"When eleven brands of cigarettes were smoked in a standardized manner, differences in the polonium-210 content of various brands were found. The differences were not directly related to the presence of a filter or to the construction of the filter, but were related to the amount of particulate matter in the mainstream smoke."

https://openalex.org/W2016657861,"Mice were subjected to x-rays (950 roentgens) and injected with isogeneic (isologous) or allogeneic (homnologous) bone marrow. Six to 8 months later these chimeras were injected with Salmonella typhi flagellar antigen, and the formation of antibodies resistant and sensitive to destruction by treatment in vitro with 2-mercaptoethanol was determined. The allogeneic chimeras showed almost normal amounts of serumn antibody after a third injection of antigen but a relative defect in their ability to synthesize antibody resistant to 2-mercaptoethanol. Apparently control of antibody formation becomes abnormal in the presence of the immunologic tolerance existing between the host and the foreign hematopoietic graft."
https://openalex.org/W2073728966,"Unanesthetized cats with electrodes permanently implanted along the auditory pathway were presented first with suistained "" white"" noise stimuli and then with the same noise paired with subcutaneous electric shocks. Pairing noise with shock decreased both background and noise-evoked activity inthe inferior colliculus, and, in some cats, also in the cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, and at the round window. No changes occurred in medial geniculate or auditory cortex recordings. The effects in the inferior colliculusdo not depend on changes in the degree of arousal of the animal, on change in the medullary auditory areas, or on the actions of the middle-ear muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2047231631,Diploid cells of the human and canine renal cortex can be isolated by newly developed techniques for organ culture. Some of these cells have abundant Bowie's positive granules. Bioassays for renin activity have shown that these granular cells can synthesize considerable amounts of renin in vitro. These investigations provide a model for studying the production of renin at cellular level.

https://openalex.org/W2058228361,"An albino mutant of Blepharisma intermedium is much more sensitive (on the basis of time to regeneration of transected cells) to short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation than the wild type (containing a reddish pigment) from which the mutant derived. In the wild type, absorption of ultraviolet light by the pigment present in the outer surface of the cell presumably reduces the intensity of the radiation impinging on the vulnerable interior."
https://openalex.org/W2081893323,"An agent, serologically identical to a Wyeomyia virus obtained from mosquitoes, was isolated from a worker on the inter-American highway project in Darien Province in eastern Panama. He experienced a mild febrile illness with recovery. A significant rise in anttibody titer to this virus was demonstrated in his serum during convalescence. Neutralizing antibodies to this newly isolated strain were found in 10 of 59 blood samples from inhabitants of Darien Province. The virus is designated the Darien strain."
https://openalex.org/W2082540156,"The oscillation in firing rate of units of the lateral geniculate body in response to stimulation with sine-wave light was studied in unanesthetized cats with the brainstem sectioned immediately in front of the fifth nerve (pretrigeminal preparation). During wakefulness, as indicated by behavior and by electroencephalograms, the time course of the oscillation in firing rate followed very closely the change in intensity of sine-wave light. During synchronized sleep there was no such relationship."

https://openalex.org/W1982257894,"Substrate induction of tryptophan pyrrolase in the liver of rats is inhibited by prior treatment of very young rats with tryptophan. This inhibition seems analogous to immunological tolerance, which can be produced by prior treatment with the antigen. The findings prowide support for an analogy between mechanisms of adaptive enzyme synthesis and those involved in adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1968905510,"The action of genes at the agouti locus in rats is similar to that of genes at the same locus in mice-the color phenotype of hairs is determined by the operation of agouti-locus alleles in the follicle, rather than in the melanocytes. Hairs produced by mouse skin growing on partially tolerant infant rat hosts show that rat melanocytes also respond to the agouti-locus genotype of mouse follicles. This constitutes the first example in vivo of the behavior of a cell of one species being completely determined by the genotype of an alien host species."
