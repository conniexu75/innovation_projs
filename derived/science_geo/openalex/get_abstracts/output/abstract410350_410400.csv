https://openalex.org/W2068048456,"Photoluminescence blinking--random switching between states of high (ON) and low (OFF) emissivities--is a universal property of molecular emitters found in dyes, polymers, biological molecules and artificial nanostructures such as nanocrystal quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and nanowires. For the past 15 years, colloidal nanocrystals have been used as a model system to study this phenomenon. The occurrence of OFF periods in nanocrystal emission has been commonly attributed to the presence of an additional charge, which leads to photoluminescence quenching by non-radiative recombination (the Auger mechanism). However, this 'charging' model was recently challenged in several reports. Here we report time-resolved photoluminescence studies of individual nanocrystal quantum dots performed while electrochemically controlling the degree of their charging, with the goal of clarifying the role of charging in blinking. We find that two distinct types of blinking are possible: conventional (A-type) blinking due to charging and discharging of the nanocrystal core, in which lower photoluminescence intensities correlate with shorter photoluminescence lifetimes; and a second sort (B-type), in which large changes in the emission intensity are not accompanied by significant changes in emission dynamics. We attribute B-type blinking to charge fluctuations in the electron-accepting surface sites. When unoccupied, these sites intercept 'hot' electrons before they relax into emitting core states. Both blinking mechanisms can be electrochemically controlled and completely suppressed by application of an appropriate potential."

Soluble amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers cause cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the relationship between oligomers, oxidative stress, and their localization during disease progression is uncertain. Our previous study demonstrated that mice deficient in cytoplasmic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD, SOD1) have features of drusen formation, a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration (Imamura, Y., Noda, S., Hashizume, K., Shinoda, K., Yamaguchi, M., Uchiyama, S., Shimizu, T., Mizushima, Y., Shirasawa, T., and Tsubota, K. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 11282–11287). Amyloid assembly has been implicated as a common mechanism of plaque and drusen formation. Here, we show that Sod1 deficiency in an amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing mouse model (AD mouse, Tg2576) accelerated Aβ oligomerization and memory impairment as compared with control AD mouse and that these phenomena were basically mediated by oxidative damage. The increased plaque and neuronal inflammation were accompanied by the generation of Nϵ-carboxymethyl lysine in advanced glycation end products, a rapid marker of oxidative damage, induced by Sod1 gene-dependent reduction. The Sod1 deletion also caused Tau phosphorylation and the lower levels of synaptophysin. Furthermore, the levels of SOD1 were significantly decreased in human AD patients rather than non-AD age-matched individuals, but mitochondrial SOD (Mn-SOD, SOD2) and extracellular SOD (CuZn-SOD, SOD3) were not. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic superoxide radical plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Activation of Sod1 may be a therapeutic strategy for the inhibition of AD progression.

Aβ42 plays a more important role in the pathogenesis of AD than Aβ40 because of its greater aggregation propensity and higher neurotoxicity (3Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3885) Google Scholar).

Many defensive systems protect mammals from oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species, including superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is one of the major antioxidant enzymes that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide (10Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). SOD consists of three isozymes: copper/zinc SOD (CuZn-SOD, SOD1), which is localized in the cytosol, nucleus, and intermembrane space of mitochondria; manganese SOD (Mn-SOD, SOD2), which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix; extracellular SOD (EC-SOD, SOD3), which is also a complex of Cu and Zn. Our previous investigation proposed that Sod1-deficient (Sod1−/−) mice showed increased drusen formation, which is a typical characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (11Imamura Y. Noda S. Hashizume K. Shinoda K. Yamaguchi M. Uchiyama S. Shimizu T. Mizushima Y. Shirasawa T. Tsubota K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. Reprod. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). The suggestion that drusen deposits contain nonfibrillar amyloid oligomers (16Luibl V. Isas J.M. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Langen R. Chen J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) led us to predict the existence of a common mechanism in AD and AMD involving cytoplasmic oxidative damage. Recently, there have been reports on the involvement of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD; transgenic mouse models of AD were crossed with Sod2+/−, resulting in increased plaque formation (17Li F. Calingasan N.Y. Yu F. Mauck W.M. Toidze M. Almeida C.G. Takahashi R.H. Carlson G.A. Flint Beal M. Lin M.T. Gouras G.K. J.

PLoS One. 2007; 2: e536Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but no effects on Aβ oligomerization were reported. Information on the contribution of SOD1 to Aβ oligomer formation and the localization is, therefore, required to further elucidate the role of cytoplasmic superoxide in the mechanism of AD. To achieve this we generated an AD model mouse lacking Sod1 and analyzed it for AD-like pathology. This report shows that cytoplasmic SOD reduction induced Aβ oligomerization, causing cognitive impairment, and that neuronal dysfunction is mediated by oxidative damage of brain tissues. Consistent with the animal studies, the levels of SOD1, but not those of SOD2 or SOD3, were significantly decreased in the brains of human AD subjects compared with non-AD individuals, thereby highlighting a potential causative role for SOD1-mediated Aβ oligomerization in the pathogenesis of AD. Tg2576 (20Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar) expressing the human APP (hAPP, C57BL6/SJL background) possessing the Swedish mutation shows the “early” (cognitive impairment) and “late” phenotypes (plaque formation) of AD (21Jacobsen J.S. Wu C.C. Redwine J.M. Comery T.A. Arias R. Bowlby M. Martone R. Morrison J.H. Pangalos M.N. Reinhart P.H. Bloom F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5161-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We utilized Tg2576 (Taconic) because it is possible to evaluate each effect of SOD1 deletion on the cognitive function or amyloid depositions. Sod1−/− mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were backcrossed with C57BL/6NCrSlc mice for 5 or 6 generations. To generate hAPP/Sod1+/− mice, we bred hAPP/Sod1+/+ mice with Sod1−/− mice. Studies were conducted on sibling offspring from hAPP/Sod1+/− × Sod1+/− matings, giving hAPP/Sod1−/− mice together with the corresponding littermate controls (hAPP/Sod1+/−, hAPP/Sod1+/+, Sod1−/−, Sod1+/−, and Sod1+/+). All experiments were performed at two age points; a young age (6–8 months old) and old age groups (15–17 months old), in which groups consisted of sex-balanced females and males. Mice were genotyped by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tail tip as reported previously (13Murakami K. Inagaki J. Saito M. Ikeda Y. Tsuda C. Noda Y. Kawakami S. Shirasawa T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle and with ad libitum access to food and water. The mice were maintained and studied according to protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. All experiments were performed by examiners blinded to the genotypes of the mice. The frontal lobes of the brains of AD (6 female, 4 male) and non-AD (5 female, 5 male) individuals (Table 1) were used in the experiment with written informed consent obtained from the patients' families, and the experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology and Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital. The National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria (modified) were adopted for the diagnosis of AD (22Murayama S. Saito Y. Neuropathology. 2004; 24: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The normal controls were defined using clinical documentation of unimpaired cognition as well as minimal senile changes consisting of Braak's neurofibrillary tangle stage equal to or less than II, senile plaque stage equal to or less than A, and a lack of any vascular, inflammatory, or traumatic changes or tumors.TABLE 1Summary of neuropathological diagnosis of human materialsCaseAgeSexCDRNFTSPNP diagnosis186F3VCAD283F3VCAD387F3VCAD474M0VCAD582F1VCAD684M3VCAD786F1VCAD881M2VICAD987M3VICAD1091F1VCAD1179M0.5II0Non-AD1281M0I0Non-AD1382M0IANon-AD1478FN/AIANon-AD1583MN/AI0Non-AD1680F0II0Non-AD1777F0I0Non-AD1879FN/AI0Non-AD1982FN/AIIANon-AD2080M0IIANon-AD Open table in a new tab The procedure was based on the method of previous works (23Murakami K.

In brief, human brain tissue (0.1–0.2 g) was homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm TBS (Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mm NaCl, a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Diagnostics) supplemented with 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The animal brain was then removed, split into two hemispheres, and one-half was frozen on liquid nitrogen. The other hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical study. Indeed, there are the differences of distribution for plaque depositions in several hAPP transgenic mice. In preliminary experiments, we investigated the variance of plaque distribution using several lines (Tg2576 (20Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar), J20 (28Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. J.

(28Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also previously described. Therefore, we carried out the biochemical analysis using the whole brain lysates of mice crossed with Tg2576. The mouse brain (∼250 mg) was homogenized in 3 volumes (w/v) of TBS buffer as described above, and homogenates were centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C using an Optima TL ultracentrifuge and a TLA100.4 rotor to give the supernatant (TBS-soluble) and pellet (TBS-insoluble) fractions. The pellet was then dissolved by sonication in 70% formic acid containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. The solubilized pellet was centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was neutralized with 1 m Tris base of pH 11 (1:20, v:v) as an insoluble fraction (formic acid-soluble). The total protein concentration of the brain was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The fractions (2 μg/μl) were subjected to Western blotting using 10–20% Tricine gel (for Aβ, Invitrogen) or 10% Bis-Tris gel (for other proteins, Invitrogen) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (0.2 μm pore size, Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 2.5% skimmed milk) and incubated with the primary antibody (anti-Aβ antibody (6E10) 1:1000 (Signet); anti-N-terminal Aβ (82E1), 1:100 (Immuno-Biological Laboratories (IBL), Gunma, Japan); anti-synaptophysin, 1:200 (Sigma); anti-total Tau, 1:200 (Dako); anti-phosphorylated Tau at Ser-396, 1:5000 (Epitomics); anti-β-actin, 1:2000 (Sigma); anti-SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, 1:1000 (Stressgen); anti-Nϵ-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), 1:400 (Cosmo Bio)) overnight at 4 °C, before being washed with TBS-T and treated with the secondary antibody (1 h). Development was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Two microliters of TBS-soluble fractions (2 μg/μl) were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2-μm pore size, Bio-Rad) basically according to the protocol developed by Kayed et al. (29Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). After being blocked, the membrane was incubated with anti-Aβ oligomer (A11, 0.1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C before being incubated with the secondary antibody (1 h). As implied previously (29Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar), TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 was used as a washing buffer to reduce the interference with the detection of oligomers by higher concentrations of detergent. Development was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Memory impairment was assessed using the Morris water maze test, as described previously (25Murakami K. Yokoyama S. Murata N. Ozawa Y. Irie K. Shirasawa T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 409: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Murakami K. Murata N. Ozawa Y. Kinoshita N. Irie K. Shirasawa T. Shimizu T. J.

The water maze pool (Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo), diameter 120 cm, contained opaque water (20 °C) with a platform (10 cm in diameter) submerged 2 cm below the surface. The hidden platform task took 4 (6–8-month group) or 7 (15–17-month group) days (2 sessions per day, 3 h apart) during which 2 trials were performed each day (15 min apart). The platform location remained constant, and the entry points were changed semi-randomly between trials. Twenty-four hours after the last day of the hidden platform task, a 1-min probe trial was carried out without the platform. The entry point for the probe trials was in the quadrant opposite the target quadrant. Memory retention was evaluated by the amount of time spent in the correct quadrant where the escape platform was located in the hidden platform trial. Performance was monitored with the CompACT VAS/DV video-tracking system. Exploratory behavior was tested using the Y maze test, as described previously (24Murata N. Murakami K. Ozawa Y. Kinoshita N.

The Y maze apparatus (Muromachi Kikai) was made of gray plastic walls, 12 cm high consisting of three compartments (40 × 2 cm) connected with 2 × 2-cm passages. The mice were placed into one of the three arms of the maze and allowed to explore the two open arms for 5 min, during which the third arm remained closed (training trial). After a 1-h interval, the closed arm was opened, and the mice were allowed to explore all three arms for 5 min (test trial). An arm entry was recorded when all four paws entered the compartment. After testing each mouse, the maze was thoroughly cleaned to standardize odors. Performance was monitored with the CompACT VAS/DV video-tracking system. The procedure was basically adopted based on the method of the previous works (23Murakami K. Horikoshi-Sakuraba Y. Murata N. Noda Y. Masuda Y. Kinoshita N. Hatsuta H. Murayama S. Shirasawa T.

In brief, the sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being treated briefly with formic acid in the case of Aβ staining. After incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to prevent endogenous peroxidation, the sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS before being incubated with an anti-Aβ antibody (6E10 and 4G8) (1 μg/ml; Signet), an anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) antibody (1 μg/ml; Wako), to detect activated microglia or an anti-glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) antibody (1 μg/ml; Sigma) to detect activated astrocytes overnight at 4 °C. The sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min. Immunoreactivity was visualized using an ABC Elite kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, and densitometric quantification of the percentage area was measured using Leica QWin V3 image software. After deparaffinization of the sections and washing with PBS, the slides were immersed for 5 min in 0.25% potassium permanganate solution followed by 5 min in 1% potassium metabisulfate, 1% oxalic acid solution. The treated slides were placed in a filtered 0.02% thioflavin-S solution for 8 min before being subjected to florescence photomicrography in aqueous mounting medium. Nuclear DNA was isolated, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured using an electrochemical detection-HPLC system as described previously (30Kaneko T. Tahara S. Takabayashi F. Harada N. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 8-OHdG content was expressed as the molar ratio of 8-OHdG to 107 of dG. The amount of dG was calculated from the absorption at 260 nm in the same sample. The glutathione (GSH) content was determined using a total glutathione quantification kit (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of GSH in the sample was measured from absorbance at 412 nm. 20-μl samples (2 μg/μl) of the TBS-soluble fraction were employed. The amounts of Aβ42, Aβ40, and Aβ oligomers in the TBS-soluble and TBS-insoluble fractions were determined by sandwich ELISA with a human β amyloid ELISA kit (Aβ40: catalog #27714, human amyloid β (1–40)(N); Aβ42: catalog #27712, human amyloid β (1–42)(N); oligomer Aβ: catalog # 27725, human amyloid β oligomers (82E1-specific)) (IBL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty microliters of fresh blood obtained from the tail vein were subjected to automatic hematological analysis (Celltac, MEK-6358, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) after a 100 times dilution with isotonic buffer (Isotonac, MEK-510, Nihon Kohden). Human blood (MEK-3DN, Nihon Kohden) was used as the standard. All data are presented as the means ± S.E., and the differences were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. To determine whether SOD1 contributes to the Aβ-dependent pathology of AD in vivo, we generated hAPP/Sod1−/− by crossing hAPP/Sod1+/− mice with Sod1+/− mice, giving six types of littermates: hAPP/Sod1+/+, hAPP/Sod1+/−, hAPP/Sod1−/−, Sod1+/+, Sod1+/−, and Sod1−/−. These groups did not differ with regard to the background strain. We confirmed the approximate half-reduction of SOD1 levels in hAPP/Sod1+/− mice at 6–8 and 15–17 months old in a gene dose-dependent manner using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A–C). The overexpression of hAPP also did not significantly affect the amounts of SOD1 in hAPP/Sod1+/+. To examine the effect of hAPP overexpression on the anemia phenotype of the Sod1−/− mice (31Iuchi Y. Okada F. Onuma K. Onoda T. Asao H. Kobayashi M. Fujii J. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the red blood cells of these mice were counted, and no significant change was observed in either age group by overexpression of hAPP (Fig. 1 D and E). During the acquisition period of Morris maze, mice were trained to search for the hidden platform for 4 days. At 6–8 months of age, all mice quickly achieved the goal except for hAPP/Sod1−/− mice, which took significantly longer to master this task (Fig. 2A). Probe trials, in which the platform was removed and mice were given 1 min to find the missing platform, were performed 1 day after the hidden platform task. As shown in Fig. 2B, only hAPP/Sod1−/− mice failed to find the target location. Estimation of time spent in the target quadrant in the probe trial showed no apparent recognition by hAPP/Sod1−/− mice of the target zone (Fig. 2C), consistent with the results of the hidden trial test (Fig. 2A). There were no differences in swimming speed among all mice investigated (data not shown), indicating that motor functions were normal. Furthermore, no drusen deposits were observed in 6–8-month-old mice knocking out Sod1 (data not shown), as described previously (11Imamura Y. Noda S. Hashizume K. Shinoda K. Yamaguchi M. Uchiyama S. Shimizu T. Mizushima Y. Shirasawa T. Tsubota K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11282-11287Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), meaning that visual functions were also normal in young mice. At 15–17 months of age, hAPP/Sod1+/+, hAPP/Sod1+/−, and hAPP/Sod1−/− mice took longer to reach the goal than control Sod1+/+ mice (supplemental Fig. S1A). In the probe trial all mice possessing the hAPP transgene showed poor memory of the goal zone (supplemental Fig. S1B), and no preference for the target area was found in these mice (supplemental Fig. S1C). All mice tested in this age group swam at a similar speed in the probe trial (supplemental Fig. S1D). A visible platform trial was carried out before the hidden trial to ensure that the significant difference was not due to visual or motor dysfunctions (data not shown). Although we confirmed the presence of drusens in 15–17-month-old mice without Sod1 (hAPP/Sod1−/− and Sod1−/−, supplemental Fig. S2), consistent with our previous studies (11Imamura Y. Noda S. Hashizume K. Shinoda K. Yamaguchi M. Uchiyama S. Shimizu T. Mizushima Y. Shirasawa T. Tsubota K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11282-11287Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), hAPP/Sod1+/− showed the significant memory loss compared with Sod1+/+. These results suggest that cytoplasmic SOD deletion significantly accelerates the Aβ-dependent learning and memory deficits of hAPP/Sod1+/+ mice in an age-dependent manner. The Y maze depends on the natural tendency of rodents to explore new environments. As a preference for the novel arm reflects locomotor activity, novel arm entries and the time spent in the novel arm by hAPP mice in the test trial were recorded after the training trial. Young hAPP/Sod1+/+ mice (age 6–8 months) visited the novel arm as often as non-Tg mice, whereas both hAPP/Sod1−/− and hAPP/Sod1+/− mice entered the novel arm less frequently than non-Tg mice (Fig. 2D). hAPP/Sod1−/− and hAPP/Sod1+/− mice also showed poor recognition of the novel arm as determined by the percentage of time spent there (Fig. 2E). Although haplo-deficiency of Sod1 induced behavioral impairment in hAPP/Sod1+/+ mice in the Y maze, these alterations were generally coincident with the learning and memory deficits observed in the Morris water maze test (Fig. 2, A–C), indicating that cytoplasmic SOD plays a role in behavioral function. Neuronal degeneration in animal models is closely associated with memory and behavioral impairments. We examined the levels of synaptophysin as a neuronal marker that is expressed on p"

However, few trials examine whether supplementation can improve such outcomes and none have examined effects on cognition. This study examined whether Vitamin D supplementation led to improvements in diverse measures of cognitive and emotional functioning, and hypothesised that supplementation would lead to improvements in these outcomes compared to placebo. Methods/Principal Findings Healthy young adults were recruited to a parallel-arm, double-blind trial conducted at The University of Queensland. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Vitamin D (one capsule daily, containing 5000 IU cholecalciferol) or identical placebo capsule for six weeks. All participants and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. Primary outcome measures assessed at baseline and 6 weeks were working memory, response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Secondary outcomes were: hallucination-proneness, psychotic-like experiences, and ratings of depression, anxiety and anger. 128 participants were recruited, randomised and included in primary analyses (vitamin D n = 63; placebo n = 65). Despite significant increases in vitamin D status in the active group, no significant changes were observed in working memory (F = 1.09; p = 0.30), response inhibition (F = 0.82; p = 0.37), cognitive flexibility (F = 1.37; p = 0.24) or secondary outcomes. No serious adverse effects were reported. Conclusions Our findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not influence cognitive or emotional functioning in healthy young adults. Future controlled trials in targeted populations of interest are required to determine whether supplementation can improve functioning in these domains.

https://openalex.org/W1993532567,"Recent palaeomagnetic and seismological studies have strengthened the suggestion that the Moon once possessed a core dynamo. Despite its importance as a constraint on lunar evolution, there is currently no consensus on how such a dynamo was driven. Two groups working independently have arrived at the idea that the lunar dynamo was powered by mechanical stirring of the liquid core. Dwyer et al. investigate the mechanism of a dynamo driven by continuous mechanical stirring arising from the differential motion between the solid silicate mantle and the liquid core beneath. They show that the fluid motions and the power required to drive a dynamo operating continuously for more than 1 billion years are readily obtained by such mechanical stirring. Le Bars et al. propose a model whereby the dynamo action comes from impact-induced changes in the Moon's rotation rate. They show that basin-forming impact events are energetic enough to have unlocked the Moon from synchronous rotation, and that the subsequent large-scale fluid flows in the core, excited by the tidal distortion of the core–mantle boundary, could have powered a lunar dynamo. The origin of lunar magnetic anomalies1,2,3,4,5 remains unresolved after their discovery more than four decades ago. A commonly invoked hypothesis is that the Moon might once have possessed a thermally driven core dynamo3, but this theory is problematical given the small size of the core and the required surface magnetic field strengths6. An alternative hypothesis is that impact events might have amplified ambient fields near the antipodes of the largest basins7, but many magnetic anomalies exist that are not associated with basin antipodes. Here we propose a new model for magnetic field generation, in which dynamo action comes from impact-induced changes in the Moon’s rotation rate. Basin-forming impact events are energetic enough to have unlocked the Moon from synchronous rotation8, and we demonstrate that the subsequent large-scale fluid flows in the core, excited by the tidal distortion of the core–mantle boundary9, could have powered a lunar dynamo. Predicted surface magnetic field strengths are on the order of several microteslas, consistent with palaeomagnetic measurements5, and the duration of these fields is sufficient to explain the central magnetic anomalies associated with several large impact basins."

We used amyloid oligomers and fibrils grown from the yeast prion Sup35p, responsible for the specific prion trait [PSI+], to investigate how membrane lipids modulate fibril interaction with the membranes of cultured H-END cells and cytotoxicity. Sup35p shares no homology with endogenous mammalian polypeptide chains. Thus, the generic toxicity of amyloids and the molecular events underlying cell degeneration can be investigated without interference with analogous polypeptides encoded by the cell genome. Sup35 fibrils bound to the cell membrane without increasing its permeability to Ca2+. Fibril binding resulted in structural reorganization and aggregation of membrane rafts, with GM1 clustering and alteration of its mobility. Sup35 fibril binding was affected by GM1 or its sialic acid moiety, but not by cholesterol membrane content, with complete inhibition after treatment with fumonisin B1 or neuraminidase. Finally, cell impairment resulted from caspase-8 activation after Fas receptor translocation on fibril binding to the plasma membrane. Our observations suggest that amyloid fibrils induce abnormal accumulation and overstabilization of raft domains in the cell membrane and provide a reasonable, although not unique, mechanistic and molecular explanation for fibril toxicity.—Bucciantini, M., Nosi, D., Forzan, M., Russo, E., Calamai, M., Pieri, L., Formigli, L., Quercioli, F., Soria, S., Pavone, F., Savistchenko, J., Melki, R., Stefani, M.

https://openalex.org/W2073294762,"Cancer evolves through the accumulation of mutations, but the order in which mutations occur is poorly understood. Inference of a temporal ordering on the level of genes is challenging because clinically and histologically identical tumors often have few mutated genes in common. This heterogeneity may at least in part be due to mutations in different genes having similar phenotypic effects by acting in the same functional pathway. We estimate the constraints on the order in which alterations accumulate during cancer progression from cross-sectional mutation data using a probabilistic graphical model termed Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Network (H-CBN). The possible orders are analyzed on the level of genes and, after mapping genes to functional pathways, also on the pathway level. We find stronger evidence for pathway order constraints than for gene order constraints, indicating that temporal ordering results from selective pressure acting at the pathway level. The accumulation of changes in core pathways differs among cancer types, yet a common feature is that progression appears to begin with mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis pathways and to conclude with mutations in genes involved in invasion pathways. H-CBN models provide a quantitative and intuitive model of tumorigenesis showing that the genetic events can be linked to the phenotypic progression on the level of pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2005388951,"Serous ovarian cancer (SeOvCa) is an aggressive disease with differential and often inadequate therapeutic outcome after standard treatment. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has provided rich molecular and genetic profiles from hundreds of primary surgical samples. These profiles confirm mutations of TP53 in ~100% of patients and an extraordinarily complex profile of DNA copy number changes with considerable patient-to-patient diversity. This raises the joint challenge of exploiting all new available datasets and reducing their confounding complexity for the purpose of predicting clinical outcomes and identifying disease relevant pathway alterations. We therefore set out to use multi-data type genomic profiles (mRNA, DNA methylation, DNA copy-number alteration and microRNA) available from TCGA to identify prognostic signatures for the prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).We implemented a multivariate Cox Lasso model and median time-to-event prediction algorithm and applied it to two datasets integrated from the four genomic data types. We (1) selected features through cross-validation; (2) generated a prognostic index for patient risk stratification; and (3) directly predicted continuous clinical outcome measures, that is, the time to recurrence and survival time. We used Kaplan-Meier p-values, hazard ratios (HR), and concordance probability estimates (CPE) to assess prediction performance, comparing separate and integrated datasets. Data integration resulted in the best PFS signature (withheld data: p-value = 0.008; HR = 2.83; CPE = 0.72).We provide a prediction tool that inputs genomic profiles of primary surgical samples and generates patient-specific predictions for the time to recurrence and survival, along with outcome risk predictions. Using integrated genomic profiles resulted in information gain for prediction of outcomes. Pathway analysis provided potential insights into functional changes affecting disease progression. The prognostic signatures, if prospectively validated, may be useful for interpreting therapeutic outcomes for clinical trials that aim to improve the therapy for SeOvCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W2108284748,"Allostery offers a highly specific way to modulate protein function. Therefore, understanding this mechanism is of increasing interest for protein science and drug discovery. However, allosteric signal transmission is difficult to detect experimentally and to model because it is often mediated by local structural changes propagating along multiple pathways. To address this, we developed a method to identify communication pathways by an information-theoretical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Signal propagation was described as information exchange through a network of correlated local motions, modeled as transitions between canonical states of protein fragments. The method was used to describe allostery in two-component regulatory systems. In particular, the transmission from the allosteric site to the signaling surface of the receiver domain NtrC was shown to be mediated by a layer of hub residues. The location of hubs preferentially connected to the allosteric site was found in close agreement with key residues experimentally identified as involved in the signal transmission. The comparison with the networks of the homologues CheY and FixJ highlighted similarities in their dynamics. In particular, we showed that a preorganized network of fragment connections between the allosteric and functional sites exists already in the inactive state of all three proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1985179998,"Serotonin (5-HT) uptake by the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) is driven by ion gradients. The stoichiometry of transported 5-HT and ions is predicted to result in electroneutral charge movement. However, hSERT mediates a current when challenged with 5-HT. This discrepancy can be accounted for by an uncoupled ion flux. Here, we investigated the mechanistic basis of the uncoupled currents and its relation to the conformational cycle of hSERT. Our observations support the conclusion that the conducting state underlying the uncoupled ion flux is in equilibrium with an inward facing state of the transporter with K+ bound. We identified conditions associated with accumulation of the transporter in inward facing conformations. Manipulations that increased the abundance of inward facing states resulted in enhanced steady-state currents. We present a comprehensive kinetic model of the transport cycle, which recapitulates salient features of the recorded currents. This study provides a framework for exploring transporter-associated currents."
https://openalex.org/W1981307220,"Background Central to the pathology of coronary heart disease is the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol and triglycerides, within the intima of arterial blood vessels. The search for drugs to treat dislipidemia, remains a major pharmaceutical focus. In this study, we evaluated the hypolipidemic properties of the essential oil from Chios mastic gum (MGO). Methodology/Principal Findings The hypolipidemic effect of MGO was investigated in naïve as well as in rats susceptible to detergent-induced hyperlipidemia. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides were determined using commercial kits. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase activity was measured in HepG2 cell extracts using a radioactive assay; cellular cholesterol and cholesterol esters were assessed using gas chromatography. MGO administration into naïve rats resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the constitutive synthesis of serum cholesterol and triglycerides. In hyperlipidemic rats, MGO treatment had also a strong hypolipidemic effect. By testing various components of MGO, we show for the first time that the hypolipidemic action is associated with camphene. Administration of camphene at a dose of 30 µg/gr of body weight in hyperlipidemic rats resulted in a 54.5% reduction of total cholesterol (p<0.001), 54% of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p<0.001) and 34.5% of triglycerides (p<0.001). Treatment of HepG2 cells with camphene led to a decrease in cellular cholesterol content to the same extend as mevinolin, a known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. The hypolipidemic action of camphene is independent of HMG-CoA reductase activity, suggesting that its hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects are associated with a mechanism of action different than that of statins. Conclusions Given the critical role that the control of hyperlipidemia plays in cardiovascular disease, the results of our study provide insights into the use of camphene as an alternative lipid lowering agent and merits further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2105981289,"Previous experimental evidence indicates that some cancer cells have an alternative glycolysis pathway with net zero ATP production, implying that upregulation of glycolysis in these cells may not be related to the generation of ATP. Here we use a genome-scale model of human cell metabolism to investigate the potential metabolic alterations in cells using net zero ATP glycolysis. We uncover a novel pathway for ATP generation that involves reactions from serine biosynthesis, one-carbon metabolism and the glycine cleavage system, and show that the pathway is transcriptionally upregulated in an inducible murine model of Myc-driven liver tumorigenesis. This pathway has a predicted two-fold higher flux rate in cells using net zero ATP glycolysis than those using standard glycolysis and generates twice as much ATP with significantly lower rate of lactate - but higher rate of alanine secretion. Thus, in cells using the standard - or the net zero ATP glycolysis pathways a significant portion of the glycolysis flux is always associated with ATP generation, and the ratio between the flux rates of the two pathways determines the rate of ATP generation and lactate and alanine secretion during glycolysis."

Despite their importance in marine biota, their deep phylogenetic relationships were scarcely investigated from a molecular perspective, whereas much valuable work has been done on taxonomy, as well as phylogeny, of lower taxa. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present a class-level bivalve phylogeny with a broad sample of 122 ingroup taxa, using four mitochondrial markers (MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2, MT-CO1, MT-CYB). Rigorous techniques have been exploited to set up the dataset, analyze phylogenetic signal, and infer a single final tree. In this study, we show the basal position of Opponobranchia to all Autobranchia, as well as of Palaeoheterodonta to the remaining Autobranchia, which we here propose to call Amarsipobranchia. Anomalodesmata were retrieved as monophyletic and basal to (Heterodonta + Pteriomorphia). Conclusions/Significance Bivalve morphological characters were traced onto the phylogenetic trees obtained from the molecular analysis; our analysis suggests that eulamellibranch gills and heterodont hinge are ancestral characters for all Autobranchia.

https://openalex.org/W2002087684,"It has been hypothesised that substance P (SP) may be produced by primary fibroblastic tendon cells (tenocytes), and that this production, together with the widespread distribution of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1 R) in tendon tissue, could play an important role in the development of tendinopathy, a condition of chronic tendon pain and thickening. The aim of this study was to examine the possibility of endogenous SP production and the expression of NK-1 R by human tenocytes. Because tendinopathy is related to overload, and because the predominant tissue pathology (tendinosis) underlying early tendinopathy is characterized by tenocyte hypercellularity, the production of SP in response to loading/strain and the effects of exogenously administered SP on tenocyte proliferation were also studied. A cell culture model of primary human tendon cells was used. The vast majority of tendon cells were immunopositive for the tenocyte/fibroblast markers tenomodulin and vimentin, and immunocytochemical counterstaining revealed that positive immunoreactions for SP and NK-1 R were seen in a majority of these cells. Gene expression analyses showed that mechanical loading (strain) of tendon cell cultures using the FlexCell© technique significantly increased the mRNA levels of SP, whereas the expression of NK-1 R mRNA decreased in loaded as compared to unloaded tendon cells. Reduced NK-1 R protein was also observed, using Western blot, after exogenously administered SP at a concentration of 10⁻⁷ M. SP exposure furthermore resulted in increased cell metabolism, increased cell viability, and increased cell proliferation, all of which were found to be specifically mediated via the NK-1 R; this in turn involving a common mitogenic cell signalling pathway, namely phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This study indicates that SP, produced by tenocytes in response to mechanical loading, may regulate proliferation through an autocrine loop involving the NK-1 R."

Here, we used H4 neuroglioma cells expressing α-synuclein fused to hemi:GFP constructs to study the effects of α-synuclein monoclonal antibodies on the early stages of aggregation, as quantified by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assay. Widefield and confocal microscopy revealed that cells treated for 48 h with monoclonal antibodies internalized antibodies to various degrees. C-terminal and oligomer-selective α-synuclein antibodies reduced the extent of α-synuclein dimerization/oligomerization, as indicated by decreased GFP fluorescence signal. Furthermore, ELISA measurements on lysates and conditioned media from antibody treated cells displayed lower α-synuclein levels compared to untreated cells, suggesting increased protein turnover.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that unstressed plants are able to respond to stress cues emitted from their abiotically-stressed neighbors and in turn induce stress responses in additional unstressed plants located further away from the stressed plants. Pisum sativum plants were subjected to drought while neighboring rows of five unstressed plants on both sides, with which they could exchange different cue combinations. On one side, the stressed plant and its unstressed neighbors did not share their rooting volumes (UNSHARED) and thus were limited to shoot communication. On its other side, the stressed plant shared one of its rooting volumes with its nearest unstressed neighbor and all plants shared their rooting volumes with their immediate neighbors (SHARED), allowing both root and shoot communication. Fifteen minutes following drought induction, significant stomatal closure was observed in both the stressed plants and their nearest unstressed SHARED neighbors, and within one hour, all SHARED neighbors closed their stomata. Stomatal closure was not observed in the UNSHARED neighbors. The results demonstrate that unstressed plants are able to perceive and respond to stress cues emitted by the roots of their drought-stressed neighbors and, via ‘relay cuing’, elicit stress responses in further unstressed plants. Further work is underway to study the underlying mechanisms of this new mode of plant communication and its possible adaptive implications for the anticipation of forthcoming abiotic stresses by plants."

Unlike the helix and strand, the non-regular region consists of an amino acid defined as a disordered residue (DR). When compared with the effect of the helix and strand, the effect of the DR on enzyme structure and function is elusive. An Aspergillus niger GH10 xylanase (Xyn) was selected as a model molecule of (β/α)(8) because the general structure consists of ~10% enzymes. The Xyn has five N-terminal DRs and one C-terminal DR, respectively, which were deleted to construct three mutants, XynΔN, XynΔC, and XynΔNC. Each mutant was ~2-, 3-, or 4-fold more thermostable and 7-, 4-, or 4-fold more active than the Xyn. The N-terminal deletion decreased the xylanase temperature optimum for activity (T(opt)) 6 °C, but the C-terminal deletion increased its T(opt) 6 °C. The N- and C-terminal deletions had opposing effects on the enzyme T(opt) but had additive effects on its thermostability. The five N-terminal DR deletions had more effect on the enzyme kinetics but less effect on its thermo property than the one C-terminal DR deletion. CD data showed that the terminal DR deletions increased regular secondary structural contents, and hence, led to slow decreased Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG(0)) in the thermal denaturation process, which ultimately enhanced enzyme thermostabilities."

Here, we report that long Lys(48)-linked chains are resistant to many deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Representative enzymes from this group, Ubp15 from yeast and its human ortholog USP7, rapidly remove mono- and diubiquitin from substrates but are slow to remove longer Lys(48)-linked chains. This resistance is lost if the structure of Lys(48)-linked chains is disrupted by mutation of ubiquitin or if chains are linked through Lys(63). In contrast to Ubp15 and USP7, Ubp12 readily cleaves the ends of long chains, regardless of chain structure. We propose that the resistance to many DUBs of long, substrate-attached Lys(48)-linked chains helps ensure that proteins are maintained free from ubiquitin until a threshold of ubiquitin ligase activity enables degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2050961829,"Partitioning-defective 1b (PAR1b), also known as microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), is a member of evolutionally conserved PAR1/MARK serine/threonine kinase family, which plays a key role in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity at least partly by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that regulate microtubule stability. PAR1b has also been reported to influence actin cytoskeletal organization, raising the possibility that PAR1b functionally interacts with the Rho family of small GTPases, central regulators of the actin cytoskeletal system. Consistent with this notion, PAR1 was recently found to be physically associated with a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1). This observation suggests a functional link between PAR1b and GEF-H1. Here we show that PAR1b induces phosphorylation of GEF-H1 on serine 885 and serine 959. We also show that PAR1b-induced serine 885/serine 959 phosphorylation inhibits RhoA-specific GEF activity of GEF-H1. As a consequence, GEF-H1 phosphorylated on both of the serine residues loses the ability to stimulate RhoA and thereby fails to induce RhoA-dependent stress fiber formation. These findings indicate that PAR1b not only regulates microtubule stability through phosphorylation of MAPs but also influences actin stress fiber formation by inducing GEF-H1 phosphorylation.

TAAR are involved in modulation of neuronal, cardiac and vascular functions and they are potentially linked with neurological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Subtype TAAR1, the best characterized TAAR so far, is promiscuous for a wide set of ligands and is activated by trace amines tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), octopamine (OA), but also by thyronamines, dopamine, and psycho-active drugs. Unfortunately, effects of trace amines on signaling of the two homologous β-adrenergic receptors 1 (ADRB1) and 2 (ADRB2) have not been clarified yet in detail. We, therefore, tested TAAR1 agonists TYR, PEA and OA regarding their effects on ADRB1/2 signaling by co-stimulation studies. Surprisingly, trace amines TYR and PEA are partial allosteric antagonists at ADRB1/2, whereas OA is a partial orthosteric ADRB2-antagonist and ADRB1-agonist. To specify molecular reasons for TAAR1 ligand promiscuity and for observed differences in signaling effects on particular aminergic receptors we compared TAAR, tyramine (TAR) octopamine (OAR), ADRB1/2 and dopamine receptors at the structural level. We found especially for TAAR1 that the remarkable ligand promiscuity is likely based on high amino acid similarity in the ligand-binding region compared with further aminergic receptors. On the other hand few TAAR specific properties in the ligand-binding site might determine differences in ligand-induced effects compared to ADRB1/2.

Increasing findings suggest that CORT exerts its impact on synaptic plasticity by altering the functional properties of glutamate receptors, which include changes in the motility and function of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid subtype of glutamate receptor (AMPAR) that are responsible for the expression of synaptic plasticity. Here we provide evidence that CORT could also regulate synaptic plasticity by modulating the function of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which mediate the induction of synaptic plasticity. We found that stress level CORT applied to adult rat hippocampal slices potentiated evoked NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses within 30 min. Surprisingly, following this fast-onset change, we observed a slow-onset (>1 hour after termination of CORT exposure) increase in synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. To investigate the consequences of the distinct fast- and slow-onset modulation of NMDARs for synaptic plasticity, we examined the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) within relevant time windows. Paralleling the increased NMDAR function, both LTP and LTD were facilitated during CORT treatment. However, 1–2 hours after CORT treatment when synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDARs is increased, bidirectional plasticity was no longer facilitated. Our findings reveal the remarkable plasticity of NMDARs in the adult hippocampus in response to CORT. CORT-mediated slow-onset increase in GluN2A in hippocampal synapses could be a homeostatic mechanism to normalize synaptic plasticity following fast-onset stress-induced facilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2013263677,"The incidence of fungal infections in immuno-compromised patients increased considerably over the last 30 years. New treatments are therefore needed against pathogenic fungi. With Candida albicans as a model, study of host-fungal pathogen interactions might reveal new sources of therapies. Transcription factors (TF) are of interest since they integrate signals from the host environment and participate in an adapted microbial response. TFs of the Zn2-Cys6 class are specific to fungi and are important regulators of fungal metabolism. This work analyzed the importance of the C. albicans Zn2-Cys6 TF for mice kidney colonization. For this purpose, 77 Zn2-Cys6 TF mutants were screened in a systemic mice model of infection by pools of 10 mutants. We developed a simple barcoding strategy to specifically detect each mutant DNA from mice kidney by quantitative PCR. Among the 77 TF mutant strains tested, eight showed a decreased colonization including mutants for orf19.3405, orf19.255, orf19.5133, RGT1, UGA3, orf19.6182, SEF1 and orf19.2646, and four an increased colonization including mutants for orf19.4166, ZFU2, orf19.1685 and UPC2 as compared to the isogenic wild type strain. Our approach was validated by comparable results obtained with the same animal model using a single mutant and the revertant for an ORF (orf19.2646) with still unknown functions. In an attempt to identify putative involvement of such TFs in already known C. albicans virulence mechanisms, we determined their in vitro susceptibility to pH, heat and oxidative stresses, as well as ability to produce hyphae and invade agar. A poor correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo assays, thus suggesting that TFs needed for mice kidney colonization may involve still unknown mechanisms. This large-scale analysis of mice organ colonization by C. albicans can now be extended to other mutant libraries since our in vivo screening strategy can be adapted to any preexisting mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2015843044,"Context The mechanisms of septic shock-associated adrenal insufficiency remain unclear. This study aimed at investigating the synthesis of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin (AVP) by parvocellular neurons and the antehypophyseal expression of ACTH in human septic shock and in an experimental model of sepsis. Objective To test the hypothesis that ACTH secretion is decreased secondarily to alteration of CRH or AVP synthesis, we undertook a neuropathological study of the antehypophyseal system in patients who had died from septic shock and rats with experimental faecal peritonitis. Methods Brains obtained in 9 septic shock patients were compared to 10 nonseptic patients (controls). Parvocellular expression of AVP and CRH mRNA were evaluated by in situ hybridization. Antehypophyseal expression of ACTH, vasopressin V1b and CRH R1 receptors and parvocellular expression of iNOS in the PVN were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The same experiments were carried out in a fecal peritonitis-induced model of sepsis. Data from septic rats with (n = 6) or without (n = 10) early death were compared to sham-operated (n = 8) animals. Results In patients and rats, septic shock was associated with a decreased expression of ACTH, unchanged expression of V1B receptor, CRHR1 and AVP mRNA, and increased expression of parvocellular iNOS compared to controls. Septic shock was also characterized by an increased expression of CRH mRNA in rats but not in patients, who notably had a greater duration of septic shock. Conclusion The present study suggests that in humans and in rats, septic shock is associated with decreased ACTH synthesis that is not compensated by its two natural secretagogues, AVP and CRH. One underlying mechanism might be increased expression of iNOS in hypothalamic parvocellular neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2091994247,"Purpose Eye movement research has traditionally studied solely saccade and/or vergence eye movements by isolating these systems within a laboratory setting. While the neural correlates of saccadic eye movements are established, few studies have quantified the functional activity of vergence eye movements using fMRI. This study mapped the neural substrates of vergence eye movements and compared them to saccades to elucidate the spatial commonality and differentiation between these systems. Methodology The stimulus was presented in a block design where the ‘off’ stimulus was a sustained fixation and the ‘on’ stimulus was random vergence or saccadic eye movements. Data were collected with a 3T scanner. A general linear model (GLM) was used in conjunction with cluster size to determine significantly active regions. A paired t-test of the GLM beta weight coefficients was computed between the saccade and vergence functional activities to test the hypothesis that vergence and saccadic stimulation would have spatial differentiation in addition to shared neural substrates. Results Segregated functional activation was observed within the frontal eye fields where a portion of the functional activity from the vergence task was located anterior to the saccadic functional activity (z>2.3; p<0.03). An area within the midbrain was significantly correlated with the experimental design for the vergence but not the saccade data set. Similar functional activation was observed within the following regions of interest: the supplementary eye field, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventral lateral prefrontal cortex, lateral intraparietal area, cuneus, precuneus, anterior and posterior cingulates, and cerebellar vermis. The functional activity from these regions was not different between the vergence and saccade data sets assessed by analyzing the beta weights of the paired t-test (p>0.2). Conclusion Functional MRI can elucidate the differences between the vergence and saccade neural substrates within the frontal eye fields and midbrain."
https://openalex.org/W2072337271,"Background Mll5 is currently a member of the Mll family of SET domain histone methyltransferase proteins but studies have also showed that it could be part of the SET3 branch of proteins. Recently, constitutive knock out animal studies have shown that Mll5 is required for proper haematopoietic stem cell differentiation, and loss of Mll5 results in synthetic lethality for genome de-methylation. Mll5 deficient male mice are infertile and here we analyse the consequences of Mll5 deficiency for spermatogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Mll5 deficient male mice, but not female mice, are infertile. Here we show using RNA in-situ hybridization that Mll5 is expressed in the germ cells of the testes of wild type mice. Consistent with the expression of Mll5, we demonstrate by electron microscopy, video microscopy and in vitro fertilisation techniques that Mll5 deficient mice have defects in terminal maturation and packaging of sperm. The defects seen include detachment of the acrosomal cap and impaired excess cytoplasm removal. Functional tests of sperm motility show a lack of progressive motility of spermatozoa from Mll5 deficient animals. None of these defects could be rescued by in vitro fertilization. Using microarray analysis we show that transcripts implicated in spermatogenesis are dysregulated. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate a clear role of Mll5 in mammalian spermatogenesis at the level of terminal differentiation providing further support for its classification in the SET3 branch of proteins. Moreover, this study identifies Tlk2, Utx, Gpr64, Sult4a1, Rap2ip, Vstm2 and HoxA10 as possible Mll5 targets that together may account for the observed spermatozoa maturation defects."

https://openalex.org/W2021726807,"Elevated glucocorticoid (GC) activity may be involved in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Tissue GC exposure is determined by the tissue-specific GC-activating enzyme 11β-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) and the GC-inactivating enzyme 5α-reductase type 1 (5αR1), as well as 5β-reductase (5βR). Our aim was to study the effects of neonatal overfeeding induced by small litter rearing on the expression of GC-regulating enzymes in adipose tissue and/or liver and on obesity-related metabolic disturbances during development. Male Sprague-Dawley rat pup litters were adjusted to litter sizes of three (small litters, SL) or ten (normal litters, NL) on postnatal day 3 and then given standard chow from postnatal week 3 onward (W3). Small litter rearing induced obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and higher circulating corticosterone in adults. 11β-HSD1 expression and enzyme activity in retroperitoneal, but not in epididymal, adipose tissue increased with postnatal time and peaked at W5/W6 in both groups before declining. From W8, 11β-HSD1 expression and enzyme activity levels in retroperitoneal fat persisted at significantly higher levels in SL compared to NL rats. Hepatic 11β-HSD1 enzyme activity in SL rats was elevated from W3 to W16 compared to NL rats. Hepatic 5αR1 and 5βR expression was higher in SL compared to NL rats after weaning until W6, whereupon expression decreased in the SL rats and remained similar to that in NL rats. In conclusion, small litter rearing in rats induced peripheral tissue-specific alterations in 11β-HSD1 expression and activity and 5αR1 and 5βR expression during puberty, which could contribute to elevated tissue-specific GC exposure and aggravate the development of metabolic dysregulation in adults."
https://openalex.org/W1975012443,"Cellular senescence-associated changes in blood vessels have been implicated in aging and age-related cardiovascular disorders. Here, we demonstrate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ coordinates angiotensin (Ang) II-induced senescence of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Activation of PPARδ by GW501516, a specific ligand for PPARδ, significantly attenuated Ang II-induced generation of superoxides and suppressed senescence of VSMCs. A marked increase in the levels of p53 and p21 induced by Ang II was blunted by the treatment with GW501516. Ligand-activated PPARδ up-regulated expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and suppressed the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Knockdown of PTEN with siRNA abrogated the effects of PPARδ on cellular senescence, on PI3K/Akt signaling, and on generation of ROS in VSMCs treated with Ang II. Finally, administration of GW501516 to apoE-deficient mice treated with Ang II significantly reduced the number of senescent cells in the aorta, where up-regulation of PTEN with reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt and ROS was demonstrated. Thus, ligand-activated PPARδ confers resistance to Ang II-induced senescence by up-regulation of PTEN and ensuing modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling to reduce ROS generation in vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084099736,"Of the ∼4000 ORFs identified through the genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) H37Rv, experimentally determined structures are available for 312. Since knowledge of protein structures is essential to obtain a high-resolution understanding of the underlying biology, we seek to obtain a structural annotation for the genome, using computational methods. Structural models were obtained and validated for ∼2877 ORFs, covering ∼70% of the genome. Functional annotation of each protein was based on fold-based functional assignments and a novel binding site based ligand association. New algorithms for binding site detection and genome scale binding site comparison at the structural level, recently reported from the laboratory, were utilized. Besides these, the annotation covers detection of various sequence and sub-structural motifs and quaternary structure predictions based on the corresponding templates. The study provides an opportunity to obtain a global perspective of the fold distribution in the genome. The annotation indicates that cellular metabolism can be achieved with only 219 folds. New insights about the folds that predominate in the genome, as well as the fold-combinations that make up multi-domain proteins are also obtained. 1728 binding pockets have been associated with ligands through binding site identification and sub-structure similarity analyses. The resource (http://proline.physics.iisc.ernet.in/Tbstructuralannotation), being one of the first to be based on structure-derived functional annotations at a genome scale, is expected to be useful for better understanding of TB and for application in drug discovery. The reported annotation pipeline is fairly generic and can be applied to other genomes as well."
https://openalex.org/W2094475133,"Background Transforming growth factor type-β (TGF-β)/Smad pathway plays an essential role in vascular fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation also mediates TGF-β signaling-induced vascular fibrosis, suggesting that some sort of interaction exists between Smad and redox pathways. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the influence of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a downstream effector of ROS, on TGF-β signaling transduction through Smad3 pathway in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Methods and Results TGF-β1 treatment promoted PARP1 activation through induction of ROS generation in rat VSMCs. TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Smad3 was prevented by treatment of cells with PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) or N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)acetami (PJ34), or PARP1 siRNA. TGF-β1 treatment promoted poly(ADP-ribosy)lation of Smad3 via activation of PARP1 in the nucleus. Poly(ADP-ribosy)lation enhanced Smad-Smad binding element (SBE) complex formation in nuclear extracts and increased DNA binding activity of Smad3. Pretreatment with 3AB, PJ34, or PARP1 siRNA prevented TGF-β1-induced Smad3 transactivation and expression of Smad3 target genes, including collagen Iα1, collagen IIIα1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, in rat VSMCs. Conclusions PARP1 is indispensable for TGF-β1 induced Smad3 activation in rat VSMCs. Targeting PARP1 may be a promising therapeutic approach against vascular diseases induced by dysregulation of TGF-β/Smad3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1985068219,"In epigenetic signaling pathways, histone tails are heavily modified, resulting in the recruitment of effector molecules that can influence transcription. One such molecule, plant homeodomain finger protein 20 (PHF20), uses a Tudor domain to read dimethyl lysine residues and is a known component of the MOF (male absent on the first) histone acetyltransferase protein complex, suggesting it plays a role in the cross-talk between lysine methylation and histone acetylation. We sought to investigate the biological role of PHF20 by generating a knockout mouse. Without PHF20, mice die shortly after birth and display a wide variety of phenotypes within the skeletal and hematopoietic systems. Mechanistically, PHF20 is not required for maintaining the global H4K16 acetylation levels or locus specific histone acetylation but instead works downstream in transcriptional regulation of MOF target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2061076816,"A fungus-specific glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which contains a unique sphingoid base possessing two double bonds and a methyl substitution, is essential for pathogenicity in fungi. Although the biosynthetic pathway of the GlcCer has been well elucidated, little is known about GlcCer catabolism because a GlcCer-degrading enzyme (glucocerebrosidase) has yet to be identified in fungi. We found a homologue of endoglycoceramidase tentatively designated endoglycoceramidase-related protein 1 (EGCrP1) in several fungal genomic databases. The recombinant EGCrP1 hydrolyzed GlcCer but not other glycosphingolipids, whereas endoglycoceramidase hydrolyzed oligosaccharide-linked glycosphingolipids but not GlcCer. Disruption of egcrp1 in Cryptococcus neoformans, a typical pathogenic fungus causing cryptococcosis, resulted in the accumulation of fungus-specific GlcCer and immature GlcCer that possess sphingoid bases without a methyl substitution concomitant with a dysfunction of polysaccharide capsule formation. These results indicated that EGCrP1 participates in the catabolism of GlcCer and especially functions to eliminate immature GlcCer in vivo that are generated as by-products due to the broad specificity of GlcCer synthase. We conclude that EGCrP1, a glucocerebrosidase identified for the first time in fungi, controls the quality of GlcCer by eliminating immature GlcCer incorrectly generated in C. neoformans, leading to accurate processing of fungus-specific GlcCer."

https://openalex.org/W2167347636,"The traditional assumption that bats cannot synthesize vitamin C (Vc) has been challenged recently. We have previously shown that two Old World bat species (Rousettus leschenaultii and Hipposideros armiger) have functional L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of Vc biosynthesis de novo. Given the uncertainties surrounding when and how bats lost GULO function, exploration of gene evolutionary patterns is needed. We therefore sequenced GULO genes from 16 bat species in 5 families, aiming to establish their evolutionary histories. In five cases we identified pseudogenes for the first time, including two cases in the genus Pteropus (P. pumilus and P. conspicillatus) and three in family Hipposideridae (Coelops frithi, Hipposideros speoris, and H. bicolor). Evolutionary analysis shows that the Pteropus clade has the highest ω ratio and has been subjected to relaxed selection for less than 3 million years. Purifying selection acting on the pseudogenized GULO genes of roundleaf bats (family Hipposideridae) suggests they have lost the ability to synthesize Vc recently. Limited mutations in the reconstructed GULO sequence of the ancestor of all bats contrasts with the many mutations in the ancestral sequence of recently emerged Pteropus bats. We identified at least five mutational steps that were then related to clade origination times. Together, our results suggest that bats lost the ability to biosynthesize vitamin C recently by exhibiting stepwise mutation patterns during GULO evolution that can ultimately lead to pseudogenization."
https://openalex.org/W2081918119,"Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1), a glycoprotein hormone, is believed to be involved in various biological processes such as inflammation, oxidative responses and cell migration. Riding on these emerging evidences, we hypothesized that STC1 may participate in the re-epithelialization during wound healing. Re-epithelialization is a critical step that involves keratinocyte lamellipodia (e-lam) formation, followed by cell migration. In this study, staurosporine (STS) treatment induced human keratinocyte (HaCaT) e-lam formation on fibronectin matrix and migration via the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the surge of intracellular calcium level [Ca2+]i and the inactivation of Akt. In accompanied with these migratory features, a time- and dose-dependent increase in STC1 expression was detected. STC1 gene expression was found not the downstream target of FAK-signaling as illustrated by FAK inhibition using PF573228. The reduction of [Ca2+]i by BAPTA/AM blocked the STS-mediated keratinocyte migration and STC1 gene expression. Alternatively the increase of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin exerted promotional effect on STS-induced STC1 gene expression. The inhibition of Akt by SH6 and GSK3β by lithium chloride (LiCl) could respectively induce and inhibit the STS-mediated e-lam formation, cell migration and STC1 gene expression. The STS-mediated e-lam formation and cell migration were notably hindered or induced respectively by STC1 knockdown or overexpression. This notion was further supported by the scratched wound assay. Collectively the findings provide the first evidence that STC1 promotes re-epithelialization in wound healing."

IPTc provides a high level of protection against uncomplicated and severe malaria, with monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP&AQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine plus piperaquine being the most efficacious regimens. A key challenge is the identification of a cost-effective delivery strategy.A community randomized trial was undertaken in Jasikan district, Ghana to assess IPTc effectiveness and costs using SP&AQ delivered in three different ways. Twelve villages were randomly selected to receive IPTc from village health workers (VHWs) or facility-based nurses working at health centres' outpatient departments (OPD) or EPI outreach clinics. Children aged 3 to 59 months-old received one IPT course (three doses) in May, June, September and October. Effectiveness was measured in terms of children covered and adherent to a course and delivery costs were calculated in financial and economic terms using an ingredient approach from the provider perspective.The economic cost per child receiving at least the first dose of all 4 courses was US$4.58 when IPTc was delivered by VHWs, US$4.93 by OPD nurses and US$ 5.65 by EPI nurses. The unit economic cost of receiving all 3 doses of all 4 courses was US$7.56 and US$8.51 when IPTc was delivered by VHWs or facility-based nurses respectively. The main cost driver for the VHW delivery was supervision, reflecting resources used for travelling to more remote communities rather than more intense supervision, and for OPD and EPI delivery, it was the opportunity cost of the time spent by nurses in dispensing IPTc.VHWs achieve higher IPTc coverage and adherence at lower costs than facility-based nurses in Jasikan district, Ghana.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00119132."

Here we report that mutation of painless leads to a defect in male–male courtship behavior and alteration in olfaction sensitivity in adult flies. Specific downregulation of the expression of the Painless protein in the olfactory projection neurons (PNs) of the antennal lobes (ALs) resulted in a phenotype resembling that found in painless mutant flies, whereas overexpression of Painless in PNs of painless mutant males suppressed male–male courtship behavior. The downregulation of Painless exclusively during adulthood also resulted in male–male courtship behavior. In addition, mutation of the painless gene in flies caused changes in olfaction, suggesting a role for this gene in olfactory processing. These results indicate that functions of painless in the adult central nervous system of Drosophila include modulation of olfactory processing and inhibition of male–male courtship behavior."

Subcutaneous immunization of mice with GST-HPV16L1Δ or GST-HPV16L1Δ-L2x3 in alum and monophosphoryl lipid A induced similarly high titers of HPV16 neutralizing antibodies. GST-HPV16L1Δ-L2x3 also elicited moderate L2-specific antibody titers. Intravaginal challenge studies showed that immunization of mice with GST-HPV16 L1Δ or GST-HPV16L1Δ-L2x3 capsomers, like Cervarix®, provided complete protection against HPV16. Conversely, vaccination with GST-HPV16 L1Δ capsomers failed to protect against HPV18 challenge, whereas mice immunized with either GST-HPV16L1Δ-L2x3 capsomers or Cervarix® were each completely protected. Thus, while the L2-specific response was moderate, it did not interfere with immunity to L1 in the context of GST-HPV16L1Δ-L2x3 and is sufficient to mediate L2-dependent protection against an experimental vaginal challenge with HPV18."
https://openalex.org/W2093457385,"Pathological neovascularization occurs when a balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors is disrupted, accompanied by an amplifying inflammatory cascade. However, the interdependence of these responses and the mechanism triggering the initial angiogenic switch have remained unclear. We present data from an epithelial debridement model of corneal neovascularization describing an initial 3-day period when a substantial component of neovascular growth occurs. Administration of selective inhibitors shows that this initial growth requires signaling through VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2), independent of the accompanying inflammatory response. Instead, increased VEGF production is found prominently in repair epithelial cells and is increased prior to recruitment of neutrophil/granulocytes and macrophage/monocytes. Consequently, early granulocyte and monocyte depletion has little effect on corneal neovascularization outgrowth. These data indicate that it is possible to pharmacologically uncouple these mechanisms during early injury-driven neovascularization in the cornea and suggest that initial tissue responses are coordinated by repair epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059408678,"A novel glutamate-binding protein was identified in Schistosoma mansoni. The protein (SmGBP) is related to metabotropic glutamate receptors from other species and has a predicted glutamate binding site located within a Venus Flytrap module but it lacks the heptahelical transmembrane segment that normally characterizes these receptors. The SmGBP cDNA was cloned, verified by 5′ and 3′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) and shown to be polyadenylated at the 3′end, suggesting the transcript is full-length. The cloned cDNA was subsequently expressed in bacteria and shown to encode a functional glutamate-binding protein. Other studies, using a specific peptide antibody, determined that SmGBP exists in two forms, a monomer of the expected size and a stable but non-covalent dimer. The monomer and dimer are both present in the membrane fraction of S. mansoni and are resistant to extraction with high-salt, alkaline pH and urea, suggesting SmGBP is either an integral membrane protein or a peripheral protein that is tightly associated with the membrane. Surface biotinylation experiments combined with western blot analyses and confocal immunolocalization revealed that SmGBP localized to the surface membranes of adult male schistosomes, especially the dorsal tubercles. In contrast, we detected little or no expression of SmGBP either in the females or larval stages. A comparative quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the level of SmGBP expression is several-fold higher in male worms than cercariae, and it is barely detectable in adult females. Together, the results identify SmGBP as a new type of schistosome glutamate receptor that is both gender- and stage-specific. The high-level expression of this protein in the male tubercles suggests a possible role in host-parasite interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2085484087,"Pathogen-specific antibody plays an important role in protection against pneumococcal carriage and infections. However, neonates and infants exhibit impaired innate and adaptive immune responses, which result in their high susceptibility to pneumococci. To protect neonates and infants against pneumococcal infection it is important to elicit specific protective immune responses at very young ages. In this study, we investigated the protective immunity against pneumococcal carriage, pneumonia, and sepsis induced by maternal immunization with pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA). Mother mice were intranasally immunized with recombinant PspA (rPspA) and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) prior to being mated. Anti-PspA specific IgG, predominantly IgG1, was present at a high level in the serum and milk of immunized mothers and in the sera of their pups. The pneumococcal densities in washed nasal tissues and in lung homogenate were significantly reduced in pups delivered from and/or breast-fed by PspA-immunized mothers. Survival after fatal systemic infections with various types of pneumococci was significantly extended in the pups, which had received anti-PspA antibody via the placenta or through their milk. The current findings strongly suggest that maternal immunization with PspA is an attractive strategy against pneumococcal infections during early childhood. (191 words)"
https://openalex.org/W2030740190,"Background Mutations in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) cause Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM), which is associated with a clinical pathology of brain myelin loss upon physiological stress. eIF2B is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of eIF2, which delivers the initiator tRNAMet to the ribosome. We recently reported that a R132H mutation in the catalytic subunit of this GEF, causing a 20% reduction in its activity, leads under normal conditions to delayed brain development in a mouse model for CACH/VWM. To further explore the effect of the mutation on global gene expression in the brain, we conducted a wide-scale transcriptome analysis of the first three critical postnatal weeks. Methodology/Principal Findings Genome-wide mRNA expression of wild-type and mutant mice was profiled at postnatal (P) days 1, 18 and 21 to reflect the early proliferative stage prior to white matter establishment (P1) and the peak of oligodendrocye differentiation and myelin synthesis (P18 and P21). At each developmental stage, between 441 and 818 genes were differentially expressed in the mutant brain with minimal overlap, generating unique time point-specific gene expression signatures. Conclusions The current study demonstrates that a point mutation in eIF2B, a key translation initiation factor, has a massive effect on global gene expression in the brain. The overall changes in expression patterns reflect multiple layers of indirect effects that accumulate as the brain develops and matures. The differentially expressed genes seem to reflect delayed waves of gene expression as well as an adaptation process to cope with hypersensitivity to cellular stress."

Both adenosine and acetylcholine treatment recovered the post-reperfusion cardiac function associated with adenosine and muscarinic receptors activation. Simultaneous administration of adenosine and acetylcholine failed to exert any additive protective effect, suggesting a shared mechanism between the two. Our data further revealed a cross-talk between the adenosine and acetylcholine receptor signaling in reperfused rat hearts. Interestingly, the selective M(2) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist methoctramine significantly attenuated the cardioprotective effect of adenosine. In addition, treatment with adenosine upregulated the expression and the maximal binding capacity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which were inhibited by the selective A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). These data suggested a possible functional coupling between the adenosine and muscarinic receptors behind the observed cardioprotection. Furthermore, nitric oxide was found involved in triggering the response to each of the two receptor agonist. In summary, there may be a cross-talk between the adenosine and muscarinic receptors in ischemic/reperfused myocardium with nitric oxide synthase might serve as the distal converging point. In addition, adenosine contributes to the invigorating effect of adenosine on muscarinic receptor thereby prompting to regulation of cardiac function. These findings argue for a potentially novel mechanism behind the adenosine-mediated cardioprotection."

In most angiosperms, the first zygotic cell division is asymmetric resulting in two daughter cells of unequal size and with distinct fates. However, the critical molecular mechanisms regulating this division remain unknown. Previously we showed that treatment of tobacco zygotes with beta-glucosyl Yariv (βGlcY) could dramatically alter the first zygotic asymmetric division to produce symmetric two-celled proembryos. In the present study, we isolated zygotes and two-celled asymmetric proembryos in vivo by micromanipulation, and obtained symmetric, two-celled proembryos by in vitro cell cultures. Using suppression-subtractive hybridization (SSH) and macroarray analysis differential gene expression between the zygote and the asymmetric and symmetric two-celled proembryos was investigated. After sequencing of the differentially expressed clones, a total of 1610 EST clones representing 685 non-redundant transcripts were obtained. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis revealed that these transcripts include those involved in physiological processes such as response to stimulus, regulation of gene expression, and localization and formation of anatomical structures. A homology search against known genes from Arabidopsis indicated that some of the above transcripts are involved in asymmetric cell division and embryogenesis. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the up- or down-regulation of the selected candidate transcripts during zygotic division. A few of these transcripts were expressed exclusively in the zygote, or in either type of the two-celled proembryos. Expression analyses of select genes in different tissues and organs also revealed potential roles of these transcripts in fertilization, seed maturation and organ development. The putative roles of few of the identified transcripts in the regulation of zygotic division are discussed. Further functional work on these candidate transcripts will provide important information for understanding asymmetric zygotic division, generation of apical-basal polarity and cell fate decisions during early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2125729699,"Approaches for manipulating cell type-specific gene expression during development depend on the identification of novel genetic tools. Here, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse line that utilizes Vsx2 upstream sequences to direct Cre recombinase to developing retinal bipolar cells. In contrast to the endogenous Vsx2 expression pattern, transgene expression was not detected in proliferating retinal progenitor cells and was restricted to post-mitotic bipolar cells. Cre immunolabeling was detected in rod bipolar cells and a subset of ON and OFF cone bipolar cells. Expression was first observed at postnatal day 3 and was detectable between 24 hours and 36 hours after the last S-phase of the cell cycle. The appearance of Cre-immunolabeled cells preceded the expression of bipolar cell type-specific markers such as PKCα and Cabp5 suggesting that transgene expression is initiated prior to terminal differentiation. In the presence of a constitutive conditional reporter transgene, reporter fluorescence was detected in Cre-expressing bipolar cells in the mature retina as expected, but was also observed in Cre-negative Type 2 bipolar cells and occasionally in Cre-negative photoreceptor cells. Together these findings reveal a new transgenic tool for directing gene expression to post-mitotic retinal precursors that are mostly committed to a bipolar cell fate."

Methodology A cross sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted at the Community Health Centre (CHC), Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi, Pakistan from September to November 2009. All individuals, visiting the CHC and aged 65 years or above were interviewed after taking written informed consent. Results A total of 400 elderly completed the interview. Majority were females, 65–69 years age, More than half of the individuals ie: 227 (85%) had received Care Giver experience for assistance and among these 195(72%) had care provided by an immediate family member. A large proportion of them stated that their Care Givers managed to provide less than four hours in a day for care giving. Around 37% showed substantial improvement in their relationship with the care givers. About 70% of the respondents stated that the care provided by the Care Giver improved their quality of life. Conclusion Elderly care is provided by majority of the family members resulting in increased satisfaction level, however small number still not satisfied due to unfulfilled need of these older people. This demands that efforts should be made to strengthen the family support by increasing awareness regarding elderly care and arranging support system by the government."
