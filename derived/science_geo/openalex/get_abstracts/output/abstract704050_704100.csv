https://openalex.org/W4308767470,"First infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with increased risk of acute and postacute death and sequelae in various organ systems. Whether reinfection adds to risks incurred after first infection is unclear. Here we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs' national healthcare database to build a cohort of individuals with one SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 443,588), reinfection (two or more infections, n = 40,947) and a noninfected control (n = 5,334,729). We used inverse probability-weighted survival models to estimate risks and 6-month burdens of death, hospitalization and incident sequelae. Compared to no reinfection, reinfection contributed additional risks of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.17, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.93-2.45), hospitalization (HR = 3.32, 95% CI 3.13-3.51) and sequelae including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematological, diabetes, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. The risks were evident regardless of vaccination status. The risks were most pronounced in the acute phase but persisted in the postacute phase at 6 months. Compared to noninfected controls, cumulative risks and burdens of repeat infection increased according to the number of infections. Limitations included a cohort of mostly white males. The evidence shows that reinfection further increases risks of death, hospitalization and sequelae in multiple organ systems in the acute and postacute phase. Reducing overall burden of death and disease due to SARS-CoV-2 will require strategies for reinfection prevention."

Here we developed a clinical-grade approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 non-viral precision genome-editing to simultaneously knockout the two endogenous TCR genes TRAC (which encodes TCRα) and TRBC (which encodes TCRβ). We also inserted into the TRAC locus two chains of a neoantigen-specific TCR (neoTCR) isolated from circulating T cells of patients. The neoTCRs were isolated using a personalized library of soluble predicted neoantigen-HLA capture reagents. Sixteen patients with different refractory solid cancers received up to three distinct neoTCR transgenic cell products. Each product expressed a patient-specific neoTCR and was administered in a cell-dose-escalation, first-in-human phase I clinical trial ( NCT03970382 ). One patient had grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and one patient had grade 3 encephalitis. All participants had the expected side effects from the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Five patients had stable disease and the other eleven had disease progression as the best response on the therapy. neoTCR transgenic T cells were detected in tumour biopsy samples after infusion at frequencies higher than the native TCRs before infusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and cloning multiple TCRs that recognize mutational neoantigens. Moreover, simultaneous knockout of the endogenous TCR and knock-in of neoTCRs using single-step, non-viral precision genome-editing are achieved. The manufacture of neoTCR engineered T cells at clinical grade, the safety of infusing up to three gene-edited neoTCR T cell products and the ability of the transgenic T cells to traffic to the tumours of patients are also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W4308772150,"Abstract Cytosine base editors (CBEs) are larger and can suffer from higher off-target activity or lower on-target editing efficiency than current adenine base editors (ABEs). To develop a CBE that retains the small size, low off-target activity and high on-target activity of current ABEs, we evolved the highly active deoxyadenosine deaminase TadA-8e to perform cytidine deamination using phage-assisted continuous evolution. Evolved TadA cytidine deaminases contain mutations at DNA-binding residues that alter enzyme selectivity to strongly favor deoxycytidine over deoxyadenosine deamination. Compared to commonly used CBEs, TadA-derived cytosine base editors (TadCBEs) offer similar or higher on-target activity, smaller size and substantially lower Cas-independent DNA and RNA off-target editing activity. We also identified a TadA dual base editor (TadDE) that performs equally efficient cytosine and adenine base editing. TadCBEs support single or multiplexed base editing at therapeutically relevant genomic loci in primary human T cells and primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. TadCBEs expand the utility of CBEs for precision gene editing."
https://openalex.org/W4308882992,"An elastic printed circuit board (E-PCB) is a conductive framework used for the facile assembly of system-level stretchable electronics. E-PCBs require elastic conductors that have high conductivity, high stretchability, tough adhesion to various components, and imperceptible resistance changes even under large strain. We present a liquid metal particle network (LMP Net ) assembled by applying an acoustic field to a solid-state insulating liquid metal particle composite as the elastic conductor. The LMP Net conductor satisfies all the aforementioned requirements and enables the fabrication of a multilayered high-density E-PCB, in which numerous electronic components are intimately integrated to create highly stretchable skin electronics. Furthermore, we could generate the LMP Net in various polymer matrices, including hydrogels, self-healing elastomers, and photoresists, thus showing their potential for use in soft electronics."

https://openalex.org/W4308883689,"T cells are the major arm of the immune system responsible for controlling and regressing cancers. To identify genes limiting T cell function, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Top hits were MED12 and CCNC, components of the Mediator kinase module. Targeted MED12 deletion enhanced antitumor activity and sustained the effector phenotype in CAR- and T cell receptor-engineered T cells, and inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity increased expansion of nonengineered T cells. MED12-deficient T cells manifested increased core Meditator chromatin occupancy at transcriptionally active enhancers-most notably for STAT and AP-1 transcription factors-and increased IL2RA expression and interleukin-2 sensitivity. These results implicate Mediator in T cell effector programming and identify the kinase module as a target for enhancing potency of antitumor T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W4308430919,"A black hole x-ray binary (XRB) system forms when gas is stripped from a normal star and accretes onto a black hole, which heats the gas sufficiently to emit x-rays. We report a polarimetric observation of the XRB Cygnus X-1 using the Imaging x-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The electric field position angle aligns with the outflowing jet, indicating that the jet is launched from the inner x-ray emitting region. The polarization degree is (4.01+-0.20)% at 2 to 8 kiloelectronvolts, implying that the accretion disk is viewed closer to edge-on than the binary orbit. The observations reveal that hot x-ray emitting plasma is spatially extended in a plane perpendicular to the jet axis, not parallel to the jet."

https://openalex.org/W4308771989,"Abstract Garrod’s concept of ‘chemical individuality’ has contributed to comprehension of the molecular origins of human diseases. Untargeted high-throughput metabolomic technologies provide an in-depth snapshot of human metabolism at scale. We studied the genetic architecture of the human plasma metabolome using 913 metabolites assayed in 19,994 individuals and identified 2,599 variant–metabolite associations ( P &lt; 1.25 × 10 −11 ) within 330 genomic regions, with rare variants (minor allele frequency ≤ 1%) explaining 9.4% of associations. Jointly modeling metabolites in each region, we identified 423 regional, co-regulated, variant–metabolite clusters called genetically influenced metabotypes. We assigned causal genes for 62.4% of these genetically influenced metabotypes, providing new insights into fundamental metabolite physiology and clinical relevance, including metabolite-guided discovery of potential adverse drug effects ( DPYD and SRD5A2 ). We show strong enrichment of inborn errors of metabolism-causing genes, with examples of metabolite associations and clinical phenotypes of non-pathogenic variant carriers matching characteristics of the inborn errors of metabolism. Systematic, phenotypic follow-up of metabolite-specific genetic scores revealed multiple potential etiological relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4309362357,"Fishing activity is closely monitored to an increasing degree, but its effects on biodiversity have not received such attention. Using iconic and well-studied fish species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks, we calculate a continuous Red List Index of yearly changes in extinction risk over 70 years to track progress toward global sustainability and biodiversity targets. We show that this well-established biodiversity indicator is highly sensitive and responsive to fishing mortality. After ~58 years of increasing risk of extinction, effective fisheries management has shifted the biodiversity loss curve for tunas and billfishes, whereas the curve continues to worsen for sharks, which are highly undermanaged. While populations of highly valuable commercial species are being rebuilt, the next management challenge is to halt and reverse the harm afflicted by these same fisheries to broad oceanic biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4308767144,"Highly regenerative tissues continuously produce terminally differentiated cells to replace those that are lost. How they orchestrate the complex transition from undifferentiated stem cells towards post-mitotic, molecularly distinct and often spatially segregated differentiated populations is not well understood. In the adult skin epidermis, the stem cell compartment contains molecularly heterogeneous subpopulations1-4 whose relationship to the complete trajectory of differentiation remains unknown. Here we show that differentiation, from commitment to exit from the stem cell layer, is a multi-day process wherein cells transit through a continuum of transcriptional changes with upregulation of differentiation genes preceding downregulation of typical stemness genes. Differentiation-committed cells remain capable of dividing to produce daughter cells fated to further differentiate, demonstrating that differentiation is uncoupled from cell cycle exit. These cell divisions are not required as part of an obligate transit-amplifying programme but help to buffer the differentiating cell pool during heightened demand. Thus, instead of distinct contributions from multiple progenitors, a continuous gradual differentiation process fuels homeostatic epidermal turnover."

https://openalex.org/W4308766006,"Abstract In vitro transcription (IVT) is a DNA-templated process for synthesizing long RNA transcripts, including messenger RNA (mRNA). For many research and commercial applications, IVT of mRNA is typically performed using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) owing to its ability to produce full-length RNA transcripts with high fidelity; however, T7 RNAP can also produce immunostimulatory byproducts such as double-stranded RNA that can affect protein expression. Such byproducts require complex purification processes, using methods such as reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, to yield safe and effective mRNA-based medicines. To minimize the need for downstream purification processes, we rationally and computationally engineered a double mutant of T7 RNAP that produces substantially less immunostimulatory RNA during IVT compared with wild-type T7 RNAP. The resulting mutant allows for a simplified production process with similar mRNA potency, lower immunostimulatory content and quicker manufacturing time compared with wild-type T7 RNAP. Herein, we describe the computational design and development of this improved T7 RNAP variant."

https://openalex.org/W4308658038,"The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically causes lung disease but can also disseminate to other tissues. We identified a M. tuberculosis (Mtb) outbreak presenting with unusually high rates of extrapulmonary dissemination and bone disease. We found that the causal strain carried an ancestral full-length version of the type VII-secreted effector EsxM rather than the truncated version present in other modern Mtb lineages. The ancestral EsxM variant exacerbated dissemination through enhancement of macrophage motility, increased egress of macrophages from established granulomas, and alterations in macrophage actin dynamics. Reconstitution of the ancestral version of EsxM in an attenuated modern strain of Mtb altered the migratory mode of infected macrophages, enhancing their motility. In a zebrafish model, full-length EsxM promoted bone disease. The presence of a derived nonsense variant in EsxM throughout the major Mtb lineages 2, 3, and 4 is consistent with a role for EsxM in regulating the extent of dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W4308883149,"Creep, the time-dependent deformation of materials stressed below the yield strength, is responsible for a great number of component failures at high temperatures. Because grain boundaries (GBs) in materials usually facilitate diffusional processes in creep, eliminating GBs is a primary approach to resisting high-temperature creep in metals, such as in single-crystal superalloy turbo blades. We report a different strategy to inhibiting creep by use of stable GB networks. Plastic deformation triggered structural relaxation of high-density GBs in nanograined single-phased nickel-cobalt-chromium alloys, forming networks of stable GBs interlocked with abundant twin boundaries. The stable GB networks effectively inhibit diffusional creep processes at high temperatures. We obtained an unprecedented creep resistance, with creep rates of ~10 –7 per second under gigapascal stress at 700°C (~61% melting point), outperforming that of conventional superalloys."
https://openalex.org/W4308884038,"Short-duration rainfall extremes can cause flash flooding with associated impacts. Previous studies of climate impacts on extreme precipitation have focused mainly on daily rain totals. Subdaily extremes are often generated in small areas that can be missed by gauge networks or satellites and are not resolved by climate models. Here, we show a robust positive trend of at least 20% per decade in subhourly extreme rainfall near Sydney, Australia, over 20 years, despite no evidence of trends at hourly or daily scales. This trend is seen consistently in storms tracked using multiple independent ground radars, is consistent with rain-gauge data, and does not appear to be associated with known natural variations. This finding suggests that subhourly rainfall extremes may be increasing substantially faster than those on more widely reported time scales."

https://openalex.org/W4308791755,"Immune checkpoint antibodies in cancer treatment are receptor-ligand pairs that modulate cancer immunity. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has emerged as one of the major targets in cancer immunotherapy. Atezolizumab, the first anti-PD-L1 antibody approved for the treatment of metastatic urothelial, non-small cell lung, small cell lung and triple-negative breast cancers, is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells with several limitations i.e., high-production costs, low-capacity yields, and contamination risks. Due to the rapid scalability and low production costs, the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was investigated by co-infiltration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 cultures harboring the nucleic acid sequences encoding for Atezolizumab heavy chain and light chain in this study. The transient expression of Atezolizumab in transformed N . benthamiana accumulated up to 86.76 μg/g fresh leaf weight after 6 days of agroinfiltration (OD 600 nm: 0.4) with 1:1 ratio of heavy chain to light chain. The structural and functional characteristics of plant-produced Atezolizumab was compared with commercially available Tecentriq ® from CHO cells with similar binding efficacies to PD-L1 receptor. The direct anti-cancer effect of plant-produced anti-PD-L1 was further performed in human lung metastatic cancer cells H460 cultured under detachment condition, demonstrating the activity of anti-PD-L1-antibody on sensitizing anoikis as well as the suppression on anti-apoptosis proteins (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) and modulation of epithelial to mesenchymal regulating proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail and Slug). In conclusion, this study manifests plants as an alternative cost-effective platform for the production of functional monoclonal antibodies for use in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4308883140,"The fine structure constant, $\alpha$, sets the strength of the electromagnetic force. The Standard Model of particle physics provides no explanation for its value, which could potentially vary. The wavelengths of stellar absorption lines depend on $\alpha$, but are subject to systematic effects owing to astrophysical processes in stellar atmospheres. We measured precise line wavelengths using 17 stars, selected to have almost identical atmospheric properties to those of the Sun (solar twins), which reduces those systematic effects. We found that $\alpha$ varies by $\lesssim$50 parts-per-billion (ppb) within 50 parsecs from Earth. Combining the results from all 17 stars provides an empirical, local reference for stellar measurements of $\alpha$ with an ensemble precision of 12 ppb."
https://openalex.org/W4308387671,"Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, has beneficial metabolic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Although the high efficacy of liraglutide as an anti-diabetic and anti-obesity drug is well known, liraglutide-induced metabolic alterations in diverse tissues remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the changes in metabolic profiles induced by a 2-week subcutaneous injection of liraglutide in diet-induced obese mice fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Our comprehensive metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus, plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle showed that liraglutide intervention led to various metabolic alterations in comparison with diet-induced obese or nonobese mice. We found that liraglutide remarkably coordinated not only fatty acid metabolism in the hypothalamus and skeletal muscle but also amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism in plasma and liver. Comparative analyses of metabolite dynamics revealed that liraglutide rewired intertissue metabolic correlations. Our study points to a previously unappreciated metabolic alteration by liraglutide in several tissues, which may underlie its therapeutic effects within and across the tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4308766739,"The implementation of recommendations for type 2 diabetes (T2D) screening and diagnosis focuses on the measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose. This approach leaves a large number of individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT), who are only detectable through oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), at risk of diabetes and its severe complications. We applied machine learning to the proteomic profiles of a single fasted sample from 11,546 participants of the Fenland study to test discrimination of iIGT defined using the gold-standard OGTTs. We observed significantly improved discriminative performance by adding only three proteins (RTN4R, CBPM and GHR) to the best clinical model (AUROC = 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.79–0.86), P = 0.004), which we validated in an external cohort. Increased plasma levels of these candidate proteins were associated with an increased risk for future T2D in an independent cohort and were also increased in individuals genetically susceptible to impaired glucose homeostasis and T2D. Assessment of a limited number of proteins can identify individuals likely to be missed by current diagnostic strategies and at high risk of T2D and its complications. A new study combines large-scale proteomics and machine learning to identify proteins that can be used to identify individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance, who would otherwise only be detectable with oral glucose tolerance tests."
https://openalex.org/W4308772005,"Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are key to the treatment-refractory desmoplastic phenotype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and have received considerable attention as a stromal target for cancer therapy. This approach demands detailed understanding of their pro- and anti-tumourigenic effects. Interrogating PSC-cancer cell interactions in 3D models, we identified nuclear FGFR1 as critical for PSC-led invasion of cancer cells. ChIP-seq analysis of FGFR1 in PSCs revealed a number of FGFR1 interaction sites within the genome, notably NRG1, which encodes the ERBB ligand Neuregulin. We show that nuclear FGFR1 regulates transcription of NRG1, which in turn acts in autocrine fashion through an ERBB2/4 heterodimer to promote invasion. In support of this, recombinant NRG1 in 3D model systems rescued the loss of invasion incurred by FGFR inhibition. In vivo we demonstrate that, while FGFR inhibition does not affect the growth of pancreatic tumours in mice, local invasion into the pancreas is reduced. Thus, FGFR and NRG1 may present new stromal targets for PDAC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4308882826,"Overcoming replicative senescence is an essential step during oncogenesis, and the reactivation of TERT through promoter mutations is a common mechanism. TERT promoter mutations are acquired in about 75% of melanomas but are not sufficient to maintain telomeres, suggesting that additional mutations are required. We identified a cluster of variants in the promoter of ACD encoding the shelterin component TPP1. ACD promoter variants are present in about 5% of cutaneous melanoma and co-occur with TERT promoter mutations. The two most common somatic variants create or modify binding sites for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, similar to mutations in the TERT promoter. The variants increase the expression of TPP1 and function together with TERT to synergistically lengthen telomeres. Our findings suggest that TPP1 promoter variants collaborate with TERT activation to enhance telomere maintenance and immortalization in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W4308884535,"Group II introns are ribozymes that catalyze their self-excision and function as retroelements that invade DNA. As retrotransposons, group II introns form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that roam the genome, integrating by reversal of forward splicing. Here we show that retrotransposition is achieved by a tertiary complex between a structurally elaborate ribozyme, its protein mobility factor, and a structured DNA substrate. We solved cryo-electron microscopy structures of an intact group IIC intron-maturase retroelement that was poised for integration into a DNA stem-loop motif. By visualizing the RNP before and after DNA targeting, we show that it is primed for attack and fits perfectly with its DNA target. This study reveals design principles of a prototypical retroelement and reinforces the hypothesis that group II introns are ancient elements of genetic diversification."
https://openalex.org/W4308386314,"Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, shows some potent antitumor effects. However, the molecular mechanism of metformin in tumor suppression has not been clarified. Here, we provided evidence using in vitro and in vivo data that metformin inhibited mevalonate pathway by downregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1), a key enzyme in this pathway. Our results further demonstrated that metformin downregulated HMGCS1 expression through inhibition of transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2. In addition, we determined that HMGCS1 was highly expressed in human liver and lung cancer tissues and associated with lower survival rates. In summary, our study indicated that metformin suppresses tumorigenesis through inhibition of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2-HMGCS1 axis, which might be a potential target in cancer prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4308463272,"Stromal Interaction Molecule1 (STIM1) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-localized calcium (Ca2+) sensor that plays a critical role in the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway. STIM1 regulates a variety of physiological processes and contributes to a plethora of pathophysiological conditions. Several disease states and enhanced biological phenomena are associated with increased STIM1 levels and activity. However, molecular mechanisms driving STIM1 expression remain largely unappreciated. We recently reported that STIM1 expression augments during pigmentation. Nonetheless, the molecular choreography regulating STIM1 expression in melanocytes is completely unexplored. Here, we characterized the molecular events that regulate STIM1 expression during pigmentation. We demonstrate that physiological melanogenic stimuli α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH) increases STIM1 mRNA and protein levels. Further, αMSH stimulates STIM1 promoter-driven luciferase activity, thereby suggesting transcriptional upregulation of STIM1. We show that downstream of αMSH, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) drives STIM1 expression. By performing knockdown and overexpression studies, we corroborated that MITF regulates STIM1 expression and SOCE. Next, we conducted extensive bioinformatics analysis and identified MITF-binding sites on the STIM1 promoter. We validated significance of the MITF-binding sites in controlling STIM1 expression by performing ChIP and luciferase assays with truncated STIM1 promoters. Moreover, we confirmed MITF's role in regulating STIM1 expression and SOCE in primary human melanocytes. Importantly, analysis of publicly available datasets substantiates a positive correlation between STIM1 and MITF expression in sun-exposed tanned human skin, thereby highlighting physiological relevance of this regulation. Taken together, we have identified a novel physiologically relevant molecular pathway that transcriptionally enhances STIM1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W4308791827,"Recently, the role of social determinants of health on frailty and dementia has received increased attention. The aim of the present study is to explore the association of social determinants on cognitive impairment, frailty, and self-rated health. As health is influenced by many factors, we also examine other health determinants including lifestyle, health seeking behaviour, socio-demographics, and multimorbidity in the analysis.Cross-sectional analysis of the Healthy Older People Everyday (HOPE) study in Singapore was carried out on 998 older adults above the age of 65. We used forward stepwise multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses to assess the association of five health determinants (social determinants, lifestyle, health seeking behaviour, socio-demographics and multimorbidity) on frailty, cognitive impairment, and self-rated health.Mean age of participants was 71.1 ± 0.2 years; 154 (15.4%) were cognitively impaired; 430 (43.1%) were pre-frail or frail; mean self-rated health was 80.4 ± 15.6. Social determinants contributed between 29% to 57% of the overall variation found in the full model with all five health determinants adjusted for. Participants with higher education had significantly lower odds of cognitive impairment and frailty. Leisure physical activity was significantly associated with lower odds of frailty and cognitive impairment, and better self-rated health.Understanding the dynamics of different health determinants is crucial to protect the vulnerable in an ageing population. Our study highlights the need for a multidimensional, multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach in the prevention of frailty, cognitive impairment, and associated disability."

The assessments of acute PE of all patients on a per-location basis were compared between the 40 keV VMI+ and the standard mixed datasets (reference standard) with a two-week interval.This study consisted of 64 patients (33 women and 31 men; mean age, 60.2 years; range 18-90 years), with a total of 512 locations. The interobserver agreement (Kappa) for detection of acute PE using the 40 keV VMI+ images and the standard mixed CT images were 0.7478 and 0.8750 respectively. The area under receiver operating characteristics (AuROC) for diagnosis of acute PE using the 40 keV VMI+ was 0.882. Four locations (0.78%) revealed a false negative result. Hypodense filling defects were identified in twelve locations (1.95%) in the 40 keV VMI+ images but had been interpreted as a negative study in the standard mixed CT images. The repeated reviews revealed that each location contained a hypodense filling defect but was overlooked on the standard mixed CT images.Low-energy VMI + DSDECT images have beneficial in improving the diagnostic value of acute PE in doubtful or disregarded standard mixed images."
https://openalex.org/W4308883556,Emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants in India are important contributors to climate change and health damages. This study estimates current emissions from India's electricity sector and simulates the state-level implications of climate change and air pollution policies. We find that (i) a carbon tax results in little short-term emissions reductions because there is not enough dispatchable lower emission spare capacity to substitute coal; (ii) moving toward regional dispatch markets rather than state-level dispatch decisions will not lead to emissions reductions; (iii) policies that have modest emissions effects at the national level nonetheless have disparate state-level emissions impacts; and (iv) pricing or incentive mechanisms tied to production or consumption will result in markedly different costs to states.
https://openalex.org/W4308914270,"The aim of this study was to quantify and contextualize sprinting actions (≥ 7.0 m/s) of English Premier League (EPL) soccer match-play with respect to the movement skills and patterns employed. Video footage (3.2.6, Premier League DVMS, ChyronHego) and raw video-based locomotor coordinates of 901 sprint efforts from 10 matches of an EPL soccer team (2017–2018), were evaluated using the Football Sprint Movement Classification System pertaining to transition, initiation, and actualisation of sprint movement skills and patterns. The results from a one-way ANOVA or independent t-test revealed that, generally, most sprinting actions begun from a linear initiation position compared to lateral or rear (63%, d = 5.0–5.3, p &lt; 0.01), without a change of direction (COD) (48%, d = 4.9–5.6, p &lt; 0.01) compared to lateral, front-back, back-front, and from forward travelling (linear and diagonal) transition movements (68%, d = 2.1–5.7, p &lt; 0.01) compared to lateral or rear. Additionally, most sprints were initiated with a rolling acceleration (66%, d = 3.2, p &lt; 0.01) compared to explosive acceleration, often performed with a degree of curvature (86%, d = 7.2, p &lt; 0.01) compared to linear, with torso rotation (62%, d = 2.7, p &lt; 0.01) compared to no rotation, and typically end with an action such as duelling with an opponent or involvement with the ball (49%). Additionally, the sprint movement characteristics proportions slightly differed across playing positions. Overall, this study confirms that sprints during EPL soccer matches are initiated from and performed with a variety of different movement skills and patterns in relation to different sport-specific outcomes. This data can be used to assist in the development of more effective physical preparation programmes, inform position-specific contextualized sprinting drills to achieve better specificity and potential transfer of training, while also informing speed testing protocols."
https://openalex.org/W4308460798,"The poisonous metalloid arsenite induces widespread misfolding and aggregation of nascent proteins in vivo, and this mode of toxic action might underlie its suspected role in the pathology of certain protein misfolding diseases. Evolutionarily conserved protein quality-control systems protect cells against arsenite-mediated proteotoxicity, and herein, we systematically assessed the contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the autophagy-vacuole pathway, and chaperone-mediated disaggregation to the clearance of arsenite-induced protein aggregates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is the main pathway that clears aggregates formed during arsenite stress and that cells depend on this pathway for optimal growth. The autophagy-vacuole pathway and chaperone-mediated disaggregation both contribute to clearance, but their roles appear less prominent than the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our in vitro assays with purified components of the yeast disaggregating machinery demonstrated that chaperone binding to aggregates formed in the presence of arsenite is impaired. Hsp104 and Hsp70 chaperone activity was unaffected by arsenite, suggesting that this metalloid influences aggregate structure, making them less accessible for chaperone-mediated disaggregation. We further show that the defect in chaperone-mediated refolding of a model protein was abrogated in a cysteine-free version of the substrate, suggesting that arsenite directly modifies cysteines in non-native target proteins. In conclusion, our study sheds novel light on the differential contributions of protein quality-control systems to aggregate clearance and cell proliferation and extends our understanding of how these systems operate during arsenite stress."
https://openalex.org/W4308791547,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about serious consequences in business world practices. Among these, flexible working policies have increased to a great extent. This has resulted in serious problems in the work-life balance. In this context, conditions such as having children and marital status have been important factors that can affect work engagement among flexible workers in the post pandemic era. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship of marital status, job experience and having children with work engagement among white-collar workers who work in flexible hours. Data is collected through surveys from 199 flexible working employees. ANOVA and T-tests were employed to analyze the data. The results indicate that only one of the sub-dimensions of work engagement–namely absorption- changes according to their marital status, and yet, the work engagement is not related to having children. In addition, it is seen that there is a significant relationship between job experience and work engagement."

A pre-post-test, randomized, quasi-experimental design was used. Thirty-five female students were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. The control group (n = 17) attended a traditional lecture and video lab demonstration (VLD), while the experimental group (n = 18) participated in SB-VLS on molecular cloning. Findings revealed statistically significant differences, with large effects sizes in the SB-VLS group between pre- and post-test in intrinsic motivation (2.9 vs 3.86, p = 0.042, Cohen's d = 4.17), self-efficacy (3.31 vs 3.85, p = 0.002, Cohen's d = 1.071), and knowledge gain scales (50.93 vs 75.93, p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.46). Moreover, between-group effect sizes of the experimental and control groups were also large for intrinsic motivation (dppc2 = 1.441), self-efficacy (dppc2 = 0.766), and knowledge (dppc2 = 1.147), indicating that the effect of the SB-VLS was significant, which may be due to the activities and techniques used in SB-VLS to develop learning outcomes. Additionally, the SB-VLS group had statistically better lab report scores as compared to the control group (3.92 vs. 4.72, p &lt; 0.0001). Collectively, our data show that SB-VLS is an innovative teaching strategy and an effective tool for developing non-cognitive and cognitive skills, especially scientific report writing skills."

This study aimed to identify changes in adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and physical activity (PA) and associations with personality during lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, a convenient sample of 543 adults in Qatar completed an online questionnaire consisting of validated tools to measure adherence to MD (MEDAS questionnaire, score ranges 0–13), PA (IPAQ, assessing light, moderate high intensity PA) and personality (BFI-10, categorizing individuals’ personalities). The majority of the participants were female (89%), aged between 21 and 29 years (45%). The overall MD adherence decreased during lockdown (5.9 vs. 6.1, p &lt; 0.001). There was an increase in olive oil (9% vs. 12%; p &lt; 0.001), vegetables (54.3% vs. 58.7%; p = 0.005), legumes (11.8% vs. 15.3%; p = 0.007), sofrito (70.9% vs. 77.3%; p &lt; 0.001) and fat (45.9% vs. 53.8%; p &lt; 0.001) consumption and a decrease in fresh fruit (39.4% vs. 15.8%; p &lt; 0.001) and fish/seafood (5.9% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.0035) consumption during lockdown. Met-min/week values of total PA (1330.5 vs. 1836.7), vigorous activity (711.5 vs. 867.4), moderate activity (208.3 vs. 301.3), and walking (410.7 vs. 668.0) all decreased during lockdown (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.010, p = 0.010 p &lt; 0.001, respectively), while sitting increased (3837.3 vs. 2896.4 p &lt; 0.001). The extraversion personality dimension had a higher MD adherence (p = 0.039) compared to agreeableness before lockdown. No changes in MEDAS scores were observed during lockdown in those with high levels of openness. Openness was positively associated with all PA ( p = 0.027), including walking ( p = 0.026), and negatively associated with sitting ( p = 0.038) before lockdown, while participants with high scores for neuroticism were less likely to be sitting during lockdown ( p = 0.042). The findings can be used to guide the development of appropriate personality-tailored lifestyle interventions."

https://openalex.org/W4308914579,"Collaboration across sectors is critical to address complex health problems, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the ability to collaborate during the pandemic as part of a baseline evaluation of an intersectoral network of healthcare and community organizations established to improve the collective response to transgender (trans) persons who have been sexually assaulted (the trans-LINK Network). A validated social network analysis survey was sent to 119 member organizations in Ontario, Canada. Survey respondents were asked, 'Has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's ability to collaborate with other organizations on the support of trans survivors of sexual assault?' and 'How has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's ability to collaborate within the trans-LINK Network?'. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Seventy-eight member organizations participated in the survey (response rate = 66%). Most organizations (79%) indicated that the pandemic had affected their ability to collaborate with others in the network, citing most commonly, increased workload (77%), increased demand for services (57%), and technical and digital challenges (50%). Survey findings were shared in a stakeholder consultation with 22 representatives of 21 network member organizations. Stakeholders provided suggestions to prevent and address the challenges, barriers, and disruptions in serving trans survivors experienced during the pandemic, which were organized into themes. Seven themes were generated and used as a scaffold for the development of recommendations to advance the network, including: increase communication and knowledge exchange among member organizations through the establishment of a network discussion forum and capacity building group workshops; enhance awareness of network organizations by developing a member-facing directory of member services, their contributions, and ability to provide specific supports; strengthen capacity to provide virtual and in-person services and programs through enhanced IT support and increased opportunities for knowledge sharing and skill development; and adopt a network wide syndemic approach that addresses co-occurring epidemics (COVID-19 + racism, housing insecurity, transphobia, xenophobia) that impact trans survivors of sexual assault."
https://openalex.org/W4308914801,"Combining chemotherapeutic (CT) and chemopreventive (CP) agents for cancer treatment is controversial, and the issue has not yet been conclusively resolved. In this study, by integrating text mining and protein-protein interaction (PPI), the combined effects of these two kinds of agents in cancer treatment were investigated. First, text mining was performed by the Pathway Studio database to study the effects of various agents (CP and CT) on cancer-related processes. Then, each group's most important hub genes were obtained by calculating different centralities. Finally, the results of in silico analysis were validated by examining the combined effects of hesperetin (Hst) and vincristine (VCR) on MCF-7 cells. In general, the results of the in silico analysis revealed that the combination of these two kinds of agents could be useful for treating cancer. However, the PPI analysis revealed that there were a few important proteins that could be targeted for intelligent therapy while giving treatment with these agents. In vitro experiments confirmed the results of the in silico analysis. Also, Hst and VCR had good harmony in modulating the hub genes obtained from the in silico analysis and inducing apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W4308464396,"Cartwheel assembly is considered the first step in the initiation of procentriole biogenesis; however, the reason for persistence of the assembled human cartwheel structure from S phase to late mitosis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate mainly using cell synchronization, RNA interference, immunofluorescence and time-lapse-microscopy, biochemical analysis, and methods that the cartwheel persistently assembles and maintains centriole engagement and centrosome integrity during S phase to late G2 phase. Blockade of the continuous accumulation of centriolar Sas-6, a major cartwheel protein, after procentriole formation induces premature centriole disengagement and disrupts pericentriolar matrix integrity. Additionally, we determined that during mitosis, CDK1-cyclin B phosphorylates Sas-6 at T495 and S510, disrupting its binding to cartwheel component STIL and pericentriolar component Nedd1 and promoting cartwheel disassembly and centriole disengagement. Perturbation of this phosphorylation maintains the accumulation of centriolar Sas-6 and retains centriole engagement during mitotic exit, which results in the inhibition of centriole reduplication. Collectively, these data demonstrate that persistent cartwheel assembly after procentriole formation maintains centriole engagement and that this configuration is relieved through phosphorylation of Sas-6 by CDK1-cyclin B during mitosis in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W4308770578,"Many therapeutic bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are in clinical trials. A modular and efficient process to create BiTEs would accelerate their development and clinical applicability. In this study, we present the design, production, and functional activity of a novel bispecific format utilizing synthetic orthogonal heterodimers to form a multichain modular design. Further addition of an immunoglobulin hinge region allowed a stable covalent linkage between the heterodimers. As proof-of-concept, we utilized CD33 and CD3 binding scFvs to engage leukemia cells and T-cells respectively. We provide evidence that this novel bispecific T-cell engager (termed IgGlue-BiTE) could bind both CD3+ and CD33+ cells and facilitates robust T-cell mediated cytotoxicity on AML cells in vitro. In a mouse model of minimal residual disease, we showed that the novel IgGlue-BiTE greatly extended survival, and mice of this treatment group were free of leukemia in the bone marrow. These findings suggest that the IgGlue-BiTE allows for robust simultaneous engagement with both antigens of interest in a manner conducive to T cell cytotoxicity against AML. These results suggest a compelling modular system for bispecific antibodies, as the CD3- and CD33-binding domains can be readily swapped with domains binding to other cancer- or immune cell-specific antigens."
https://openalex.org/W4308791331,"In the Anthropocene the consequences of land-use transformation on ecosystem services are of growing concern, particularly in fragile areas of mountain agriculture that often represent high nature-value farmland. This study uses a decadal repeated survey approach to analyse the effects of modernisation on oasis systems in the Jabal Al Akhdar region of northern Oman. This rugged mountain region at the north-eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula experiences a growing influx of regional and international tourists since the opening of a modern highway 15 years ago. In 2007, at the onset of transformation processes, a survey was conducted with all households (HH) located in three major settlements along the 1000-m-altitude gradient of the Wadi Muaydin watershed. The survey was repeated in 2018, including all remaining HH of the three settlements. This longitudinal approach allowed studying the consequences of social-ecological transformation processes on crop and livestock husbandry, agricultural labour use, product marketing, and perception of the region’s future by its local residents. Though the village inhabitants are aging and declining in numbers, they still adhere to agriculture, largely because of tradition and identity. Fallowing and abandoning farmland increased over the investigated time span but was paralleled by increased application of agrochemicals and animal manure on fields, purchase of roughage and concentrate feeds for small ruminants, concentration on cash crop and meat production for sale, and increased employment of migrant workers. These indicators of modernisation of oasis agriculture are accompanied by predominantly pessimistic views on future prospects of oasis farming. Commonly perceived problems are shortage of irrigation water and profound societal change. Against these challenges, value chain generation and direct marketing opportunities for local agricultural produce are seen as prerequisites to keep the high nature-value farmland of these mountain oases alive."
https://openalex.org/W4308791607,"The estimation of physical parameters from data analyses is a crucial process for the description and modeling of many complex systems. Based on Rényi α-Gaussian distribution and patched Green's function (PGF) techniques, we propose a robust framework for data inversion using a wave-equation based methodology named full-waveform inversion (FWI). From the assumption that the residual seismic data (the difference between the modeled and observed data) obeys the Rényi α-Gaussian probability distribution, we introduce an outlier-resistant criterion to deal with erratic measures in the FWI context, in which the classical FWI based on l2-norm is a particular case. The new misfit function arises from the probabilistic maximum-likelihood method associated with the α-Gaussian distribution. The PGF technique works on the forward modeling process by dividing the computational domain into outside target area and target area, where the wave equation is solved only once on the outside target (before FWI). During the FWI processing, Green's functions related only to the target area are computed instead of the entire computational domain, saving computational efforts. We show the effectiveness of our proposed approach by considering two distinct realistic P-wave velocity models, in which the first one is inspired in the Kwanza Basin in Angola and the second in a region of great economic interest in the Brazilian pre-salt field. We call our proposal by the abbreviation α-PGF-FWI. The results reveal that the α-PGF-FWI is robust against additive Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian noise with outliers in the limit α → 2/3, being α the Rényi entropic index."

https://openalex.org/W4308914580,"Revealing the patterns and influencing mechanisms of spatial and temporal distribution of rural settlements is crucial for rural revitalization and sustainable development. However, our limited understanding of the rural settlements in China's ethnic minority border areas has hindered the process of their agricultural and rural modernization. Based on data on rural settlements in Inner Mongolia, China in four periods between 1990 and 2020, this study reveals its spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and describes the dynamic transformation process of settlement. Using a geographical detector approach, 17 factors are explored to identify the influencing mechanisms of each factor on the distribution of rural settlements in different regions. The results show obvious regional differences in the spatial distribution of rural settlements in Inner Mongolia, with the largest kernel density values in the west (Hetao irrigation area) and higher kernel densities in the central (Hohhot) and the east (Chifeng and Tongliao). While rural population decreases, rural settlements expand into cultivated land, grassland, and unused land resources. Its spatial distribution is significantly influenced by the factors of distance to cultivated land, distance to towns, and population density. The east of the study area is mainly controlled by temperature, while vegetation type and vegetation coverage have a greater impact in the west. The interactions between two influencing factors possess bilinear or nonlinear enhancement relationships. This study enriches the understanding of the rural settlements in ethnic minority border areas, which provide reference for the improvement of rural human settlement environment in Inner Mongolia."
https://openalex.org/W4308915669,"Recently, we have created ‘artificial cells’ with an architecture mimicking that of typical eukaryotic cells. Our design uses common biopolymers like alginate and chitosan to create multi-compartment capsules (MCCs) via oil-free microfluidics. MCCs (~ 500 μm in diameter) can be engineered with multiple inner compartments, each with a distinct payload. This mimics the distinct organelles in eukaryotic cells, each of which has unique properties. In this study, we encapsulate microbial cells from two distinct kingdoms — Pseudomonas aeruginosa (bacteria) and Candida albicans (fungi) — in the inner compartments of MCCs. The two microbes are commonly found in biofilms at sites of infection in humans. We first demonstrate that the MCC can serve as a simple platform to observe the comparative growth of the cells in real time. Unlike typical co-culture in solution or on agar plates, the cells can grow in their own compartments without direct physical contact. Moreover, the hydrogel matrix in the compartments mimics the three-dimensional (3-D) environment that cells naturally encounter during their growth. Small molecules added to the solution are shown to permeate through the capsule walls and affect cell growth: for example, cationic surfactants inhibit the fungi but not the bacteria. Conversely, low pH and kanamycin inhibit the bacteria but not the fungi. Also, when the bacteria are present in adjacent compartments, the fungal cells mostly stay in a yeast morphology, meaning as spheroidal cells. In contrast, in the absence of the bacteria, the fungi transition into hyphae , i.e., long multicellular filaments. The inhibition of this morphological switch in fungal cells is shown to be induced by signaling molecules (specifically, the quorum sensing autoinducer-1 or AI-1) secreted by the bacteria. Thus, the MCC platform can also be used to detect cross-kingdom signaling between the compartmentalized microbes."
