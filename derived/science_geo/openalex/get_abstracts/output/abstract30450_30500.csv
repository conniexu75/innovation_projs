https://openalex.org/W1542941723,"The treatment of HL-60 myelocytic leukemia cells with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) resulted in the activation of a neutral sphingomyelinase and in sphingomyelin turnover (Okazaki, T., Bell, R., and Hannun, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). In this paper, the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, ceramide, and the possible function of ceramide as a lipid mediator of the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cell differentiation were investigated. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in ceramide mass levels. Ceramide levels peaked at 2 h following treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 with an increase of 41% over base line. The mass of generated ceramide (13 +/- 2 pmol/nmol of phospholipid) agreed with the mass of hydrolyzed sphingomyelin (17 +/- 4 pmol/nmol of phospholipid). Cell-permeable ceramides with shorter N-acyl chains induced HL-60 cell differentiation at subthreshold concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Higher concentrations of cell-permeable ceramides potently induced HL-60 cell differentiation independent of 1,25-(OH)2D3. A 2-h exposure of HL-60 cells to N-acetyl-sphingosine was sufficient to cause differentiation. Morphologically, N-acetylsphingosine caused a similar monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells as did 1,25-(OH)2D3. Exogenous ceramide was further metabolized to sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, but no conversion to sphingosine was detected. Moreover, sphingosine and its analogs failed to affect monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells in response to subthreshold 1,25-(OH)2D3, indicating that the effect of ceramide was independent of sphingosine generation. These studies demonstrate that ceramide is a lipid mediator that may transduce the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1503977217,"Homogeneous native and recombinant porcine liver thioltransferase (glutaredoxin), bovine thymus and human placenta thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) were examined for dehydroascorbate reductase activity (EC 1.8.5.1) involving the direct catalytic reduction of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) by glutathione. Each enzyme had substantial activity with apparent Km and Vmax for dehydroascorbate between 0.2 and 2.2 mM and 6-27 nmol min-1, respectively, and for gluathione between 1.6 and 8.7 mM and 11-30 nmol min-1, respectively. In the presence of purified bovine liver thioredoxin reductase, homogeneous bovine liver thioredoxin failed to reduce DHA to ascorbic acid as measured by NADPH oxidation. Highly purified bovine liver protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) reacted directly with DHA and GSH to catalyze the reduction of DHA to ascorbic acid. The apparent Km for DHA was 1.0 mM and the Vmax was 8 nmol min-1, and for GSH were 3.9 mM and 14 nmol min-1, respectively. These results suggest that thioltransferase and PDI contribute to the regeneration of oxidized ascorbic acid in mammalian cells, and based on their cellular location, thioltransferase is proposed to be the major cytoplasmic activity, whereas interaction of DHA with microsomal membrane PDI may catalyze regeneration of ascorbic acid and initiate oxidation of intralumenal protein thiols to disulfides."
https://openalex.org/W1492473590,"A monospecific polyclonal antiserum against deglycosylated human pancreatic tumor mucin was used to select human pancreatic mucin cDNA clones from a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library developed from a human pancreatic tumor cell line. The full-length 4.4-kilobase mucin cDNA sequence included a 72-base pair 5‘-untranslated region and a 307-base pair 3‘-untranslated region. The predicted amino acid sequence for this cDNA revealed a protein of 122,071 daltons containing 1,255 amino acid residues of which greater than 60% were serine, threonine, proline, alanine, and glycine. Approximately two-thirds of the protein sequence consisted of identical 20-amino acid tandem repeats which were flanked by degenerate tandem repeats and nontandem repeat sequences on both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends. The amino acid sequence also contained five putative N-linked glycosylation sites, a putative signal sequence and transmembrane domain, and numerous serine and threonine residues (potential O-linked glycosylation sites) outside and within the tandem repeat position. The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the pancreatic mucin sequence was over 99% homologous with a mucin cDNA sequence derived from breast tumor mucin, even though the native forms of these molecules are quite distinct in size and degree of glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1482599777,Nicotinic receptor-mediated secretion of catecholamines from individual cultured bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells was measured and characterized with a voltametric microelectrode placed adjacent to the cells. Nicotine-induced secretion is associated with a large increase in chemical spikes that is temporally resolved into the apparent secretion of discrete packets of attomole quantities of easily oxidized molecules. These data are consistent with direct chemical measurement of single exocytotic events.
https://openalex.org/W1595986566,"The oxygen dependence of mitochondrial respiration was investigated using suspensions of mitochondria and quiescent ventricular myocytes isolated from adult rat hearts. A new optical method was used to determine oxygen concentration in the suspending media. The P50 for respiration for coupled mitochondria at a high [ATP]/[ADP].[Pi] ratio and oxidizing glutamate/malate was 0.45 +/- 0.03 microM but was increased to 0.57 +/- 0.02 microM by the addition of succinate to the substrate mixture. This value was decreased to less than 0.06 +/- 0.01 microM when the ATP/ADP.Pi ratio was decreased with the uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. The P50 value in resting myocytes was 2.23 +/- 0.13 microM at a Vmax of 13.22 +/- 1.38 nmol of O2/g, dry weight/min. During resting conditions, the creatine phosphate/creatine and ATPfree/ADPfree ratios were high in these cells, 6.81 +/- 1.11 and 1131 +/- 185, respectively. Addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to the suspending media increased the P50 by 50% whereas respiration rose by only 10%. Respiratory rate was increased up to about 10-fold by uncoupling the cells, but the P50 increased by less than 3-fold. When these uncoupled cells were inhibited with Amytal to lower the rate of oxygen consumption to that of resting cells, the P50 fell to 1.25 +/- 0.14 microM. Diffusion models indicate that in resting myocytes, the oxygen concentration difference from sarcolemma to cell core was approximately 1.84 microM with an additional difference of about 0.27 microM attributed to the unstirred layer of media surrounding each cell. The intracellular oxygen diffusivity coefficient in myocytes was calculated to be 0.30 x 10(-5) cm2/s. The results show that the oxygen dependence of respiration is modulated by the cellular metabolic state. At near maximal levels of respiration or on recovery from hypoxic episodes, oxygen diffusion may become an important determinant of the oxygen dependence of myocardial respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1508119641,"The conformation of tachyplesin I, an antimicrobial cationic peptide of 17 residues found in the hemocyte debris of horseshoe crab, was investigated using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of tachyplesin I in aqueous solution could be completely assigned, and the secondary structure was substantiated by interpretation of the nuclear Overhauser effect, coupling constant, amide exchange rate, and temperature dependence of the amide chemical shift. Tachyplesin I takes on a fairly rigid conformation constrained by two disulfide bridges and adopts a conformation consisting of an anti-parallel beta-sheet (residues 3-8 and 11-16) connected by a beta-turn (residues 8-11). In this planar conformation, five bulky hydrophobic side groups are localized in one side of the plane and six cationic side groups are distributed at the tail part of the molecule (residues 1-5 and 14-17). This amphipathic structure of the molecule is presumed to be closely associated with the bactericidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1510210099,"Prior studies demonstrated that conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide via sphingomyelinase action resulted in the generation of free sphingoid bases and inactivation of protein kinase C in human leukemia (HL-60) cells (Kolesnick, R. N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7617-7623). The present studies define the novel phospholipid ceramide 1-phosphate in these cells and present evidence for formation of this compound by preferential utilization of ceramide derived from spingomyelin. A ceramide 1-phosphate standard, prepared enzymatically via diacylglycerol kinase, was utilized for localization. In cells labeled to equilibrium with 32Pi to label the head group of the molecule, the basal ceramide 1-phosphate level was 30 +/- 2 pmol/10(6) cells. Generation of ceramide via the use of exogenous sphingomyelinase resulted in time- and concentration-dependent formation of ceramide 1-phosphate. As little as 3.8 x 10(-5) units/ml was effective and a 3-fold increase was observed with a maximal concentration of 3.8 x 10(-2) units/ml; ED50 approximately 2 x 10(-4) units/ml. This effect was observed by 5 min and maximal at 30 min. Similarly, in cells labeled with [3H]serine to probe the sphingoid base backbone, the basal level of ceramide 1-phosphate was 39 +/- 5 pmol/10(6) and increased 2.5-fold with sphingomyelinase; ED 50 approximately 5 x 10(-5) units/ml. To determine the source of the phosphate moiety, studies were performed with cells short term labeled with 32Pi and resuspended in medium without radiolabel. Under these conditions, sphingomyelin was virtually unlabeled. Nevertheless, sphingomyelin (3.8 x 10(-2) units/ml) induced a 12-fold increase in radiolabel incorporation, suggesting ceramide 1-phosphate formation occurred via ceramide phosphorylation. This event appeared specific for ceramide derived from sphingomyelin since ceramide from glycosphingolipids was not converted to ceramide 1-phosphate. In sum, these studies demonstrate the novel phospholipid ceramide 1-phosphate in HL-60 cells and suggest the possibility that a path exists from sphingomyelin to ceramide 1-phosphate via the phosphorylation of ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1547487487,"The existence and identity of protein water transporters in biological membranes has been uncertain. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured in defolliculated Xenopus oocytes microinjected with water or mRNA from kidney cortex, kidney papilla, reticulocyte, brain, and muscle. Pf was measured by quantitative image analysis from the time course of oocyte swelling in response to an osmotic gradient. When assayed at 10 degrees C, Pf in water-injected oocytes increased from (3.6 +/- 0.9) x 10(-4) cm/s (S.D., n = 16) to 74 x 10(-4) cm/s with addition of amphotericin B, showing absence of unstirred layers. At 48-72 h after injection of 50 ng of unfractionated mRNA, Pf (in cm/s x 10(-4] was: 4.0 +/- 1.5 (rabbit brain, n = 15), 4.2 +/- 1.8 (rabbit muscle, n = 10), 18.4 +/- 6.3 (rabbit reticulocyte, n = 20), 16.1 +/- 5.6 (rat renal papilla, n = 24), 12.9 +/- 6.3 (rat renal cortex, n = 20), 14.4 +/- 6.1 (rabbit renal papilla, n = 15), and 11.8 +/- 3.4 (rabbit renal cortex, n = 8). In oocytes injected with mRNA from rat renal papilla, Pf was inhibited reversibly by 0.3 mM HgCl2 (4.1 +/- 1.6, n = 10); expressed water channels from kidney and red cell had activation energies of less than 4 kcal/mol. These results show functional oocyte expression of water channels from red cell, kidney proximal tubule (cortex), and the vasopressin-sensitive kidney collecting tubule (papilla), indicating that water channels are proteins, and providing an approach for the expression cloning of water channels."
https://openalex.org/W1766876315,"A new taste-modifying protein named curculin was extracted with 0.5 M NaCl from the fruits of Curculigo latifolia and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, CM-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Purified curculin thus obtained gave a single band having a Mr of 12,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 M urea. The molecular weight determined by low-angle laser light scattering was 27,800. These results suggest that native curculin is a dimer of a 12,000-Da polypeptide. The complete amino acid sequence of curculin was determined by automatic Edman degradation. Curculin consists of 114 residues. Curculin itself elicits a sweet taste. After curculin, water elicits a sweet taste, and sour substances induce a stronger sense of sweetness. No protein with both sweet-tasting and taste-modifying activities has ever been found. There are five sets of tripeptides common to miraculin (a taste-modifying protein), six sets of tripeptides common to thaumatin (a sweet protein), and two sets of tripeptides common to monellin (a sweet protein). Anti-miraculin serum was not immunologically reactive with curculin. The mechanism of the taste-modifying action of curculin is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1555419656,"Clonal GH4C1 rat pituitary cells are heterogeneous with respect to phorbol dibutyrate receptors (PDBu-R) and protein kinase C (PKC) content. GH cell PDBu-Rs can be separated into two categories based on Ca2(+)-modulation of receptor affinity. Approximately 70% of the cytosolic PDBu-Rs demonstrate Ca2(+)-sensitive receptor affinity and redistribute from the soluble to the particulate fraction in the presence of excess Ca2+. The other 30% of the receptors remain in the cytosol in the presence of excess Ca2+. Their receptor affinity is Ca2(+)-independent. Northern blot hybridization and immunoblot analysis showed that GH4C1 cells express Ca2(+)-independent epsilon-PKC as well as Ca2(+)-dependent alpha- and beta-PKCs. Cell lysis in Ca2+ caused the redistribution of greater than 95% of alpha- and beta-PKC to the particulate fraction, whereas approximately 90% of the epsilon-PKC remained in the cytosol. In contrast, brief treatment of GH cell cultures with PDBu or thyrotropin-releasing hormone caused redistribution of all three isozymes. Prolonged treatment with PDBu down-modulated all three isozymes but at different rates and to different extents. In contrast, prolonged thyrotropin-releasing hormone treatment selectively down-modulated epsilon-PKC. These results demonstrate that GH cells have both Ca2(+)-sensitive and -insensitive PKCs and PDBu-Rs and that both populations are regulated by agonists that control prolactin synthesis and secretion by these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529465070,"Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is an 84-residue vitamin K-dependent protein initially isolated from bovine bone. MGP is also expressed at high levels in heart, kidney, and lung and is up-regulated by vitamin D in bone cells. To characterize the genomic sequences responsible for the regulated expression of this gene, we screened a human genomic library using a MGP cDNA probe and obtained two clones containing the MGP locus. The human MGP gene spans 3.9 kilobases of chromosomal DNA and consists of four exons separated by three large intervening sequences which account for more than 80% of the gene. Southern analysis of total human genomic DNA indicated the presence of a single copy of the MGP gene. Hybridization of the hMGP cDNA to a series of Chinese Hamster x human hybrid clones assigned this gene to the short arm of the human chromosome 12 (12p). The N-terminal sequences of the known vitamin K-dependent vertebrate proteins reveal a transmembrane signal peptide, followed by a putative gamma-carboxylation recognition site and a Gla-containing domain. Each of these regions correspond to a separate exon in MGP. MGP also contains a fourth exon of unknown function which codes for 11 residues and lies between the transmembrane signal peptide and the putative recognition site for the gamma-carboxylase. This four-exon organization is essentially identical to that of bone Gla protein and is quite different from the two exon organization encoding this region in the other known vitamin K-dependent proteins. Analysis of the MGP gene promoter revealed, in addition to the typical TATA and CAT boxes, the presence of a number of putative regulatory sequences homologous to previously identified hormone and transcription factor responsive elements. In particular, two regions of the promoter were delineated containing possible binding sites for retinoic acid and vitamin D receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1545034454,"We have used two in vitro motility assays to study the relative movement of actin and myosin from turkey gizzards (smooth muscle) and human platelets. In the Nitella-based in vitro motility assay, myosin-coated polymer beads move over a fixed substratum of actin bundles derived from dissection of the alga, Nitella, whereas in the sliding actin filament assay fluorescently labeled actin filaments slide over myosin molecules adhered to a glass surface. Both assay systems yielded similar relative velocities using smooth muscle myosin and actin under our standard conditions. We have studied the effects of ATP, ionic strength, magnesium, and tropomyosin on the velocity and found that with the exception of the dependence on MgCl2, the two assays gave very similar results. Calcium over a concentration of pCa 8 to 4 had no effect on the velocity of actin filaments. Phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin propelled filaments of smooth muscle and skeletal muscle actin at the same rate. Phosphorylated smooth muscle and cytoplasmic myosin monomers also moved actin filaments, demonstrating that filament formation is not required for movement."
https://openalex.org/W1527472579,"A cell-free assay has been developed to detect and characterize a nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated protein kinase activity in PC12 cells that phosphorylates high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins (HMW-MAPs). The activity was partially purified and separated from other endogenous nonregulated HMW-MAP kinase activities by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and Mono-Q resin. Characterization of the NGF-activated kinase (designated HMK) revealed the following features. 1) Both MAP1 and MAP2 are phosphorylated with approximately equal efficiencies. 2) Activation reaches a plateau within 3 min of NGF treatment and persists for approximately 60 min; subsequently, a substantial decline occurs by 5 h. 3) Maximal activation reaches 15-20-fold; activation is nearly as high with fibroblast growth factor, an agent that mimics NGF in promoting PC12 cell neuronal differentiation. 4) Epidermal growth factor and depolarizing levels of K+ stimulate HMK activity by only 2-4-fold; additional agents without PC12 cell differentiation activity (insulin, phorbol ester, and a permeant cAMP analogue) do not stimulate HMK activity. 5) The divalent cation requirement shows a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. 6) There is inhibition by 10 mM 2-aminopurine but not by 6-thioguanine, heparin, or NaF. 7) HMW-MAPs and myelin basic protein are effective substrates while histones IIIs and H1, dephospho-beta-casein, and S6 protein are not phosphorylated by HMK. These and other features appear to distinguish HMK from a variety of other well-characterized protein kinases as well as from other previously described NGF-activated kinases. The properties of HMK indicate that it could play a role in the signaling pathway for growth-factor-promoted neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1587185311,"A rhodopsin phosphorylation reaction that occurs with high-gain is observed if measurements are made in electropermeabilized frog rod outer segments (ROS) stimulated by a dim flash of light in the operating range of the photoreceptor. Flashes of light exciting 1000 or fewer of the 3 x 10(9) rhodopsins present/ROS results in the incorporation of 1400 phosphates from ATP into the rhodopsin pool for each excited rhodopsin (Rho*). This amplification decreases with increasing light intensity, falling most sharply after each disk has absorbed one photon. The high-gain reaction is lost if the ROS are broken into vesicles by shearing, leaving a low-gain rhodopsin phosphorylation characterized in previous studies using brighter illumination. The high-gain but not the low-gain phosphorylation appears to be regulated by G-protein and by calcium levels in the range over which intracellular calcium changes when rod photoreceptors are illuminated. Kinetic measurements made on the phosphorylation observed at higher light intensities shows that it initially occurs rapidly enough for a role in terminating the photoresponse. The high-gain phosphorylation observed at lower light intensities may play a global role in regulating light-adaptation of the rod photoreceptor, and its existence suggests that a search for a similar high-gain modification in systems using the homologous beta-adrenergic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors might be rewarding."
https://openalex.org/W1592296649,"Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT-1) is a transcription factor which is considered to be an important regulator in early T-cell activation. We have developed a system to monitor the transcriptional activity of NFAT-1 at the single cell level in whole animals. The system is based on the use of an oligomerized NFAT-1 binding motif that directs transcription of SV40 T-antigen in transgenic mice. This report represents the first demonstration that a multimerized short binding motif can function appropriately in transgenic mice. NFAT-1 activity had previously been thought to be confined to activated T-lymphocytes upon release of intracellular calcium. By targeting NFAT-1-dependent gene expression in transgenic mice we discovered new sites of NFAT-1 activity. Besides in T-lymphocytes NFAT-1 activity could also be induced in T-lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells and purified B-lymphocytes and requires agents that both release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C. A difference in the time course of appearance of NFAT-1 activity between T-lymphocytes and non-T-lymphocytes was revealed. Constitutive expression was observed in a small population of cells in the dermis and some mice have developed skin lesions. Interestingly, the tissue pattern of expression of the NFAT-1 activity resembles the expression pattern described for HIV-LTR/tat transgenic mice (Vogel, J., Hinrichs, S. H., Reynolds, R. K., Luciw, P. A., and Jay, G. (1988) Nature 335, 606-611). This similarity in expression and the fact that NFAT-1 has been shown to bind functional sequences in HIV-LTR suggest a role for NFAT-1 in dermal activation of the HIV-LTR."
https://openalex.org/W1602024000,"Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (P-450 Ch7 alpha) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. P-450 Ch7 alpha activity in rat liver is regulated at three independent levels: (a) feedback inhibition by bile acids (long term regulation); (b) midterm regulation through the diurnal cycle; (c) short term modulation by hormones and dietary factors. P-450 Ch7 alpha was purified to apparent homogeneity and in active form (turnover number = 10-15 min-1 P-450(-1)) from cholestyramine-fed female rats, and rabbit anti-P-450 Ch7 alpha polyclonal antibodies were then prepared. Liver microsomes were isolated from rats fed normal diet or diet containing the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine and were then killed at either the apex (midnight) or nadir (noon) of the diurnal rhythm of P-450 Ch7 alpha activity. Direct comparison of microsomal P-450 Ch7 alpha enzyme activity levels with P-450 Ch7 alpha protein (Western blotting) and mRNA levels (Northern and slot blots) revealed that the 2.5-3-fold induction of P-450 Ch7 alpha activity with cholestyramine feeding can be fully accounted for by an increase in P-450 Ch7 alpha protein and mRNA. Turnover numbers of 7-9 nmol of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol/min/nmol of microsomal P-450 Ch7 alpha were observed for both induced and uninduced animals. Similarly, the postmidnight decrease in enzyme activity could be generally accounted for by a decrease in P-450 Ch7 alpha protein and mRNA, suggesting that these species have relatively short half-lives. The short term regulation of P-450 Ch7 alpha was examined following treatment with the cholesterol precursor mevalonic acid. A 2.5-fold increase in hepatic microsomal P-450 Ch7 alpha activity occurred within 150 min and was accompanied by a significant elevation of P-450 Ch7 alpha mRNA (up to 3-6-fold increase). These findings establish that hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity is regulated in response to long term, midterm, and short term control factors primarily at a pretranslational level and that this regulation is of greater importance than proposed mechanisms based on allosteric effects of bile acids on P-450 Ch7 alpha protein, changes in cholesterol availability, or reversible phosphorylation of a putative P-450 Ch7 alpha phosphoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1527962818,"Evidence for CO-heme partitioning into and across lipid bilayers was obtained by kinetic and chromatographic studies. Biphasic time courses were observed when CO-heme was rapidly mixed with unilamellar lipid vesicles in a stopped-flow spectrometer. The initial rapid phase depended linearly on lipid concentration and was assigned to heme partitioning between the external solvent phase and the outer lipid layer of the membranes. The rate of the second, much slower phase was independent of both heme and lipid concentration. The fraction of absorbance change associated with this slower phase increased with increasing heme to lipid ratios and reached a maximum of approximately 45%. A similar slow phase was observed when membrane-bound heme was reacted with apomyoglobin. In the presence of excess globin, all of the CO-heme was extracted from the membranes to form native CO myoglobin. Under these conditions, the fractional amount of absorbance change associated with the slow dissociation phase was approximately 45%, regardless of the heme to lipid ratio. These results suggest strongly that the slow phases represent transmembrane movement of heme, from the outer to the inner lipid layer in the association reactions and from the inner to the outer layer in dissociation reactions. The temperature dependence of the rate of CO-heme binding to the outer lipid layer was markedly different from that of transmembrane movement. The rate of the latter, slower process decreased greatly with increasing acyl chain length, whereas the rate of the initial binding process varied little with vesicle composition, as long as the membranes were examined above their melting temperatures. Finally, the two kinetically distinct bound heme fractions could be isolated directly by column chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1601915562,"Abstract Binding of Nile Red to tubulin enhances and blue-shifts fluorescence emission to about 623 nm with a shoulder around 665 nm. Binding is reversible and saturable with an apparent Kd of approximately 0.6 microM. Nile Red does not alter tubulin polymerization, and polymerization in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (Mes) buffer does not alter the spectrum of the Nile Red-tubulin complex. In contrast, polymerization in glutamate buffer results in a red shift, reduction of intensity, and a decrease in lifetime, suggesting an increase in polarity of the binding environment. Lifetimes of 4.5 and 0.6 ns fluorescence in Mes buffer are associated with the 623-nm peak and the 665-nm shoulder, respectively. Indirect excitation spectra for these components are distinct and the 4.5-ns component exhibits tryptophan to Nile Red energy transfer. Acrylamide quenching yields linear Stern-Volmer plots with unchanged lifetimes, indicating static quenching. Apparent quenching constants are wavelength-dependent; global analysis reveals a quenchable component corresponding to the 4.5 ns component and an unquenchable component superposing the 0.6-ns spectrum. Analysis of anisotropy decay required an associative model which yielded rotational correlation times of greater than 50 ns for the 4.5-ns lifetime and 0.3 ns for the 0.6-ns lifetime. Dilution of tubulin in Mes results in an apparent red shift of emission without lifetime changes, due only to loss of the 623-nm component. These data are reconciled in terms of a model with two binding sites on the tubulin dimer. The more nonpolar site is located in a region of subunit-subunit contact which accounts for the fluorescence changes upon dilution; this permits estimation of a subunit dissociation constant of 1 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1521871069,"The level of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity in a human cell line carrying a 1.1-kilobase cDNA fragment was about 50 times higher than that found in ordinary methyltransferase-proficient (Mer+) cell lines (Hayakawa, H., Koike, G., and Sekiguchi, M. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 213, 739-747). Taking advantage of this overproduction, the enzyme was purified to apparent physical homogeneity and the physical and biochemical properties investigated. A single polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 25,000 was detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the most highly purified preparation. The Stokes radius of 22.5 A and the sedimentation coefficient of 2.0 S were obtained, from which the molecular weight of the native form of the enzyme was calculated to be 19,000. After digestion with lysyl endopeptidase, peptide fragments of the protein were isolated and sequenced. The amino acid sequences of these peptides and the amino acid composition of the protein were in good agreement with those deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA. The purified enzyme catalyzed transfer of methyl groups from O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine, but not from methylphosphotriesters, of methylated DNA to the enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1552148712,"Anti-peptide and anti-protein antisera were produced which both recognize bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (Mr = 75,000) and an apparent fragment or biosynthetic intermediate (Mr = 50,000) in calcified tissues and/or serum. A fragment-precursor relationship is suggested from the fact that closely spaced doublet polypeptides of Mr = 50,000 could be produced by proteolysis of the purified protein upon long term storage. No reactivity was detected with osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, or small bone proteoglycans. Bone acidic glycoprotein-75 represents 0.5-1% of the total radiolabeled proteins synthesized by explant cultures of neonatal calvaria or growth plate, by calvarial outgrowth cultures, and by rat osteosarcoma cells. Amounts produced by explant cultures and calvarial outgrowth cultures were similar to that for osteopontin, a major product of osteoblasts. In osteosarcoma cultures, 80% of labeled antigens were associated with the cell layer fraction wherein specific immunoprecipitation pelleted Mr = 50,000 and 75,000 sized antigens. Bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (Mr = 75,000) is enriched in 4 M guanidine HCl/0.5 EDTA extracts of neonatal rat bone and growth plate tissues, whereas largely absent from heart, lung, spleen, liver, brain, and kidney. Explant cultures of these noncalcifying tissues also synthesized bone acidic glycoprotein-75 antigen, but the quantities produced were only 5% or less that obtained with calvaria. By immunohistochemistry, antigenicity is associated with the bony shaft and calcified cartilage of long bones, but is absent from associated soft tissues. These finding demonstrate that bone acidic glycoprotein-75 is antigenically distinct, predominantly localized to calcified tissues, represents a major product of normal osteoblastic cells and may undergo a characteristic fragmentation in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1579585723,"We have utilized fura-2 and a Ca2+ surrogate, Mn2+, to assess the mechanism of Ca2+ entry involved in the refill of the internal agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool in parotid acini. Both the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, and the alpha-adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, stimulate Mn2+ entry into dispersed parotid acini, which is detected as an augmentation in fura-2 fluorescence quench rate. The rate of Mn2+ entry into parotid acini, depleted of internal agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pools by prolonged carbachol stimulation in a nominally Ca2(+)-free medium, is not significantly changed by the addition of the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, but is significantly attenuated when these internal pools are allowed to either partially or totally reload with Ca2+. Also, we provide evidence which suggests that under conditions which promote refill, Mn2+ appears to directly enter the cytosol from the extracellular medium and is not accumulated into an internal Ca2+ pool either directly from the medium or via a cytosolic route. Thus, we suggest that during refill, Ca2+ enters into the cytosol prior to its recruitment into the internal agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool and in turn, the magnitude of this entry is modulated by the refill status of this pool."
https://openalex.org/W1570592551,"The human serum enzyme, beta-galactoside alpha 1----2 fucosyltransferase, presumably blood group H gene-encoded, was purified to homogeneity from serum of AB and mixed secretor phenotype individuals. The purification procedure involved chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, and high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration. The enzyme was purified 10 x 10(6)-fold, with a final specific activity of 23.6 units/mg for the phenyl-beta-O-galactoside acceptor. The apparent Mr of the H gene-encoded beta-galactoside alpha 1----2 fucosyltransferase was determined as 200,000 and 50,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively. The Mr of native enzyme was found by gel filtration chromatography to be 148,000. The subunit structure as well as the sensitivity of the enzymatic activity to beta-mercaptoethanol suggest that the native enzyme exists in polymeric form of covalently bound subunits. Lectin binding properties of the purified molecule indicate that the enzyme is glycosylated. Another human serum beta-galactoside alpha 1----2 fucosyltransferase, presumably Se gene-encoded, was separated from the H enzyme by adsorption on S-Sepharose cation exchange matrix. A comparison of the kinetic parameters of the initial rate data of both alpha 1----2 fucosyltransferases revealed differences between Km values for various oligosaccharide acceptors. Higher Km values for the phenyl-beta-O-galactoside acceptor and a lower Km for the lacto-N-tetraose-beta-O-PA8 type 1 acceptor for the enzyme that adsorbed to S-Sepharose compared with nonadsorbed enzyme were observed. The two enzymes also were differentiated by binding properties to S-Sepharose and electrophoretic mobilities on native gel electrophoresis. We, therefore, postulate that the enzyme which does not adsorb to S-Sepharose and adsorbed enzyme are structurally different molecules and they represent the H and Se gene-encoded beta-galactoside alpha 1----2 fucosyltransferases, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1663785932,"Three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (T6, U5, and U6) against prolactin (PRL) receptors in rat liver were studied in the rat lymphoma lactogen-dependent (Nb2-11C) and autonomous (Nb2-SP) cell lines. The mAbs had strong affinity for lactogen receptors (Ka = 12-14 nM-1), similar to that of human growth hormone (hGH) which is a lactogenic hormone. T6 and hGH competed for the same binding site, while U5 and U6 interacted with another epitope. The 125I-hGH-receptor complex could be immunoprecipitated by either U5 or U6, but not by T6. Affinity labeling and immunoblotting revealed that hGH and U6 bind to a protein of 63-65 kDa. T6, U5, and U6 were mitogenic in Nb2-11C cells but their respective potencies were 185-, 70-, and 4700-fold lower than that of hGH. Anti-mouse IgG enhanced the mitogenic effect of all three mAbs and almost completely abolished the differences between them, although their mitogenic activity was still 60-120-fold lower than hGH. Des-13-hGH, a competitive antagonist of hGH which hardly effected the binding of 125I-U5, inhibited the U5-stimulated proliferation of Nb2-11C cells in a noncompetitive manner, indicating that simultaneous binding of both ligands fixed the receptor in a nonactive conformation. A Fab fragment of T6 was not mitogenic, and inhibited the hGH-induced mitogenesis in a competitive manner, but its mitogenicity could be restored by anti-mouse IgG. We suggest that the dimerization or oligomerization of the lactogen receptor in Nb2-11C cells is an obligatory step in the transduction of the mitogenic signal. It may be induced by binding of the mAb to a site, which can be either identical or may even be distinct from that which binds the lactogenic hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1519751156,"A pair of 10-kDa peptides, designated CB-a and CB-b, was isolated by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography from a total CNBr digest of turkey gizzard caldesmon. CB-a encompasses the COOH-terminal segment of residues 659-756, according to the sequence of adult chicken gizzard caldesmon (Bryan, J., Imai, M., Lee, R., Moore, P., Cook, R.G., and Lin, W.G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13873-13879), whereas CB-b comprises the same structure but was a few amino acids shorter at its COOH terminus. Both peptides cosedimented with F-actin, and their binding was increased by smooth muscle tropomyosin. The Kd values were 1.3 and 0.5 microM, in the absence and presence of tropomyosin, respectively, with a maximum binding capacity of 6.9 actins/mol of peptides. The CB-a/CB-b fragments inhibited, in a tropomyosin-sensitive and Ca2(+)-calmodulin-dependent manner, the skeletal actomyosin subfragment 1 ATPase activity to a level close but not identical to that observed for the parent caldesmon. Ca2(+)-calmodulin was selectively cross-linked to either caldesmon or the CNBr peptides with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide producing 1:1 covalent complexes that were retained neither by phenyl-Sepharose nor by immobilized calmodulin. Moreover, the cross-linked caldesmon bound weakly to F-actin and did not inhibit the actomyosin subfragment 1 ATPase in the absence of Ca2+. The results suggest that the CB-a/CB-b peptide region contains major regulatory determinants of caldesmon."
https://openalex.org/W1498234255,"Mouse and human genomes contain hypervariable DNA regions consisting of tandem repeats of a short sequence referred to as minisatellites. This variation is thought to arise through processes such as unequal crossover or replication slippage. A mo-1 minisatellite probe comprising a 14-base pair repeat sequence reveals many polymorphic fragments even in DNA of BALB/c sublines. Oligonucleotide probes with single base substitution in the mo-1 have been synthesized and used for assessing sequence involved in generation of polymorphisms. The results indicate that the loci containing mo-1 homologues with mutation in the GGCAGG sequence are monomorphic despite the other mutants showing polymorphism. Reciprocally, locus-specific polymorphic clones, Pc-1 and Pc-2, have been isolated with hybridization to mo-1, and both are shown to contain repeated sequence comprising the GGCAGG sequence. They reveal high mutation rates of 8.8% and 3.3% per gamete, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the motif contributes to the germline instability of minisatellites."
https://openalex.org/W1530733681,"Abstract Nucleolin, a eukaryotic nucleolar phosphoprotein, is involved in the synthesis and maturation of ribosomes. To characterize the genomic organization and regulatory sequences of this gene, two overlapping lambda clones containing the human nucleolin gene plus flanking regions were isolated from a genomic library using human nucleolin cDNA. Southern blots of genomic DNA from human, several mammals, chicken, and yeast revealed that the nucleolin gene is well conserved across these species. The gene consists of 14 exons with 13 intervening sequences and spans approximately 11 kilobases of DNA. Analysis of the splice junctions indicated that the amino-terminal domain and the four RNA binding domains plus the nuclear localization signal are split into adjacent exons. Sequences from the 5'-flanking and the first intron contain a high content of GC residues which is consistent with nucleolin being a housekeeping gene. Promoter elements include an atypical TATA box (GTTA), one CCAAT box much further from the initiation site, three reverse compliments of CCAAT (ATTGG), and two pyrimidine-rich nucleotide stretches. In addition, this region and the first intron contain numerous potential Sp1, GCF, CRE-fos, GCN, AP-1, AP-2, UCE, and sequences similar to the glucocorticoid receptor binding site. The transcription start site was determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping of RNA from human liver. One Kpn and three Alu repeats were found within two of the middle introns. The 3'-untranslated portion of the gene contains five homology blocks in a 100-base pair region that are highly conserved among human, mouse, and hamster genomes. Finally, we have determined that the human nucleolin gene is located on chromosome 2q12-qter and is present at one copy per haploid genome. A restriction fragment length polymorphism with EcoRI has been detected in the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1504906017,"Carboxypeptidase M, a plasma membrane-bound enzyme, is present in many human organs and differs from other carboxypeptidase that cleave basic COOH-terminal amino acids. Cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) distal tubular cells contain a kininase I-type enzyme that inactivates bradykinin by releasing Arg9. We found the properties of this kininase to be identical with carboxypeptidase M. In fractionated cells, carboxypeptidase activity sediments with membranes; and detergents, trypsin, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C solubilize it, similar to results with human placental carboxypeptidase M. Ten microM 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid and 1 mM o-phenanthroline inhibit, whereas 1.0 mM CoCl2 activates the enzyme. It has a neutral pH optimum and cleaves COOH-terminal Arg or Lys in bradykinin and in shorter peptides. The relative hydrolysis rates of peptides in the presence or absence of 1 mM CoCl2 were similar to those obtained with human carboxypeptidase M. The carboxypeptidase in MDCK cells (54 kDa) cross-reacts with antibodies to human carboxypeptidase M in Western blotting, but not with antibodies to plasma carboxypeptidase N. The enzyme is a glycoprotein; chemical deglycosylation reduced the size to 48 kDa. The presence of the enzyme on the cell membrane of MDCK cells was also shown with transmission electron microscopy using immunogold, which indicated that the enzyme is on the apical side. In addition, MDCK cells contain neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase) and prolylcarboxypeptidase (angiotensinase C) activities. Partitioning of solubilized carboxypeptidase M into Triton X-114 and water indicates that trypsin and phospholipase C remove a hydrophobic tail, while detergent solubilization leaves the hydrophobic moiety intact. Labeling of MDCK cells with [3H]ethanolamine resulted in the synthesis of radiolabeled carboxypeptidase M as determined by immunoprecipitation and fluorography. Thus, MDCK cells contain membrane-bound carboxypeptidase M, which is anchored to the plasma membrane via phosphatidylinositol-glycan. As a major kininase of the distal tubules, it may regulate salt and water excretion."
https://openalex.org/W1527366719,"The neuroendocrine protein 7B2 is highly conserved and widely present in neurons and endocrine cells. It is coexpressed with the prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland of Xenopus laevis. To study the biosynthesis of 7B2 in this amphibian, an anti-7B2 monoclonal antibody was used in immunoprecipitation analysis of newly synthesized radiolabeled proteins, produced by pulse and pulse-chase-incubated neurointermediate lobes. Following a 15-min pulse incubation, a single immunoprecipitable protein of 25 kDa was synthesized. During subsequent chase incubation, this newly synthesized 7B2 protein was processed to an 18-kDa immunoprecipitable form. Analysis of the chase incubation medium revealed that only the 18-kDa processed product of 7B2, and not 7B2 itself, had been secreted. This secretion is a regulated process because it was blocked completely by the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. A study of protein biosynthesis in lobes treated with tunicamycin to prevent N-linked glycosylation showed that in contrast to POMC and an 18-kDa derivative of POMC, neither 7B2 nor its 18-kDa derivative was glycosylated. Chemical and enzymatic peptide mapping showed that processing of 7B2 occurs in the carboxyl-terminal region. The function of the 7B2 protein is unknown; the present results show that 7B2 itself is a precursor molecule and can only have an intracellular function whereas an extracellular function can only be attributed to 7B2-derived peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1569019225,"The steady state kinetic mechanism of the bromide-assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide, forming dioxygen, catalyzed by vanadium bromoperoxidase has been investigated and compared to the mechanism of monochlorodimedone (MCD) bromination under conditions of 0.0125-6 mM H2O2, 1-500 mM Br-, and pH 4.55-6.52. Under these conditions, 50 microM MCD was sufficient to inhibit at least 90% of the dioxygen formation during MCD bromination. The rate data is consistent with a substrate-inhibited Bi Bi Ping Pong mechanism, in which the substrate bromide, is also an inhibitor at pH 4.55 and 5.25, but not at pH 5.91 and 6.52. The kinetic parameter KmBr, KmH2O2, KisBr, and KiiBr determined for the reactions of bromide-assisted disproportionation fo hydrogen peroxide and MCD bromination are similar, indicating that the mechanisms of both reactions occur via the formation of a common intermediate, the formation of which is rate-limiting. Fluoride is a competitive inhibitor with respect to hydrogen peroxide in both reactions at pH 6.5. At high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, the bromide-assisted disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide occurs during the bromination of MCD. The sum of the rates of MCD bromination and dioxygen formation during MCD bromination is equal to the rate of dioxygen formation in the absence of MCD. The apportionment of the reaction through the MCD bromination and dioxygen formation pathways depends on pH, with much lower hydrogen peroxide concentrations causing significant dioxygen formation at higher pH."
https://openalex.org/W1516972356,"Studies were performed to determine the subcellular fractions and proteins involved in the intracellular transport of bile acids in rat ileal cells. The photolabile derivative 7,7-azo-taurocholate inhibited the Na(+)-dependent uptake of taurocholate into rat ileal enterocytes reversibly in the dark and irreversibly following photolysis. When photolabeled cells were submitted to subcellular fractionation, greatest radioactivity was found in the soluble protein (SP) fraction with decreasing radioactivity in the brush-border-(BBM), basolateral-(BLM), mitochondria-(MT), microsome-(MC), and Golgi-(GO) enriched fractions. Following trichloroacetic acid precipitation, delipidation, and correction for loss of marker enzyme activity, protein bound radioactivity was in SP greater than BBM greater than MC greater than BLM greater than GO greater than MT. When photolabeled cells were first fractionated and then submitted to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a 99-kDa polypeptide was associated with BBM, 54- and 59-kDa polypeptides with BLM, 14-, 35-, 43-, 59-, and 68-kDa polypeptides with SP and a 20-kDa polypeptide with MC fractions. Immunoprecipitation with known antisera identified the 68-kDa polypeptide as albumin and the 43-kDa polypeptide as actin. No precipitation on the 14-kDa polypeptide was noted with anti-hepatic and anti-intestinal fatty acid-binding proteins. No precipitation of the 35-kDa polypeptide occurred with antibody to the hepatic cytosolic bile acid-binding protein. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized 20-kDa microsomal, and 14- and 35-kDa cytosolic bile acid-binding polypeptides which may be involved in the transcellular movement of bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1535029697,"Disruption and degradation of interstitial elastic fibers are significant characteristics of pulmonary emphysema. In order to examine the responses of elastogenic cells to the conditions mimicking degradation of interstitial pulmonary elastin, rat pulmonary fibroblast cultures were used as an in vitro model. Second passage fibroblasts were divided into two different environmental situations to represent cells adjacent to and remote from the site of elastase-digested matrix. One set of cell cultures was briefly digested with pancreatic elastase. The resultant digest was then added back incrementally to the medium of elastase-digested cell cultures and to the medium of a second set of undigested cultures. Both sets of cell cultures remained viable and metabolically active during these treatments (96 h of incubation) as judged by protein synthesis, cell number, and steady-state levels of beta-actin mRNA. However, the two sets of cultures exhibited opposite responses in elastin gene expression with addition of increasing amounts of the elastase digest. The elastase-digested cultures exhibited a 200% increase in extractable soluble elastin and a 186% increase in tropoelastin mRNA with the addition of increasing amounts of the elastase digest to the medium. Conversely, the amount of soluble elastin recovered from the undigested cultures decreased 75%, and the steady-state level of tropoelastin mRNA decreased 63%. Soluble elastin peptides generated from oxalic acid treatment of purified elastin were shown to decrease tropoelastin mRNA in undigested cell cultures in the same manner as the elastase digest. Based on these data, we propose that pulmonary fibroblast elastin gene expression can be controlled coordinately by the state of the extracellular matrix and solubilized peptides derived from that matrix. Such integrated regulation may serve to localize elastin repair mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2113854943,"The Holliday junction is a four-stranded DNA intermediate that arises during recombination reactions. We have designed and constructed a set of Holliday junction analogs that model each of the ideal conformations available to a 2-fold symmetric four-arm junction. The strategy used is to connect two arms of a junction molecule with a short tether of thymidines. These DNA molecules share a common core sequence but have different arms that are connected so that each molecule is constrained in either an antiparallel or a parallel structure. For tethered antiparallel molecules the identity of the crossover strands is determined by which arms are connected. Different arm connections gave molecules representing each of the two antiparallel crossover isomers. Two parallel molecules that differ in the length and position of the tether exhibit opposite biases in their choice of crossover strands. Thus, a physical constraint applied at a distance from the branch point can determine the conformation of a junction."

Cells were examined at different cell densities, at different stages of cell growth, and after the cells had been incubated with a carcinogen reported to affect mitochondrial DNA replication, benzo[a]pyrene-epoxide. In addition, the analysis was performed on three tumorigenic NIH/3T3 cell lines and one mouse bladder epithelial cell line and its tumorigenic derivative. Small variations of mitochondrial DNA under these various conditions were detected easily and revealed a linear relationship between mitochondrial DNA and total cell DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1550711511,"We describe purification of three different states of the 82-kDa K+/H+ antiporter from rat liver mitochondria. The denatured 82-kDa protein, identified by its selective labeling with [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), was purified by preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This purified product was used to raise and immunopurify monospecific polyclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis showed that the [14C] DCCD-labeled 82-kDa protein is not a DCCD-crosslinked product. The native, [14C]DCCD-labeled, 82-kDa protein was purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and column chromatography, using 14C labeling and gel electrophoresis to track the protein. The native, non-DCCD-labeled 82-kDa protein was purified by similar procedures, using immunopurified antibodies to track the protein. DCCD binding had no effect on chromatographic behavior of the antiporter protein. This protocol resulted in purification of the 82-kDa protein to apparent homogeneity. The purified, native 82-kDa protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes and assayed for K+ transport with the new fluorescent probe, PBFI. K+ transport was electroneutral and was inhibited by DCCD, Mg2+, and timolol. The turnover number for K+ transport was about 1000 s-1, very similar to the value previously estimated in intact mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1554692773,"Abstract Reconstitution, using phosphatidylcholine liposomes in conjugation with immunological purification procedures, has been used to establish directly the identity of the hepatocyte Na(+)-dependent bile acid transport protein. Octyl glucoside-solubilized sinusoidal plasma membranes were shown to form proteoliposomes exhibiting taurocholate transport properties which were similar to those of plasma membrane vesicles, namely, Na(+)-dependence and marked inhibition by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and by taurochenodeoxycholate. Proteoliposomes formed from plasma membrane proteins depleted of the putative 49-kDa bile acid transport protein by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 25D-1, which specifically recognizes this protein (Ananthanarayanan, M., von Dippe, P., and Levy, D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8338-8343), showed a 94% reduction in mediated transport capacity. Proteoliposomes containing total membrane protein also demonstrated Na(+)-dependent alanine transport. The addition of taurochenodeoxycholate or the removal of the 49-kDa protein by monoclonal antibody 25D-1 immunoprecipitation had no effect on the uptake of alanine, thus confirming the specificity of these procedures. When only the immunoprecipitated 48-kDa protein was used in the reconstitution system, a 2200% increase of taurocholate uptake was observed. These results definitively establish that this 49-kDa sinusoidal membrane protein is the sole essential component of the Na(+)-dependent bile acid transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1571363321,"Ascorbate-reduced dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) is inhibited by CO in a competitive manner with respect to molecular O2. Measurement of the stoichiometry of CO binding indicates 0.50 CO bound per Cu(I), which provides the first evidence that the Cu(I) centers in the reduced enzyme are structurally inequivalent. FTIR spectroscopy has been used to detect an infrared absorption band characteristic of coordinated CO, with v(CO) = 2089 cm-1. Comparison of this frequency with those of other Cu(I)-carbonyls in both inorganic and protein systems suggests a coordination site with fewer or less basic ligands than the 3-histidine site of carbon-monoxy hemocyanin."
https://openalex.org/W1579548022,"The crystal structure of the oxidized form of a flavodoxin from an eukaryotic red alga, Chondrus crispus, has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering methods. A model of the 173 residues and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) has been refined by a restrained least squares method to a crystallographic R-factor of 22.6% using 6236 reflections between 6.0 and 2.35 A with F greater than 3 sigma F. This molecule has a sheet consisting of five parallel beta-strands with two alpha-helices on one side of the sheet and three on the other side, and has a (beta alpha)5 structure. The molecule incorporates a substantial insertion in beta 5, as in Anacystis nidulans flavodoxin, which distinguishes these flavodoxins from the short-chain type. The isoalloxazine ring of FMN is sandwiched between the side chains of Trp-56 and Tyr-98, with its C-7 and C-8 methyl groups being exposed to solvent. The phosphate group of FMN is located at the N-terminal end of alpha 1, and forms extensive hydrogen bonds with the loop (T8-T13) between beta 1 and alpha 1 of the protein. Six of the total 11 lysine residues are clustered at the opposing face to the FMN-binding site, while about two-thirds of the total 35 acidic residues are located in the half of the molecule which includes the FMN-binding site. Such localization of charged residues produces a dipole within the molecule, which may be important in its recognition of the other proteins participating in electron transfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1961244064,"Three separate lines of transgenic mice were created with integrated copies of an 11.1-kilobase pair human DNA fragment containing the apolipoprotein (apo) E gene. The endogenous mouse apoE gene is primarily expressed in the liver with varying levels of expression in other tissues. However, in all three transgenic lines high levels of human apoE mRNA were detected only in the kidney, with lower levels found in the liver and other tissues; despite this profile of human apoE mRNA, human apoE was found in the plasma of the transgenic mice at levels comparable to those found in human plasma. All of the human apoE in the plasma of the transgenic mice was associated with lipoproteins. These results suggest that the domain responsible for the high level of apoE expression in liver lies outside of the microinjected DNA fragment and that an ectopic site of expression of an introduced gene may be permissive for the accumulation of its protein in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1560722209,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to bind in vitro to purified, human erythrocyte glucose transporter reconstituted into vesicles. Mild tryptic digestion of the glucose transporter totally inactivated the binding, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of the transporter is involved in the binding to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The binding was abolished in the presence of antisera raised against the purified glucose transporter, further supporting specificity of this interaction. The binding was reversible with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.3 x 10(-6) M and a total capacity (Bt) of approximately 30 nmol/mg of protein indicating a stoichiometry of one enzyme-tetramer per accessible transporter. The binding was sensitive to changes in pH showing an optimum at around pH 7.0. KCl and NaCl inhibited the binding in a simple dose-dependent manner with Ki of 40 and 20 mM, respectively. The binding was also inhibited by NAD+ with an estimated Ki of 3 mM. ATP, on the other hand, enhanced the binding by up to 3-fold in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent Ka of approximately 6 mM. The binding was not affected by D-glucose or cytochalasin B. The binding did not affect either the glucose or cytochalasin B in binding affinities or the transport activity of the transporter. However, the enzyme was inactivated totally upon binding to the transporter. Based on these findings, we suggest that a significant portion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in human erythrocytes exists as an inactive form via an ATP-dependent, reversible association with glucose transporter, and that this association may exert regulatory intervention on nucleotide metabolism in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1608931600,"The fungal parasite Rhizoctonia leguminicola produces two indolizidine alkaloids, slaframine and swainsonine, of physiological interest. These alkaloids are biosynthesized from pipecolic acid which in turn is derived from L-lysine in this fungus as shown in the accompanying paper (Wickwire, B.M., Harris, C.M., Harris, T.M., and Broquist, H.P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14742-14747): L-lysine—-saccharopine—-delta 1—-piperideine-6- carboxylate—-pipecolate. This paper concerns the discovery, purification, and properties of a flavoenzyme, termed saccharopine oxidase, which carries out the oxidative cleavage of saccharopine as follows: Saccharopine + O2—-delta 1-piperidine-6-carboxylate + glutamate + H2O2 The enzyme was purified 2,000-fold to homogeneity (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) in 14% yield from R. leguminicola mycelia, and had a native molecular mass of about 45,000 daltons by gel filtration (fast protein liquid chromatography Superose). Evidence for the presence of a flavin in the enzyme was drawn from these considerations: (a) the enzyme, while oxidatively cleaving saccharopine, concomitantly reduces 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; (b) the purified enzyme has a fluorescence spectrum typical of flavins; and (c) the enzyme requires oxygen and produces hydrogen peroxide. Good correlation was shown with purified saccharopine oxidase between disappearance of saccharopine with the concomitant appearance of delta 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate plus glutamate. The enzyme has a pH optimum about 6 and a Km for saccharopine of 0.128 mM. The enzyme apparently exists in R. leguminicola to shunt saccharopine, a major lysine metabolite, into a secondary pathway of lysine metabolism leading to pipecolate and subsequently to slaframine and swainsonine."
https://openalex.org/W1529510611,"The effects of membrane composition on heme binding to large unilamellar vesicles were examined using 30 separate phospholipid mixtures. Although there was some variation, most lecithins with Tm values less than or equal to 20 degrees C showed overall equilibrium partition constants equal to approximately 5 x 10(5) and association and dissociation partition rate constants equal to approximately 3 x 10(6) s-1 and 7 s-1, respectively, for CO-heme binding at 30 degrees C. A sharp decrease in the association rate for CO-heme uptake was observed as the lipid vesicles changed from liquid-crystalline to the gel phase. The addition of dicetyl phosphate or dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, which are negatively charged at neutral pH, decreased the affinity of the vesicles for CO-heme. The association rate and equilibrium partition constants for CO-heme uptake in unsaturated lecithins were unaffected by cholesterol content at levels up to 40%/mol. The affinity of saturated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles for CO-heme decreased with increasing cholesterol content at 30 degrees C. This effect appears to be related to the influence of cholesterol on the DMPC phase transition temperature (Tm) since at low temperatures (less than or equal to 20 degrees C) little CO-heme binds to vesicles composed of DMPC even in the absence of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2117044841,"Evaluation of the double-quantum filter for sodium was performed on several sample series of bovine serum albumin in water. Both single-quantum (1Q) and double-quantum (2Q) measurements were obtained. The quality of the 2Q filter was found to be quite sensitive to pulse width setting. Ordinary 1Q measurements of sodium in albumin-containing solutions show 100% visibility. At high ionic strengths, the 2Q albumin results confirm earlier conclusions demonstrating the tendency for the albumin molecule to unfold under a variety of influences. At physiological sodium concentrations, the magnitude of the 2Q/1Q ratio is controlled not only by the concentration of albumin, but also by the solution pH. Non-zero, double-quantum signals were observed in physiological samples consisting of essentially intracellular material (packed red blood cells) as well as in extracellular material (plasma and urine). Measurements in human urine showed no 2Q signal. However, high-concentration NaCl solutions did produce real, measurable 2Q signals. Therefore, the 2Q filter does not measure intracellular sodium exclusively. Although packed red blood cells gave the highest 2Q/1Q ratio (8.5 x 10(-3), plasma gave a very considerable 2Q/1Q ratio (2.3 x 10(-3). Because of its relatively high extracellular concentration, extracellular sodium may give a greater absolute 2Q signal than intracellular sodium in unmodified tissue samples. Based on these data, we conclude that a 2Q filter will not provide a useful measurement of intracellular sodium in in vivo tissue samples."
https://openalex.org/W1550784552,"The expression of thymosin beta 4, an ubiquitous peptide of high cellular content, was studied in concanavalin A-stimulated rat thymocytes within the first 3 h after activation of the cells. An early 6.3-fold increase of the peptide occurred after 1 h of stimulation amounting to 0.4% of the total cellular protein. This increase coincided with that of thymosin beta 4 biosynthesis measured by [35S]methionine incorporation. The share of thymosin beta 4 synthesis in total protein synthesis 1 h after addition of concanavalin A amounts to 1% but no elevation of the corresponding mRNA was observed. These data suggest that a translational control mechanism is involved in this rapid induction. Consequently, actinomycin D did not inhibit thymosin beta 4 induction in contrast to cycloheximide. The peaks of maximal thymosin beta 4 levels and biosynthesis were followed by rapid decreases of these parameters suggesting a function of thymosin beta 4 in the early phase of T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1534216380,"We investigated the interaction between glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar), a neutral dipeptide, and phenylalanylprolylalanine (Phe-Pro-Ala), a neutral tripeptide, for transport into renal brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from Japanese F344 rats. This rat strain is genetically deficient in dipeptidylpeptidase IV. Owing to the absence of this enzyme, Phe-Pro-Ala was found to be completely resistant to hydrolysis by the brush-border membranes, and this enabled us to study the uptake of the intact tripeptide without interference by hydrolysis. Gly-Sar was also resistant to hydrolysis by these membrane preparations. Transport of Gly-Sar as well as that of Phe-Pro-Ala in these vesicles was driven by an inwardly directed H+ gradient. Gly-Sar transport was blocked completely by increasing concentrations of Phe-Pro-Ala and vice versa. Gly-Sar inhibited Phe-Pro-Ala transport competitively; and similarly, Phe-Pro-Ala inhibited Gly-Sar transport competitively. The dissociation constant (Kt) for Gly-Sar transport (94 +/- 5 microM) was very similar to the inhibition constant (Ki) for Gly-Sar to inhibit Phe-Pro-Ala transport (107 +/- 13 microM). The Kt for Phe-Pro-Ala transport (36 +/- 3 microM) was equal to the Ki for Phe-Pro-Ala to inhibit Gly-Sar transport (36 +/- 6 microM). Furthermore, linear correlation was exhibited by various neutral di- and tripeptides, which were also resistant to hydrolysis, in their abilities to inhibit the transport of Gly-Sar and that of Phe-Pro-Ala. These results strongly suggest that a common carrier system participates in the transport of neutral di- and tripeptides in renal brush-border membrane vesicles."

Further, inactivation of Na/Pi transport involves irreversible inhibition, possibly via internalization, of the transport system. This study analyzed alterations of concentration and phosphorylation of membrane proteins of an apically enriched preparation induced by short (10 min) and long (3 h) term incubation with 10(-10) M PTH of monolayer cultures of the OK-cell line. To this end, an apically enriched membrane fraction was isolated from cells grown on Petri dishes and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Long term exposure of the cells to PTH induced changes in apical protein concentration. Four proteins were found to be decreased and one protein was found to be increased in its concentration. Addition of 10(-10) M PTH to the cells led to transient phosphorylation of five proteins. In contrast to transient phosphorylation, phosphorylation of one protein increased over the time period of 3 h. Combined analysis of silver staining and autoradiography led to the detection of an acidic 35-kDa protein in which specific phosphorylation increased over a time period of hours. The results document for the first time alterations in apical membrane protein content and phosphorylation state mediated by PTH when added to an intact cellular system. It is concluded that the identified proteins represent possible candidates for being involved directly or indirectly in PTH alterations of membrane transport."
https://openalex.org/W2141723098,"We have studied the effects of modification of the endogenous phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) content of the plasma membrane of Mycoplasma capricolum on the kinetics of spontaneous [14C]cholesterol and 14C-labeled phospholipid exchange between M. capricolum membranes and lipid vesicles. The PG/DPG molar ratio of M. capricolum membranes changed when cells were grown in media supplemented with 0.5 mM CaCl2 and/or egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) (10-20 micrograms/ml), increasing from 3.9 to 6.3 on supplementation with Ca2+; this ratio decreased to 1.1 in media supplemented with PC and to 1.8 in media containing both PC and Ca2+. The ratio of palmitate to oleate in both PG and DPG decreased when cells were grown with PC or with PC and Ca2+. Bilayer disruptions were seen in freeze-fracture electron micrographs of trypsin-treated M. capricolum membranes from cells grown with both Ca2+ and PC, and numerous lipidic particles and other bilayer disruptions were observed in trypsin-treated M. capricolum membranes and their lipid extracts. The rates of spontaneous exchange of 14C-labeled cholesterol and PC from membranes isolated from cells grown with PC and Ca2+ to acceptor lipid vesicles were exchanged by approximately 30%, and the rate of the rapidly exchangeable cholesterol pool in intact cells was enhanced by 64%. The enhancements in cholesterol and PC exchange rates are considered to result from structural defects expected in the M. capricolum membranes obtained from cells grown with Ca2+ supplementation. Our findings parallel previous examples of functional modifications of membranes induced by bilayer instability arising from a pretransitional state leading to the onset of a nonlamellar phase."
https://openalex.org/W1640844189,"Considerable attention is being directed toward defining a binding site in the central region of calmodulin that forms a high affinity interaction with certain enzymes and amphiphilic peptides. However, other regions of calmodulin are also known to be involved in the activation of enzymes such as myosin light chain kinase, regions which may not be directly involved in the binding of small peptides, e.g. mastoparan X. We investigated the properties of wheat calmodulin fluorescent derivatives, which were modified chemically in the first calcium binding site at Cys-27, in the activation of rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. Unmodified wheat calmodulin stimulated myosin light chain kinase to a greater maximal velocity than wheat calmodulin that was modified at Cys-27 by any of four fluorescent compounds, IAANS (2-[4'-iodoacetamidoanilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid), 5-[2'-[[iodoacetyl]amino]ethyl]aminonaphthalene]-1-sulfonic acid, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, and 7-diethylamino-3-[4'-maleimidylphenyl]-4-methylcoumarin; the midpoints for activation of myosin light chain kinase were not significantly different for unmodified wheat calmodulin and three of the four wheat calmodulin derivatives. Myosin light chain kinase, but not mastoparan X, enhanced the fluorescence emission intensity of wheat calmodulin-IAANS. Mastoparan X reversed, in a dose-dependent manner, the changes in fluorescence intensity of a preformed complex of myosin light chain kinase and wheat calmodulin-IANNS. Thus, we propose that the region vicinal to Cys-27 participates in the activation but not the high affinity association of myosin light chain kinase. Lastly, a comparison of mammalian and plant calmodulin showed that the Vmax for the stimulation of myosin light chain kinase was 1.6-fold greater for bovine than wheat calmodulin. The difference between the two calmodulins was more pronounced at lower Ca2+ because less Ca2+ was needed to saturate the kinase rate when stimulated by bovine calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1584048668,"The kinetics of chloroperoxidase-catalyzed bromination and chlorination reactions were studied at various halide and hydrogen peroxide concentrations. At very high concentrations, both chloride (KI = 370 mM) and bromide (KI = 150 mM) are competitive substrate inhibitors versus hydrogen peroxide. Results at subinhibitory halide concentrations for bromination reactions (kcat = 4 ms-1, kcat/KPeroxide = 1.6 microM-1 x s-1 and kcat/KBr = 4.0 microM-1 x s-1) and chlorination reactions (kcat = 1.5 ms-1, kcat/Kperoxide = 2.3 microM-1 x s-1, and kcat/KBr = 0.32 microM-1 x s-1) indicate that halide oxidation is rate-limiting in chlorination reactions. However, in bromination reactions, both compound I formation and bromide oxidation are partially rate-limiting. This is the first documented case where compound I formation participates in determining the overall rate of a peroxidase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1491433175,"Microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase isolated from the livers of rats fed a diet containing cholestyramine (HMGR-C) is oxidized to a protein-SS-protein disulfide via a thermodynamically favorable thiol/disulfide exchange in glutathione redox buffers which approach the normal in vivo redox poise. In the presence of either substrate (NADPH or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA), the equilibrium thiol/disulfide redox behavior of HMGR-C is substantially different than that observed in the absence of substrates or in the presence of both substrates. NADPH present during redox equilibrium in a glutathione redox buffer decreases the equilibrium constant for formation of the protein-SS-protein disulfide (Kox,i) from 0.55 +/- 0.07 M to 0.18 +/- 0.02 M and increases the Kox,m for formation of an inactive protein-SS-glutathione mixed disulfide from less than 1 to 6 +/- 1. The presence of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA during redox equilibrium has a similar effect, decreasing the Kox,i for protein-SS-protein disulfide formation to 0.10 +/- 0.02 M and increasing the Kox,m for protein-SS-glutathione mixed disulfide formation to 3.8 +/- 0.9. A three-state model is developed which describes the simultaneous accumulation of protein-SS-protein and protein-SS-glutathione mixed disulfides at redox equilibrium with glutathione redox buffers. Because of the different redox behavior of the free and substrate-liganded forms of the enzyme, addition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA or NADPH to HMGR-C at redox equilibrium results in increased reduction and activation of the enzyme."
