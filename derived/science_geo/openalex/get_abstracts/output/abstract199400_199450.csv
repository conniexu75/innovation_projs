https://openalex.org/W1964662742,"STARCH gel electrophoresis, as developed by Smithies1,2, is a delicate method for the separation of large, charged molecules. By this means, serum proteins have been separated into a great number of components, which presumably are more homogeneous than the five or six groups obtained by the usual methods of zone electrophoresis. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that different components separated from a mixture by means of starch gel electrophoresis may contain different polymers of a monomer, and thus may not be as different as the clear-cut separation might suggest. The following example illustrates this point."
https://openalex.org/W2076730518,"WE have reported elsewhere1 that fertilizable eggs for embryological studies can be obtained satisfactorily from the ubiquitous Indian skipper-frog (Rana cyanophlyctis Schn.). Homoplastic parenteral injections of 4–5 pituitary glands into gravid test animals brought forth viable eggs after 12–15 hr. It was our object to find out if mammalian hormones could also induce these frogs to ovulate, as there is conflicting opinion about the action of gonadotrophins on female frogs. Rugh2 noted in this connexion that: “In general, the Anura will respond to pituitaries from other Amphibia but not from mammalian extracts of the pituitary hormone”. However, Greaser and Gorbman3 quoted authors reporting ovulation in two species of Rana induced by mammalian hormones. Whereas many workers have reported failure to induce Rana pipiens to ovulate with mammalian gonadotrophins, Wright and Hisaw4 appear to have succeeded with mammalian pituitary gonadotrophins. Ovulation has been brought about in frogs using testosterone, progesterone and adrenal cortical hormones5,6. Chang and Witschi7 suggested that cortisone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone play a supporting part in the process of ovulation in R. pipiens and that the ovary should be brought to a threshold by implanting one or two pituitary glands to enable the supporting agent to work. It has been assumed in explaining this action that the process of ovulation is caused by the high follicular œstrogen content, which in turn releases adrenocorticotrophic hormone from the pituitary, the latter activating the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisone which assists in ovulation."

https://openalex.org/W1975351935,"A SAP-TRANSMISSIBLE rod-shaped virus which is carried in the soil has been recovered from corky ringspot-affected Sebago potato tubers and from a certain percentage of potato plants produced from diseased tubers. The virus has also been recovered from systemically infected potato seedlings, pepper and tobacco when these plants were grown in the greenhouse in virus-containing loamy fine sand soil, obtained from the site of field infection in northern Florida."

https://openalex.org/W2005099424,"THE results of the application of the technique of precipitation in agar gel to a study of the antigenic composition of the virus of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported by Brown and Crick1,2. It was tentatively concluded that two antibodies are present in the serum of guinea pigs and cattle convalescent from the disease on the evidence that (a) two precipitin lines were obtained when suspensions of the virus were diffused towards homotypic serum and (b) formation of one of the precipitin lines could be prevented if the immune serum was mixed with excess of the 7 mµ component of the virus before test. It was considered that the immunoelectrophoretic technique of Grabar and Williams3, in which the protein mixture under examination is first separated in an electric field before analysis by diffusion, might provide further evidence on this point."

https://openalex.org/W2035787508,"EXPOSURE to high environmental temperature has reduced the fertility in females of a number of species of animals1–5. Injections of cortisone or adrenocorticotrophic hormone into pregnant rats, rabbits and mice caused embryonic deaths5,6. 36–48 hr. starvation at the time of exposure increased the susceptibility of mice to Staphylococcus aureus infection7. Temporary reduction in pasture ‘quality’ at the time of mating has been associated with bovine female infertility (MeClure, unpublished data)."
https://openalex.org/W2088860601,"IN a communication in Nature, Mr. H. C. A. Dale1 made some interesting suggestions about the relationship between subjective probability, intelligence and the tendency to gamble. Certain experiments of our own in the realm of subjective probability may throw further light on this complex question."

https://openalex.org/W1990608933,"A NUMBER of different serological methods have been employed for the identification of types within the species Pasteurella multocida 1–3. Three different serological types were identified by Little and Lyon4 by means of a slide agglutination test. Their types 1, 2 and 3 were made available through the American Type Culture Collection. These and other types identified by Little and Lyon's technique have been employed in some recent studies on P. multocida 5–7. It is the purpose of this communication to point out inadequacies of the agglutination test for the identification of serological types within this species."

https://openalex.org/W2033484212,"FROM three quite different lines of investigation it has been postulated that isoniazid kills tubercle bacilli through the intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide1–3. In Micrococcus lysodeikticus, which contains an exceptionally high concentration of catalase, Chance has been able to demonstrate a peroxidase–catalase complex and to show that the peroxide concentration is controlled by the presence of suitable oxygen acceptors within the cell or added externally4. Sensitive though it is, Chance's spectro-photometric method would be difficult to apply to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has a very low catalase activity5, and direct chemical determination of intracellular peroxide does not seem possible. It seemed reasonable, however, to test the theory of peroxide accumulation in the presence of isoniazid by growing the bacilli in an excess of a stable exogenous oxygen acceptor capable of penetrating the osmotic barrier of the cell but not inhibiting cell growth. Sodium nitrite appears to fulfil all the requirements in that it reduces free peroxide and reacts rapidly with the catalase–peroxide complex, both in vitro6 and intracellularly4."

https://openalex.org/W2069774029,Drs. A. S. V. Burgen and S. W. Kuffler claim1 that the dual inhibitory regulation of one cell by two neurons with distinctly different physiological performance which they found in the stretch receptor of the lobster (presumably Homarus vulgaris?) is a phenomenon which has not been found elsewhere.
https://openalex.org/W2080559703,"IT is generally appreciated that a lung infection of adult rats is common to most laboratory rat colonies, and it is not unusual for up to 75 per cent of a colony to be infected. In recent years the disease has been given various names, but it is usually described now as a pleuro-pneumonia-like organism infection. This merely means that it is an infectious catarrh caused by these organisms. However, no specific organisms have been isolated which could be held responsible for the disease. Normally the infection only appears in the older rats, but the very young animals may also succumb to it, probably being infected by their mothers."
