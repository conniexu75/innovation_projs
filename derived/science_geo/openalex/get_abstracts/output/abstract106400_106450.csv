This reaction requires transient isolation of the flavin and substrate from the bulk solvent. Previous crystal structures have revealed the position of the substrate para-hydroxybenzoate during oxygenation but not how it enters the active site. In this study, enzyme structures with the flavin ring displaced relative to the protein were determined, and it was established that these or similar flavin conformations also occur in solution. Movement of the flavin appears to be essential for the translocation of substrates and products into the solvent-shielded active site during catalysis."

Only the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the label at 101 was time-dependent during the photocycle. The spectral change rose with the decay of the M intermediate and fell with recovery of the ground state. The transient signal is interpreted as the result of movement in the C-D or E-F interhelical loop, or in both, coincident with protonation changes at the key aspartate 96 residue. These results link the optically characterized intermediates with localized conformational changes in bacteriorhodopsin during the photocycle."
