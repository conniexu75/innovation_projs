Following the removal of the two largest lobes of the liver, the remaining ones, constituting about one-third of the total, enlarge to the size of the original liver in the span of a few days. The work of Higgins and Anderson (l), Brues et al. (2), and others has established that this enlargement is due to true hyperplastic growth. It therefore seemed to us an especially favorable tissue in which to test, by chemical analysis, the current view that nucleic acids are intimately related to growth. It should be noted that, although there is considerable indirect evidence to support this view, there is surprisingly little direct chemical data to demonstrate this relation. Caspersson and his colleagues (3-5) have shown an increased absorption of ultraviolet light, at 260 rnp, in the cytoplasm of actively growing cells. Stowell (6), using photometric histochemical methods, demonstrated a higher nucleic acid content in neoplastic tissue than in the homologous normal tissue. Brachet (7) has combined cytochemical techniques with the chemical estimation of furfural to reveal an increasing pentosenucleic acid (PNA) concentration during embryonic growth. Davidson and Waymouth (8) have estimated the PNA and desoxypentosenucleic acid (DNA) content of embryonic and adult tissues, and have found the concentration of both nucleic acids higher in embryonic than in adult tissues. Schneider and Klug (9) assayed rapidly growing tumors chemically and found them to have a high nucleic acid content. In this paper we shall present results which demonstrate a rise in PNA content of the liver when it is rapidly growing. We shall also present analyses, performed on the same tissue, for other substances which may be related to growth, lactic acid, glycogen, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenylic acid, and pentose phosphate, and for four oxidative enzyme systems, succinoxidase, malic dehydrogenase, cytochrome reductase, and oxalacetic oxidase."

On testing this hypothesis a considerable amount of experimental evidence was obtained in its favour. Thus detached leaves in water of Pelargonium or wheat, enclosed together with entire plants in a saturated atmosphere under a bell jar and illuminated for a few hours, showed wide stomatal opening when tested by the injection technique of Williams1 ; single leaves similarly enclosed by themselves, also in a saturated atmosphere and illuminated, showed little or no injection. On the other hand, similar single leaves of wheat each enclosed in a small volume of saturated air in a glass tube showed very heavy injection, as in the leaves from the crowded bell jars. When such tubes were swept continuously with a slow stream of humid air, little or no injection of the leaves was found."

https://openalex.org/W2135625791,The effects of choline deficiency on liver lipides have been well established and the variations in plasma lipides encountered in clinical hypoand hyperthyroid states have been thoroughly studied. With the recent finding that hypothyroid animals do not exhibit the hepatic damage which results from chronic choline deficiency in normal rats (1)’ it was thought of interest to determine the influence of thyroid activity on the plasma and liver lipides of both cholineand cystine-deficient animals.

https://openalex.org/W1491181530,"From an ext,ensive series of experiments with whole embryos and with tissue mince, Needham and his coworkers (l-7) concluded that in the early chick embryo the phosphorylation route of glycolysis, the Meyerhof-Embden cycle, is imperfectly established. Because glycogen generally failed to be converted to lactic acid, they argued that the enzyme esterifying glycogen was absent or insufficient. Since they could demonstrate no breakdown of hexose diphosphate beyond triose phosphate, they maintained that the “dismutase” forming phosphoglycerate and lactate from triose phosphate and pyruvate was similarly lacking or insufficient. Though extracts of chick embryo were strongly positive with the glucose dehydrogenase and growth rate tests with Bacillus injluenzae, they gave negative results with the malic dehydrogenase system. The authors therefore concluded that coenzyme I, essential for the operation of the Meyerhof-Embden cycle, was absent from the chick embryo. Their study of the phosphorus compounds in trichloroacetic acid extracts of the embryo revealed between 5 and 7 mg. per cent of adenyl pyrophosphat,e phosphorus. This quantity the authors presumably considered insufficient for the phosphorylation pathway in glycolysis, since they listed as the fourth deficiency in this pathway the lack of adenyl pyrophosphate. In 1940, Meyerhof and Perdigon (8) succeeded in preparing extracts of early chick embryos which would readily glycolyze hexose diphosphate, in the presence of added coenzyme I. The ability of these extracts to form lactic acid from hexose diphosphate and pyruvate demonstrates the presence of the triose phosphate dehydrogenase which Needham considered lacking. In view of Needham’s emphasis on the importance of cell structure for the presumed non-phosphorylating glycolysis mechanism but not for the phosphorylating one, it is interesting to note how Meyerhof and Perdigon extracted the embryos. To obtain actively glycolyzing extracts, they had"

Being most marked with freshly precipitated oxides, it is not surprising it should first have been considered an adsorption. For some time this observation has found practical application in the removal of soluble manganese in water supplies1, while recently it has been shown of significance in the chemistry of the dry cell depolarizer2, and also in the oxidation-reduction cycle of manganese in the soil3,4."

Since it will be a long time before the accumulated results of the years 1942-45 can be published in detail, some points of general interest are reported here."

These plasmodial masses apparently form the long-sought pre-erythrocytic stage of mammalian malaria parasites, and it is to be expected that human malaria parasites will show similar developmental changes in the incubation period of an infection. Prof. Shortt has very kindly shown me his preparations, and I write to confirm his discovery by the finding of similar parasites in my own laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W1563798193,"In previous papers (1,2) evidence was presented to show that condensed fish solubles produced a marked increase in the growth rate of chicks on diets containing an adequate level of vitamins and essential amino acids. Berry, Carrick, Roberts, and Hauge (3) found that a water extract of fish solubles was also active in stimulating the growth of chicks. Very little other information on the properties of the unidentified growth factor in fish solubles is available. The present investigation was undertaken to study some of the properties of the factor."

Owing to the fact that both couples were extremely religious Jews, extra-conjugal relations could be excluded. Since fertilization with such low spermatic counts seemed improbable, it occurred to us that variations in the spermatogenetic function occur in certain cases of oligospermia. Thus, fertilization might take place at a time when higher spermatic levels are reached."
