https://openalex.org/W2890436397,"The viral spread of digital misinformation has become so severe that the World Economic Forum considers it among the main threats to human society. This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly problematized phenomenon of “echo chambers”, but the causal nature of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an “echo chamber effect”: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion. These findings have implication for the study of the media logic of new social media."

In this study, we apply a reverse taxonomy approach to the Brachionus calyciflorus species complex, a commonly studied freshwater monogonont rotifer. By combining phylogenetic, morphometric and morphological analyses, we confirm the existence of four cryptic species that have been recently suggested by a molecular study. Based on these results and according to an exhaustive review of the taxonomic literature, we name each of these four species and provide their taxonomic description alongside a diagnostic key."
https://openalex.org/W2892367196,"Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an inflammatory disease of unknown causes, characterized by recurrent inflammation in cartilaginous tissues of the whole body. Recently, researchers have reported that, in mouse experiments, altered gut microbe-dependent T cell differentiation occurred in gut associated lymphoid tissues. Here, we investigated whether gut microbe alteration existed, and if so, the alteration affected peripheral T cell differentiation in patients with RP. In an analysis of gut microbiota, we found increased annotated species numbers in RP patients compared with normal individuals. In the RP gut microbiota, we observed several predominant species, namely Veillonella parvula, Bacteroides eggerthii, Bacteroides fragilis, Ruminococcus bromii, and Eubacterium dolichum, all species of which were reported to associate with propionate production in human intestine. Propionate is a short-chain fatty acid and is suggested to associate with interleukin (IL)10-producing regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation in gut associated lymphoid tissues. IL10 gene expressions were moderately higher in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of RP patients than those of normal individuals. Six hours after the initiation of the cell culture, regardless of the presence and absence of mitogen stimulation, IL10 gene expressions were significantly lower in RP patients than those in normal individuals. It is well known that PBMC of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases show hyporesponsiveness to mitogen stimulation. We suggest that, in RP patients, continuous stimulation of intestinal T cells by excessive propionate leads to the spontaneous IL10 production and a subsequent refractory period of T cells in patients with RP. The hyporesponsiveness of Treg cells upon activation may associate with inflammatory cytokine production of PBMC and subsequently relate to chondritis in RP patients."
https://openalex.org/W2889720020,"As China’s political and economic centre, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration experiences serious environmental challenges on particulate matter (PM) concentration, which results in fundamental or irreparable damages in various socioeconomic aspects. This study investigates the seasonal and spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 concentration in the BTH urban agglomeration and their critical impact factors. Spatial interpolation are used to analyse the real-time monitoring of PM2.5 data in BTH from December 2013 to May 2017, and partial least squares regression is applied to investigate the latest data of potential polluting variables in 2015. Several important findings are obtained: (1) Notable differences exist amongst PM2.5 concentrations in different seasons; January (133.10 mg/m3) and December (120.19 mg/m3) are the most polluted months, whereas July (38.76 mg/m3) and August (41.31 mg/m3) are the least polluted months. PM2.5 concentration shows a periodic U-shaped variation pattern with high pollution levels in autumn and winter and low levels in spring and summer. (2) In terms of spatial distribution characteristics, the most highly polluted areas are located south and east of the BTH urban agglomeration, and PM2.5 concentration is significantly low in the north. (3) Empirical results demonstrate that the deterioration of PM2.5 concentration in 2015 is closely related to a set of critical impact factors, including population density, urbanisation rate, road freight volume, secondary industry gross domestic product, overall energy consumption and industrial pollutants, such as steel production and volume of sulphur dioxide emission, which are ranked in terms of their contributing powers. The findings provide a basis for the causes and conditions of PM2.5 pollution in the BTH regions. Viable policy recommendations are provided for effective air pollution treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2890513203,"Background So far limited evidence exist comparing the difference between urban and rural elder residents in relation to how living arrangements correlates to health-related quality of life(HRQOL) of the elderly. Objective This study aims to compare the HRQOL of the elderly with four living arrangements: living with spouse only (LS), living alone (LA), living with a spouse and adult children(LSC) and the single elderly living with adult children (SLC) in urban and rural areas of China. Methods The data were drawn from the 2013 wave of Chinese National Health Service Survey in Shaanxi Province, which included 11,729 elderly people. The Chinese version of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire was used to measure the HRQOL. Tobit regression model and logistic regression models were employed to estimate the associations between living arrangements and the HRQOL of the elderly. Results The EQ-5D utility scores of the urban elderly with four different living arrangements (LS, LA,LSC and SLC) were 0.9141, 0.8392, 0.8176 and 0.9080, which were almost all higher than their rural counterparts. After controlling other confounding variables, tobit regression estimates showed that the EQ-5D utility scores of the single elderly either living alone or living with adult children were lower than the elderly living with a spouse in urban areas. In rural areas only the single elderly living with adult children were more disadvantaged. Additionally the logistic regression results showed living-alone elderly had worse psychological health and the single elderly living with adult children had worse physical health. Conclusion The findings suggest that the urban elderly have better HRQOL than the rural elderly and the elderly with different living arrangements in urban and rural area have different HRQOL. More attention should be given to the poor mental health of the elderly living alone and the worse physical health of the single elderly living with adult children."
https://openalex.org/W2890384987,"In addition to the well-known Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici, several other Fusarium species are known to cause extensive worldwide crop losses in tomatoes. Prevalence and identities of Fusarium species infecting tomatoes in Northwest Pakistan is currently not known. In this study, we surveyed and characterized Fusarium species associated with symptomatic tomatoes in Northwest Pakistan using morphological and molecular analyses. Pathogenicity tests revealed varying degrees of virulence with some Fusarium sp. causing severe disease symptoms whereas others displaying mild symptoms. Molecular identification based on Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region and TEF-1α gene sequencing classified all isolates into four major species with a majority (68.9%) belonging to Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC), followed by F. graminearum (20.7%), F. acuminatum (6.8%), and F. solani (6.8%). ISSR analyses revealed substantial genetic variability among all the Fusarium population infecting tomatoes. Genetic distance between populations from the central region and the type strain F.o. f.sp. lycopersici from Florida was the highest (0.3662), whereas between the south and central region was the lowest (0.0298), which showed that genetic exchange is negatively effected by distance. High genetic variability suggests that these Fusarium species have the potential to become a major production constraint for tomato growers. Findings in this report would greatly facilitate identification of Fusarium species in developing countries and would provide groundwork for devising and implementing disease management measures for minimizing losses caused by Fusarium species in tomatoes."
https://openalex.org/W2889948284,"Background The addition of plasmid cytokine adjuvants, electroporation, and live attenuated viral vectors may further optimize immune responses to DNA vaccines in heterologous prime-boost combinations. The objective of this study was to test the safety and tolerability of a novel prime-boost vaccine regimen incorporating these strategies with different doses of IL-12 plasmid DNA adjuvant. Methods In a phase 1 study, 88 participants received an HIV-1 multiantigen (gag/pol, env, nef/tat/vif) DNA vaccine (HIV-MAG, 3000 μg) co-administered with IL-12 plasmid DNA adjuvant at 0, 250, 1000, or 1500 μg (N = 22/group) given intramuscularly with electroporation (Ichor TriGrid™ Delivery System device) at 0, 1 and 3 months; followed by attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, serotype Indiana, expressing HIV-1 Gag (VSV-Gag), 3.4 ⊆ 107 plaque-forming units (PFU), at 6 months; 12 others received placebo. Injections were in both deltoids at each timepoint. Participants were monitored for safety and tolerability for 15 months. Results The dose of IL-12 pDNA did not increase pain scores, reactogenicity, or adverse events with the co-administered DNA vaccine, or following the VSV-Gag boost. Injection site pain and reactogenicity were common with intramuscular injections with electroporation, but acceptable to most participants. VSV-Gag vaccine often caused systemic reactogenicity symptoms, including a viral syndrome (in 41%) of fever, chills, malaise/fatigue, myalgia, and headache; and decreased lymphocyte counts 1 day after vaccination. Conclusions HIV-MAG DNA vaccine given by intramuscular injection with electroporation was safe at all doses of IL-12 pDNA. The VSV-Gag vaccine at this dose was associated with fever and viral symptoms in some participants, but the vaccine regimens were safe and generally well-tolerated.

https://openalex.org/W2891436452,"Intensive monoculture coffee farms quickly expanded in Yunnan Province in the 1990’s and 2000’s. In 2012, local authorities in Pu’er and Xishuangbanna Prefectures, the main coffee producing centre in the province, initiated a large-scale conversion program of these farms towards coffee-agroforestry systems to promote “ecologically-friendly coffee”. Shade tree inventories and household interviews were conducted in these two prefectures to characterize coffee farms and the Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) of farmers on the provision of ecosystem services by associated tree species. This study on newly emerging coffee farming systems revealed a high level of tree species diversity at both farm and landscape levels despite the previous dominance of intensive coffee monoculture and the large-scale distribution of a limited number of shade tree species by the government. 162 tree species were encountered during farm inventories, out of which the community of coffee farmers was able to rank 30 against 9 ecosystem services and disservices. This study reveals that this LEK is a type of hybrid knowledge that still relies mostly on traditional knowledge of tree species combined with experience acquired from newly-implemented coffee-agroforestry practices. This study also pointed out knowledge gaps regarding the impact of mature trees on coffee yield, coffee quality and pest control. The participatory approach resulted in the identification of non-promoted species with a high potential to provide locally relevant ecosystem services in coffee-agroforestry systems. These results lead to the upgrade of an online tool (www.shadetreeadvice.org) which allows extension services generating lists of recommended shade tree species tailored to the local ecological context and individual farmers’ needs. This tool will benefit farmers’ livelihood, support landscape health and contribute to the sustainability of the emerging Yunnan coffee agriculture sector."
https://openalex.org/W2891969987,"During the last two decades, mutations in sarcomere genes have found to comprise the most common cause for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but still significant number of patients with dominant HCM in the family are left without molecular genetic diagnosis. Next generation sequencing (NGS) does not only enable evaluation of established HCM genes but also candidate genes for cardiomyopathy are frequently tested which may lead to a situation where conclusive interpretation of the variant requires extensive family studies. We aimed to characterize the phenotype related to a variant in the junctophilin-2 (JPH2) gene, which is less known non-sarcomeric candidate gene. In addition, we did extensive review of the literature and databases about JPH2 variation in association with cardiac disease. We characterize nine Finnish index patients with HCM and heterozygous for JPH2 c.482C>A, p.(Thr161Lys) variant were included and segregation studies were performed. We identified 20 individuals affected with HCM with or without systolic heart failure and conduction abnormalities in the nine Finnish families with JPH2 p.(Thr161Lys) variant. We found 26 heterozygotes with the variant and penetrance was 71% by age 60 and 100% by age 80. Co-segregation of the variant with HCM phenotype was observed in six families. Main clinical features were left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia vulnerability and conduction abnormalities including third degree AV-block. In some patients end-stage severe left ventricular heart failure with normal or mildly enlarged diastolic dimensions was detected. In conclusion, we propose that the heterozygous JPH2 p.(Thr161Lys) variant is a new Finnish mutation causing atypical HCM."
https://openalex.org/W2892085015,"Many analyses of fishery recovery have demonstrated the potential biological and economic benefits of management reform, but few have compared these to the associated costs of management upgrades, which can be substantial. This study aims to determine if the projected economic benefits of management reform outweigh the increases in management costs required to achieve those benefits. To answer this question, we developed a database of country-level fisheries management costs and use those to estimate the country-level costs of management changes. We use this framework to compare estimates of future costs of management upgrades against their economic benefits in terms of profit. Results indicate that for most nations, including the top 25 fishing nations, management upgrades outweigh their associated costs. This result is robust to a number of alternative assumptions about costs. Results also suggest that stronger reforms such as rights-based management, although sometimes more expensive to implement, can lead to greater net economic benefits compared to alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W2889904466,"Natural ponds are rich in biodiversity, contributing greatly to regional aquatic biodiversity. Artificial reservoirs used for irrigation can be significant additional features of the landscape. They infill the local natural pondscape, and are attractors for aquatic insects. Here, we determine the extent to which artificial reservoirs represent the local natural pond biota, and how they contribute to the pondscape in conservation corridors used to mitigate the impact of plantation forestry in a global biodiversity hotspot. We did this by: 1) identifying the environmental factors, including plants, that drive dragonfly, water beetle, and water bug species richness, diversity and composition, and 2) determining the value of natural ponds vs. artificial reservoirs for maintaining the population size and expanding the area of occupancy for dragonflies, beetles and bugs in conservation corridors. While vegetation cover was central for maintaining species richness and composition of the assemblages in general, many other environmental variables are necessary to encourage the full suite of local diversity. Artificial reservoirs are attractive habitats to many species, overall increasing area of occupancy for 75% of them (ranging from 62–84% for different taxa). These reservoirs provide complementary alternative habitats to natural ponds, leading to improved ecological resilience across the pondscape. We conclude that maintaining a diverse and heterogeneous pondscape is important for conserving local aquatic insect diversity, and that artificial reservoirs increase the local area of occupancy for a range of pond insects in conservation corridors, and improve the biodiversity value of these pondscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2891590528,"Despite the important functional role of the amygdala and hippocampus in socioemotional functioning, there have been limited adequately powered studies testing how the structure of these regions relates to putatively relevant personality traits such as neuroticism. Additionally, recent advances in MRI analysis methods provide unprecedented accuracy in measuring these structures and enable segmentation into their substructures. Using the new FreeSurfer amygdala and hippocampus segmentation pipelines with the full Human Connectome Project sample (N = 1105), the current study investigated whether the morphometry of these structures is associated with the five-factor model (FFM) personality traits in a sample of relatively healthy young adults. Drawing from prior findings, the following hypotheses were tested: 1) amygdala and hippocampus gray matter volume would be associated with neuroticism, 2) CA2/3 and dentate gyrus would account for the relationship of the hippocampus with neuroticism, and 3) amygdala gray matter volume would be inversely associated with extraversion. Exploratory analyses were conducted investigating potential associations between all of the FFM traits and the structure of the hippocampus and amygdala and their subregions. Despite some previous positive findings of whole amygdala and hippocampus with personality traits and related psychopathology (e.g., depression), the current results indicated no relationships between the any of the brain regions and the FFM personality traits. Given the large sample and utilization of sophisticated analytic methodology, the current study suggests no association of amygdala and hippocampus morphometry with major domains of personality."
https://openalex.org/W2892293001,"Ascochyta blight of lentil is an important fungal disease in many lentil-producing regions of the world causing major yield and grain quality losses. Quick shifts in aggressiveness of the population of the causal agent Ascochyta lentis mandates developing germplasm with novel and durable resistance. In the absence of complete resistance, lentil genotypes CDC Robin and 964a-46 have frequently been used as sources of partial resistance to ascochyta blight and carry non-allelic ascochyta blight resistance genes. RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify differences in the transcriptome of CDC Robin, 964a-46 and the susceptible check Eston after inoculation with A. lentis. Candidate defense genes differentially expressed among the genotypes had hypothetical functions in various layers of plant defense, including pathogen recognition, phytohormone signaling pathways and downstream defense responses. CDC Robin and 964a-46 activated cell surface receptors (e.g. receptor like kinases) tentatively associated with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) recognition and nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) receptors associated with intracellular effector recognition upon A. lentis infection, and differed in their activation of salicylic acid, abscisic acid and jasmonic acid / ethylene signal transduction pathways. These differences were reflected in the differential expression of downstream defense responses such as pathogenesis-related proteins, and genes associated with the induction of cell death and cell-wall reinforcement. A significant correlation between expression levels of a selection of genes based on quantitative real-time PCR and their expression levels estimated through RNA-seq demonstrated the technical and analytical accuracy of RNA-seq for identification of genes differentially expressed among genotypes. The presence of different resistance mechanisms in 964a-46 and CDC Robin indicates their value for pyramiding gene leading to more durable resistance to ascochyta blight."
https://openalex.org/W2889917519,"Objective To explore work-related psychosocial stressors among people of Chinese, Vietnamese and Arabic-speaking backgrounds currently working in Australia. Methods In 2015, a telephone survey of 585 Vietnamese, Chinese and Arabic-speaking workers asked about workplace bullying, ethnic discrimination, job complexity, degree of control, security and fairness of payment along with demographic and employment information. Estimates of job-related psychosocial stressors were derived and regression analyses used to identify significant associations. Results At least one workplace stressor was reported by 83% of the workers in the study. Education was significantly associated with experiencing any psychosocial stressor and also with the total number of stressors. Workers aged 45 years and older were more likely to be bullied or experience racial discrimination compared with younger workers of any ethnicity. There was a greater likelihood of reporting low control over a job when the interview was conducted in a language other than English and the workers were either Chinese or Arabic. Workers on a fixed-term contract, independent of ethnicity were more likely to report a job with low security. Overall psychosocial job quality decreased with education and was associated with occupation type which interacted with ethnicity and gender. Conclusions The results suggest that job-related psychosocial stressors are widespread but not uniform across ethnic groups. Further research into what drives differences in work experience for migrant groups would provide information to guide both employers and migrants in ways to reduce workplace psychosocial stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2889674208,"We sought to describe sounds of some of the common fishes suspected of producing unidentified air movement sounds in soundscape surveys of freshwater habitats in the New England region of North America. Soniferous behavior of target fishes was monitored in real time in the field in both natural and semi-natural environments by coupling Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) with direct visual observation from shore and underwater video recording. Sounds produced by five species including, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus, Clupeidae), white sucker (Catastomus commersonii, Catostomidae), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmonidae), brown trout (Salmo trutta, Salmonidae), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmonidae) were validated and described in detail for the first time. In addition, field recordings of sounds produced by an unidentified salmonid were provisionally attributed to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae). Sounds produced by all species are of the air movement type and appear to be species specific. Our data based on fishes in three distinct orders suggest the phenomenon may be more ecologically important than previously thought. Even if entirely incidental, air movement sounds appear to be uniquely identifiable to species and, hence, hold promise for PAM applications in freshwater and marine habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2889775527,"Previous health studies have focused on the correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and health. We pooled data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (N = 9765) conducted in 2011, and examined the association of SES and health-related behavior with elderly health in China. The cumulative health disadvantage of the elderly caused by SES can be relieved by lifelong health-related behavior. In the same SES, the odds of self-rated health (SRH) as “good,” mini-mental state examination (MMSE) as “not impaired,” and activities of daily living (ADLs) as “not impaired” among the elderly who exercised regularly, were 46.9%, 28.6%, and 62.3% lower for the elderly who rarely exercised. The elderly who started doing regular exercise from 30 years old, achieved higher SRH, ADL, and MMSE scores to some extent. The health improvement advantage for the elderly who started doing regular exercises after 60 years old, was reduced. However, the odds of SRH as “good,” MMSE as “not impaired,” and ADLs as “not impaired” were still 3.4%, 12.5%, and 17.8%, respectively, higher than the respondents who never exercised. The health-related behaviors not only promote elderly health improvement, but its duration has also been found to be associated with the extent of health improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2891356087,"Purpose Several studies have demonstrated the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) quantification using vendor-specific image acquisition protocols and PDFF estimation methods. The purpose of this work is to validate a confounder-corrected, cross-vendor, cross field-strength, in-house variant LMS IDEAL of the IDEAL method licensed from the University of Wisconsin, which has been developed for routine clinical use. Methods LMS IDEAL is implemented using a combination of patented and/or published acquisition and some novel model fitting methods required to correct confounds which result from the imaging and estimation processes, including: water-fat ambiguity; T2* relaxation; multi-peak fat modelling; main field inhomogeneity; T1 and noise bias; bipolar readout gradients; and eddy currents. LMS IDEAL has been designed to use image acquisition protocols that can be installed on most MRI scanners and cloud-based image processing to provide fast, standardized clinical results. Publicly available phantom data were used to validate LMS IDEAL PDFF calculations against results from originally published IDEAL methodology. LMS PDFF and T2* measurements were also compared with an independent technique in human volunteer data (n = 179) acquired as part of the UK Biobank study. Results We demonstrate excellent agreement of LMS IDEAL across vendors, field strengths, and over a wide range of PDFF and T2* values in the phantom study. The performance of LMS IDEAL was then assessed in vivo against widely accepted PDFF and T2* estimation methods (LMS Dixon and LMS T2*, respectively), demonstrating the robustness of LMS IDEAL to potential sources of error. Conclusion The development and clinical validation of the LMS IDEAL algorithm as a chemical shift-encoded MRI method for PDFF and T2* estimation contributes towards robust, unbiased applications for quantification of hepatic steatosis and iron overload, which are key features of chronic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2890401895,"Introduction Cigarette smoking is among the most important public health concerns worldwide and the leading preventable cause of illness and death associated with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although Qingdao, China implemented smoking control measures in 2007 and smoke-free legislation in 2013, smoking-attributable cancer mortality remains at a high level. The present study aimed to facilitate changes in policy-making, intervention implementation, monitoring and evaluation by estimating and comparing the burden of smoking-attributable cancers in Qingdao during 2005, 2010 and 2015. Methods This study used the disease list from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to quantify the burden of smoking-related cancer. Sex and age-specific smoking-attributable mortality data were collected from the Qingdao Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention using an online reporting system. The population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of smoking and smoking-attributable cancer mortality in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were estimated using the smoking impact ratio (SIR) and relative risks (RRs) and by multiplying the smoking-attributable fraction by total cancer mortality, respectively. Results The numbers of smoking-attributable cancer deaths increased from 2484 in 2005 to 2999 in 2010 and 4148 in 2015, with corresponding PAFs of 26.41%, 25.76% and 29.13%, respectively. The PAFs were higher among men (vs. women) for all cancers except cervical cancer. In 2005, lung, liver, esophageal and stomach cancers were most frequently associated with smoking-associated cancer mortality, and lung cancer had the greatest PAF, followed by nasopharyngeal, oral and esophageal cancers. Similar patterns were observed in 2010 and 2015. In 2015, 1 in 3 and 1 in 5 cancer deaths in men and women, respectively, were attributable to smoking, and 95% of these deaths were associated with lung, liver, esophageal or stomach cancer. Over time, downward and upward trends in smoking-attributable cancer deaths were respectively observed among people younger than and older than 50 years. Conclusions The smoking-attributable cancer burden in Qingdao remains considerable, despite the implementation of tobacco control and smoke-free measures. Tobacco control efforts should remain a major public health priority."
https://openalex.org/W2891238469,"Whole genome wide identification and annotation of genetic variations in camels is in its first steps. The aim of this study was the identification of genome wide variants, functional annotations of them and enrichment analysis of affected genes using whole genome sequencing data of three dromedary camels. The genomes of two Iranian female dromedary camels that mostly used to produce meat and milk were sequenced to 41.9-fold and 38.6-fold coverage. A total of 4,727,238 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 692,908 indels (insertions and deletions) were found by mapping raw reads to the dromedary reference assembly (GenBank Accession: GCA_000767585.1). In-silico functional annotation of the discovered variants in under study samples revealed that most SNPs (2,305,738; 48.78%) and indels (339,756; 49.03%) were located in intergenic regions. A comparison of the identified SNPs with those of the African camel (BioProject Accession: PRJNA269274) indicated that they had 993,474 SNPs in common. We found 15,168 non-synonymous SNPs in the shared variants of the three camels that could affect gene function and protein structure. Obtained results revealed that there were 7085, 6271 and 4688 non-synonymous SNPs among the 3436, 3058 and 2882 genes in the specific gene sets of Yazd dromedary, Trod dromedary and African dromedary, respectively. The list of genes predicted to be affected by non-synonymous variants in different individuals was subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2891020105,"Background We assessed the associations between metabolic control and adherence and a broad range of adolescent and family characteristics (e.g., gender, family structure), treatment-related variables (e.g., disease duration, treatment modality), and psychosocial factors (e.g., symptoms of depression and anxiety, parental support, self-efficacy) in a nationwide study of Danish adolescents (age 12–17 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods Sixty-four percent of invited families participated by completing a survey and providing a blood sample. Two path models of associations between generic and diabetes-related family factors, adolescent self-efficacy, emotional difficulties, and metabolic control and adherence were tested, one for adolescents and one for caregivers. Demographic variables were included as covariates. Results Both path models demonstrated a satisfying model fit. In both models, metabolic control was associated with adherence, age, and T1DM duration. In the adolescent model, metabolic control was also related to treatment modality, single-parent household, caregiver non-support, and anxiety, whereas in the caregiver model metabolic control was associated with family conflict and caregiver support. In both models, adherence was related to age, duration, treatment modality, family conflict, caregiver support, family functioning, and emotional difficulties of the adolescent. In the adolescent model, adherence was also related to adolescent self-efficacy, whereas in the caregiver model adherence was associated with adolescent gender and caregiver non-support and support. Adolescent self-efficacy, emotional well-being, and difficulties related to adolescent/caregiver interaction appeared to be particularly important, as indicated by their stronger association with adherence and/or metabolic control. Conclusion The results highlight the value of applying a multi-informant approach to address the psychosocial well-being of adolescents with diabetes in a large national sample. Self-efficacy, emotional, and family-related difficulties are important aspects to address in both clinical care and future research regarding adolescents with T1DM."
https://openalex.org/W2892349744,"Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) is a state-of-the-art object detection method. However, the object detection effect of Faster R-CNN is not good based on the Region Proposal Network (RPN). Inspired by RPN of Faster R-CNN, we propose a novel proposal generation method called Enhanced Region Proposal Network (ERPN). Four improvements are presented in ERPN. Firstly, our proposed deconvolutional feature pyramid network (DFPN) is introduced to improve the quality of region proposals. Secondly, novel anchor boxes are designed with interspersed scales and adaptive aspect ratios. Thereafter, the capability of object localization is increased. Thirdly, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based support vector machine (SVM), termed PSO-SVM, is developed to distinguish the positive and negative anchor boxes. Fourthly, the classification part of multi-task loss function in RPN is improved. Consequently, the effect of classification loss is strengthened. In this study, our proposed ERPN is compared with five object detection methods on both PASCAL VOC and COCO data sets. For the VGG-16 model, our ERPN obtains 78.6% mAP on VOC 2007 data set, 74.4% mAP on VOC 2012 data set and 31.7% on COCO data set. The performance of ERPN is the best among the comparison object detection methods. Furthermore, the detection speed of ERPN is 5.8 fps. Additionally, ERPN obtains good effect on small object detection."
https://openalex.org/W2889966303,"Background Multimodal rehabilitation interventions delivered in late phase of stroke recovery involve physical (motor and sensory), social, and cognitively challenging activities. Horseback riding can be incorporated within such interventions, leading to meaningful long-term improvements when applied to individuals with moderate levels of disability. There is a lack of research illuminating stroke survivors’ experiences and perceptions of horseback riding in the context of multimodal interventions. Aim To explore stroke survivors’ experiences of participation in a multimodal group-based intervention that included horseback riding. Methods An explorative interview study was conducted with individual face-to-face interviews performed on a single occasion, utilising a semi-structured interview guide. Eighteen participants were purposively selected from a larger trial (mean age 62, 12 men, 6 women) within four weeks after treatment completion. The interview duration was between 17 and 50 minutes. The data was analysed using a qualitative content analysis method. Findings Four broad themes were identified from the analysis. These themes were: transformative experiences; human–horse interaction; togetherness and belonging; and the all-in-one solution. Interacting with the horse and peers had a profound emotional impact on the participants. The participants also reported having learned new skills, increased self-efficacy and self-esteem, and improvements in balance and gait, all of which could be transferred to everyday life. The horse itself played a central role, but other components, such as the other group members, the instructors, and the challenging tasks on the horseback, were also important. Conclusion A multimodal rehabilitation intervention that includes horseback riding may provide stroke survivors in a late phase of recovery with rich pleasurable experiences that may have life-changing and profound impacts on their emotional and physical state."
https://openalex.org/W2889986284,"Dust source that presents a ring shape is frequently observed in mining engineering. An arc fan nozzle used for water spray is designed to improve the dust removal efficiency. Based on a study of the spray field characteristics of an arc fan nozzle using volume of fluid (VOF) analysis, it is found that the section of arc fan flow gradually increases, and its mean width of the impact zone is 3.1 times that of the free jet zone. After leaving the guiding object, the central axis velocity of the arc fan flow rapidly increases and then gradually decreases. Based on dimensionless analysis, the calculation formula of the jet speed near the wall is achieved. The relationship between the section geometric features of arc fan flow and the structural parameters of the arc fan nozzle is analysed. A field test completed in the Fucun coal mine indicates that the dust removal efficiency obviously improved with the use of arc fan nozzles. Compared to the full cone nozzles used before, the average removal efficiency for total dust increased by 34%, and the average removal efficiency for respirable dust increased by 32%."
https://openalex.org/W2890199196,"Signaling by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and its receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor-B, is a pivotal stimulator of endochondral bone growth. We recently developed CNP knockout (KO) rats that exhibit impaired skeletal growth with early growth plate closure. In the current study, we further characterized the phenotype and growth plate morphology in CNP-KO rats, and the effects of exogenous CNP in rats. We used CNP-53, an endogenous form of CNP consisting of 53 amino acids, and administered it for four weeks by continuous subcutaneous infusion at 0.15 or 0.5 mg/kg/day to four-week old CNP-KO and littermate wild type (WT) rats. We demonstrated that CNP-KO rats were useful as a reproducible animal model for skeletal dysplasia, due to their impairment in endochondral bone growth. There was no significant difference in plasma bone-turnover markers between the CNP-KO and WT rats. At eight weeks of age, growth plate closure was observed in the distal end of the tibia and the calcaneus of CNP-KO rats. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of CNP-53 significantly, and in a dose-dependent manner, stimulated skeletal growth in CNP-KO and WT rats, with CNP-KO rats being more sensitive to the treatment. CNP-53 also normalized the length of long bones and the growth plate thickness, and prevented growth plate closure in the CNP-KO rats. Using organ culture experiment of fetal rat tibia, gene set enrichment analysis indicated that CNP might have a negative influence on mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascades in chondrocyte. Our results indicated that CNP-KO rats might be a valuable animal model for investigating growth plate physiology and the mechanism of growth plate closure, and that CNP-53, or its analog, may have the potential to promote growth and to prevent early growth plate closure in the short stature."
https://openalex.org/W2890898100,"The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), is a major insect pest of cereal crops in many countries. Imidacloprid has been widely used for controlling piercing-sucking insect pests worldwide, but its sublethal effects on R. padi have not been well addressed. In this study, we investigated the sublethal effects of imidacloprid on biological parameters and five enzyme activities of R. padi. The LC10, LC20, and LC25 of imidacloprid to adult aphids were 0.0053, 0.0329 and 0.0659 mg L-1, respectively. These concentrations significantly decreased pre-adult survival rate, but prolonged the development duration of 1st instar nymphs, pre-oviposition period, and adult longevity. Adult oviposition period was also extended by LC20. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R0), and finite rate (λ) decreased at all three concentrations, whereas mean generation time (T) increased. Moreover, LC20 and LC25 significantly inhibited superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, but increased catalase (CAT) activity. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity also increased at LC20. However, cytochrome P450 enzyme and peroxidase (POD) activity did not differ between imidacloprid treatments and the control. In conclusion, the imidacloprid concentrations tested here have negative impacts on the performance of R. padi by reducing its nymphal survival, extending the development duration of some stages, decreasing the rate of population growth, and altering enzyme activities."
https://openalex.org/W2891432074,"Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) is an important pest of cucurbit crops and certain vegetables in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Hawaii. Most studies on B. cucurbitae have focussed on the effects of prolonged high temperature and very few have examined the effects of short-term exposures to high-temperature on behaviour.In this study, short-term of high-temperature treatments of 33°C, 37°C, 41°C and 45°C were maintained for 1-3hr, and long-term, variable high-temperature treatments were established that consisted of experienced one, two and three times high temperatures stages to 31°C, 33°C, 34°C, 35°C, 36°C, 37°C, 41°C and 45°C for 7hr. We compared the effects of the different high temperatures regimes changes treatments on the mating, oviposition and thermotactic taxis of the flies. The results showed that exposure to a 45°C/1hr treatment, delayed both initiation of mating and oviposition for 8 hr relative to the control but mating and was observed 41 times and oviposition 47 times. By comparison, in the control, mating commenced immediately and was observed 38.3 times and oviposition was observed 41.3 times. Under the other treatments, all the indices for the flies declined with the increase in temperature and duration of exposure.Results showed that 1hr of exposure to 45°C significantly stimulated mating, oviposition and thermotactic behaviour of the flies. These results could improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the population dynamics of B. cucurbitae during the high-temperature season."
https://openalex.org/W2890033991,"Inactivation of pulmonary surfactant by different components such as serum, cholesterol or meconium contributes to severe respiratory pathologies through destabilization and collapse of airspaces. Recent studies have analyzed in detail how the interfacial properties of natural surfactant purified from animal lungs are altered as a consequence of its exposure to serum proteins or meconium-mobilized cholesterol. It has been also demonstrated that pre-exposure of surfactant to polymers such as hyaluronic acid provides resistance to inactivation by multiple inhibitory agents. In the current work, we have extended these studies to the analysis of Surfacen, a clinical surfactant currently in use to rescue premature babies suffering or at risk of respiratory distress due to congenital lack of surfactant. This surfactant is also strongly inhibited by both meconium and serum when tested in the captive bubble surfactometer (CBS) under conditions mimicking respiratory dynamics. As it occurs with native surfactant, Surfacen is markedly protected from inhibition by pre-exposure to hyaluronic acid, confirming that clinical surfactants can be improved to treat pathologies associated with strongly deactivating contexts, such as those associated with lung injury and inflammation. Remarkably, we found that, under physiologically-mimicking conditions, a cholesterol-free clinical surfactant such as Surfacen is less susceptible to inhibition by cholesterol-mobilizing environments than cholesterol-containing natural surfactant, as a consequence of a markedly reduced susceptibility to incorporation of exogenous cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2890502326,"Although cancer is multifactorial, a strong correlation between this pathology and increased oxidative stress has long been stablished. Hypoxia, inherent to solid tumors, increases reactive oxygen species and should be taken into account when analyzing the response of tumor cells to antioxidants. The Mediterranean diet has been related to a lower incidence of cancer, and particularly of breast cancer. Given that hydroxytyrosol (HT) is largely responsible for the antioxidant properties of olive oil, we have performed a comprehensive and comparative study of its effect on the oxidative stress response of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in hypoxia and normoxia. Our results demonstrate that the antioxidant action of HT is particularly effective in a hypoxic environment. Moreover, we have observed that this polyphenol modulates the transcription and translation of members of the PGC-1α/ERRα and PGC-1α/Nrf2 pathways. However, while the transcriptional effects of HT are similar in normoxic and hypoxic conditions, its translational action is less prominent and partially attenuated in hypoxia, and therefore cannot completely explain the antioxidant effect of HT. Consequently, our results underscore that the hypoxic environment of tumor cells should be considered when analyzing the effect of bioactive compounds. Besides, this study also points to the importance of assessing the regulatory role of HT at both mRNA and protein level to get a complete picture of its effects."
https://openalex.org/W2892055775,"Human induced eutrophication has strongly altered aquatic ecosystems. With increasing eutrophication, plant nutrient concentrations increase, making them more attractive as food for herbivores. However, most aquatic consumers are omnivorous. Ecological stoichiometry theory predicts that animals prefer to consume food which has a similar nutrient (N and P) composition or C:nutrient ratio compared to their own bodies, hence omnivorous animals may prefer to eat animal prey instead of plants. We asked whether aquatic omnivores would shift their diet towards more plant consumption when plants are more nutritious and their stoichiometry becomes more similar to the stoichiometry of the omnivore. We hypothesized that: (1) the omnivore increases plant consumption as the plant C:nutrient ratio decreases when there is only plant material available; (2) the omnivore generally prefers animal food over plant material; (3) the omnivore will increase its relative plant consumption as the plant C:nutrient ratio decreases, in the presence of animal food. As a model system, we used the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (omnivorous consumer), the aquatic plant Potamogeton lucens (plant food to the consumer, cultured at different nutrient regimes to obtain different plant C:nutrient ratios), and the crustacean Gammarus pulex (animal food to the consumer, using freshly dead individuals). When there was only plant material available, the consumers increased their relative consumption rate with decreasing plant C:nutrient ratio from no measurable amount to about 102 mg g-1 day-1. When plant material was offered simultaneously with animal food, even though the omnivores always preferred animal food over plant material, the omnivores still increased their relative intake of plant material as plant C:nutrient ratio decreased, from virtually nothing at the highest to on average 16% of their diet at the lowest plant C:nutrient ratio, with a maximum of 28%. Therefore, we conclude that as nutrient loading increases in aquatic ecosystems, plant-eating omnivorous animals may shift their trophic position towards increased plant consumption and alter the food web structure. As a result, we may observe increased top-down control on aquatic plants."
https://openalex.org/W2890777067,"Periodic patterning of iterative structures is diverse across the animal kingdom. Clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of these structure helps to elucidate the process of organogenesis. Turing-type reaction-diffusion mechanisms have been shown to play a critical role in regulating periodic patterning in organogenesis. Palatal rugae are periodically patterned ridges situated on the hard palate of mammals. We have previously shown that the palatal rugae develop by a Turing-type reaction-diffusion mechanism, which is reliant upon Shh (as an inhibitor) and Fgf (as an activator) signaling for appropriate organization of these structures. The disturbance of Shh and Fgf signaling lead to disorganized palatal rugae. However, the mechanism itself is not fully understood. Here we found that Lrp4 (transmembrane protein) was expressed in a complementary pattern to Wise (a secreted BMP antagonist and Wnt modulator) expression in palatal rugae development, representing Lrp4 expression in developing rugae and Wise in the inter-rugal epithelium. Highly disorganized palatal rugae was observed in both Wise and Lrp4 mutant mice, and these mutants also showed the downregulation of Shh signaling, which was accompanied with upregulation of Fgf signaling. Wise and Lrp4 are thus likely to control palatal rugae development by regulating reaction-diffusion mechanisms through Shh and Fgf signaling. We also found that Bmp and Wnt signaling were partially involved in this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2892040778,"Adolescents spend large amounts of time sitting at school. Little is known about the impact of reducing and breaking-up prolonged sitting during school lessons on adolescents’ health. This study aimed to investigate the impact of an intervention to reduce classroom sitting time on adolescents’ energy expenditure (EE; kcal/lesson), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and musculoskeletal discomfort. A secondary school classroom was equipped with height-adjustable desks, posters promoting the health benefits of and strategies for breaking-up sitting time, and desk stickers reminding students to periodically stand up. Classroom teachers participated in a professional development session. Using a quasi-experimental design, differences between 49 participants who utilised the intervention classroom 2–5 times/week and a comparison group (39 adolescents, matched by year level and subject) who used traditional classrooms, were examined. EE, BMI and WC were objectively measured and musculoskeletal discomfort was self-reported at baseline, 4-weeks, and 17-weeks. Hierarchical linear and multilevel logistic regression-mixed models were used to examine intervention effects, adjusting for baseline values, sex and age. EE was significantly higher at 4-weeks and 17-weeks (29.4 and 37.7 kcal/lesson, respectively), BMI was higher at 4-weeks (0.34 kg/m2), and WC was lower at 4-weeks and 17-weeks (-3.53 and -2.64 cm, respectively) in the intervention compared to the comparison group. No intervention effect was found for musculoskeletal discomfort. Findings provide preliminary indications that these strategies may benefit health among adolescents in the short term. However, extended longer-duration trials are needed to determine longer-term health effects."

Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) campaigns supported by the European Commission have been conducted twice a year since the spring of 2011. The first campaigns were limited to the northern and eastern parts of the country, and from the autumn of 2012, the program was extended to the entire country. The Lysvulpen vaccine containing the SAD Bern strain was used for ORV. Following the vaccination campaigns, the number of rabies cases decreased, and the last positive case was recorded in February 2014.

https://openalex.org/W2892224263,"Osteoclasts play a critical role not only in bone homeostasis but also in inflammatory osteolysis, such as that occurring in inflammatory arthritis and systemic inflammation. In both inflammation conditions, inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induce RANKL expression in osteoblasts, but the roles of these cytokines in osteoclast activation remain unclear. S100A12, an S100 family member, is a low-molecular-weight calcium-binding protein. Although it has a pro-inflammatory role, its effects on osteoclast differentiation have been unclear. Here we examined the direct effects of S100A12 on human osteoclasts in vitro. S100A12 facilitated osteoclast formation in the presence of RANKL, as judged by the cells’ morphology and elevated expression of osteoclast-related molecules, including NFATc1, ACP5, CALCR, and ITGβ3. In addition, S100A12 administration markedly enhanced the osteoclasts’ bone resorption ability, consistent with their increased expression levels of CTSK and CA2. Blocking RAGE and TLR4 cancelled the effects of S100A12. Our results indicate that S100A12 is a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory osteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2890570523,"Obesity is increasingly prevalent and associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for determination of body fat volume and distribution. However, quantifying body fat from numerous MRI slices is tedious and time-consuming. Here we developed a deep learning-based method for measuring visceral and subcutaneous fat in the abdominal region of mice. Congenic mice only differ from C57BL/6 (B6) Apoe knockout (Apoe-/-) mice in chromosome 9 that is replaced by C3H/HeJ genome. Male congenic mice had lighter body weight than B6-Apoe-/- mice after being fed 14 weeks of Western diet. Axial and coronal T1-weighted sequencing at 1-mm-thickness and 1-mm-gap was acquired with a 7T Bruker ClinScan scanner. A deep learning approach was developed for segmenting visceral and subcutaneous fat based on the U-net architecture made publicly available through the open-source ANTsRNet library—a growing repository of well-known neural networks. The volumes of subcutaneous and visceral fat measured through our approach were highly comparable with those from manual measurements. The Dice score, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and correlation analysis demonstrated the similarity between two methods in quantifying visceral and subcutaneous fat. Analysis with the automated method showed significant reductions in volumes of visceral and subcutaneous fat but not non-fat tissues in congenic mice compared to B6 mice. These results demonstrate the accuracy of deep learning in quantification of abdominal fat and its significance in determining body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2890499505,"Early nomads in the Eurasian steppes since the beginning of the 1st millennium BC played a key role in the formation of the cultural and genetic landscape of populations of a significant part of Eurasia, from Eastern Europe to Eastern Central Asia. Numerous archaeological cultures associated with early nomads have been discovered throughout the Eurasian steppe belt. The Tagar archaeological culture existed in the Minusinsk basin (Sayan Mountains, Southern Siberia, Russia) in the northeastern periphery of the Eurasian steppe belt from the 8th to 1st century BC during the pre-Scythian, Scythian, and Early Xiongnu-Sarmatian periods. In this study, we evaluated mtDNA diversity in the Tagar population based on representative series (N = 79) belonging to all chronological stages of the culture. The Tagar population had a mixed mtDNA pool dominated by Western Eurasian haplogroups and subgroups (H, HV6, HV*, I, K, T, U2e, U4, U5a, and U*) and, to a lesser degree, Eastern Eurasian haplogroups (A*, A8, C*, C5, D, G2a, and F1b). The Tagar population showed a similar mtDNA pool structure to those of other Iron Age populations representing the ""Scythian World."" We observed particularly high similarity between the Tagar and Classic Scythians from the North Pontic region. Our results support the assumption that genetic components introduced by Bronze Age migrants from Western Eurasia contributed to the formation of the genetic composition of Scythian period populations in Southern Siberia. Another important component of the Tagar mtDNA pool was autochthonous East Eurasian lineages, some of which (A8 and C4a2a) are potential markers of the westward genetic influence of the eastern populations of the Scythian period. Our results suggest a genetic continuity (at least partial) between the Early, Middle, and Late Tagar populations."
https://openalex.org/W2890671198,"In this single-center study we retrospectively evaluated the impact of early reconstitution of different lymphocyte subsets on patient outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We found that CD8+ T-cell counts exceeding 50x106/l as early as on day 28 post-transplantation correlated significantly with decreased relapse risk, with three-year relapse rates of 17.0% and 55.6% (P = 0.002), but were also associated with severe acute and chronic GVHD. Incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD was 30.5% for those with early CD8+ T-cell recovery compared to 2.1% for those with lower CD8+ T-cell counts on day 28 post-transplant (HR = 20.24, P = 0.004). Early CD8+ T-cell reconstitution did not, however, affect the overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed that slow CD8+ T-cell reconstitution was strongly associated with increased risk of relapse (HR = 3.44, P = 0.026). A weaker correlation was found between CD4+ reconstitution and relapse-risk, but there was no such association with CD19+ B-cells or NK-cells. In conclusion, the early CD8+ T-cell recovery on day 28 post-transplant is associated with the lower risk of relapse but also predicts the impending severe GVHD, and thus could be useful in guiding timely treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2889936938,"Recessive genic male sterility (RGMS) has great potential for F1 hybrid seeds production in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.). However, it is not yet widely used in practice due to poor understanding of the underlying mechanism in RGMS. Previously, we have developed a novel sesame RGMS line (D248A) controlled by a single recessive gene. To elucidate its cytological mechanism, histological observations were carried out in sterile and fertile buds. The results indicated that abnormality in D248A began at microspore mother cell stage and persisted until microspore stage. The microsporocytes had less cytoplasm and no obvious nucleus. Normal meiosis failed in microspore mother cells. Cytoplasm condensation and vacuolation frequently occurred in tetrads, leading to the production of crumpled and abortive microspores. To develop molecular markers for breeding of hybrid lines, InDel and SSR markers were analyzed in a fertility segregating NIL population constructed by sib-mating D248A with D248B. Five markers were identified for the male sterile gene (Ms), with a respective genetic distance of 1.47 and 5.17 cM for the two closest markers (SB2993 and LG1-170) on both sides. The Ms gene was further anchored into a 108-kb interval in the downstream of chromosome 1, within which 15 genes were predicted and four were likely to be responsible for male sterility. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying RGMS in sesame."

It is important to diagnose TB infections in HCWs to prevent nosocomial transmission, particularly among immunocompromised patients.The aim of this study was to analyze the rate of tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion and to assess the incidence of active TB after the latent TB infection screenings in high-risk HCWs.This retrospective cohort study involved 458 HCWs in TB-related departments between 2009 and 2013. All HCWs underwent a TST and a chest radiograph annually; an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) was performed on the TST-converted subjects. TST-converted and IGRA-positive HCWs underwent treatment for latent TB infection.The TST conversion rate was 30.3% from 2009 to 2011 in two years, 7.4% from 2011 to 2012, and 17.4% from 2012 to 2013. Eleven subjects out of 42 TST converters (26%) were IGRA-positive; two of them developed into active pulmonary TB during the follow-up period.There was significant discordance between TST conversion and IGRA results in high-risk HCWs, and active TB developed only in TST-converted and IGRA-positive HCWs. Therefore, the combined use of TST and IGRA for periodic monitoring of TB infections in high-risk HCWs may be useful."

Recently, we have developed a novel imaging technology named scanning electron-assisted dielectric-impedance microscopy (SE-ADM), which visualizes untreated living mammalian cells in aqueous conditions with high contrast. Using the SE-ADM system, we observed 60-nm gold colloids with antibodies directly binding to the focal adhesion core containing integrin β1 on mammalian cancer cells without staining and fixation. The adhesion core contains three or four high-density regions of integrin β1 and connects to the actin filament. An adhesion core with high-density integrin β1 is suggested to contain 10–20 integrin dimers. Our SE-ADM system can also visualize various other membrane proteins in living cells in medium without staining and fixation."
https://openalex.org/W2890500897,"Nitric oxide (NO) can be generated from nitrite by reductase activity of deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) apparently to facilitate tissue perfusion under hypoxic condition. Although hemoglobin E (HbE) solutions have been shown to exhibit decreased rate of nitrite reduction to NO, this observation has never been reported in erythrocytes from subjects with hemoglobin E/ß-thalassemia (HbE/ß-thal). In this study, we investigated the nitrite reductase activity of deoxyHb dialysates from 58 non-splenectomized and 23 splenectomized HbE/ß-thal subjects compared to 47 age- and sex-matched normal subjects, and examined its correlation with platelet activity. Iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin (HbNO) was measured by tri-iodide reductive chemiluminescence as a marker of NO generation. HbNO produced from the reaction of nitrite with deoxyHb dialysate from both non-splenectomized and splenectomized HbE/ß-thal subjects was lower than that of normal (AA) hemoglobin subjects. P-selectin expression, a marker of platelet activation, at baseline and in reactivity to stimulation by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), were higher in HbE/ß-thal subjects than normal subjects. HbNO formation from the reactions of nitrite and deoxyHb inversely correlated with baseline platelet P-selectin expression, HbE levels, and tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV). Nitrite plus deoxygenated erythrocytes from HbE/ß-thal subjects had a lower ability to inhibit ADP-induced P-selectin expression on platelets than erythrocytes from normal subjects. We conclude that deoxyHb in erythrocytes from HbE/ß-thal subjects has a decreased ability to reduce nitrite to NO, which is correlated with increased platelet activity in these individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2891576669,"The present study introduces the Extreme Climate Event Database (EXCEED), a picture database intended to induce emotionally salient stimuli reactions in the context of natural hazards associated with global climate change and related extreme events. The creation of the database was motivated by the need to better understand the impact that the increase in natural disasters worldwide has on human emotional reactions. This new database consists of 150 pictures divided into three categories: two negative categories that depict images of floods and droughts, and a neutral category composed of inanimate objects. Affective ratings were obtained using online survey software from 50 healthy Brazilian volunteers who rated the pictures according to valence and arousal, which are two fundamental dimensions used to describe emotional experiences. Valence refers to the appraisal of pleasantness conveyed by a stimulus, and arousal involves internal emotional activation induced by a stimulus. Data from picture rating, sex difference in affective ratings and psychometric properties of the database are presented here. Together, the data validate the use of EXCEED in research related to natural hazards and human reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2889730177,"Ciliopathies presenting as inherited hepatorenal fibrocystic disorders are rare in humans and in dogs. We describe here a novel lethal ciliopathy in Norwich Terrier puppies that was diagnosed at necropsy and characterized as diffuse cystic renal disease and hepatic fibrosis. The histopathological findings were typical for cystic renal dysplasia in which the cysts were located in the straight portion of the proximal tubule, and thin descending and ascending limbs of Henle’s loop. The pedigree of the affected puppies was suggestive of an autosomal recessive inheritance and therefore, whole exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping were used for identification of the causative variant. The analyses revealed a case-specific homozygous splice donor site variant in a cilia related gene, INPP5E: c.1572+5G>A. Association of the variant with the defect was validated in a large cohort of Norwich Terriers with 3 cases and 480 controls, the carrier frequency being 6%. We observed that the identified variant introduces a novel splice site in INPP5E causing a frameshift and formation of a premature stop codon. In conclusion, our results suggest that the INPP5E: c.1572+5G>A variant is causal for the ciliopathy in Norwich Terriers. Therefore, genetic testing can be carried out in the future for the eradication of the disease from the breed."
https://openalex.org/W2891384932,"Community pharmacies are expanding their role into medicines-related healthcare and public health services, previously the domain of physicians and nurses, driven by policies to improve healthcare access for patients and to address problems of increasing demands and rising costs in primary and urgent care services. Understanding the organisational context into which this expansion is taking place is necessary given concerns over the extent to which pharmacies prioritise service volume over the quality of service provision. As part of a larger programme of work, this paper aims to explore stakeholder perceptions of the organisational and extra-organisational factors associated with service quality and quantity in community pharmacy as an established exemplar of private sector organisations providing publicly-funded healthcare. With ethics committee approval, forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with service commissioners, superintendent and front-line pharmacists, purposively selected from across nine geographical areas and a range of community pharmacy organisational types in England. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings highlight the perceived importance of appropriate staffing and skill-mix for promoting service quantity and quality in community pharmacy. Organisational cultures which supported team development were viewed as facilitatory whereas those prioritising business targets over service quality seen to be inhibitive. Older local populations and low patient expectations were thought to limit service uptake as was poor integration with wider primary care services. The contractual framework and commissioning processes were also seen as a barrier to increasing service quality, quantity and integration in this sector. These findings suggest that healthcare administrations should take account of organisational and extra-organisational drivers and barriers when commissioning services from private sector providers such as community pharmacies to ensure that the quality of service provision is incentivised in addition to service quantity. Additionally, collaborative working should be encouraged through integrated commissioning mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2891866941,"In the United States, the Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes water quality standards important for maintaining healthy freshwater ecosystems. Within the CWA framework, states define their own water quality criteria, leading to a potential fragmentation of standards between states. This fragmentation can influence the management of shared water resources and produce spillover effects of pollutants crossing state lines and other political boundaries. We used numerical simulations to test the null prediction of no difference in impairment between watersheds that cross political boundaries (i.e. state lines, national or coastal borders, hereafter termed “transboundary”) and watersheds that cross no boundaries (hereafter “internal”). We found that transboundary watersheds are more likely to be impaired than internal watersheds. Further, we examined possible causes for this relationship based on both geographic and sociopolitical drivers. Though geographic variables such as human-modified land cover and the amount of upstream catchment area are associated with watershed impairment, the number and type of agencies managing land within a watershed better explained the different impairment levels between transboundary and internal watersheds. Watersheds primarily consisting of public lands are less impaired than watersheds consisting of private lands. Similarly, watersheds primarily managed by federal agencies are less impaired than state-managed watersheds. Our results highlight the importance of considering Integrated Watershed Management strategies for water resources within a fragmented policy framework."
https://openalex.org/W2891936894,"This study aimed to investigate whether smokers who are ready to quit are more likely to use electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) than those who are not. The association between the ever and current use of e-cigarettes with the stages of change (SOC) model was examined, which reflects the readiness to quit smoking. Current smokers were categorized based on the SOC (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation). We investigated the associations between quit attempts, intention to quit, and stage of change with e-cigarette use in the general population and different age groups. We used data from the Korea Community Health Survey that was conducted nationwide in 2014, and 45,378 current smokers were included in the study. Adult smokers were more likely to use e-cigarettes simultaneously in the preparation and contemplation stages than in the precontemplation stage (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] of preparation stage: 2.88 and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.26-3.66; AOR of contemplation stage: 1.93 and 95% CI: 1.67-2.24). Ever use of e-cigarette was significantly associated with the contemplation stage in smokers younger than 50 years, while current e-cigarette use was greater in the contemplation stage than in the precontemplation stage at all ages. Both ever and current use of e-cigarettes were significantly related with the preparation stage among all age groups except 50-59 years. Because the use of e-cigarette among smokers may continually increase, public health guidance must be provided to different types of dual users. Previous studies on the association between e-cigarette use and the cognitive and behavioral aspects of smokers have conflicting results. This study highlights whether the use of e-cigarettes can be used as an indicator for the readiness to quit smoking. Thus, counselors can encourage smoking cessation and provide tailored interventions."

In this study, we show that the analysis of entropy production patterns can provide insight into the diverse observations from experiments that investigate porous medium dissolution in imposed flow field. We first present a numerical scheme for the analysis of entropy production in dissolving porous media. Our scheme uses a greyscale digital model for chalk (an extremely fine grained rock), that was obtained using X-ray nanotomography. Greyscale models preserve structural heterogeneities with very high fidelity. We focussed on the coupling between two types of entropy production: the percolative entropy, generated by dissipating the kinetic energy of fluid flow, and the reactive entropy, originating from the consumption of chemical free energy. Their temporal patterns pinpoint three stages of microstructural evolution. We then showed that local mixing deteriorates fluid channelisation by reducing local variations of reactant concentration. We also showed that microstructural evolution can be sensitive to the initial transport heterogeneities, when the macroscopic flowrate is low. This dependence on flowrate indicates the need to resolve the structural features of a porous system when fluid residence time is long."

Healthy young participants (n = 10, 5 female) walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill while an external cable-driven device applied frontal plane forces to the trunk. Two types of forces were applied: 1) forces which accentuated COM movement in the frontal plane (destabilizing) and 2) forces which resisted COM movement in the frontal plane (stabilizing). We quantified dynamic balance control using frontal plane measures of (1) the extent of center of mass (COM) movement over a gait cycle (COM sway), (2) the magnitude of base of support (step width), and (3) cadence. During destabilizing force conditions, COM sway, step width, and cadence increased. In response to stabilizing force conditions, COM sway decreased. In addition, during destabilizing balance conditions participants made quicker adaptations to their step width compared to the time to adapt to stabilizing forces. Taken together, these results provide important insight into differences in dynamic balance control strategies in response to stabilizing and destabilizing force fields."
https://openalex.org/W2892059519,"Insulin resistance-as observed in aging, diabetes, obesity, and other pathophysiological situations, affects brain function, for insulin signaling is responsible for neuronal glucose transport and control of energy homeostasis and is involved in the regulation of neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity. This study investigates brain metabolism and function in a liver-specific Phosphatase and Tensin Homologue (Pten) knockout mouse model (Liver-PtenKO), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. The Liver-PtenKO mouse model showed an increased flux of glucose into the liver-thus resulting in an overall hypoglycemic and hypoinsulinemic state-and significantly lower hepatic production of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (as compared with age-matched control mice). The Liver-PtenKO mice exhibited increased brain glucose uptake, improved rate of glycolysis and flux of metabolites in the TCA cycle, and improved synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Brain slices from both control- and Liver-PtenKO mice responded to the addition of insulin (in terms of pAKT/AKT levels), thereby neglecting an insulin resistance scenario. This study underscores the significance of insulin signaling in brain bioenergetics and function and helps recognize deficits in diseases associated with insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2890795745,"Simplification strategies of antiretroviral treatment represent effective tools for the reduction of drug-induced toxicity, resistance mutations in case of virological failure and costs.To assess the effectiveness of simplification to atazanavir/ritonavir (ATVrtv) or unboosted atazanavir (ATV400) plus lamivudine, and if low plasma or intracellular ATV Ctrough influence virological outcomes.Ambispective observational study in patients with undetectable HIV-RNA who were switched to ATVrtv or ATV400 plus lamivudine once daily. Previous virological failures (VF) were allowed if the resistance tests showed major resistance mutation neither to ATV nor to lamivudine. VF was defined as two consecutive plasma HIV-RNA >200 copies/mL. Effectiveness was assessed by intention-to-treat and on-treatment analyses. Plasma and intracellular ATV Ctrough were measured by LC-MS/MS.A total of 246 patients were included. At week 48, the Kaplan-Meier estimation of efficacy within the ATVrtv and ATV400 groups were 85.9% [95% confidence interval, (CI95), 80.3-91.4%] versus 87.6% (CI95, 80.1-94.1%) by intention-to-treat analysis (p = 0.684), and 97.7% (CI95, 95.2-100%) versus 98.8% (CI95, 97.0-100%) by on-treatment analysis (p = 0.546), respectively. Plasma and intracellular Ctrough were significantly higher with ATVrtv than with ATV400 (geometric mean (GM), 318.3 vs. 605.9 ng/mL; p = 0.013) and (811.3 vs. 2659.2 ng/mL; p = 0.001), respectively. Only 14 patients had plasma Ctrough below the suggested effective concentration for ATV (150 ng/mL). No relationship between plasma or intracellular Ctrough and VF or blips were found.Boosted or unboosted ATV plus lamivudine is effective and safe, and the lower plasma Ctrough observed with ATV400 do not compromise the effectiveness of these simplification regimens in long-term virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2890177263,"Craniosynostosis (CS) is a disorder that involves the premature ossification of one or more cranial sutures. Our research team has described a naturally occurring rabbit model of CS with a variable phenotype and unknown etiology. Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a genomic sampling method for identifying genetic variants in species with little or no existing sequence data. RAD sequencing data was analyzed using a mixed linear model to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with disease occurrence and onset in the rabbit model of CS. SNPs achieving a genome-wide significance of p ≤ 5 x 10-8 were identified on chromosome 2 in association with disease occurrence and on chromosomes 14 and 19 in association with disease onset. Genotyping identified a coding variant in fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1 (FGFBP-1) on chromosome 2 and a non-coding variant upstream of integrin alpha 3 (ITGA3) on chromosome 19 that associated with disease occurrence and onset, respectively. Retrospective analysis of patient data revealed a significant inverse correlation between FGFBP-1 and ITGA3 transcript levels in patients with coronal CS. FGFBP-1 and ITGA3 are genes with roles in early development that warrant functional study to further understand suture biology."
