https://openalex.org/W1998849596,Infants between 12 and 21 days of age can imitate both facial and manual gestures; this behavior cannot be explained in terms of either conditioning or innate releasing mechanisms. Such imitation implies that human neonates can equate their own unseen behaviors with gestures they see others perform.
https://openalex.org/W1996948250,"The 5' terminal sequences of several adenovirus 2 (Ad2) mRNAs, isolated late in infection, are complementary to sequences within the Ad2 genome which are remote from the DNA from which the main coding sequence of each mRNA is transcribed. This has been observed by forming RNA displacement loops (R loops) between Ad2 DNA and unfractionated polysomal RNA from infected cells. The 5' terminal sequences of mRNAs in R loops, variously located between positions 36 and 92, form complex secondary hybrids with single-stranded DNA from restriction endonuclease fragments containing sequences to the left of position 36 on the Ad2 genome. The structures visualized in the electron microscope show that short sequences coded at map positions 16.6, 19.6 and 26.6 on the R strand are joined to form a leader sequence of 150-200 nucleotides at the 5' end of many late mRNAs. A late mRNA which maps to the left of position 16.6 shows a different pattern of second site hybridization. It contains sequences from 4.9-6.0 linked directly to those from 9.6-10.9. These findings imply a new mechanism for the biosynthesis of Ad2 mRNA in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2009849541,"""Normal fibroblast"" lines such as 3T3 cells arrest in the G0/G1 compartment of the cell cycle when starved of serum. Following readdition of serum and after a lag of 14 hr, the cells enter S phase with first-order kinetics. Cell cycle progress after stimulation is thus consistent with the existence of a single, rate-limiting random event (or transition) in G1 as proposed by Smith and Martin (1973). The addition of low concentrations of cycloheximide (33-100 ng/ml) at any time after the end of the lag phase brings about a rapid reduction (within 1-2 hr) of the rate constant for entry into S phase by an amount that is proportional to the inhibition of leucine incorporation. This suggests that the transition probability depends upon the continuous synthesis of a protein with a short half-life, or on some other unstable substance whose concentration is geared to the rate of translation. More importantly at present, the results indicate that the rate-limiting transition occurs within 2 hr of the start of DNA synthesis. When the same low concentrations of cycloheximide are added at the time of serum stimulation, they also lead to a marked elongation of the lag phase which again is related to the inhibitor concentration. This result is surprising since the lag is independent of serum concentration which itself influences the rate of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2071190126,"The messenger RNAs encoding two late adenovirus serotype 2 (Ad2) proteins, fiber and 100K, were purified by hybridization to restriction endonuclease fragments of Ad2 DNA followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing 98% formamide. The 5' terminal oligonucleotides generated by RNAase T1 digestion of the messengers were selected by dihydroxyboryl-cellulose chromatography. Both mRNAs gave an identical 5'-undecanucleotide with the general structure 7mG5'ppp5'AmC(m)U(C4,U3)G. This undecanucleotide could be removed by mild RNAase treatment from the mRNA after hybridization to DNA fragments containing the main coding sequence of the messenger. In contrast, a small region defined by Bal I-E (14.7-21) protects this undecanucleotide from RNase. A second region contained within both Hind III-B (17-31.5) and Hpa I-F (25.5-27.9), although unable to protect the undecanucleotide, hybridizes to both fiber and 100K mRNAs and protects a similar sequence of 100-150 nucleotides. These observations suggest that both mRNAs contain a long common sequence, complementary to at least two different sites on the Ad2 genome remote from the start of these two genes. The implications of these findings are discussed, and a general mechanism is presented for the biosynthesis of mRNAs from larger precursor molecules, based on intramolecular ligation."
https://openalex.org/W1486205509,"Adenylate cyclase activity in a Lubrol 12A9 extract of wild type S49 lymphoma plasma membranes is completely inactivated by incubation at 37 degrees for 20 min. Activity is restored by mixing this heated extract of wild type membranes with an unheated detergent extract of membranes from a variant clone that lacks measureable adenylate cyclase activity (AC-). The factor(s) donated by the AC- extract is labile to heating at 30 degrees (t1/2 = 3 min) or to treatment with N-ethylmaleimide or trypsin. The factor(s) donated by the heated wild type extract is also sensitive to proteases or N-ethylmaleimide. This extract displays more complex inactivation kinetics at 50 degrees, consistent with the existence of separate factors necessary for the stimulatory effects of NaF and guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate. We suggest that at least two proteins are necessary for adenylate cyclase activity and that one of these is retained in the phenotypically adenylate cyclase-deficient variant."

In dialysis patients, serum aluminum and endogenous parathyroid hormone concentrations are significantly correlated. These data suggest that aluminum toxicity in dialysis patients results from oral aluminum ingestion in the presence of hyperparathyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W2052346404,"A survey of cancer mortality from 1950 to 1969 was conducted in U.S. counties where the petroleum industry is most heavily concentrated. Male residents of these counties experienced significantly higher rates for cancers of the lung, the nasal cavity and sinuses, and the skin (including malignant melanoma) compared to male residents of counties with similar demographic characteristics. Further study is needed to determine whether these patterns result from exposure to chemical carcinogens, including polycyclic hydrocarbons, involved in the manufacturing of petroleum."
https://openalex.org/W2070254367,"Rats in which ascending dopamine-containing neurons have been unilaterally destroyed by injections of 6-hydroxydopamine are known to rotate after being injected with apomorphine or L-dopa. The rotation is markedly reduced by either (i) ipsilateral electrocoagulations of the caudate-putamen or internal capsule or (ii) ipsilateral coronal knife cuts immediately rostral to the substantia nigra. Neostriatal efferent fibers, in particular the strionigral projection, appear to be required for the expression of this dopamine-dependent behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2129915098,"A new technique has been developed for stable, long-term recording from groups of individual primary afferent neurons in the freely walking cat. A number of fine, flexible wires are inserted into dorsal root ganglia via a small laminotomy in the lumbar spine. The cut end of each wire can record stable and separable action potentials from one to three dorsal root ganglion neurons; each unit has typically held for 1 to 4 days. A broad range of myelinated somatosensory afferents (conduction velocities of 30 to 120 meters per second) have been studied during locomotion. Most cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents studied have been sensitive monitors of complex combinations of step-cycle components, and their firing patterns would often have been difficult to predict from existing information."
https://openalex.org/W1986436234,"The augmenting or reducing of flash-evoked potentials in paralyzed cats was significantly correlated with their previously videotaped behaviors. Augmenting reducing was due to alterations in cortical rather than subcortical responsiveness, and was duplicated by increasing cortical arousal by means of reticular stimulation while the animal was exposed to visual stimuli of constant intensity. Brainstem activation of cortical inhibition may underlie the behavioral results as well as the results obtained with the evoked potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2048836102,"RNA isolated from the cytoplasm of human cells at late times after infection by adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) has been fractionated by hybridization to fragments of Ad2 DNA which were produced by digestion with the restriction endonucleases Hpa I, Eco RI, Bam HI and Hind III. Cell-free translation of these partially purified mRNAs indicates that the genes for the late Ad2 proteins lie within the following intervals on the conventional Ad2 map: 15K (4.4-17.0 map units), IX and IVa2 (7.5-17.0), IIIa (29.1-40.9), III and V (29.1-57.0), pVIII (40.9-57.0), pVI and II (40.9-70.7), 100K (59.0-83.4), pVIII (70.7-83.4) and IV (85.0-100). In addition to the primary hybridization of the late Ad2 mRNAs to the regions indicated above, most late Ad2 mRNAs (except those for 15K, IX and IVa2) exhibited some hybridization to a secondary site between 17.0 and 29.1 map units."

https://openalex.org/W2071238487,"Abstract HeLa cells were infected with adenovirus 2 (Ad2) virions irradiated with different doses of ultraviolet light. The concentration of early viral mRNA accumulating over 8 hr in the cytoplasm of infected cells was found to fall as a function of ultraviolet dose, and the inhibition displayed first-order kinetics. Transcripts from each of the four early regions of the viral genome exhibit differing sensitivities to ultraviolet light. For three of the four early regions, the rate constant for the ultraviolet-induced inhibition of mRNA production is proportional to the physical size of the genome represented as mRNA in the cytoplasm. DNA extracted from irradiated virions was digested with restriction enzymes, and the fraction of each restriction fragment containing one or more ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers was determined by treating the DNA with T4 ultraviolet endonuclease and assaying the products on alkaline agarose gels. In this manner, the rate of pyrimidine dimer formation per nucleotide was found to be approximately constant throughout the genome. From these data and the previously mapped positions of the early regions, we conclude that the mRNAs coded in each of the four early regions are transcribed from separate promoters. For three of the four early regions, the promoter is within 1000 nucleotides of the 5′-most sequences found in the cytoplasm. In the case of the fourth early region, the initial transcript may be approximately 3 times the size of the transcripts found in the cytoplasm, or transcription of this region of the genome may be influenced by one or more of the early gene products. The concentration of early mRNAs observed in cells mixedly infected with unirradiated and irradiated virions suggests that initiation of transcription is the rate-limiting step in the production of the early mRNAs, and that this rate is independent of the number of viral templates within the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2093085877,"A potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, anisomycin, was applied (10(-6)M) in 6-hour pulses at specific phases in the circadian rhythm of endogenous compound action potential (CAP) activity recorded from the eye of Aplysia in vitro. The phase of the circadian rhythm was systematically advanced or delayed (up to 15 hours) depending on the specific phase at which the pulse was applied. The resultant phase response curve implicates protein synthesis on the eukaryotic ribosome as a fundamental part of the controlling processes that constitutes the circadian clock."

https://openalex.org/W1971655706,"Large pools of empty viral capsids accumulate in cells infected by subgroup B human adenoviruses. Such infected cells also yield DNA-containing incomplete particles in larger quantities than cells infected with serotypes representing other adenovirus subgroups. DNA isolated from carefully purified classes of Ad7 incomplete particles was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage, gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. At least 90% of the DNA molecules in each sample consisted of sequences that extended from the left end of the viral genome map by variable lengths toward the right end. The average length of DNA is linearly related to the average buoyant density of the incomplete particles from which the DNA is isolated. The results indicate that each capsid contains one DNA molecule. There is also a specific association of the left end of the viral genome with assembled or assembling capsids. The characteristic distributions of Ad7 incomplete particles may result from intracellular pools of assembly intermediates in which the incompletely packaged DNA has been fragmented in vivo or by shear during preparative procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2013524093,"Hybridization of HeLa cell RNA to the DNA of a recombinant phage containing sea urchin histone genes shows that histone mRNA of HeLa cells is synthesized throughout the entire cell cycle. Furthermore, histone messenger is synthesized in cells treated with cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA duplication. Although histone RNA is found in the nucleus, the amount of cytoplasmic histone messenger is drastically reduced, in agreement with previous work. The absence of coupling between histone mRNA synthesis and DNA duplication shows that the regulatory process which determines the presence or absence of histone mRNA in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells is not at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2075021652,"The amplitude of auditory evoked potentials recorded from the cerebral hemispheres to pairs of task-irrelevant tones was related to differential hemispheric engagement in ongoing cognitive activity (for example, verbal versus musical). The hemisphere hypothesized to be most engaged in the ongoing cognitive task, as compared to the unengaged hemisphere, produced a greater potential difference between the temporal and reference electrode to the second of the tone pairs. These findings are related to ""fast habituation"" and ""recovery cycle.""."
https://openalex.org/W2149116170,"Abstract Studies on the genetics and molecular biology of the Friend virus complex, which includes both a spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) and a lymphoid leukemia helper virus (LLV), have been hampered by the apparent inability to propagate SFFV in vitro under clonal conditions. The present study describes the establishment of an NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast culture which continuously releases high titers of both LLV and SFFV into the culture medium. SFFV harvested from such cultures was in excess of its LLV helper virus and titrated in vivo with multi-hit kinetics. Hybridization experiments, using purified 70S viral RNA and cDNA made from Friend virus stocks containing SFFV in excess of its helper LLV, indicated that approximately 25–30% of this cDNA represents SFFV-specific sequences. By use of this virus stock, several mouse and rat clones nonproductively infected with SFFV were isolated. SFFV rescued from these nonproductively infected clones by superinfection with LLV, as well as SFFV produced by chronically infected NIH/3T3 cells, was subject to restriction by a previously described host regulatory gene, Fv -2. Each of several SFFV nonproducer clones was shown to contain relatively large amounts of viral-specific RNA sequences. Moreover, these clones also expressed high levels of a 15,000 molecular weight virion structural protein, p15, while the levels of the other gag gene-coded proteins and the major viral envelope glycoprotein, gp70, were similar to those exhibited by uninfected cells. The stable association between the erythroleukemic activity of SFFV and the gag gene-coded protein, p15, of murine leukemia virus is discussed in terms of a possible model for the generation of the SFFV genome."

After the region adjacent to the electrode site was labeled with [14C]dopamine, it was perfused repeatedly by means of push-pull cannulas. Electrical stimulation of this cortical area in six animals enhanced the release of dopamine and its associated metabolites in nine of 16 experiments. Thus in vivo evidence is provided that dopamine is involved in the brain self-stimulation mechanism within the frontal cortex."

These data support, at the molecular level, the observations that delta 9-THC has a weak estrogenic activity (at least the ability to bind to estrogen receptors). Moreover, estrogen-like binding suggests that delta 9-THC, acting at the level of estrogen receptor, causes a primary estrogenic effect rather than an indirect or secondary phenomenon."

In contrast, the ILS% does not correlate with the uptake of these diacridines by cells, nor with the inhibition of RNA synthesis or of DNA synthesis or with the inhibition of growth of cells in culture. The possibility that the antitumor effectiveness of actinomycin D, another DNA intercalator, is associated with sites of action other than the hibition of RNA synthesis is discussed."

High infection rates were obtained in mice inoculated with about 1.5 X 10(8) organisms. Infectivity reacquisition was correlated with invasion of the salivary glands by the parasites. Few small trypanosomes with subterminal kinetoplasts (metacyclic-like forms) were found in the infective inoculums. The parasitemias in mice consisted of pleomorphic cultivable trypanosomes. Cultures initiated by these organisms and then placed with the head-salivary gland preparations became infective for mice.

https://openalex.org/W2010757393,"The size of DNA replication intermediates from Drosophila cells pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine for 30-120 sec was determined by electrophoresis in formamide-polyacrylamide gels. Replication intermediates were formed in three discrete size classes, with median lengths of 61, 125 and 240 nucleotides. Replication intermediates in the 125 nucleotide size class occurred most frequently. Two of the three size classes may contain discrete species of replication intermediates about 90-400 nucleotides long. The data also suggested that some larger replication intermediates accumulate in pulse-labeled cells. We concluded that 61 nucleotide molecules give rise to 125 and 240 nucleotide molecules, which then form high molecular weight DNA. Mechanisms for forming these replication intermediates are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2106606820,"Using the technology of metaphase chromosome transfer, evidence has been obtained in CHO cells that genes controlling enzymes in a common pathway in folate metabolism are closely linked. MtxRI and MtxRIII are co-dominant mutations which affect the structure and level of dihydrofolate reductase. Gat- is a glycine-, adenosine- and thymidine-requiring auxotrophic mutant with a lesion in folylpolyglutamate synthetase, an enzyme responsible for addition of glutamates to folate residues. GlyB- is an auxotrophic glycine-requiring mutant whose phenotype may be reversed by folinic acid. Using purified metaphase chromosomes, the MtxR genes were co-transferred into recipient cells with the auxotrophic markers, as demonstrated by the isolation of transferents when two of the phenotypes, either Mtx and Gat, or Mtx and GlyB, were selected at the same time. When recipient cells were selected for Gat+ or GlyB+ alone, the transferents carried the MtxR markers. The GlyA mutation, another glycine-requiring auxotrophic change, is not co-transferred with methotrexate resistance. Because of previous evidence that only a small fragment is involved in chromosomal transfer experiments, these results seem to provide the first indication that some genes which control enzymes on a common metabolic pathway in eucaryotes are closely linked or are at least syntenic."
