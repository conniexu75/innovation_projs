https://openalex.org/W2046749316,"To address the mechanisms of tolerance to extrathymic proteins, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral (LCMV) glycoprotein (GP) in the beta islet cells of the pancreas. The fate of LCMV GP-specific T cells was followed by breeding the GP transgenic mice with T cell receptor transgenic mice, specific for LCMV and H-2Db. These studies suggest that ""peripheral tolerance"" of self-reactive T cells does not involve clonal deletion, clonal anergy, or a decrease in the density of T cell receptors or accessory molecules. Instead, this model indicates that self-reactive cytotoxic T cells may remain functionally unresponsive, owing to a lack of appropriate T cell activation. Infection of transgenic mice with LCMV readily abolishes peripheral unresponsiveness to the self LCMV GP antigen, resulting in a CD8+ T cell-mediated diabetes. These data suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in several so-called ""T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases."""
https://openalex.org/W1995201985,"We investigated the potential association between viruses and insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes (IDDM) by developing a transgenic mouse model. By inserting into these mice a unique viral protein that was then expressed as a self-antigen in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, we could study the effect on that expressed antigen alone, or in concert with an induced antiviral (i.e., autoimmune) response manifested later in life in causing IDDM. Our results indicate that a viral gene introduced as early as an animal's egg stage, incorporated into the germline, and expressed in islet cells does not produce tolerance when the host is exposed to the same virus later in life. We observed that the induced anti-self (viral) CTL response leads to selective and progressive damage of β cells, resulting in IDDM."
https://openalex.org/W2152698588,"The existence of a protein-conducting channel in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane was demonstrated by electrophysiological techniques. Pancreatic rough microsome (RM) vesicles were fused to one side (cis) of a planar lipid bilayer separating two aqueous compartments of 50 mM salt. This exposed the cytoplasmic surface of the RMs, with its attached ribosomes, to the cis chamber. Addition of 100 microM puromycin to the cis side caused a large increase in membrane conductance, presumably the result of puromycin-induced clearance of nascent protein chains from the lumen of protein-conducting channels. When puromycin was added at low concentrations (0.33 microM), single channels of 220 pS were observed. These closed when the salt concentration was raised to levels at which ribosomes detach from the membrane (150-400 mM), indicating that the attached ribosome keeps the channel in an open conformation. A mechanism for a complete cycle of opening and closing of the protein-conducting channel is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2011465521,"Noxious stimulation provokes the activation of genes that are thought to play a crucial role in the phenomena of stress and pain. Among these is the prodynorphin gene. By double-labeling in situ hybridization/immunohistochemistry, we show that increased prodynorphin gene expression is preceded, in the same neurons, by an early induction of c-fos. Inspection of the prodynorphin promoter region revealed the presence of several AP-1-like sequences. We demonstrate that only one of these sites is a functional AP-1 element. It is constituted by the noncanonical TGACAAACA sequence, in which the palindromic structure is partly conserved by the 3′ terminal CA dinucleotide. Transfection experiments in NCB20 neuroblastoma cells indicated that this site is a target of Fos/Jun trans-activation. Our results suggest that Fos/Jun oncoproteins may function as third messengers in the signal transduction mechanisms of stress/pain processes."
https://openalex.org/W1553345337,"Abstract Platelet activation converts the membrane GP IIb-IIIa complex into a functional receptor for fibrinogen, but the mechanism is poorly understood. We asked whether induction of receptor competency coincides with a conformational change affecting the spatial arrangement of exoplasmic domains of the IIb and IIIa subunits. Epitopes on these subunits were labeled with monoclonal antibodies conjugated to either a donor fluorescein (FITC) or an acceptor tetramethylrhodamine (TR) chromophore. Then, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (RET) between platelet-bound FITC and TR was measured by flow cytometry. In unstimulated platelets, 6-8% RET efficiency was detected between antibody B1B5, bound to GP IIb, and antibody SSA6, bound to GP IIIa, regardless of which antibody served as RET donor. RET was also observed between these antibodies and A2A9, an antibody specific for the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Cell stimulation by thrombin, ADP plus epinephrine or phorbol-ester caused up to a 2-fold increase in RET between chromophore-labeled, platelet-bound B1B5, SSA6, and A2A9 (p less than or equal to 0.05), suggesting a change in the separation or orientation of these epitopes within the GP IIb-IIIa complex. The activation-related conformational change detected by the increase in RET between antibody B1B5 and SSA6 was independent of receptor occupancy since it was unaffected by the addition of fibrinogen or by the inhibition of fibrinogen binding by the antibody, A2A9, or the peptide, RGDS. In contrast to these results with antibodies bound to different epitopes within GP IIb-IIIa, no RET was observed between FITC-A2A9 and TR-A2A9 bound to different GP IIb-IIIa complexes or between a TR-labeled GP Ib antibody and FITC-labeled GP IIb-IIIa antibodies. These studies demonstrate that platelet activation causes a change in the spatial separation or orientation of exoplasmic domains within GP IIb and IIIa, which may serve to convert this integrin into a functional adhesion receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1986380537,"Cell division in the Xenopus CNS was blocked by incubating embryos in a mixture of the DNA synthesis inhibitors hydroxyurea and aphidicolin. Surprisingly, embryos treated at the beginning of gastrulation proceeded normally through neurulation, neural tube closure, and CNS subdivision. Thus, cell division is not critical for neural induction or early morphogenetic events in the CNS. Neuroblasts in treated embryos differentiated into neurons of many classes, indicating that cellular determination in the CNS can be dissociated from lineage and birth date. Axonal tracts and embryonic reflexes also developed. The remarkable amount of normal CNS development that occurs in these animals may be explained by a series of sequential inductions that are largely independent of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2024970650,"The nad1 gene encoding subunit I of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase is fragmented into five unique-copy coding segments that are scattered over at least 40 kb and interspersed with other genes in the wheat mitochondrial genome. The nad1 segments are flanked by sequences with group II intron features, and transcript analysis demonstrates the presence of correctly spliced mRNAs. RNA editing occurs at sites asymmetrically distributed along the wheat nad1 coding region, and the initiation codon is created by RNA editing. The unusual organization of the wheat nad1 gene is attributed to mitochondrial DNA rearrangements within introns, and a trans-splicing model involving secondary structural interactions between group II-like intron pieces is proposed for its expression."
https://openalex.org/W2065404736,"Loss of sensitivity to growth inhibitory polypeptides is likely to be one of the events that participates in the formation of some tumors and might be caused by inactivation or loss of the genetic elements that transduce these extracellular signals. The isolation of such a gene was achieved by randomly inactivating genes by an anti-sense complementary DNA expression library followed by direct selection for growth in the presence of an inhibitory polypeptide. Thus, a gene whose inactivation conveyed growth resistance to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was isolated. Sequence analysis showed complete identity with human thioredoxin, a dithiol reducing agent, implicated here in the IFN-gamma-mediated growth arrest of HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1595313172,"Tryptophan synthase, an alpha 2 beta 2 complex, is a classic example of an enzyme that is thought to channel a metabolic intermediate (indole) from the active site of the alpha subunit to the active site of the beta subunit. We now examine the kinetics of substrate channeling by tryptophan synthase directly by chemical quench-flow and stopped-flow methods. The conversion of indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP) to tryptophan at the active site proceeds at a rate of 24 s-1, which is limited by the rate of cleavage of IGP to produce indole (alpha reaction). In a single turnover experiment monitoring the conversion of radiolabeled IGP to tryptophan, only a trace of indole is detectable (less than or equal to 1% of the IGP), implying that the reaction of indole to form tryptophan must be quite fast (greater than or equal to 1000 s-1). The rate of reaction of indole from solution is much too slow (40 s-1 under identical conditions) to account for the negligible accumulation of indole in a single turnover. Therefore, the indole produced at the alpha site must be rapidly channeled to the beta site, where it reacts with serine to form tryptophan: channeling and the reaction of indole to form tryptophan must each occur at rates greater than or equal to 1000 s-1. Steady-state turnover is limited by the slow rate of tryptophan release (8 s-1). In the absence of serine, the cleavage of IGP to indole is limited by a change in protein conformation at a rate of 0.16 s-1. When the alpha beta reaction is initiated by mixing enzyme with IGP and serine simultaneously, there is a lag in the cleavage IGP and formation of tryptophan. The kinetics of the lag correspond to the rate of formation of the aminoacrylate in the reaction of serine with pyridoxal phosphate at the beta site, measured by stopped-flow methods (45 s-1). There is also a change in protein fluorescence, suggestive of a change in protein conformation, occurring at the same rate. Substitution of cysteine for serine leads to a longer lag in the kinetics of IGP cleavage and a correspondingly slower rate of formation of the aminoacrylate (6 s-1). Thus, the reaction of serine at the beta site modulates the alpha reaction such that the formation of the aminoacrylate leads to a change in protein conformation that is transmitted to the alpha site to enhance the rate of IGP cleavage 150-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1555774609,"By chromatographic and mass spectral techniques we document in rat liver the presence of new classes of glycerophospholipids which contain an epoxyeicosatrienoate moiety, esterified to the glycerol-sn-2 position. These novel lipids are formed in vivo from endogenous precursors and under physiological conditions. Chromatographic resolution followed by hydrolysis and regioisomeric analysis showed that they consist of the 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoyl derivatives of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. Their relative concentrations (micromoles of oxidized lipid/mol of phospholipid) were 70, 85, and 106 for phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol, respectively. Chiral analysis of the fatty acids at sn-2 revealed an enantioselective preference for 8(S),9(R)-, 11(S),12(R)-, and 14(R),15(S)-epoxyeicosatrienoates in all three lipid classes. The data suggest a multienzyme process initiated by cytochrome P-450 epoxidation of arachidonic acid followed by ATP-dependent activation to epoxyeicosatrienoyl-CoA derivatives and stereoselective lysolipid acylation. These results provide a molecular basis for a potential physiological role of cytochrome P-450 in the biosynthesis of unique cellular glycerolipids and, consequently, in the control of cell membrane structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W1605174965,"The expression of DNA polymerase alpha, a principal chromosome replication enzyme, is constitutive during the cell cycle. We show in this report that DNA polymerase alpha catalytic polypeptide p180 is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle and is hyperphosphorylated in G2/M phase. The p70 subunit is phosphorylated only in G2/M phase. This cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation is due to cell cycle-dependent kinase(s) and not to phosphatase(s). In vitro evidence indicates the involvement of p34cdc2 kinase in the mitotic phosphorylation of DNA polymerase alpha. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps demonstrate that peptides phosphorylated in vitro are identical to those phosphorylated in vivo. DNA polymerase alpha from mitotic cells is found to have lower affinity for single-stranded DNA than does polymerase alpha from G1/S phase cells. These results imply that the mitotic phosphorylation of polymerase alpha may affect its physical interaction with other replicative proteins and/or with DNA at the replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1976104586,"To help focus debate about the best use of society's resources, it is important to have estimates of the benefits and costs of further improvements in air quality. Such estimates are developed, with focus primarily on reductions in ground-level ozone resulting from the control of volatile organic compounds; to a lesser extent, particulate control also is considered. Proposed controls are evaluated for both the nation as a whole and for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, where violations of air quality standards are most frequent and severe. Subject to a number of uncertainties, the costs of proposed new controls are found to exceed the benefits, perhaps by a considerable margin."
https://openalex.org/W1586989529,"The production of alpha-amidated peptides from their glycine-extended precursors is a two-step process involving the sequential action of two catalytic domains encoded by the bifunctional peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) precursor. The NH2-terminal third of the PAM precursor contains the first enzyme, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), a copper, molecular oxygen, and ascorbate-dependent enzyme. The middle third of the PAM precursor contains the second enzyme, peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL). The COOH-terminal third of the PAM precursor encodes a transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain that may form a cytoplasmic tail. Antisera to a peptide within the PAL domain were used to identify a 50-kDa protein as the major form of PAL in bovine neurointermediate pituitary granules. This 50-kDa PAL protein was purified and found to begin at Asp434 of bPAM, indicating that it could arise through endoproteolytic cleavage of the bPAM precursor at Lys432-Lys433. With alpha-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-alpha-hydroxyglycine as the substrate, PAL exhibits a pH optimum of 5.0; enzymatic activity is inhibited by high concentrations of salt but is relatively resistant to thiol reagents and urea. PAL activity is inhibited by EDTA and restored by a number of divalent metals, including Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+. Kinetic studies using alpha-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-alpha-hydroxyglycine indicate that PAL has a Km of 38 microM and a turnover number of 220/s. Expression vectors encoding only the soluble PHM domain or the PAM precursor from which the PHM domain had been deleted were constructed. hEK293 cells transfected with the PHM vector exhibited a 10-fold increase in secretion of PHM activity with no PHM activity detectable in control or transfected cells. hEK293 cells transfected with the PAL vector exhibited a 2-fold increase in secretion of PAL activity and a 15-fold increase in cellular PAL activity. Most of the PAL activity produced by the transfected cells remained membrane-associated."
https://openalex.org/W1592745274,"Analyses of the 5' regulatory sequences of genes encoding barbiturate-inducible cytochromes P450BM-1 and P450BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium and of the 5' sequences of genes for barbiturate-inducible P450b and P450e of the rat revealed a string of 17 base pairs in each of the genes that shared a high degree of sequence identity. Labeled oligonucleotide probes of each of these four sequences were tested in gel retardation assays with protein obtained from B. megaterium grown either in the presence or absence of barbiturates or with protein from nuclear extracts from livers of rats left untreated or injected with phenobarbital. Each of the four 17-mers bound strongly to a single protein from bacteria grown in the absence of barbiturates, but this binding was dramatically reduced with protein from pentobarbital- or phenobarbital-grown cells. Conversely, the probes complexed weakly to one protein band from nuclear extracts from untreated rats but much more strongly with protein from phenobarbital-treated rats. Similar effects could be obtained by prolonged incubation with phenobarbital of either soluble protein from the bacteria grown in the absence of barbiturates or nuclear extract protein from untreated rats. Deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the P450BM-1 gene of B. megaterium revealed a putative repressor binding site located within a 24-base pair DNA segment that included the 17-base pair sequence involved in barbiturate-regulated protein binding."
https://openalex.org/W1643013712,"The addition of platelet-activating factor (PAF) to human neutrophils increases the levels of the tyrosine phosphorylation in several proteins. These proteins have molecular weights of 41 (pp41), 54 (pp54), 66 (pp66), 104 (pp104), and 116 (pp116) kDa. The effect of PAF was dose-dependent and could be seen at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The nonmetabolizable bioactive PAF analog, C-PAF, caused an increase in the level of phosphorylation of the same proteins in a time- and dose-dependent manner. On the contrary, lyso-PAF, enantio-PAF, and L-beta,gamma-dihexadecyl-alpha-lecithin failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of any of the aforementioned proteins. The response to PAF was prevented by the PAF antagonist BN-52021. The PAF-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation in pp66, pp116, and pp104 were selectively inhibited by pertussis toxin. In contrast, the level of pp41 phosphorylation remained unchanged after the pertussis toxin treatment. The calcium chelator EGTA significantly inhibited the PAF-produced phosphorylation of the pp41 protein. The intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxil)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) potentiated the PAF-enhanced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation on the pp41 protein. On the other hand, the PAF-induced phosphorylations of pp66, pp104, and pp116 were inhibited in BAPTA-treated cells. The calcium ionophore A23187 selectively potentiated the phosphorylation of the pp41 protein and reduced the phosphorylation in the pp54 protein. This phosphorylation was dependent on the extracellular calcium and was inhibited in toxin-treated cells. The results suggest that PAF is able to affect either directly or indirectly tyrosine kinase and/or phosphotyrosine phosphatase activities. The phosphorylation of the high and low molecular weight proteins are mediated by two different sets of kinases and/or phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1527453674,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase has a single iron protoporphyrin IX which is required for both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of the enzyme. At room temperature, the heme iron is coordinated at the axial position by an imidazole, and about 20% of the heme iron is coordinated at the distal position by an imidazole. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate which histidine residues are involved in PGH synthase catalysis and heme binding. Individual mutant cDNAs for ovine PGH synthases were prepared with amino acid substitutions at each of 13 conserved histidines. cos-1 cells were transfected with each of these cDNAs, and the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of the resulting microsomal PGH synthases were measured. Mutant PGH synthases in which His-207, His-309, or His-388 was replaced with either glutamine or alanine lacked both activities. Gln-386 and Ala-386 PGH synthase mutants exhibited cyclooxygenase but not peroxidase activities. Other mutants exhibited both activities at varying levels. Because binding of heme renders native PGh synthase resistant to cleavage by trypsin, we examined the effects of heme on the relative sensitivities of native, Ala-204, Ala-207, Ala-309, Ala-386, and Ala-388 mutant PGH synthases to trypsin as a measure of the heme-protein interaction. The Ala-309 PGh synthase mutant was notably hypersensitive to tryptic cleavage, even in the presence of exogenous heme; in contrast, the native enzyme and the other alanine mutants exhibited similar, lower sensitivities toward trypsin and, except for the Ala-386 mutant, were partially protected from trypsin cleavage by heme. Preincubation of the native and each of the alanine mutant PGH synthases, including the Ala-309 mutant, with indomethacin protected the proteins from trypsin cleavage. Thus, all the mutant proteins retain sufficient three-dimensional structure to bind cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Our results suggest that His-309 is one of the heme ligands, probably the axial ligand, of PGH synthase. Two other histidines, His-207 and His-388, are essential for both PGH synthase activities suggesting that either His-207 or His-388 can serve as the distal heme ligand; however, the trypsin cleavage measurements imply that neither His-207 nor His-388 is required for heme binding. This is consistent with the fact that only 20% of the distal coordination position of the heme iron of PGH synthase is occupied by an imidazole side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1483800737,"It has become increasingly clear that agents classically thought to act as neurotransmitters can also alter gene expression. To understand the early events by which neurotransmitters could effect genetic responses, we have studied the induction of two immediate early genes, c-fos and c-jun. These genes encode proteins that form a dimeric complex (AP-1) active as a transcriptional factor. Using the stable acetylcholine analog carbachol to activate muscarinic receptors (mAChR) in a glial cell line (1321N1), we show that c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels are transiently increased, reaching a maximum at 30 min after agonist addition. Experiments in which the actions of carbachol are blocked by adding atropine at various times demonstrate that only 1.5 min of agonist stimulation is needed to give maximal increases in c-fos or c-jun mRNA at 30 min. These results suggest that events previously shown to occur in the first minute of mAChR occupation (the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, activation of protein kinase C) are sufficient for induction of these immediate early genes. In cells in which protein kinase C has been down-regulated, carbachol no longer stimulates c-fos or c-jun expression, indicating a critical role for protein kinase C in these responses. In cells loaded with bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) to buffer increases in cytosolic [Ca2+], mAChR-mediated induction of c-fos is markedly reduced; in contrast there is enhanced c-jun expression. The strong enhancement of c-jun induction by carbachol in BAPTA-treated cells is due at least in part to mRNA stabilization. Experiments using phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) in combination with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin confirm that activation of protein kinase C induces c-fos and c-jun expression and that a concomitant increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] potentiates the induction of c-fos while repressing that of c-jun. The data suggest that the ability of neurotransmitters or growth factors to mobilize Ca2+ would modulate the effect of concomitant protein kinase C activation on AP-1 generation and consequent target gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010703328,"Ras-GAP (GTPase activating protein) is a regulatory protein that stimulates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the proto-oncogene product p21ras. A domain of the neurofibromatosis gene product (NF1) that has sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of Ras-GAP and to yeast IRA gene products also has a specific stimulatory activity toward p21ras GTPase. Arachidonic acid and phosphatidic acid inactivate GAP, but no agents have been identified that stimulate GAP and thereby switch p21ras off. With the use of recombinant Ha-c-Ras and Ras-GAP, NF1, and GAP catalytic domains, it was found that prostaglandins PGF2 alpha and PGA2 stimulated Ras-GAP and that prostacyclin PGI2 inhibited Ras-GAP. The stimulatory effect of PGF2 alpha was saturable and structure-specific and competed with the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid also inhibited the catalytic activity of NF1, but prostaglandins were not stimulatory. These results suggest a mechanism for the allosteric control of Ras function through the modulation of arachidonate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1499361685,"We have previously shown that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) phosphorylates smg p21A and -B, ras p21-like small GTP-binding proteins. In the present study, we investigated the function(s) of this phosphorylation by use of the smg p21B purified from human platelets. smg p21B bound to plasma membranes and the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of smg p21B reduced this binding. Moreover, the phosphorylation of smg p21B enhanced the two actions of its specific GDP/GTP exchange protein, named GDP dissociation stimulator, when tested in a cell-free system: one is the action to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of smg p21B, and the other is the action to inhibit the binding of smg p21B to membranes. Consistently, smg p21B was translocated from the membranes to the cytoplasm when it was phosphorylated by protein kinase A in intact platelets in response to prostaglandin E1 or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of smg p21B affected neither its basal GDP/GTP exchange reaction, basal GTPase activity, nor the GTPase activity stimulated by its specific GTPase activating protein. On the other hand, we have recently clarified that the structure of the C-terminal region of the post-translationally processed human platelet smg p21B is Lys-Lys-Ser-Ser-all-trans-geranylgeranyl Cys181 methyl ester, and that this modification of the C-terminal region is essential for smg p21B to bind to membranes. We furthermore determined here that protein kinase A phosphorylated Ser179 in this C-terminal region of smg p21B. These results indicate that protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of smg p21B makes smg p21B sensitive to the actions of smg p21 GDP dissociation stimulator."
https://openalex.org/W1981728848,"IM is a voltage- and time dependent K+ current that is suppressed by muscarinic receptor activation. IM augmentation following agonist washout was blocked by heavily buffering [Ca2+ using BAPTA. Although IM is not primarily Ca2+ dependent, small increases in [Ca2+]i by photolysis of the “caged” Ca2+ chelator nitr-5 or by evoking action potentials augmented, while larger increases inhibited, IM. Raising [Ca2+]i, for prolonged periods, by nitr-5 photolysis, reduced its sensitivity to agonist, leaving a poorly reversible response. These results suggest that IM can be regulated by physiologically relevant changes in [Ca2+]i, placing IM in a unique position to modulate cell excitability."
https://openalex.org/W1932304369,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S ADP-ribosylates several GTP-binding proteins of apparent Mr = 23,000-25,000. Exoenzyme S absolutely requires a soluble eukaryotic protein, which we have named FAS (Factor Activating exoenzyme S), in order to ADP-ribosylate all substrates. The rate of ADP-ribosylation of all exoenzyme S substrates increases linearly with time and with the FAS concentration. FAS is wide-spread in eukaryotes but appears to be absent from prokaryotes. We have estimated the molecular mass of the protein to be approximately 29,000 daltons and its pI to be 4.3-4.5. Several bacterial toxins share this sort of requirement for the presence of a eukaryotic protein for enzymic activity. In particular, FAS resembles ADP-ribosylation factor, a 21,000-dalton GTP-binding protein which performs an analogous function for cholera toxin. However, we can find no evidence that FAS binds GTP. In the presence of FAS, exoenzyme S ADP-ribosylates several proteins in lysates of P. aeruginosa. The requirement for a eukaryotic protein for enzymic activity, which is common to several bacterial toxins, may be a device to identify the eukaryotic environment and to ensure that the enzymes cannot function within and harm the toxin-producing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1532268531,"The interaction of platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex with the cytoplasmic membrane skeleton is potentially of major importance in regulating platelet function. Indirect evidence suggested that this interaction is mediated by actin-binding protein, but it is not known whether GP Ib-IX and actin-binding protein associate directly. To examine more closely the nature of this association, purified GP Ib-IX complex was specifically bound and oriented on the surface of impermeable polymer beads via a monoclonal antibody, AK 2, directed against the extracytoplasmic domain of GP Ib alpha (glycocalicin). Binding was specific since 1) it was abolished by excess unlabeled actin-binding protein; 2) there was no detectable specific binding of radiolabeled actin-binding protein to beads coated with glycocalicin, the major extracytoplasmic proteolytic fragment of GP Ib alpha; and 3) unlike actin-binding protein, there was no specific binding of bovine serum albumin or human platelet vinculin to the GP Ib-IX complex-coated beads. Binding of actin-binding protein to the GP Ib-IX complex-coated beads, but not to the glycocalicin-coated beads, was saturable and reversible (apparent Kd = 1 x 10(-7) M). These experiments provide direct evidence that actin-binding protein can bind to the cytoplasmic domain of a membrane glycoprotein. Because actin-binding protein is found submembranously in cells other than the platelet, it is possible that this protein may link actin filaments to the plasma membrane in those cells."
https://openalex.org/W1523612979,"A new category of beta-(1----4)-xylan xylanohydrolases that exhibit a specific capacity to hydrolyze glucuronoxylans was characterized using heteroxylans prepared from Vigna (Vigna angularis Ohwi et Ohashi cv. Takara) and maize (Zea mays L.) cell walls together with appropriate derivatives as substrates. Glucuronopyranosyl moieties, as side chains, were prerequisite for enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of the beta-(1----4)-xylosyl linkages. The enzyme degraded glucuronoxylans derived from Vigna cell walls to yield a major oligomeric species (formula; see text) where Xyl represents xylose and GlcA represents glucuronic acid. The enzyme also degraded glucuronoarabinoxylans derived from maize cell walls to yield a major oligomeric species containing a single glucuronosyl side chain and a single unsubstituted beta 1----4Xyl pendant terminal. These results indicate that this xylanohydrolase recognizes glucuronosyl moieties inserted as monomeric side chains along the xylan backbone and mediates the hydrolysis of the beta-(1----4)-xylosyl linkage of the adjacent unsubstituted xylosyl residue in heteroxylans. This enzyme is the first xylanohydrolase identified that recognizes distinctly different sugars constituting side chains. We propose to designate this new enzyme as a glucuronoxylan xylanohydrolase to be abbreviated as glucuronoxylanase. Use of this unique enzyme demonstrated the presence of repeating units in heteroxylans in cell walls of higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1516864086,"Mutant versions of the calmodulin of Drosophila melanogaster have been prepared for use in the study of Ca2+ binding and Ca2(+)-induced conformational changes. In each mutant, a conserved glutamic acid residue indicated to play a critical role in Ca2+ binding has been mutated to glutamine in one of the Ca2(+)-binding sites. Thus a series of four proteins, each with an analogous mutation in one of the four binding sites, has been generated. Here the Ca2(+)-induced conformational changes in these proteins have been examined by use of the fluorescent hydrophobic reporter molecule, 9-anthroyl choline. These studies confirm earlier work which indicates that the carboxyl-terminal pair of Ca2(+)-binding sites shows cooperative Ca2+ binding to produce a major conformational change in the protein. However, these studies provide evidence that the sites of the amino-terminal pair are more independent in their Ca2+ binding properties and contribute individually to the conformational changes associated with Ca2+ binding in the amino-terminal half of the protein. This work also indicates that mutation of either of the amino-terminal Ca2(+)-binding sites can influence the conformational change produced by Ca2+ binding to the carboxyl-terminal sites."
https://openalex.org/W1576016987,"The structure and sequence of the human gene for aldose reductase (AR) was determined by analysis of cDNA and genomic clones.

A major site of transcription initiation in liver was mapped to an A residue 31 nucleotides upstream from the A of the ATG initiation codon. The promotor region of the gene contains a TATA (TATTTA) box and a CCAAT box which are located 37 and 104 nucleotides upstream, respectively, from the transcription initiation site. We have found four Alu elements in the AR gene; two are found in intron 1 and one each in intron 4 and intron 9."
https://openalex.org/W1530383954,"Abstract Heparin cofactor II (HC) is a plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that inhibits alpha-thrombin in a reaction that is dramatically enhanced by heparin and other glycosaminoglycans/polyanions. We investigated the glycosaminoglycan binding site in HC by: (i) chemical modification with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in the absence and presence of heparin and dermatan sulfate; (ii) molecular modeling; and (iii) site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis. Four lysyl residues (173, 252, 343, and 348) were protected from modification by heparin and to a lesser extent by dermatan sulfate. Heparin-protected PLPHC retained both heparin cofactor and dermatan sulfate cofactor activity while dermatan sulfate-protected PLPHC retained some dermatan sulfate cofactor activity and little heparin cofactor activity. Molecular modeling studies revealed that Lys173 and Lys252 are within a region previously shown to contain residues involved in glycosaminoglycan binding. Lys343 and Lys348 are distant from this region, but protection by heparin and dermatan sulfate might result from a conformational change following glycosaminoglycan binding to the inhibitor. Site-directed mutagenesis of Lys173 and Lys343 was performed to further dissect the role of these two regions during HC-heparin and HC-dermatan sulfate interactions. The Lys343----Asn or Thr mutants had normal or only slightly reduced heparin or dermatan sulfate cofactor activity and eluted from heparin-Sepharose at the same ionic strength as native recombinant HC. However, the Lys173----Gln or Leu mutants had greatly reduced heparin cofactor activity and eluted from heparin-Sepharose at a significantly lower ionic strength than native recombinant HC but retained normal dermatan sulfate cofactor activity. Our results demonstrate that Lys173 is involved in the interaction of HC with heparin but not with dermatan sulfate, whereas Lys343 is not critical for HC binding to either glycosaminoglycan. These data provide further evidence for the determinants required for glycosaminoglycan binding to HC."
https://openalex.org/W2165563320,"The importance of sugar contacts for the sequence-specific recognition that occurs during polyadenylation of mRNAs was investigated with chemically synthesized substrates containing 2'-O-CH3 groups at selected riboses. An RNA (5'-CUGCAAUAAACAAGU-UAA-3') with 2'-O-CH3 ribose at each nucleotide except for the AAUAAA sequence and 3'-terminal adenosine was efficiently polyadenylated in vitro. Methylation of single riboses within AAUAAA inhibited both poly(A) addition and binding of the specificity factor, but the magnitude of inhibition varied greatly at different nucleotides. Nucleotides that showed sensitivity to base substitutions did not necessarily show sensitivity to ribose methylation, and vice versa. The data indicate that the specificity factor interacts with AAUAAA through RNA-protein contacts involving essential recognition of both sugars and bases at different nucleotide positions."
https://openalex.org/W1604007482,"Abstract Clathrin in coated vesicles is linked to transmembrane receptors by adaptor protein complexes. The Golgi-associated adaptor complex HA1 is a tetramer, made up of beta', gamma, 47-kDa, and 20-kDa subunits, whereas the tetrameric plasma membrane adaptor, HA2, contains alpha, beta, 50-kDa, and 16-kDa subunits (Ahle, S., Mann, A., Eichelsbacher, U., and Ungewickell, E. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 919-929). Here we report on the structural organization of adaptor subunits as revealed by proteolytic dissection. We show that the beta' and gamma subunits of HA1 are cleaved into 60-67-kDa and 32-44-kDa fragments. Interactions between adaptor subunits involve the trunk domains only. In overall organization of their domains, the Golgi and plasma membrane adaptors are very similar. The similarity encompasses also the location of phosphorylated serine residues in the alpha a, beta, beta', and gamma subunits, which are found in the head domains in all cases. In the alpha a and beta subunits they probably occur in the proline- and glycine-rich hinge region, which connects the head to the trunk. Identical adaptor fragments were obtained by controlled digestion of clathrin-coated vesicles. Under conditions that did not affect the integrity of the clathrin heavy chain, the adaptor head fragments were always quantitatively released from coated vesicles. The release of the bulk of the adaptors occurred concomitantly with the cleavage of their beta-type subunits (beta and beta') and under buffer conditions that prevent aggregation of adaptors. These observations taken together with the results of reconstitution experiments confirm and extend previous data (Ahle, S., and Ungewickell, E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20089-20093) which suggested that adaptors attach to clathrin through their beta-type (beta and beta') subunits. Moreover, high affinity interaction between adaptors and clathrin requires the participation of regions from both the head and trunk domains of the beta-type subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1498096758,"Activation of coagulation factor X via the intrinsic pathway requires the assembly of factors IXa and VIII on lipid membranes. It is known that the platelet expresses membrane sites for assembly of factors IXa/VIII and promotes efficient factor X activation. We now show that human blood monocytes, but not lymphocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes, also express appropriate sites for factors IXa/VIII assembly. The maximal rate of factor X activation by factors IXa (0.75 nM) and VIII (1 unit/ml) assembled on monocytes is similar to the maximal rate on platelets. This rate, adjusted per micromole of lipid phosphorus, is 1636 +/- 358 nM factor Xa/min on monocyte, and 1569 +/- 54 nM factor Xa/min on platelets. At physiologic concentrations of factors X and VIII, the activation rate increases with factor IXa concentration asymptotically approaching a maximum. Half-maximal rate is achieved with 1.0 +/- 0.16 nM factor IXa. Monocytes and macrophages, but not platelets, can express membrane tissue factor and thus promote simultaneous assembly of two distinct factor X-activating protease complexes. In these studies, blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages are used as membrane sources in kinetic experiments comparing factor X activation by intrinsic (factor IXa/VIII) versus extrinsic (factor VII/tissue factor) protease complexes. At plasma concentration of factors VIII and VII, apparent Km on the monocyte is 14.6 +/- 1.4 nM for intrinsic and 117.0 +/- 10.1 nM for extrinsic activation. The apparent Km on alveolar macrophages is 12.1 +/- 1.9 and 90.6 +/- 10.2 nM for intrinsic and extrinsic activation, respectively. Maximal rates on monocytes at saturating concentration of factors IXa, VIII, and VII are 48.0 +/- 11.2 nM factor Xa/min, for intrinsic activation, and 16.5 +/- 5.5 nM factor Xa/min, for extrinsic activation. These data show that the monocyte/macrophage is the only blood-derived cell type with membrane sites for both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway assembly. We have exploited this characteristic of the monocyte/macrophage membrane to demonstrate that factor X activation by the intrinsic pathway protease is more efficient than activation via the extrinsic pathway protease complex."
https://openalex.org/W1605641845,"Previous work has shown that, shortly after rabbit corneas are injured, arachidonic acid metabolism is activated, and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) is one of the main products formed (Bazan, H. E. P., Birkle, D. L., Beuerman, R., and Bazan, N. G. (1985) Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 26, 474-480; Bazan, H. E. P. (1987) Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 28, 314-319). In order to determine whether this metabolite is a lipoxygenase product, anesthetized rabbit corneas injured in vivo, either cryogenically or by 1 M NaOH, were subsequently incubated in vitro with [14C] arachidonic acid in the presence of indomethacin. 12-HETE was the main metabolite produced, as established by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of novel naphthoyl-pentafluorobenzoyl derivatives of 12-HETE were resolved by chiral-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The radiolabeled 12-HETE from whole cornea and from isolated epithelium, endothelium, or stroma eluted as a single peak co-chromatographing with the (S)-enantiomer and was detected both by UV absorbance at 234 nm and by radioactivity. In noninjured corneas a smaller peak of radiolabeled (12S)-HETE was also eluted from the chiral column. The stereochemistry was additionally confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These studies suggest that (12S)-lipoxygenase is activated in the injured rabbit cornea."

Purification procedures consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatographies on columns of phenyl-Sepharose and CM-Sepharose, gel filtration on a TSK-gel G3000SW, and Mono S fast protein liquid chromatography. By these procedures the activity was purified about 36,000-fold with a recovery of 0.6%. The final preparation showed a major protein band at Mr 28,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stimulated GTP hydrolysis by the purified rho A protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner. No stimulation was found for ras p21. The ADP-ribosylation on the rho protein by botulinum C3 exoenzyme did not affect its interaction with the purified rho-GAP."
https://openalex.org/W1509282534,"We have examined the phosphorylation of the serine threonine kinase, the product of c-raf proto-oncogene in response to insulin or platelet-derived growth factor in intact cells. Both insulin and platelet-derived growth factor stimulated phosphorylation of the c-raf protein about 2- to 3-fold. The phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine and threonine residues; phosphotyrosine was not detected. In immune-complex kinase assays, treatment with insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor increased autophosphorylation of the c-raf kinase, suggesting activation of its kinase activity. To investigate whether the phosphorylation of the c-raf protein in intact cells results from an autophosphorylation event or from the phosphorylation by other cellular kinase(s), we replaced lysine 375 in the putative ATP-binding domain of the c-raf protein with alanine using oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the mutated protein in NIH3T3 cells. The substitution resulted in the inactivation of the serine/threonine-specific autophosphorylation in immune-complex kinase assays. In intact cells, however, although phosphorylation of the mutant protein in response to insulin and platelet-derived growth factor occurred to a lesser extent than that of the wild-type protein, the phosphopeptide maps were indistinguishable. These results suggest that serine threonine phosphorylation might be responsible for the activation of c-raf kinase upon treatment of cells with insulin and platelet-derived growth factor, and most of the phosphate associated with the c-raf protein results from its phosphorylation by as yet uncharacterized cellular serine/threonine kinase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1556199795,"The domains on clathrin responsible for interaction with the plasma membrane-associated assembly protein AP-2 have been studied using a novel cage binding assay. AP-2 bound to pure clathrin cages but not to coat structures already containing AP that had been prepared by coassembly. Binding to preassembled cages also occurred in the presence of elevated Tris-HCl concentrations (greater than or equal to 200 mM) which block AP-2 interactions with free clathrin. AP-2 interactions with assembled cages could also be distinguished from AP-2 binding to clathrin trimers by sodium tripolyphosphate (NaPPPi), which binds to the alpha subunit of AP-2 (Beck, K., and Keen, J. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4442-4447). At concentrations of 1-5 mM, NaPPPi blocked clathrin-triskelion binding; in contrast, interactions with cages persisted in the presence of 25 mM NaPPPi. To begin to identify the region(s) of the clathrin molecule important in recognition by AP-2, clathrin cages were proteolyzed to remove heavy chain terminal domains and portions of the distal leg as well as all of the light chains. AP-2 bound to these cages; however, unlike the interaction with native cages, binding of AP-2 to clipped cages was sensitive to the lower concentrations of both Tris-HCl and NaPPPi which disrupt interactions of AP-2 with clathrin trimers. Reconstitution of the clipped cages with clathrin light chains did not restore resistance of AP-2 binding to Tris-HCl. We conclude that one binding site for AP-2 resides on the hub and/or proximal part of the clathrin triskelion whereas a second site is likely to involve the terminal domain and/or distal leg; the second site is manifested only in the assembled lattice structure. We suggest that these two distinct binding interactions may be mediated by the two unique large subunits within the AP-2 complex, acting sequentially during assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1601059764,"We have expressed two forms of the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP), the 695-amino acid form (695 beta APP), and the 751-amino acid form (751 beta APP) in a baculovirus system. Both forms were expressed as full-length precursor, and were subsequently processed in vivo to release extracellular secreted proteins. The secreted forms were cleaved from the full-length beta APP in a manner analogous to the cleavage of beta APP during constitutive secretion in mammalian cells (Weidemann, A., Konig, G., Bunke, D., Fischer, P., Salbaum, J. M., Masters, C. L., Beyreuther, K. (1989) Cell 57, 115-126; Oltersdorf, T., Ward, P. J., Henriksson, T., Beattie, E. C., Neve, R., Lieberburg, I., and Fritz, L. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4492-4497). High levels of expression of 20-50 mg/liter were achieved. Both full-length and secreted forms of the beta-amyloid precursor proteins were purified using a combination of ion-exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody directed against beta APP. The 751 beta APP-derived full-length and secreted forms, which contain the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain, were shown to be as active in the inhibition of trypsin as is mammalian-derived secreted beta APP. The availability of purified full-length beta APP from the baculovirus system will be valuable for biochemical and cell biological analyses that may elucidate the mechanism of the inappropriate processing that leads to beta-amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1613515614,"The enzyme ribonuclease T1 cleaves single-stranded RNA at the 3'-side of guanosine. The structure of the complex with two guanosines has been analyzed at 1.8-A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R value of 14.0%. One guanosine occupies the guanosine recognition site as observed in previously analyzed complexes of ribonuclease T1 with guanosine phosphates. The other is bound to a base-unspecific subsite marking the binding locus of the nucleoside 3'-proximal to guanosine in a cleavable RNA chain. The positions of the guanosine bound to the recognition site and of the guanine base at the subsite were used to guide model building of the substrate guanylyl-3',5'-guanosine bound to the active site of ribonuclease T1. After energy minimization and a 7-ps stochastic dynamics simulation, a plausible model of the enzyme-substrate complex was obtained which may serve as a reference point in consideration of the mechanisms of RNA hydrolysis by ribonuclease T1."
https://openalex.org/W1534304720,"The relative specificities of the carboxylase and oxygenase reactions catalyzed by the recombinant large subunit core (L8) of Synechococcus ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase have been determined. The L8 core still retained the ability to catalyze both reactions but at a much reduced turnover rate, about 0.6% of the holoenzyme. The fate of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate during carboxylation and oxygenation by L8 was compared with the Synechococcus holoenzyme (reconstituted from L8 and recombinant small subunits), the carboxylase from Rhodospirullum rubrum, and that of spinach. The absence of small subunits had no significant effect on the partitioning of the bisphosphate substrate between the two reactions. Thus the course of the two competing reactions is a characteristic of the structural elements that compose the L-subunits, whereas the S-subunits exert their effect on factors common to both reactions such as the specificity of the bisphosphate substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1557653113,"The EnvZ protein is presumably a membrane-located osmotic sensor which is involved in expression of the ompF and ompC genes in Escherichia coli. Previously, we developed an in vitro method for analyzing the intact form of the EnvZ protein located in isolated cytoplasmic membranes, and demonstrated that this particular form of the EnvZ protein exhibits the ability not only as to OmpR phosphorylation but also OmpR dephosphorylation. In this study, to gain an insight into the structural and functional importance of the putative periplasmic domain of the EnvZ protein, a set of mutant EnvZ proteins, which lack various portions of the periplasmic domain, were characterized in terms of not only their in vivo osmoregulatory phenotypes but also in vitro EnvZ-OmpR phosphotransfer reactions. It was revealed that these deletion mutant EnvZ proteins are normally incorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane. Cells harboring these mutant EnvZ proteins showed a pleiotropic phenotype, namely, OmpF- Mal- LamB- PhoA-, and produced the OmpC protein constitutively irrespective of the medium osmolarity. It was also suggested that all of these mutant EnvZ proteins were defective in their in vitro OmpR dephosphorylation ability, while their OmpR phosphorylation ability remained unaffected. These results imply the functional importance of the periplasmic domain of the EnvZ protein for modulation of the kinase/phosphatase activity exhibited by the cytoplasmic domain in response to an environmental osmotic stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1500523702,"In the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus PCC6301), ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rbu-P2 carboxylase) is composed of eight large subunits and eight small subunits. There are three regions of the small subunit that contain amino acids that are conserved throughout evolution, from bacteria to higher plants. Since the function of the small subunit is not fully understood, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on highly conserved residues in the first and second conserved regions. Ser-16, Pro-19, Leu-21, and Tyr-54 were replaced by Asp-16, His-19, Glu-21, and Ser-54, respectively. Crude extracts containing the recombinant His-19 mutant enzyme indicated that there was little effect on either Rbu-P2 carboxylase activity or interactions between large and small subunits. However, the Asp-16, Glu-21, and Ser-54 mutations showed effects on Rbu-P2 carboxylase activity and the interaction between large and small subunits. The large and small subunits of the Asp-16, Glu-21, and Ser-54 enzymes were found to dissociate during nondenaturing gel electrophoresis or sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, the dissociated small subunits remained functional and were capable of reconstituting Rbu-P2 carboxylase activity when added to large subunits. These results indicated that Ser-16, Leu-21, and Tyr-54 might play an important role in interactions between large and small subunits of the A. nidulans enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1557582181,"In cartilage proteoglycan aggregates, link protein stabilizes the binding of proteoglycan monomers to hyaluronate by binding simultaneously to hyaluronate and to the G1 globular domain of proteoglycan monomer core protein. Studies reported here involving metal chelate affinity chromatography demonstrate that link protein is a metalloprotein that binds Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+. Zn2+ and Ni2+ decrease the solubility of link protein and result in its precipitation. However, link protein is readily soluble and functional in low ionic strength solvents from which divalent cations have been removed with Chelex 100. These observations make it possible to study the biochemical properties of link protein in low ionic strength, physiologic solvents. Studies were carried out to define the oligomeric state of link protein alone in physiologic solvents, and the transformation in oligomeric state that occurs when link protein binds hyaluronate. Sedimentation equilibrium studies demonstrate that in 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7, link protein exists as a monomer-hexamer equilibrium controlled by a formation constant of 2 x 10(27) M-5, yielding a delta G' of -36 kcal/mol for the formation of the hexamer from six monomers. On binding hyaluronate oligosaccharides (HA10 or HA12), link protein dissociates to dimer. Link protein hexamer is rendered insoluble by Zn2+. Greater than 90% of the protein is precipitated by 2 mol of Zn2+/mol of link protein monomer. The binding of hyaluronate oligosaccharide by link protein strongly inhibits the precipitation of link protein by Zn2+. The link protein/hyaluronate oligosaccharide complex is completely soluble in the presence of 2 mol of Zn2+/mol of link protein. At higher molar ratios of Zn2+/link protein, the inhibitory effect of hyaluronate oligosaccharide on the precipitation of link protein is gradually overcome. Hyaluronate oligosaccharide is not dissociated from link protein by Zn2+. Hyaluronate remains bound to the link protein which is precipitated by Zn2+, or to the link protein which binds to Zn2(+)-charged iminodiacetate-Sepharose columns. Hyaluronate oligosaccharides and Zn2+ bind to different sites on link protein."
https://openalex.org/W1494825241,"Using a photoaffinity labeling approach to characterize GDP/GTP-binding proteins of the nuclear envelope, we found that several polypeptides of isolated rat liver nuclear envelopes were photolabeled with [alpha-32P]GDP. One of these labeled proteins, which had an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa (p28), was highly enriched in nuclear envelopes relative to unfractionated nuclei and was not detectable in fractions of mitochondria, cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thus p28 is specific to the nuclear envelope. Chemical extractions showed that p28 was tightly associated with a subfraction of the nuclear envelope enriched in nuclear pore complexes and lamina. Solubilization of p28 required buffers containing 1% octylglucoside and at least 300 mM KCl. Photolabeling of p28 was specific for GTP and GDP, since no other guanine or adenine nucleotide tested was able to compete efficiently with [alpha-32P]GDP for photolabeling. Added magnesium or manganese cations were not required for photolabeling of p28, and labeling was substantially inhibited with 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, and KCl concentrations greater than 150 mM. Sucrose density centrifugation showed that detergent-solubilized p28 had a S value of 2.5. The properties of p28 described in this study suggest that it may have a role in functions of the pore complex or lamina."

No transfer occurred to the N-unsubstituted pentasaccharide containing only L-iduronic acid, but the other three isomers incorporated various amounts of 35S, which was totally present in N-sulfate groups. After complete chemical N-sulfation, all four pentasaccharides served as acceptors in O-sulfotransferase reactions and incorporated from 20 to greater than 200 times as much radioactivity as did the nonsulfated parent compounds. The C-6 position of the internal glucosamine unit was labeled preferentially, irrespective of the structures of the adjacent hexuronic acid units. Significant 2-O-35S-sulfation of IdoA units occurred in both -IdoA-Glc-NSO3-GlcA- and -GlcA-GlcNSO3-IdoA- sequences, whereas no significant sulfation of GlcA residues was detected. The pentasaccharide GlcNSO3-GlcA-Glc-NSO3-GlcA-GlcNSO3 thus can be used as a selective substrate in assays for glucosaminyl-6-O-sulfotransferase activity. The antithrombin-binding region, essential for the blood anticoagulant activity of heparin, has been identified as a pentasaccharide sequence with the predominant structure GlcNR(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)-++ +IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) (where R represents either a sulfate or an acetyl group and -OSO3 represents an O-sulfate/ester sulfate group, with locations of O-sulfate groups indicated in parentheses) (Lindahl U., Thunberg, L., Backstrom, G., Riesenfeld, J., Nordling, K., and Bjork, I. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12368-12376). The products of [35S]sulfate transfer to the pentasaccharide GlcNSO3-GlcA-GlcNSO3-IdoA-GlcNSO3 contained molecules with high affinity for antithrombin, corresponding to 0.3-0.5% of the total label. Structural analysis suggested the occurrence of O-[35S]sulfate groups at both C-6 of the nonreducing terminal glucosamine unit and C-3 of the internal glucosamine unit. No products with high affinity for antithrombin were formed from the pentasaccharides that had a different monosaccharide sequence than the binding region; and moreover, these oligosaccharides appeared unable to incorporate glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfate groups. These findings point to the importance of the uronic acid sequence in the generation of the antithrombin-binding region of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1599991866,"Synthetic oligopeptide inhibitors of metalloendoprotease activity have been shown to block membrane fusion events, to slow transport of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, and to perturb Ca2+ homeostasis. Effects of such agents on translational activity, which requires Ca2+ sequestered putatively within the ER, were examined in this study. Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 (where Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl) provoked rapid inhibition of amino acid incorporation into a broad spectrum of proteins in GH3 pituitary, C6 glial, and Neuro-2a cells but not in reticulocytes, which lack ER. Polysome accumulation and incorporation were reduced concurrently, indicating that the dipeptide acted to slow translational initiation. Inhibitions were largest at low extracellular Ca2+, were reversed by increasing extracellular Ca2+, were comparable to those achieved in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ ionophores, and were observed with assorted metalloendoprotease antagonists but not with leupeptin. At concentrations inhibitory to protein synthesis Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 mobilized cell-associated 45Ca, lowered cytosolic free Ca2+, and did not generate inositol phosphates. Cells treated for 3-4 h with Cbz-Gly-Phe-NH2 reacquired the ability to synthesize proteins at nearly normal rates; a phorbol ester or cAMP-elevating agent was necessary for such recovery in GH3, but not C6 or Neuro-2a, cells. GRP78, which may function in the folding and assembly of secretory proteins and in translational accommodation to agents that deplete sequestered Ca2+ stores, was induced during such treatments. Accumulation of GRP78 mRNA in treated preparations was reduced as extracellular Ca2+ was increased. Extended exposure to dipeptide followed by brief recovery in its absence rendered protein synthesis resistant to inhibition by Ca2+ ionophore. It is concluded that metalloendoprotease antagonists suppress translational initiation as a consequence of their capacity to mobilize sequestered Ca2+ stores."

The RNA was generated by a homologous transcription system or by a T7 RNA polymerase reaction using a constructed 5 S RNA gene linked to a T7 promoter. In vitro D. melanogaster 5 S RNA processing is heat- and EDTA-sensitive, suggesting a requirement for protein, and produces a 3' end characteristic of mature 5 S RNA. Processing of substrate RNAs with altered 3' ends shows that the 3'-U5 tail (nt 131-135) inhibits the reaction. 30 nt, including all of domain IV and most of domain V, are dispensible for processing, whereas deletions including the base of stem V and all or part of stem III severely inhibit it.

https://openalex.org/W1496626134,"Treatment of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the pheromone alpha-factor caused an inhibition of glycogen synthesis in MATa haploid cells but not in MAT alpha cells or MATa/MAT alpha diploid cells. The concentration of alpha-factor required for a half-maximal inhibition was comparable to that required for the induction of the FUS1 gene. Strains containing a disruption in ste2 or ste12 or temperature-sensitive mutations in ste4, ste7, or ste11 continued to divide and to accumulate glycogen in the presence of alpha-factor. In contrast, inhibition of glycogen occurred upon exposure to mating pheromone of far1 mutants which, under this condition, fail to arrest in G1 and continue to divide while simultaneously undergoing the transcriptional induction and morphological changes typical of mating cells. The inhibition of glycogen accumulation by alpha-factor persisted in a strain lacking glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1), which ruled out the participation of this enzyme in the pheromone response. Glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.11) from a cells treated with alpha-factor was found primarily in the glucose 6-phosphate-dependent (inactive) form whereas the total activity was unaltered. This indicates that the action of mating pheromone is mainly to inhibit the interconversion of the inactive glucose 6-phosphate-dependent form to the active glucose 6-phosphate-independent form of glycogen synthase without affecting the concentration of the enzyme."

In this work we investigate certain aspects of RNA/protein interaction within the large ribosomal subunits of the extremely thermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus. The ribosomal proteins involved in the early reactions leading to in vitro particle assembly have been identified; it is shown that they can interact with the RNA in a temperature-independent fashion, forming a thermally stable particle that can subsequently be converted into complete 50 S ribosomes. Among the protein components of the core particle, those capable of independently binding to 23 and 5 S RNA species have also been identified. Finally, we show that the early assembly proteins of Sulfolobus large ribosomal subunits are able to interact cooperatively with 23 S RNAs from other archaebacteria or from eubacteria, thereby suggesting that RNA/protein recognition sites are largely conserved within prokaryotic ribosomes. By contrast, no specific binding of the archaebacterial proteins to eukaryotic RNA could be demonstrated."
