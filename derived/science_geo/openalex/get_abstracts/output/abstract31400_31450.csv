https://openalex.org/W2039531779,Biochemical and biophysical studies on Aplysia sensory neurons indicate that inhibitory responses to the molluscan peptide FMRFamide are mediated by lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid. These compounds are a new class of second messengers in neurons.
https://openalex.org/W2002568336,"A 12 amino-acid synthetic peptide (NANP)3 comprising the immunodominant epitope of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT), adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide, and administered intramuscularly in three doses at monthly intervals to 35 healthy males as a malaria vaccine. No significant adverse reactions were noted, with mild soreness at the injection site the only common symptom. Seroconversions against NANP occurred in 53% and 71% of recipients of 100 or 160 micrograms, respectively, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Most ELISA-positive sera reacted with sporozoites by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Three vaccinees with the highest ELISA and IFA titres and four unimmunized controls were challenged with P. falciparum sporozoites introduced via the bites of infective Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood stage parasites were detected in all controls by 10 days (mean 8.5 days, range 7-10). In contrast, the two vaccinees who became infected did not manifest parasitaemia until day 11 and the third vacinee showed neither parasites nor symptoms during the 29 day observation period. This first synthetic peptide parenteral vaccine against a communicable disease tested in man is safe and stimulates biologically active antibodies. These observations encourage the development of improved vaccine formulations which, by enhancing immunogenicity, may lead to practical vaccines to assist in the control of falciparum malaria."

The chemical mechanisms of RNA-catalyzed reactions are discussed with emphasis on the self-splicing ribosomal RNA precursor of Tetrahymena and the enzymatic activities of its intervening sequence RNA. Wherever appropriate, catalysis by RNA is compared to catalysis by protein enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1967297467,"The Drosophila Shaker (Sh) gene appears to encode a type of voltage-sensitive potassium (K+) channel called the A channel. We have isolated Sh as part of a 350 kb chromosomal walk. The region around Sh contains four identified transcription units. We find that Sh corresponds to a very large transcription unit encompassing a total of about 95 kb of genomic DNA and split by a major 85 kb intron. Sh has multiple hydrophobic domains that have a high probability of being membrane-spanning, consistent with the proposal that it encodes an ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1602417853,"A synthetic procedure has been developed by which stable abasic sites are introduced into oligodeoxynucleotides at any desired position in the sequence. A modified tetrahydrofuran moiety, isosteric with 2'-deoxyribofuranose, serves as a structural analog of the natural apurinic/apyrimidinic site. We have also prepared oligodeoxynucleotides that lack cyclic structure at the abasic site but retain the carbon atoms of the phosphodiester backbone. These synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides are cleaved on the 5' side of the abasic site by endonuclease IV and by exonuclease III; they serve also as templates for avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), and calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha. Extension of primed templates by these DNA polymerases is blocked initially at the position immediately 3' to the abasic site; nucleoside monophosphates are subsequently incorporated opposite the lesion. The nucleotide most frequently incorporated opposite all abasic sites, regardless of structure, is dAMP. Significant readthrough at the abasic site was observed in experiments using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase-alpha and, to a much lesser degree, with DNA polymerase I. We conclude that a modified tetrahydrofuran group can serve as a stable structural analog of 2'-deoxyribose in the apurinic/apyrimidinic site. These modified oligodeoxynucleotides should prove useful for studies of chemical mutagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1512706043,"Changes in free cytosolic calcium were measured in UMR-106 cells in response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulation. Bovine PTH-(1-34) induced an increase in [Ca2+]i with the contour of the rise in [Ca2+]i occurring in three successive phases: a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i occurring within seconds, rapid decrement in [Ca2+]i to near-resting levels within 1 min, and slow increment in [Ca2+]i. Phase one and phase three increases in [Ca2+]i were dependent on medium calcium. The phase one rise in [Ca2+]i was inhibitable by the calcium channel blockers lanthanum and verapamil. Only the phase one rise in [Ca2+]i was blocked by preincubation of the cells with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This channel was also blocked when cellular cAMP levels were increased prior to PTH stimulation. The phase two decrement of [Ca2+]i was due to the rapid inactivation of the phase one calcium channel. The phase three rise in [Ca2+]i was mediated by cellular cAMP levels. This cAMP-dependent Ca2+ channel was insensitive to pretreatment of the cells with phorbol diesters and showed low sensitivity to Ca2+ channel blockers. It is concluded that UMR-106 cells respond to PTH stimulation by the activation of a cAMP-independent Ca2+ channel. This channel rapidly inactivates. The subsequent PTH-dependent increase in cellular cAMP is followed by activation of a cAMP-dependent Ca2+ channel resulting in a slow rise in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1581858990,"The chain origins of subunits M1, M2*, and M3 previously described (Butkowski, R. L., Wieslander, J., Wisdom, B.J., Barr, J.F., Noelken, M.E., and Hudson, B.G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3739-3747) of the globular domain of basement membrane collagen were identified, by amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, with respect to their relationship to the chains of collagen IV. M1 comprises two polypeptides which correspond to the noncollagenous segments (NC1) of the alpha 1 ad alpha 2 chains of collagen IV. M2*, containing the Goodpasture epitope, and M3 are distinct from these two constituents and from each other but have Gly-X-Y triplets and hydroxyproline at their amino terminus, reflecting the fact that each has a collagen chain origin. These results indicate the presence of two new collagen chains in basement membrane. These new chains appear to be integral components of collagen IV molecules. Alternatively, they could represent new molecular species of basement membrane collagen containing a globular domain, comprising M2* and M3, with physicochemical properties very similar to those of collagen IV."
https://openalex.org/W1496710035,"A subline of the rat hepatoma (H-35) cells has been identified which responds to hepatocyte-stimulating factors (HSFs) of human squamous carcinoma cells by increased synthesis of all major rat acute phase plasma proteins. The regulation occurs at the level of mRNA. Two HSFs (HSF-I and HSF-II) have been purified from conditioned medium of the squamous carcinoma cells. HSF-I is a protein with an Mr = 18,000 and pI 5.5, and HSF-II is a glycoprotein with an Mr = 34,000 and a broad, neutral to basic charge. In H-35 cells, HSF-I predominantly stimulates the synthesis of complement C3 and haptoglobin and acts synergistically with dexamethasone to stimulate alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. HSF-II stimulates cysteine protease inhibitor, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen, and hemopexin, and acts synergistically with dexamethasone to stimulate alpha 2-macroglobulin. Each HSF is between 10 and 100 times less effective in regulating proteins of the other set. Human tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 increase complement C3, haptoglobin, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, as does HSF-I, but are unable to modulate any of the other acute phase proteins. The monokines differ from HSF-I is their low activity in HepG2 cells and rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1538727673,"The 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor purified from rabbit skeletal muscle triads was shown to contain four protein components of 175,000, 170,000, 52,000, and 32,000 Da when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Monoclonal antibodies capable of specifically immunoprecipitating the [3H]PN200-110-labeled dihydropyridine receptor from digitonin-solubilized triads recognized the 170,000-Da protein on nitrocellulose transfers of skeletal muscle triads, transverse tubular membranes, and purified dihydropyridine receptor. Wheat germ agglutinin peroxidase stained the 175,000-Da protein on similar nitrocellulose transfers, demonstrating that the 175,000-Da protein is the glycoprotein subunit of the purified dihydropyridine receptor. The apparent molecular weight of the Mr 170,000 protein remained unchanged with reduction, whereas the apparent molecular weight of the glycoprotein subunit shifted from 175,000 to 150,000 upon reduction. These results demonstrate that the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel from rabbit skeletal muscle contains two distinct high molecular weight subunits of 175,000 and 170,000."
https://openalex.org/W1516954810,"The adherence of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells to adhesive matrix proteins was examined to determine if cell attachment and spreading were mediated by the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex on endothelial cells. The HUVE cells adhered well to glass slides that had been coated with fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor but failed to adhere to albumin-coated or to uncoated slides. The HUVE cell attachment and spreading on vitronectin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor were greatly inhibited by a GP IIb-IIIa monoclonal antibody (7E3). In contrast, HUVE cell attachment to fibronectin was not inhibited by 7E3 but was inhibited by a fibronectin-receptor antibody (alpha GP140), which had no effect on cell attachment to the other adhesive proteins. The 7E3 antibody, but not alpha GP140, disrupted HUVE cell monolayers by detaching cells from their naturally occurring extracellular matrix. These data indicate that platelet GP IIb-IIIa-like proteins mediate the adherence of HUVE cells to specific adhesive proteins and to the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1994954403,"The v-abl oncogene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) is known to efficiently transform NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in vitro and to cause an acute lymphosarcoma in susceptible murine hosts. The role of its relative, the bcr/abl gene product, in the etiology of human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) remains speculative. To assess the transforming properties of the bcr/abl gene product, complementary DNA clones encoding the CML-specific P210 bcr/abl protein were expressed in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast to the v-abl oncogene product P160, the P210 bcr/abl gene product did not transform NIH/3T3 cells. Cell lines were isolated that expressed high levels of the P210 bcr/abl protein but were morphologically normal. During the course of these experiments, a transforming recombinant of bcr/abl was isolated which fuses gag determinants derived from helper virus to the NH2-terminus of the bcr/abl protein. This suggests that a property of viral gag sequences, probably myristylation-dependent membrane localization, must be provided to bcr/abl for it to transform fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2040328047,"The physiological role of the platelet-secreted protein thrombospondin (TSP) is poorly understood, although it has been postulated to be involved in platelet aggregation and cellular adhesion. In this report, TSP isolated from human platelets was found to promote, in vitro, the cell-substratum adhesion of a variety of cells, including platelets, melanoma cells, muscle cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. The adhesion-promoting activity of TSP was species independent, specific, and not due to contamination by fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, or platelet factor 4. The cell surface receptor for TSP is protein in nature and appears distinct from that for fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1577657954,"Using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, we have characterized the tyrosine phosphorylation of an endogenous substrate of the insulin receptor in Fao hepatoma cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing the human insulin receptor cDNA. In Fao cells, besides the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor, a protein with a molecular mass between 170 and 210 kDa designated pp185, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation immediately after insulin stimulation reaching a maximum level within 30 s. After 4 h of continuous insulin stimulation, the labeling of pp185 decreased to less than half of its original intensity, whereas the insulin receptor was unchanged. After 24 h of insulin stimulation, the phosphotyrosine-containing insulin receptor decreased by 75% owing to down-regulation, whereas the pp185 was completely undetectable. By several biochemical and physiological criteria, the pp185 is distinct from the insulin receptor. The pp185 and the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor were strongly labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, but in contrast to the insulin receptor, the pp185 was not labeled by cross-linking with 125I-insulin or surface 125I iodination. Unlike the insulin receptor, the pp185 was extracted from Fao cells without detergent, and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of the pp185 and the insulin receptor yielded distinct patterns. Thus, the pp185 is not located at the external face of the plasma membrane and does not bind insulin. Treatment of Fao cells with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, stimulated the phosphorylation of two proteins with molecular weights of 170 and 210 kDa which were immunoprecipitated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Subsequent insulin stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the 210 kDa protein, but the pp185 was not detected. Increasing the concentration of the human insulin receptor in the Chinese hamster ovary cells by transfection with a plasmid containing the human insulin receptor cDNA caused a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit and the pp185. These data support the notion that the insulin signal may be transmitted to a cellular substrate (pp185) which may initiate insulin action at intracellular sites."
https://openalex.org/W1489559813,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the radioiodinated native amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel protein isolated from bovine renal papilla and cultured amphibian A6 cells under denatured and nonreduced conditions revealed an 125I-labeled protein band of Mr approximately 730,000. Upon reduction, this protein was resolved into five major polypeptide bands with apparent average Mr values of 315,000, 149,000, 95,000, 71,000, and 55,000. The amiloride analog [3H]methylbromoamiloride has been used as a photoaffinity label to determine the location of the binding site for amiloride on the epithelial sodium channel protein. [3H]Methylbromoamiloride binds covalently to the sodium channel at high affinity binding sites with a half-maximal binding concentration of 0.2 microM. [3H]Methylbromoamiloride was specifically photoincorporated into the Mr approximately 150,000 polypeptide and this incorporation was blocked by addition of excess amiloride. These data suggest that the epithelial sodium channel protein is composed of at least five nonidentical polypeptide subunits, only one of which specifically binds amiloride."
https://openalex.org/W2094497593,"New blood vessel growth occurs during normal fetal development and in diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The polypeptide angiogenin induces new blood vessel growth in two biological assays and may play a role in the vascular development of the fetus and in the neovascularization that accompanies diseases and wound healing. A complementary DNA probe for human angiogenin was used to examine the tissue distribution of angiogenin messenger RNA (mRNA) in the developing rat and in selected transformed cell lines. Angiogenin mRNA was detected predominantly in adult liver but was also detectable at low levels in other tissues. The expression of the angiogenin gene in rat liver was found to be developmentally regulated; mRNA levels were low in the developing fetus, increased in the neonate, and maximal in the adult. The amount of angiogenin mRNA in human HT-29 colon carcinoma and SK-HEP hepatoma cells was not greater than that in normal rat liver. These results demonstrate that angiogenin is predominantly expressed in adult liver, that the pattern of angiogenin gene expression is not temporally related to vascular development in the rat, and that the transformed cells studied do not contain more angiogenin mRNA than does normal liver. If angiogenin activity is controlled at the transcriptional level, the results of this study suggest that the primary function of angiogenin in vivo may be in processes other than the regulation of vascular growth."
https://openalex.org/W1543868967,"Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity was measured in vivo after microinjection of [3H]cAMP into intact Xenopus oocytes. This activity was inhibited by extracellular application of methylxanthines, and the dose-dependent inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity correlated with the abilities of isobutylmethylxanthine and theophylline to inhibit oocyte maturation induced by progesterone, with IC50 values of approximately 0.3 and 1.5 mM, respectively. Insulin stimulated in vivo phosphodiesterase activity measured after microinjection of 200 microM [3H]cAMP in a time- and dose-dependent fashion without affecting phosphodiesterase activity measured after microinjection of 2 microM [3H]cAMP. Although progesterone alone had no effect on in vivo phosphodiesterase activity, low concentrations of progesterone (0.01 microM) accelerated the time course of insulin stimulation of both phosphodiesterase activity and oocyte maturation. The EC50 for stimulation of in vivo phosphodiesterase activity by insulin correlated with the IC50 for inhibition of oocyte membrane adenylate cyclase activity measured in vitro (2 and 4 nM, respectively). Twenty-fold higher concentrations of insulin were required to stimulate oocyte maturation. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulated in vivo phosphodiesterase, inhibited in vitro adenylate cyclase, and induced oocyte maturation at concentrations of 0.3-1.0 nM. These results demonstrate a dual regulation of oocyte phosphodiesterase and adenylate cyclase by insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1."
https://openalex.org/W1572515270,"The existence and mechanisms of inactivation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are important, but still debatable, physiological problems. By using the Ca2+ indicators quin2 and fura-2, we demonstrate that in PC12 cells voltage-gated Ca2+ channels undergo inactivation dependent on both voltage and [Ca2+]i. Inactivation, however, is never complete and a small number of channels remains open during prolonged depolarization, explaining the steady state elevation of [Ca2+]i observed in cells depolarized with high KCl. A close parallel exists between Ca2+ channel inactivation and the transient nature of neurotransmitter release: secretion is rapidly stimulated during the first 30 s of depolarization, when a transient overshoot in [Ca2+]i can be demonstrated, while it is negligible during the following period, despite the persistence of an elevated [Ca2+]i; predepolarization in Ca2+-free medium and subsequent addition of Ca2+ (a condition which allows the development of the voltage inactivation) abolishes the fast phase of secretion, while not modifying the steady state [Ca2+]i eventually attained; and increases in the intracellular Ca2+ buffering decreases the amplitude of the fast secretion phase induced by KCl without altering the steady state [Ca2+]i. We suggest that localized [Ca2+]i gradients form close to the plasma membrane shortly after depolarization and that the [Ca2+]i reached in these regions is the relevant parameter in the regulation of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1636707023,"Previous studies using calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography have suggested that bovine brain may contain a mixture of calmodulin-sensitive and -insensitive adenylate cyclase activities (Wescott, K. R., La Porte, D. C., and Storm, D. R. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 3086-3090). In this study, mice were immunized with a purified preparation of the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase from bovine brain, and a polyclonal antiserum was obtained which was specific to the calmodulin-sensitive form of the enzyme. The antiserum was not inhibitory and precipitated enzyme activity from a homogeneous preparation of the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase catalytic subunit. Furthermore, the antiserum did not interact with calmodulin-insensitive adenylate cyclase which was resolved from the calmodulin-sensitive form of the enzyme by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Since the only polypeptide specifically precipitated by the antiserum had an Mr of 135,000, which was identical to the Mr of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, it is concluded that the antiserum interacted directly and specifically with the catalytic subunit of the calmodulin-sensitive isozyme of adenylate cyclase. Detergent-solubilized membranes from several rat tissues were examined for the presence of calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase using anti-calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase antiserum. Approximately 40-60% of the total adenylate cyclase activity of rat brain and kidney were immunoprecipitated by the antiserum, whereas liver and testes contained no detectable calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase. Approximately 15% of the total adenylate cyclase activity in rat heart and lung was the calmodulin-sensitive form. These data indicate that the calmodulin-sensitive and insensitive adenylate cyclases from bovine brain are immunologically distinct and support the proposal that there may be two or more distinct adenylate cyclase isozymes in brain."
https://openalex.org/W2038281476,"To understand the control of differential variant cell surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene expression in T. brucei, we studied VSG gene and expression site transcription regulation. We show that the interchromosomal duplicative transposition of VSG gene 118, on an unusually large transposed segment, results in the transcriptional activation of a cotransposed RNA polymerase I-like (pol I) promoter, from which the VSG gene is transcribed. Transcription of VSG genes by pol I can therefore be regulated by DNA rearrangements that affect positional control of gene expression. A 5′ cap is added in trans to the pol I-derived pre-mRNA, by addition of a pol II-derived 35 nucleotide mini-exon. A second gene (ESAG1) is located 25 kb upstream of the VSG 118 gene and is also transcribed. This expression site therefore contains at least two independently regulated genes. We discuss the putative importance of a nucleolar location for VSG gene and expression site transcription regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1570674543,"Abstract We have investigated the effects of various interferons on the receptors for recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) and also their effects on rTNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity on human cervical carcinoma cell line ME-180. Preincubation of cells with interferon (IFN)-gamma causes a concentration- and time-dependent increase in rTNF-alpha receptor number without any change in the affinity constant of the receptors. The increase in receptor number is caused only by IFN-gamma and not by IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Approximately 4-6 h of preincubation with IFN-gamma are required for maximum increase in rTNF-alpha binding to the cells, and this increase can be abolished by inhibitors of protein synthesis, suggesting de novo synthesis of rTNF-alpha receptors. The half-life of both uninduced and induced receptors of rTNF-alpha is approximately 2 h, indicating a rapid turnover. The binding of rTNF-alpha to the cells can also be eliminated by pretreatment of cells with trypsin. Following the removal of trypsin, binding of rTNF-alpha gradually increases, and this requires the synthesis of new proteins. The cytotoxic effect of rTNF-alpha on ME-180 cells is potentiated severalfold by the addition of either IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma. However, at similar concentrations, relatively higher potentiation of rTNF-alpha cytotoxicity is observed with IFN-gamma as compared to IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. The pre-exposure of cells to IFNs is as effective as co-exposure in enhancing cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha. The induction of TNF-alpha receptors by IFNs is observed in different cell types regardless of their sensitivity to TNF-alpha, suggesting that increase in receptor number alone is not sufficient for the enhanced cytotoxic response. Because the enhancement of cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha is observed by all IFNs but receptor induction in ME-180 cells occurs only with INF-gamma and because metabolic inhibitors which down-regulate TNF-alpha receptors also enhance cytotoxic response, we suggest that the induction of TNF-alpha receptor by IFNs is not a major mechanism of synergism between these cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1533109492,"Ovalbumin mRNA precursors were found to be almost quantitatively associated with the hen oviduct nuclear matrix. On the other hand, only one-third of the mature ovalbumin mRNA of whole nuclei was recovered in the nuclear matrix fraction. The binding of both the high molecular weight mRNA precursors and the mature-sized mRNA to the matrix displayed no difference in stability against salt, urea, or detergents. The mature mRNA, however, was found to be released selectively from the matrix by ATP. In contrast, the mRNA precursors remained completely bound to the nuclear substructure in the presence of ATP. Detachment of mRNA from the matrix also occurred in the presence of ADP, AMP plus pyrophosphate, or ATP analogs that contain nonhydrolyzable alpha, beta and beta, gamma bonds. Contrasting with the ATP-induced effect, addition of poly(A), ethidium bromide, or the copper chelator 1,10-phenanthroline to oviduct cell matrices caused an unspecific liberation of both mature and immature ovalbumin messengers. The release of the mature mRNA by ATP was found to be strongly inhibited by both nonintercalative and intercalative inhibitors of type II topoisomerase. These results suggest that the selection of the mature mRNAs for nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs at the release stage from the matrix (i.e. before translocation through the nuclear pore) and that reactions hitherto known to cause changes in the DNA secondary structure are associated with the detachment of mRNA from the nuclear substructure."
https://openalex.org/W1601157756,"Isolated triads from rabbit skeletal muscle were shown to contain an intrinsic protein kinase which was neither Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent nor cAMP-dependent. The protein substrates phosphorylated by this protein kinase exhibited apparent molecular weights of 300,000, 170,000, 90,000, 80,000, 65,000, 56,000, 52,000, 51,000, 40,000, 25,000, 22,000, and 15,000. Purification of the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor from phosphorylated triads has demonstrated that the 170,000- and 52,000-Da subunits of the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor are phosphorylated by this intrinsic protein kinase in isolated triads. Monoclonal antibodies to the 170,000-Da subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor immunoprecipitated the 170,000-Da phosphoprotein from detergent extracts of phosphorylated triads. The mobility of the 170,000-Da phosphoprotein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels was not changed with or without reduction, demonstrating that the 170,000-Da phosphoprotein is not the glycoprotein subunit of the receptor. Our results demonstrate that the 170,000- and 52,000-Da subunits of the dihydropyridine receptor are phosphorylated by an intrinsic protein kinase in isolated triads. In addition, our results also demonstrate that the 175,000-Da glycoprotein subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor is not phosphorylated in isolated triads by the intrinsic protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1601233652,"Translation of Sendai virus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and phosphoprotein (P/C) mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (15-20-mers) showed that oligonucleotides having complementarity within the 5′ noncoding region of the mRNAs blocked translation, oligonucleotides having complementarity within 20 nucleotides upstream from the initiator codon blocked translation only partially, and oligonucleotides complementary to the coding region of mRNA had no effect on translation. The results suggest the possibility that the 80 S initiation complex may form about 20 bases upstream from the initiator codon. Alternatively, the 40 S preinitiation complex may recognize an initiator codon at least 20 nucleotides upstream from the codon, activating a helix-destabilizing process."
https://openalex.org/W1518545287,"The proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) inhibited antigen-stimulated secretion and calcium influx in rat basophilic leukemia cells. In a glucose-free solution the inhibitory effects of CCCP were due to a decrease in the intracellular ATP concentration; however, when glucose was present there was no decrease in ATP. Instead, we found that in a glucose-containing saline solution, CCCP inhibited antigen-stimulated calcium uptake because it depolarized the plasma membrane, which in rat basophilic leukemia cells inhibits antigen-stimulated calcium uptake. In the presence of glucose, relatively low concentrations of CCCP inhibited calcium uptake while higher concentrations were required to inhibit secretion. In contrast, the initial antigen-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic calcium, measured with the fluorescent calcium indicator quin2, was not inhibited by CCCP. This suggests that the release of calcium from intracellular stores might, in some cases, be sufficient to support antigen-stimulated secretion. In the presence of CCCP the pH gradient becomes important for regulating the membrane potential across the plasma membrane. When cells were depolarized with CCCP and the external pH was increased, the membrane potential returned to resting levels and antigen-stimulated calcium uptake was restored. Inhibition of antigen-stimulated secretion by higher concentrations of CCCP could also be reversed by increasing the external pH."
https://openalex.org/W1499863053,"Recently omega-conotoxin GVIA was shown to specifically block neuronal and other calcium channels. In this work, an azidonitrobenzoyl derivative of mono-[125I]iodo-omega-conotoxin GVIA was used to identify the components of its receptor site in synaptic plasma membrane by photoaffinity labeling. Components of Mr approximately equal to 310,000, approximately equal to 230,000, and 34,000 were specifically photolabeled. The characteristics of photolabeling of these three components were consistent with those of the specific binding of omega-conotoxin GVIA to synaptic plasma membrane with respect to the effects of metal ions, conventional calcium antagonists, and an agonist (1,4-dihydropyridines, verapamil, and diltiazem, etc.), omega-conotoxins GVIIA and GVIIB. Furthermore, the distribution of these three components in subcellular fractions from rat brain as estimated by photolabeling was in good agreement with that of the specific binding of omega-conotoxin GVIA to its receptor. These findings indicate that the components of Mr approximately equal to 310,000, approximately equal to 240,000, and 34,000 are the receptor for omega-conotoxin GVIA and suggest that these components are constituents of the voltage-sensitive calcium channel in brain. No specific photolabeling was observed in the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes, probably indicating the absence of the receptor for omega-conotoxin GVIA in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1915159129,"The uptake, internalization, and intracellular degradation of 125I-labeled recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) by isolated rat hepatocytes was investigated. Incubation at 37 degrees C resulted in internalization of 125I-rt-PA, followed by the appearance of labeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble material in the incubation media due to degradation of rt-PA. Degradation of rt-PA was inhibited by the presence of NH4Cl (10 mM) or chloroquine (1 mM) (lysosomal tropic agents) in the incubation media. This suggests that rt-PA degradation occurs intracellularly, perhaps within the lysosomes. 125I-rt-PA was taken up by rat hepatocytes through a specific, high affinity mechanism with half-maximal uptake at 10 nM. Uptake of 125I-rt-PA was not inhibited by glycopeptides isolated from rt-PA nor by several other glycoproteins known to be cleared by identified hepatic receptors. These results suggest that the uptake of rt-PA by rat hepatocytes involves a receptor specific for t-PA and is not mediated by a carbohydrate-specific receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1572790682,"The studies presented herein were designed to investigate the effects of mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF) on steroid biosynthesis in a clonal strain of cultured murine Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10). We show that in short-term incubations (up to 8 h), mEGF activates steroid biosynthesis without affecting cAMP levels. The maximal activation of steroid biosynthesis by mEGF (about 10-fold) is, however, much lower than the maximal activation detected with human choriogonadotropin (hCG) or cAMP analogues (about 1000-fold). We also show that mEGF has two (opposing) effects on the activation of steroidogenesis by hCG. Initially, it transiently attenuates the increase in intracellular cAMP and steroid biosynthesis provoked by submaximal concentrations of hCG. At later times, however, it potentiates the stimulatory effects of submaximal concentrations of hCG on steroid biosynthesis in a synergistic fashion. Last, we show that mEGF and submaximal concentrations of cAMP analogues also activate steroidogenesis in a synergistic fashion and that the degree of synergism attained with cAMP analogues plus mEGF is much higher than that attained with hCG plus mEGF. Taken together, our results show that mEGF (i) activates steroidogenesis without affecting cAMP levels and (ii) modulates the activation of steroidogenesis by the cAMP second messenger system."
https://openalex.org/W2028546206,"The regulation of the increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) occurring in cytolytic. T lymphocytes (CTLs) upon their interaction with antigen was examined. This [Ca2+]i increase and lytic function were insensitive to verapamil, a Ca channel blocker. An antigen-independent increase in [Ca2+]i was not induced by depolarization of CTLs with excess extracellular K+, suggesting that Ca2+ influx is not mediated by the ubiquitous voltage-gated Ca channel. The antigen-induced [Ca2+]i increase was inhibited by prior membrane hyperpolarization with valinomycin. Hyperpolarization occurred under normal circumstances in CTLs exposed to antigen-receptor-specific antibodies. This potential change was Ca2+-dependent and inhibited by K channel blockade. Conversely, K channel blockade augmented the antigen-specific [Ca2+]i increase while markedly decreasing the K+ efflux associated with CTL lytic function. Therefore, either membrane potential or intracellular K+ regulates the antigen-specific [Ca2+]i increase in CTLs."
https://openalex.org/W1577674296,"Two major acute phase alpha 1-protein (alpha 1-MAP, also called thiostatin) genes, one kininogen gene and one structurally related pseudogene, were isolated from a Buffalo rat genomic library and characterized. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence in the 5' proximal flanking region (1 kilobase) of a strongly inducible alpha 1-MAP gene with that in the non-inducible rat kininogen gene showed an overall homology of 90%, with a small number of randomly distributed base changes. In the intron downstream of the exon coding for Ile-Ser-bradykinin, the two alpha 1-MAP genes contained sequence sections similar to the section in the human kininogen gene which codes for the carboxyl-terminal chain of high molecular weight kininogen. Various features of the DNA related to gene expression such as initiation and termination sites of transcription, receptor binding sites, a Z-DNA section, and exon/intron splicing sites were identified. mRNAs expressed by alpha 1-MAP and kininogen genes in liver were studied by RNA blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes. The kininogen gene expressed two mRNA species, one coding for high molecular weight kininogen, the other coding for low molecular weight kininogen. The levels of the two kininogen mRNAs in liver did not increase during acute inflammation. Only one type of mRNA, similar in size to low molecular weight kininogen RNA, was expressed by each of the two alpha 1-MAP genes. The levels of both alpha 1-MAP mRNAs increased strongly during acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1524836399,"Follicular 19 S thyroglobulin (molecular weight 660,000) from rat, human, and bovine thyroid tissues contains approximately 10-12 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. These phosphate residues can be radiolabeled when rat thyroid hemilobes, FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, or bovine thyroid slices are incubated in vitro with [32P]phosphate. Thus labeled, the [32P]phosphate residues comigrate with unlabeled 19 S follicular thyroglobulin on sucrose gradients and gel filtration columns; are specifically immunoprecipitated by an antibody preparation to rat or bovine thyroglobulin as appropriate; and co-migrate with authentic 19 S thyroglobulin when subjected to analytic or preparative gel electrophoresis. Tunicamycin prevents approximately 50% of the phosphate from being incorporated into FRTL-5 cell thyroglobulin. Approximately one-half of the phosphate in FRTL-5 cell or bovine thyroglobulin can also be released by enzymatic deglycosylation and can be located in Pronase-digested peptides which contain mannose, are endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H but not neuraminidase-sensitive, and release a dually labeled oligosaccharide containing mannose and phosphate after endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion. The remainder of the phosphate is in alkali-sensitive phosphoserine residues (3-4/mol of protein) and phosphotyrosine residues (approximately 2/mol of protein). This is evidenced by electrophoresis of acid hydrolysates of 32P-labeled thyroglobulin and by reactivity with antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine residues. The phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine residues do not appear to be randomly located through the thyroglobulin molecule since approximately 75-85% of the phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues were recovered in a approximately 15-kDa tryptic peptide or a approximately 24-kDa cyanogen bromide peptide, each almost devoid of carbohydrate. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies of bovine thyroglobulin confirm the presence and heterogeneity of the phosphate residues on thyroglobulin preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1677643592,"DNA sequencing of a 1.7-kilobase cloned cDNA allowed determination of the complete COOH-terminal noncollagenous region (NC1) of the human alpha 2(IV) collagen chain. This 227-residue domain is composed of two equal-sized sequential as had been observed for the corresponding 229-residue domain of the alpha 1(IV) chain. Alignment of the alpha 2(IV) repeats with each other and with those in alpha 1(IV) suggests that the type IV NC1 regions evolved via an intra- to intergenic duplication. In addition, smaller internal units having a consensus sequence GYSSCLFLWYLAF are present multiple times in the 110-115-amino acid halves. Consonant with the predominance of Tyr, Leu, and Phe in the heptads, hydrophilicity profiles of the homologous alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) regions revealed extended hydrophobic stretches which are similar to those in the noncollagenous COOH terminus of the chicken alpha 1(X) chain (Ninomiya, Y., Gordon, M., van der Rest, M., Schmid, T., Linsenmayer, T., and Olsen, B. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5041-5050). Isolation of an alpha 2(IV) clone also enabled us to investigate if the alpha 2(IV) and alpha 1(IV) collagen mRNAs were coordinately transcribed and if one or both were consistently associated with either type I (alpha 1 and alpha 2), III, or V (alpha 2) transcripts as a function of cell type. Northern blot hybridization of collagen cDNA probes to poly(A) RNA extracted from human and bovine cell cultures showed that only the alpha 1(III) and alpha 2(V) genes were expressed in all cells examined. Unexpectedly, neither type IV mRNAs were found in bovine endothelial, smooth muscle, or fibroblast cells, whereas both type IV species were present in human fibroblasts and to a much greater extent in human umbilical vein endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1545725378,"We describe a first attempt to study the antibody-combining sites recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against the beta-subunit of human choriogonadotropin (hCG). Two groups of antibodies were first defined by their ability to recognize only the free beta-subunit or the free and combined subunit. Antibodies FBT-11 and FBT-11-L bind only to hCG beta-subunit but not to hCG, whereas antibodies FBT-10 and D1E8 bind to both the beta-subunit and the hormone. In both cases, the antigenic determinants were localized to the core of the protein (residues 1-112), indicating the weak immunogenicity of the specific carboxyl-terminal extension of hCG-beta. Nine synthetic peptides spanning different regions of hCG-beta and lutropin-beta were assessed for their capacity to inhibit antibody binding. A synthetic peptide inclusive of the NH2-terminal region (residues 1-7) of the hCG beta-subunit was found to inhibit binding to the radiolabeled subunit of a monoclonal antibody specific for free hCG-beta (FBT-11). Further delineation of the antigenic site recognized by this antibody provided evidence for the involvement of fragment 82-92. Moreover, monoclonal antibody FBT-11 inhibited the recombination of hCG-beta to hCG-alpha, indicating that its antigenic determinant might be located nearby or in the hCG-beta portion interacting with the alpha-subunit. Binding of monoclonal antibody FBT-10, corresponding to the second antigenic determinant, was weakly inhibited by fragment 82-105 and did not impair the recombination of the hCG beta-subunit to the hCG alpha-subunit. Its combining site appeared to be located in a region of the intact native choriogonadotropin present at the surface of the hormone-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1484857276,"The yeast mitochondrial genome contains three reading frames, RF1, RF2, and RF3, which are related to the group I maturases, though they are not intronic sequences. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D273-10B/A, these reading frames are interrupted by G + C-rich sequences (GC clusters) which break the frames. In the present work we described a Saccharomyces uvarum strain which possesses a RF3 continuous sequence devoid of GC clusters. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that in the same strain RF2 and RF1 are also continuous sequences. As all three RFs belong to transcription units which are highly expressed, it is most reasonable to assume that RF1, RF2, and RF3 are functional genes. Furthermore, we have discovered a rule which seems to explain the transposition of GC clusters, considered as mobile elements, in the mitochondrial genome."
https://openalex.org/W1677444111,"Bovine adrenodoxin mRNA is found to consist of several distinct mRNA species which can be divided into two sets. Each set utilizes at least three of four separate poly(A)+ addition sites providing an explanation of the three sizes of adrenodoxin mRNA (1.75, 1.4, and 0.95 kilobases) previously observed in bovine adrenocortical RNA by this laboratory (Okamura, T., John, M.E., Zuber, M.X., Simpson, E.R., and Waterman, M.R. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 5705-5709). The two sets are distinguished from one another by a unique 5' sequence leading to two different amino acid sequences (approximately 10% homology) for the precursor portion of this nuclear encoded, mitochondrial protein. A common mature adrenodoxin sequence is encoded by both sets of mRNA. One set of RNAs is 10-fold more abundant than the other, but the levels of both sets can be induced by treatment of primary bovine adrenocortical cell cultures with adrenocorticotropin. The biological significance of these two types of adrenodoxin precursor sequences remains obscure."
https://openalex.org/W1499804795,"Monoclonal antibodies produced to both chicken ovotransferrin and to the isolated N- and C-terminal half-molecule domains of ovotransferrin have been used to probe the interaction of ovotransferrin with its specific receptor on chick embryo red blood cells. Two antibodies to epitopes on the N-terminal domain and one antibody to an epitope on the C-terminal domain were able to block the binding of 125I-labeled diferric ovotransferrin to the receptor. When the cellular surface receptors were first saturated with ovotransferrin at 0 degrees C, none of these antibodies bound to the cell-associated ovotransferrin. This suggests that the antibodies are to epitopes which lie very near to, or in the regions of, the two domains which interact with receptor. The same three antibodies also blocked the binding to the receptor of ovotransferrin associated in situ from the isolated N- and C-terminal half-molecule domains. A fourth antibody did not block binding to receptor of 125I-labeled diferric ovotransferrin or the associated domains; furthermore, it was able to bind to ovotransferrin bound to the cell surface at 0 degrees C. This antibody thus appears to recognize an epitope remote from the receptor binding region of ovotransferrin. Additional evidence for the requirement of the presence of both domains of ovotransferrin to effect binding to the transferrin receptor on chick reticulocytes was obtained with a fifth antibody which recognized only the N-terminal half-molecule domain but not holo-ovotransferrin. Although this antibody had no effect on the binding of 125I-labeled ovotransferrin to cells, it blocked binding to receptor of the associated domains of ovotransferrin, presumably by inhibiting the association of the two domains."
https://openalex.org/W1593717444,"The action of insulin on tyrosine phosphorylation of plasma membrane-associated proteins in rat adipocytes was investigated. Incubation of plasma membranes from insulin-treated adipocytes with [gamma-32P] ATP results in a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Mr = 160,000 (P160) and Mr = 92,000 proteins when compared to controls. Based on the immunoreactivities of these two proteins with anti-insulin receptor antibodies, the Mr = 92,000 species is identified as the insulin receptor beta subunit while P160 is unrelated to the receptor structure. P160 appears to be a glycoprotein as evidenced by its adsorption to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The tyrosine phosphorylation of P160 exhibits a rapid response to insulin (maximal within 2 min at 37 degrees C) and is readily reversed following removal of the free hormone by anti-insulin serum. The time courses of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation as well as the dephosphorylation of P160 coincide with those of the activation and deactivation of the insulin receptor kinase in the same plasma membrane preparation. Concanavalin A and hydrogen peroxide mimic insulin stimulation of the insulin receptor kinase and enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation of P160. Isoproterenol, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol diester are without effects. Analysis of the insulin dose-response relationship between P160 tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin receptor kinase activity reveals that maximal phosphorylation of P160 occurs when only a fraction (25%) of the receptor kinase is activated by the hormone. A similar relationship between these two parameters is observed for the insulinomimetic agent hydrogen peroxide. The close correlation between the level of P160 phosphorylation and insulin receptor kinase activity suggests that P160 may be tyrosine phosphorylated by the receptor kinase following receptor kinase activation by the hormone or insulin-like agents. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that the insulin receptor kinase is the only insulin-sensitive tyrosine kinase detectable in adipocyte plasma membranes under the conditions of our experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1607190706,"Enhanced synthesis and accumulation of interstitial collagens in the lungs of bleomycin-treated animals have been ascribed to drug-induced alterations in the cellular phenotype as judged by preferentially elevated rates of transcription of collagen and fibronectin genes (Raghow, R., Lurie, S., Seyer, J. M., and Kang, A. H. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 76, 1733-1739). To explore the biosynthetic contribution of mesenchymal cells to the fibrotic process we cultured hamster lung fibroblasts from animals at 0, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after bleomycin treatment and compared their ability to synthesize type I collagen and fibronectin. Our analyses involved (i) measurements of the rates of procollagen and fibronectin synthesis in relation to the total protein synthesis, (ii) quantitative analyses of the steady-state levels of mRNAs coding for type I procollagen chains and fibronectin by Northern hybridization, and finally (iii) a semiquantitative comparison of the steady-state levels of type I procollagen transcripts by in situ hybridization to recombinant cDNA probes. We show that in the earliest stages of the growth in vitro, the patterns of type I procollagen and fibronectin biosynthesis by cells in primary culture closely corresponded with those found in the intact lung. With increasing duration in culture, the distinctive phenotypes of cells from control as well as fibrotic lungs changed steadily; the biosynthetic profiles of fibroblasts cultured for 10 days from untreated or bleomycin-treated lungs were nearly identical. Based on these data, we conclude that the biosynthetic phenotype of fibroblasts, as judged by the parameters of collagen and fibronectin synthesis, appears to be reversible. The characteristic biosynthetic phenotype of fibroblasts, in the interactive milieu of the intact lung (both control and bleomycin-treated), is maintained by cellular and/or humoral factor(s) which are removed or inactivated by the procedures used for isolation and in vitro culture of fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2130764957,"We studied the rotational Brownian motions of myosin heads, of which the sulfhydryl group was selectively labeled with the triplet probe 5-eosinylmaleimide, in myofibril by using flash-induced phosphorescence anisotropy decay measurements. The anisotropy decay curve under relaxing conditions consisted of a fast (submicrosecond) and a slow (a few microseconds) component and a small constant part as in the synthetic myosin filaments in solution. The decay curves could be analyzed by assuming that a head part, i.e. subfragment 1 (S1), wobbles in the first cone and a part connecting S1 and the tail of a myosin molecule of which the length is shorter than subfragment 2 (S2) wobbles in the second cone (a double-cone model); the semiangles of the former and the latter cones were about 30 degrees and 50 degrees, respectively. The rotational freedom of myosin heads was only slightly restricted by the limited space of the filament lattice in myofibrils. Under rigor conditions, no motion of myosin heads was observed in the 10-microseconds time scale."
https://openalex.org/W1530774433,"The sequence of a complementary DNA clone coding for a human autoimmune antigen has been determined. This DNA sequence predicts the amino acid sequence of a small protein (E) which is associated with small nuclear RNA in human cells. Analysis of the predicted protein sequence suggests that the E protein is not closely related to other nucleic acid binding proteins. Screening of a human genomic DNA library has led to the isolation of several members of the E protein multigene family. Sequence analysis of one member of this family reveals that it is flanked by direct repeats and contains several mutations. One of these mutations, an insertion, terminates the long open reading frame. These features are compatible with the designation of this sequence as a processed pseudogene."
https://openalex.org/W1493078952,"Cholinergic agents decrease myocardial contractility in part by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity. We have found that after a prolonged preincubation period (greater than 6 h), washout of cholinergic agents from embryonic chick hearts or cultured heart cells results in a persistent increase in their basal and catecholamine-stimulated cAMP content. Membranes prepared from pretreated cells have elevated basal, forskolin-, and catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. This myocardial adaptation to cholinergic agents is analogous to changes in nerve cells and other cell types after prolonged exposures to narcotics or other inhibitors of adenylate cyclase, respectively. A rapid (less than 5 min) adaptation response to cholinergic agents can also be demonstrated in heart cells by quickly blocking agonist action with atropine. Atropine alone has no effect, but after a brief preincubation period with agonists (methacholine or oxotremorine), the addition of atropine transiently enhances catecholamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 2.5-fold. These responses are absent in heart cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. The data indicate that the response is not mediated by the phosphoinositide pathway, which has been demonstrated to be insensitive to pertussis toxin in chick heart. Enhanced cAMP accumulation after termination of muscarinic agonist action may provide an explanation for the observation that acetylcholine sometimes produces biphasic contractile responses."
https://openalex.org/W1482208789,"Heat shock induces 31 proteins in thymic lymphocytes in 1 h, 11 of which are not blocked by cordycepin, suggesting that their induction may be regulated at the level of translation (Maytin, E.V., Colbert, R.A., and Young, D.A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2384-2392). The possibility that mRNAs coding for these 11 cordycepin-insensitive heat-shock proteins would be found in non-heat-shocked thymus cells was investigated. Analysis of 1500 in vitro translation products separated by giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that poly(A)+ RNA isolated from non-heat-shocked thymus cells coded for proteins corresponding to 10 of the 11 non-cordycepin-inhibitable heat-shock proteins. Comparison of the relative rates of synthesis of these 10 proteins in whole cells incubated at 37 and 42 degrees C, with their synthesis in vitro directed by poly(A)+ RNA isolated from cells incubated at 37 degrees C, suggests that mRNAs for 7 of them are present in sufficient amounts in non-heat-shocked cells to account for their increased synthesis during heat shock. These results indicate that part of the response of thymic lymphocytes to heat shock involves a rapid increase in the translation of a group of pre-existing mRNAs that are normally translated at very low rates or not at all."
https://openalex.org/W1511636506,"Viscometry and gel chromatography of mixtures of proteoglycans with other linear flexible polymers suggest that proteoglycans shrink as the concentration of the linear polymer is increased. Similar behavior was observed for binary proteoglycan solutions using a differential viscometry procedure. The shrinkage does not involve specific chemical properties of the linear polymer, but rather is a consequence of purely entropic excluded volume interactions with the proteoglycans. Comparison with a hydrodynamic model supports this conclusion. The polydisperse proteoglycan preparation was subfractionated, and the individual fractions were tested for shrinkage. Fractions of lower molecular weight were found to shrink to a greater extent, suggesting that the molecules are more flexible when they contain fewer glycosaminoglycan chains."
https://openalex.org/W1520424661,"With a view toward the determination of nucleic acid binding domains and sites on nucleic acid helix-destabilizing (single strand-specific) proteins (HDPs), we have studied the interactions of the copolymer polynucleotide photoaffinity label, poly(adenylic, 8-azidoadenylic acid), (poly(A,8-N3A] with the T4 bacteriophage HDP, 32 protein. Poly(A,8-N3A) quenched the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of 32 protein in a manner similar to that observed with other polynucleotides, and the effect could be reversed by addition of sufficient NaCl. The binding affinity and site size of this noncovalent interaction of poly(A,8-N3A) with 32 protein are similar to the values obtained for poly(A) and this protein. When [3H]poly(A,8-N3A)/32 protein mixtures were irradiated at 254 nm, fluorescence quenching was not reversed by NaCl, suggesting that the label was covalently bound to the protein. Mixtures of photolabel and protein subjected to short periods of irradiation (generally 1 min, 2000 erg mm-2) formed high molecular weight complexes, which when electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels were radioactive and stained with Coomassie Blue R. Under the same conditions, [3H]poly(A) failed to label 32 protein. The radioactivity of [3H]poly(A,8-N3A)-labeled complexes subjected to micrococcal nuclease after irradiation was seen to migrate just behind the free 32 protein monomer on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, indicating that portions of the photolabel not in direct contact with protein were accessible to this enzyme. By several criteria, we conclude that 32 protein was photolabeled specifically at its single-stranded nucleic acid binding site. Single-stranded nucleic acids with affinities for protein greater than that of poly(A,8-N3A) effectively inhibited photolabeling. The [NaCl] dependence of photolabeling monitored on SDS gels paralleled the NaCl reversal of (noncovalent) poly(A,8-N3A)-32 protein binding. Photolabeling reached a plateau after 1-2 min. The formation of high molecular weight complexes with increasing [poly(A,8-N3A)] paralleled the disappearance of free protein on SDS gels, and reached a saturation level of about 75% labeling. Several chromatographic procedures appear to be useful for the separation of the photolabeled complexes from free protein and photolabel. Limited trypsin hydrolysis of photolabeled 32 protein indicated that all the label was within the central (III) portion of the protein. This approach should have general applicability to the identification of nucleic acid binding sites on helix-destabilizing proteins."
