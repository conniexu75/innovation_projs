https://openalex.org/W4306810879,"Infectious diseases are among the strongest selective pressures driving human evolution1,2. This includes the single greatest mortality event in recorded history, the first outbreak of the second pandemic of plague, commonly called the Black Death, which was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis3. This pandemic devastated Afro-Eurasia, killing up to 30-50% of the population4. To identify loci that may have been under selection during the Black Death, we characterized genetic variation around immune-related genes from 206 ancient DNA extracts, stemming from two different European populations before, during and after the Black Death. Immune loci are strongly enriched for highly differentiated sites relative to a set of non-immune loci, suggesting positive selection. We identify 245 variants that are highly differentiated within the London dataset, four of which were replicated in an independent cohort from Denmark, and represent the strongest candidates for positive selection. The selected allele for one of these variants, rs2549794, is associated with the production of a full-length (versus truncated) ERAP2 transcript, variation in cytokine response to Y. pestis and increased ability to control intracellular Y. pestis in macrophages. Finally, we show that protective variants overlap with alleles that are today associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, providing empirical evidence for the role played by past pandemics in shaping present-day susceptibility to disease."
https://openalex.org/W4306809799,"Abstract The current human reference genome, GRCh38, represents over 20 years of effort to generate a high-quality assembly, which has benefitted society 1,2 . However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it is a blend of multiple individuals 3,4 . Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly homozygous genome 5 . To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium formed with the goal of creating high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity 6 . Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches yield the most complete and accurate diploid genome assembly with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent–child data with graph-based haplotype phasing during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of the top-performing methods, we generated our first high-quality diploid reference assembly, containing only approximately four gaps per chromosome on average, with most chromosomes within ±1% of the length of CHM13. Nearly 48% of protein-coding genes have non-synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest diversity. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at scale for a pangenome reference to capture global genetic variation from single nucleotides to structural rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W4306809810,"Excessive agricultural nitrogen use causes environmental problems globally1, to an extent that it has been suggested that a safe planetary boundary has been exceeded2. Earlier estimates for the planetary nitrogen boundary3,4, however, did not account for the spatial variability in both ecosystems' sensitivity to nitrogen pollution and agricultural nitrogen losses. Here we use a spatially explicit model to establish regional boundaries for agricultural nitrogen surplus from thresholds for eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and nitrate in groundwater. We estimate regional boundaries for agricultural nitrogen pollution and find both overuse and room for intensification of agricultural nitrogen. The aggregated global surplus boundary with respect to all thresholds is 43 megatonnes of nitrogen per year, which is 64 per cent lower than the current (2010) nitrogen surplus (119 megatonnes of nitrogen per year). Allowing the nitrogen surplus to increase to close yield gaps in regions where environmental thresholds are not exceeded lifts the planetary nitrogen boundary to 57 megatonnes of nitrogen per year. Feeding the world without trespassing regional and planetary nitrogen boundaries requires large increases in nitrogen use efficiencies accompanied by mitigation of non-agricultural nitrogen sources such as sewage water. This asks for coordinated action that recognizes the heterogeneity of agricultural systems, non-agricultural nitrogen losses and environmental vulnerabilities."
https://openalex.org/W4306810376,"Abstract Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) functions downstream of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase in DNA sensing or as a direct receptor for bacterial cyclic dinucleotides and small molecules to activate immunity during infection, cancer and immunotherapy 1–10 . Precise regulation of STING is essential to ensure balanced immune responses and prevent detrimental autoinflammation 11–16 . After activation, STING, a transmembrane protein, traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where its phosphorylation by the protein kinase TBK1 enables signal transduction 17–20 . The mechanism that ends STING signalling at the Golgi remains unknown. Here we show that adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) controls the termination of STING-dependent immune activation. We find that AP-1 sorts phosphorylated STING into clathrin-coated transport vesicles for delivery to the endolysosomal system, where STING is degraded 21 . We identify a highly conserved dileucine motif in the cytosolic C-terminal tail (CTT) of STING that, together with TBK1-dependent CTT phosphorylation, dictates the AP-1 engagement of STING. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of AP-1 in complex with phosphorylated STING explains the enhanced recognition of TBK1-activated STING. We show that suppression of AP-1 exacerbates STING-induced immune responses. Our results reveal a structural mechanism of negative regulation of STING and establish that the initiation of signalling is inextricably associated with its termination to enable transient activation of immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4306810394,"Tobacco smoking is positively correlated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)1–5, but the underlying mechanism for this association is unclear. Here we report that nicotine accumulates in the intestine during tobacco smoking and activates intestinal AMPKα. We identify the gut bacterium Bacteroides xylanisolvens as an effective nicotine degrader. Colonization of B. xylanisolvens reduces intestinal nicotine concentrations in nicotine-exposed mice, and it improves nicotine-exacerbated NAFLD progression. Mechanistically, AMPKα promotes the phosphorylation of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), stabilizing the latter and therefore increasing intestinal ceramide formation, which contributes to NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Our results establish a role for intestinal nicotine accumulation in NAFLD progression and reveal an endogenous bacterium in the human intestine with the ability to metabolize nicotine. These findings suggest a possible route to reduce tobacco smoking-exacerbated NAFLD progression. Nicotine accumulates in the intestine during tobacco smoking and accelerates the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but it can be degraded effectively by the human symbiont Bacteroides xylanisolvens."
https://openalex.org/W4306748633,"Some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We tested mosquito attraction to human skin odor and identified people who are exceptionally attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes. These differences were stable over several years. Chemical analysis revealed that highly attractive people produce significantly more carboxylic acids in their skin emanations. Mutant mosquitoes lacking the chemosensory co-receptors Ir8a, Ir25a, or Ir76b were severely impaired in attraction to human scent, but retained the ability to differentiate highly and weakly attractive people. The link between elevated carboxylic acids in “mosquito-magnet” human skin odor and phenotypes of genetic mutations in carboxylic acid receptors suggests that such compounds contribute to differential mosquito attraction. Understanding why some humans are more attractive than others provides insights into what skin odorants are most important to the mosquito and could inform the development of more effective repellents."
https://openalex.org/W4306809760,"Abstract Planar digital image sensors facilitate broad applications in a wide range of areas 1–5 , and the number of pixels has scaled up rapidly in recent years 2,6 . However, the practical performance of imaging systems is fundamentally limited by spatially nonuniform optical aberrations originating from imperfect lenses or environmental disturbances 7,8 . Here we propose an integrated scanning light-field imaging sensor, termed a meta-imaging sensor, to achieve high-speed aberration-corrected three-dimensional photography for universal applications without additional hardware modifications. Instead of directly detecting a two-dimensional intensity projection, the meta-imaging sensor captures extra-fine four-dimensional light-field distributions through a vibrating coded microlens array, enabling flexible and precise synthesis of complex-field-modulated images in post-processing. Using the sensor, we achieve high-performance photography up to a gigapixel with a single spherical lens without a data prior, leading to orders-of-magnitude reductions in system capacity and costs for optical imaging. Even in the presence of dynamic atmosphere turbulence, the meta-imaging sensor enables multisite aberration correction across 1,000 arcseconds on an 80-centimetre ground-based telescope without reducing the acquisition speed, paving the way for high-resolution synoptic sky surveys. Moreover, high-density accurate depth maps can be retrieved simultaneously, facilitating diverse applications from autonomous driving to industrial inspections."

https://openalex.org/W4306810360,"The ubiquitin E3 ligase substrate adapter cereblon (CRBN) is a target of thalidomide and lenalidomide1, therapeutic agents used in the treatment of haematopoietic malignancies2–4 and as ligands for targeted protein degradation5–7. These agents are proposed to mimic a naturally occurring degron; however, the structural motif recognized by the thalidomide-binding domain of CRBN remains unknown. Here we report that C-terminal cyclic imides, post-translational modifications that arise from intramolecular cyclization of glutamine or asparagine residues, are physiological degrons on substrates for CRBN. Dipeptides bearing the C-terminal cyclic imide degron substitute for thalidomide when embedded within bifunctional chemical degraders. Addition of the degron to the C terminus of proteins induces CRBN-dependent ubiquitination and degradation in vitro and in cells. C-terminal cyclic imides form adventitiously on physiologically relevant timescales throughout the human proteome to afford a degron that is endogenously recognized and removed by CRBN. The discovery of the C-terminal cyclic imide degron defines a regulatory process that may affect the physiological function and therapeutic engagement of CRBN. C-terminal cyclic imides are physiological degrons that enable the ubiquitin E3 ligase adapter protein cereblon to target substrates for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W4306809797,"Genomic analyses of Neanderthals have previously provided insights into their population history and relationship to modern humans1-8, but the social organization of Neanderthal communities remains poorly understood. Here we present genetic data for 13 Neanderthals from two Middle Palaeolithic sites in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia: 11 from Chagyrskaya Cave9,10 and 2 from Okladnikov Cave11-making this one of the largest genetic studies of a Neanderthal population to date. We used hybridization capture to obtain genome-wide nuclear data, as well as mitochondrial and Y-chromosome sequences. Some Chagyrskaya individuals were closely related, including a father-daughter pair and a pair of second-degree relatives, indicating that at least some of the individuals lived at the same time. Up to one-third of these individuals' genomes had long segments of homozygosity, suggesting that the Chagyrskaya Neanderthals were part of a small community. In addition, the Y-chromosome diversity is an order of magnitude lower than the mitochondrial diversity, a pattern that we found is best explained by female migration between communities. Thus, the genetic data presented here provide a detailed documentation of the social organization of an isolated Neanderthal community at the easternmost extent of their known range."
https://openalex.org/W4306810321,"Chronic stress can have lasting adverse consequences in some individuals, yet others are resilient to the same stressor1,2. Susceptible and resilient individuals exhibit differences in the intrinsic properties of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons after the stressful experience is over3–8. However, the causal links between DA, behaviour during stress and individual differences in resilience are unknown. Here we recorded behaviour in mice simultaneously with DA neuron activity in projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (which signals reward9–12) and the tail striatum (TS) (which signals threat13–16) during social defeat. Supervised and unsupervised behavioural quantification revealed that during stress, resilient and susceptible mice use different behavioural strategies and have distinct activity patterns in DA terminals in the NAc (but not the TS). Neurally, resilient mice have greater activity near the aggressor, including at the onset of fighting back. Conversely, susceptible mice have greater activity at the offset of attacks and onset of fleeing. We also performed optogenetic stimulation of NAc-projecting DA neurons in open loop (randomly timed) during defeat or timed to specific behaviours using real-time behavioural classification. Both open-loop and fighting-back-timed activation promoted resilience and reorganized behaviour during defeat towards resilience-associated patterns. Together, these data provide a link between DA neural activity, resilience and resilience-associated behaviour during the experience of stress. Neural recording and closed-loop manipulation during chronic stress in mice reveal causal links between dopamine, behavior and resilience."
https://openalex.org/W4306810806,"Multipass membrane proteins play numerous roles in biology and include receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes1,2. How multipass proteins are co-translationally inserted and folded at the endoplasmic reticulum is not well understood2. The prevailing model posits that each transmembrane domain (TMD) of a multipass protein successively passes into the lipid bilayer through a front-side lateral gate of the Sec61 protein translocation channel3-9. The PAT complex, an intramembrane chaperone comprising Asterix and CCDC47, engages early TMDs of multipass proteins to promote their biogenesis by an unknown mechanism10. Here, biochemical and structural analysis of intermediates during multipass protein biogenesis showed that the nascent chain is not engaged with Sec61, which is occluded and latched closed by CCDC47. Instead, Asterix binds to and redirects the substrate to a location behind Sec61, where the PAT complex contributes to a multipass translocon surrounding a semi-enclosed, lipid-filled cavity11. Detection of multiple TMDs in this cavity after their emergence from the ribosome suggests that multipass proteins insert and fold behind Sec61. Accordingly, biogenesis of several multipass proteins was unimpeded by inhibitors of the Sec61 lateral gate. These findings elucidate the mechanism of an intramembrane chaperone and suggest a new framework for multipass membrane protein biogenesis at the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W4306809759,"Most membrane proteins are synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound ribosomes docked at the translocon, a heterogeneous ensemble of transmembrane factors operating on the nascent chain1,2. How the translocon coordinates the actions of these factors to accommodate its different substrates is not well understood. Here we define the composition, function and assembly of a translocon specialized for multipass membrane protein biogenesis3. This 'multipass translocon' is distinguished by three components that selectively bind the ribosome-Sec61 complex during multipass protein synthesis: the GET- and EMC-like (GEL), protein associated with translocon (PAT) and back of Sec61 (BOS) complexes. Analysis of insertion intermediates reveals how features of the nascent chain trigger multipass translocon assembly. Reconstitution studies demonstrate a role for multipass translocon components in protein topogenesis, and cells lacking these components show reduced multipass protein stability. These results establish the mechanism by which nascent multipass proteins selectively recruit the multipass translocon to facilitate their biogenesis. More broadly, they define the ER translocon as a dynamic assembly whose subunit composition adjusts co-translationally to accommodate the biosynthetic needs of its diverse range of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W4306809753,"Anaerobic methane oxidation exerts a key control on greenhouse gas emissions1, yet factors that modulate the activity of microorganisms performing this function remain poorly understood. Here we discovered extraordinarily large, diverse DNA sequences that primarily encode hypothetical proteins through studying groundwater, sediments and wetland soil where methane production and oxidation occur. Four curated, complete genomes are linear, up to approximately 1 Mb in length and share genome organization, including replichore structure, long inverted terminal repeats and genome-wide unique perfect tandem direct repeats that are intergenic or generate amino acid repeats. We infer that these are highly divergent archaeal extrachromosomal elements with a distinct evolutionary origin. Gene sequence similarity, phylogeny and local divergence of sequence composition indicate that many of their genes were assimilated from methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens archaea. We refer to these elements as 'Borgs'. We identified at least 19 different Borg types coexisting with Methanoperedens spp. in four distinct ecosystems. Borgs provide methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens archaea access to genes encoding proteins involved in redox reactions and energy conservation (for example, clusters of multihaem cytochromes and methyl coenzyme M reductase). These data suggest that Borgs might have previously unrecognized roles in the metabolism of this group of archaea, which are known to modulate greenhouse gas emissions, but further studies are now needed to establish their functional relevance."

https://openalex.org/W4306811488,"Haem is an iron-containing tetrapyrrole that is critical for a variety of cellular and physiological processes1–3. Haem binding proteins are present in almost all cellular compartments, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transport and use of haem within the cell remain poorly understood2,3. Here we show that haem-responsive gene 9 (HRG-9) (also known as transport and Golgi organization 2 (TANGO2)) is an evolutionarily conserved haem chaperone with a crucial role in trafficking haem out of haem storage or synthesis sites in eukaryotic cells. Loss of Caenorhabditis elegans hrg-9 and its paralogue hrg-10 results in the accumulation of haem in lysosome-related organelles, the haem storage site in worms. Similarly, deletion of the hrg-9 homologue TANGO2 in yeast and mammalian cells induces haem overload in mitochondria, the site of haem synthesis. We demonstrate that TANGO2 binds haem and transfers it from cellular membranes to apo-haemoproteins. Notably, homozygous tango2−/− zebrafish larvae develop pleiotropic symptoms including encephalopathy, cardiac arrhythmia and myopathy, and die during early development. These defects partially resemble the symptoms of human TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias, a hereditary disease caused by mutations in TANGO24–8. Thus, the identification of HRG-9 as an intracellular haem chaperone provides a biological basis for exploring the aetiology and treatment of TANGO2-related disorders. HRG-9 (also known as TANGO2) is an evolutionarily conserved haem chaperone that traffics haem from sites of storage or synthesis in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W4306810717,"Cells process information in a manner reminiscent of a Turing machine1, autonomously reading data from molecular tapes and translating it into outputs2,3. Randomly processive macrocyclic catalysts that can derivatise threaded polymers have been described4,5, as have rotaxanes that transfer building blocks in sequence from a molecular strand to a growing oligomer6-10. However, synthetic small-molecule machines that can read and/or write information stored on artificial molecular tapes remain elusive11-13. Here we report on a molecular ratchet in which a crown ether (the 'reading head') is pumped from solution onto an encoded molecular strand (the 'tape') by a pulse14,15 of chemical fuel16. Further fuel pulses transport the macrocycle through a series of compartments of the tape via an energy ratchet14,17-22 mechanism, before releasing it back to bulk off the other end of the strand. During its directional transport, the crown ether changes conformation according to the stereochemistry of binding sites along the way. This allows the sequence of stereochemical information programmed into the tape to be read out as a string of digits in a non-destructive manner through a changing circular dichroism response. The concept is exemplified by the reading of molecular tapes with strings of balanced ternary digits ('trits'23), -1,0,+1 and -1,0,-1. The small-molecule ratchet is a finite-state automaton: a special case24 of a Turing machine that moves in one direction through a string-encoded state sequence, giving outputs dependent on the occupied machine state25,26. It opens the way for the reading-and ultimately writing-of information using the powered directional movement of artificial nanomachines along molecular tapes."
https://openalex.org/W4306811598,"Long-term analyses of biodiversity data highlight a ‘biodiversity conservation paradox’: biological communities show substantial species turnover over the past century1,2, but changes in species richness are marginal1,3–5. Most studies, however, have focused only on the incidence of species, and have not considered changes in local abundance. Here we asked whether analysing changes in the cover of plant species could reveal previously unrecognized patterns of biodiversity change and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms. We compiled and analysed a dataset of 7,738 permanent and semi-permanent vegetation plots from Germany that were surveyed between 2 and 54 times from 1927 to 2020, in total comprising 1,794 species of vascular plants. We found that decrements in cover, averaged across all species and plots, occurred more often than increments; that the number of species that decreased in cover was higher than the number of species that increased; and that decrements were more equally distributed among losers than were gains among winners. Null model simulations confirmed that these trends do not emerge by chance, but are the consequence of species-specific negative effects of environmental changes. In the long run, these trends might result in substantial losses of species at both local and regional scales. Summarizing the changes by decade shows that the inequality in the mean change in species cover of losers and winners diverged as early as the 1960s. We conclude that changes in species cover in communities represent an important but understudied dimension of biodiversity change that should more routinely be considered in time-series analyses. Time-series data including 1,794 plant species from 7,738 vegetation plots in Germany between 1927 and 2020 reveal patterns of change in biodiversity, and suggest that more species declined than increased in abundance during this period."

Large amounts of entanglement 4–6 involving the internal degrees of freedom of laser-cooled atomic ensembles 4–16 have been generated in collective cavity quantum-electrodynamics systems, in which many atoms simultaneously interact with a single optical cavity mode.

https://openalex.org/W4306810146,"Attitude control is an essential flight capability. Whereas flying robots commonly rely on accelerometers1 for estimating attitude, flying insects lack an unambiguous sense of gravity2,3. Despite the established role of several sense organs in attitude stabilization3-5, the dependence of flying insects on an internal gravity direction estimate remains unclear. Here we show how attitude can be extracted from optic flow when combined with a motion model that relates attitude to acceleration direction. Although there are conditions such as hover in which the attitude is unobservable, we prove that the ensuing control system is still stable, continuously moving into and out of these conditions. Flying robot experiments confirm that accommodating unobservability in this manner leads to stable, but slightly oscillatory, attitude control. Moreover, experiments with a bio-inspired flapping-wing robot show that residual, high-frequency attitude oscillations from flapping motion improve observability. The presented approach holds a promise for robotics, with accelerometer-less autopilots paving the road for insect-scale autonomous flying robots6. Finally, it forms a hypothesis on insect attitude estimation and control, with the potential to provide further insight into known biological phenomena5,7,8 and to generate new predictions such as reduced head and body attitude variance at higher flight speeds9."
https://openalex.org/W4306748254,"A stunning example of synaptic diversity is the postsynaptic target cell-type-dependent difference in synaptic efficacy in cortical networks. Here, we show that CA1 pyramidal cell (PC) to fast spiking interneuron (FSIN) connections have 10-fold larger release probability (Pv) than those on oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons. Freeze-fracture immunolabeling revealed that different nano-topologies and coupling distances between Ca2+ channels and release sites (RSs) are not responsible for the distinct Pv. Although [Ca2+] transients are 40% larger in FSINs innervating boutons, when [Ca2+] entry is matched in the two bouton populations, EPSCs in O-LM cells are still 7-fold smaller. However, application of a phorbol ester analog resulted in a ∼2.5-fold larger augmentation at PC - O-LM compared to PC - FSIN synapses, suggesting incomplete docking or priming of vesicles. Similar densities of docked vesicles rule out distinct RS occupancies and demonstrate that incompletely primed, but docked, vesicles limit the output of PC - O-LM synapses."

Observations have previously shown that interactions between multiple members, including a high-speed intruder galaxy currently colliding into the intragroup medium, have probably generated tidal debris in the form of multiple gaseous and stellar filaments6,8,13, the formation of tidal dwarfs7,14,15 and intragroup-medium starbursts16, as well as widespread intergalactic shocked gas5,10,11,17. The details and timing of the interactions and collisions remain poorly understood because of their multiple nature18,19. Here we report atomic hydrogen (H I) observations in the vicinity of SQ with a smoothed sensitivity of 1σ = 4.2 × 1016 cm-2 per channel (velocity bin-width Δv = 20 km s-1; angular resolution = 4'), which are about two orders of magnitude deeper than previous observations8,13,20,21. The data show a large H I structure (with linear scale of around 0.6 Mpc) encompassing an extended source of size approximately 0.4 Mpc associated with the debris field and a curved diffuse feature of length around 0.5 Mpc attached to the south edge of the extended source. The diffuse feature was probably produced by tidal interactions in early stages of the formation of SQ (>1 Gyr ago), although it is not clear how the low-density H I gas (NH i ≲ 1018 cm-2) can survive the ionization by the intergalactic ultraviolet background on such a long time scale. Our observations require a rethinking of properties of gas in outer parts of galaxy groups and demand complex modelling of different phases of the intragroup medium in simulations of group formation."

Consequently, understanding the formation of matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton’s bound state. A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the electromagnetic polarizabilities1 that describe how easily the charge and magnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the electromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities2 map out the resulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an electromagnetic field. They disclose essential information about the underlying system dynamics and provide a key for decoding the proton structure in terms of the theory of the strong interaction that binds its elementary quark and gluon constituents. Of particular interest is a puzzle in the electric generalized polarizability of the proton that remains unresolved for two decades2. Here we report measurements of the proton’s electromagnetic generalized polarizabilities at low four-momentum transfer squared. We show evidence of an anomaly to the behaviour of the proton’s electric generalized polarizability that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory. Measurements of the proton’s electromagnetic structure show enhancement of its electric generalized polarizability compared with theoretical expectations, confirming the presence of a new dynamical mechanism not accounted for by current theories."

Here we use a community-science approach to investigate the genetics of three color morphs affecting production of the pigment melanin. These morphs—Albino, Lavender Albino, and Ultramel—show a loss of melanin in the skin and eyes, ranging from severe (Albino) to moderate (Lavender Albino) to mild (Ultramel). To identify genetic variants causing each morph, we recruited shed skins of pet ball pythons via social media, extracted DNA from the skins, and searched for putative loss-of-function variants in homologs of genes controlling melanin production in other vertebrates. We report that the Albino morph is associated with missense and non-coding variants in the gene TYR . The Lavender Albino morph is associated with a deletion in the gene OCA2 . The Ultramel morph is associated with a missense variant and a putative deletion in the gene TYRP1 . Our study is one of the first to identify genetic variants associated with color morphs in ball pythons and shows that pet samples recruited from the community can provide a resource for genetic studies in this species."
https://openalex.org/W4306832709,"Whole-genome data has become significantly more accessible over the last two decades. This can largely be attributed to both reduced sequencing costs and imputation models which make it possible to obtain nearly whole-genome data from less expensive genotyping methods, such as microarray chips. Although there are many different approaches to imputation, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) remains the most widely used. In this study, we compared the latest versions of the most popular HMM-based tools for phasing and imputation: Beagle5.4, Eagle2.4.1, Shapeit4, Impute5 and Minimac4. We benchmarked them on four input datasets with three levels of chip density. We assessed each imputation software on the basis of accuracy, speed and memory usage, and showed how the choice of imputation accuracy metric can result in different interpretations. The highest average concordance rate was achieved by Beagle5.4, followed by Impute5 and Minimac4, using a reference-based approach during phasing and the highest density chip. IQS and R 2 metrics revealed that Impute5 and Minimac4 obtained better results for low frequency markers, while Beagle5.4 remained more accurate for common markers (MAF&gt;5%). Computational load as measured by run time was lower for Beagle5.4 than Minimac4 and Impute5, while Minimac4 utilized the least memory of the imputation tools we compared. ShapeIT4, used the least memory of the phasing tools examined with genotype chip data, while Eagle2.4.1 used the least memory phasing WGS data. Finally, we determined the combination of phasing software, imputation software, and reference panel, best suited for different situations and analysis needs and created an automated pipeline that provides a way for users to create customized chips designed to optimize their imputation results."

https://openalex.org/W4306810115,"Sustained neuronal activity demands a rapid resupply of synaptic vesicles to maintain reliable synaptic transmission. Such vesicle replenishment is accelerated by submicromolar presynaptic Ca2+ signals by an as-yet unidentified high-affinity Ca2+ sensor1,2. Here we identify synaptotagmin-3 (SYT3)3,4 as that presynaptic high-affinity Ca2+ sensor, which drives vesicle replenishment and short-term synaptic plasticity. Synapses in Syt3 knockout mice exhibited enhanced short-term depression, and recovery from depression was slower and insensitive to presynaptic residual Ca2+. During sustained neuronal firing, SYT3 accelerated vesicle replenishment and increased the size of the readily releasable pool. SYT3 also mediated short-term facilitation under conditions of low release probability and promoted synaptic enhancement together with another high-affinity synaptotagmin, SYT7 (ref. 5). Biophysical modelling predicted that SYT3 mediates both replenishment and facilitation by promoting the transition of loosely docked vesicles to tightly docked, primed states. Our results reveal a crucial role for presynaptic SYT3 in the maintenance of reliable high-frequency synaptic transmission. Moreover, multiple forms of short-term plasticity may converge on a mechanism of reversible, Ca2+-dependent vesicle docking."
https://openalex.org/W4306810805,"Accurate knowledge of the mineralogy is essential for understanding the lower mantle, which represents more than half of Earth’s volume. CaSiO3 perovskite is believed to be the third-most-abundant mineral throughout the lower mantle, following bridgmanite and ferropericlase1–3. Here we experimentally show that the calcium solubility in bridgmanite increases steeply at about 2,300 kelvin and above 40 gigapascals to a level sufficient for a complete dissolution of all CaSiO3 component in pyrolite into bridgmanite, resulting in the disappearance of CaSiO3 perovskite at depths greater than about 1,800 kilometres along the geotherm4,5. Hence we propose a change from a two-perovskite domain (TPD; bridgmanite plus CaSiO3 perovskite) at the shallower lower mantle to a single-perovskite domain (SPD; calcium-rich bridgmanite) at the deeper lower mantle. Iron seems to have a key role in increasing the calcium solubility in bridgmanite. The temperature-driven nature can cause large lateral variations in the depth of the TPD-to-SPD change in response to temperature variations (by more than 500 kilometres). Furthermore, the SPD should have been thicker in the past when the mantle was warmer. Our finding requires revision of the deep-mantle mineralogy models and will have an impact on our understanding of the composition, structure, dynamics and evolution of the region. Experiments show that calcium solubility in bridgmanite increases with depth in Earth’s lower mantle, resulting in the disappearance of CaSiO3 perovskite and indicating a transition from a two-perovskite to a single-perovskite domain."
https://openalex.org/W4306822603,"Long-term studies of population dynamics can provide insights into life history theory, population ecology, socioecology, conservation biology and wildlife management. Here we examine 25 years of population dynamics of western gorillas at Mbeli Bai, a swampy forest clearing in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park, the Republic of Congo. The Mbeli population more than doubled from 101 to 226 gorillas during the study. After adjusting for a net influx of gorillas into the study population, the increase represents an inherent growth rate of 0.7% per year, with 95% confidence limits between -0.7% and 2.6%. The influx of gorillas mainly involved immigration of individuals into existing study groups (social dispersal), but it also included the appearance of a few previously unknown groups (locational dispersal). The average group size did not change significantly during the study, which is consistent with the possibility that western gorillas face socioecological constraints on group size, even when the population is increasing. We found no significant evidence of density dependence on female reproductive success or male mating competition. The distribution of gorillas among age/sex categories also did not change significantly, which suggests that the population had a stable age structure. Our results provide evidence of population stability or growth for some western gorillas (albeit within a small area). The results highlight the value of law enforcement, long-term monitoring, and protected areas; but they do not diminish the importance of improving conservation for this critically endangered species."

Understanding the safety culture is essential for improving undesirable workforce attitudes and behaviours such as lack of adverse event reporting. The study assessed the frequency of adverse event reporting, the patient safety culture determinants of the adverse event reporting, and the implications for Ghanaian healthcare facilities.The study employed a multi-centre cross-sectional survey on 1651 health professionals in 13 healthcare facilities in Ghana using the Survey on Patient Safety (SOPS) Culture, Hospital Survey questionnaire. Analyses included descriptive, Spearman Rho correlation, one-way ANOVA, and a Binary logistic regression model.The majority of health professionals had at least reported adverse events in the past 12 months across all 13 healthcare facilities. Teamwork (Mean: 4.18, SD: 0.566) and response to errors (Mean: 3.40, SD: 0.742) were the satisfactory patient safety culture. The patient safety culture dimensions were statistically significant (χ2 (9, N = 1642) = 69.28, p < .001) in distinguishing between participants who frequently reported adverse events and otherwise.Promoting an effective patient safety culture is the ultimate way to overcome the challenges of adverse event reporting, and this can effectively be dealt with by developing policies to regulate the incidence and reporting of adverse events. The quality of healthcare and patient safety can also be enhanced when healthcare managers dedicate adequate support and resources to ensure teamwork, effective communication, and blame-free culture."
https://openalex.org/W4306818226,"Background In early terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) without identified cytogenetic abnormality, a fetal autopsy is recommended for diagnostic purposes, to guide genetic counseling. Medical induction, which allows analysis of a complete fetus, is generally preferred over surgical vacuum aspiration. Our objective was to assess the diagnostic value of fetal autopsies in these early terminations, relative to the first-trimester ultrasound, overall and by termination method. Materials For this retrospective study at the Port Royal Maternity Hospital, we identified all TOPFA performed from 11 weeks to 16 weeks diagnosed at the first-trimester ultrasound in cases with a normal karyotype. The principal endpoint was the additional value of the autopsy over /compared to the ultrasound and its impact on genetic counseling, globally and by termination method. The secondary objective was to compare the complication rate by method of termination. Results The study included 79 women during period of 2013–2017: 42 with terminations by medical induction and 37 by aspiration. Fetal autopsy found additional abnormalities in 54.4% of cases, more frequently after medical induction (77.5%) than after aspiration (21.4%, p &lt; .01). Genetic counseling was modified in 20.6% of cases, more often after induction (32.5% vs 3.6%, p &lt; .01). The length of stay was significantly longer and a secondary aspiration was required in 16,7% of case in the medical induction group (p &lt; .01). Conclusion Medically induced vaginal expulsion appears preferable and can change genetic counseling for subsequent pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W4306833567,"Hand-eye calibration is an important step in controlling a vision-guided robot in applications like part assembly, bin picking and inspection operations etc. Many methods for estimating hand-eye transformations have been proposed in literature with varying degrees of complexity and accuracy. However, the success of a vision-guided application is highly impacted by the accuracy the hand-eye calibration of the vision system with the robot. The level of this accuracy depends on several factors such as rotation and translation noise, rotation and translation motion range that must be considered during calibration. Previous studies and benchmarking of the proposed algorithms have largely been focused on the combined effect of rotation and translation noise. This study provides insight on the impact of rotation and translation noise acting in isolation on the hand-eye calibration accuracy. This deviates from the most common method of assessing hand-eye calibration accuracy based on pose noise (combined rotation and translation noise). We also evaluated the impact of the robot motion range used during the hand-eye calibration operation which is rarely considered. We provide quantitative evaluation of our study using six commonly used algorithms from an implementation perspective. We comparatively analyse the performance of these algorithms through simulation case studies and experimental validation using the Universal Robot's UR5e physical robots. Our results show that these different algorithms perform differently when the noise conditions vary rather than following a general trend. For example, the simultaneous methods are more resistant to rotation noise, whereas the separate methods are better at dealing with translation noise. Additionally, while increasing the robot rotation motion span during calibration enhances the accuracy of the separate methods, it has a negative effect on the simultaneous methods. Conversely, increasing the translation motion range improves the accuracy of simultaneous methods but degrades the accuracy of the separate methods. These findings suggest that those conditions should be considered when benchmarking algorithms or performing a calibration process for enhanced accuracy."

Yet, data collection in partnership with RWCM, particularly over large geographic areas, has been under-explored. We partnered with RWCM and their organizations throughout Florida to administer a 10-item technology use and willingness survey to clients living with HIV; RWCMs provided process-oriented feedback.

https://openalex.org/W4306831543,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a fundamental component of the heart, guiding vital cellular processes during organ homeostasis. Most cardiovascular diseases lead to a remarkable remodeling of the ECM, accompanied by the formation of a fibrotic tissue that heavily compromises the heart function. Effective therapies for managing fibrosis and promoting physiological ECM repair are not yet available. The production of a decellularized extracellular matrix (d-ECM) serving as a three-dimensional and bioactive scaffold able to modulate cellular behavior and activities is considered crucial to achieve a successful regeneration. The protocol represents a step-by-step method to obtain a decellularized cardiac matrix through the combination of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and Triton X-100. Briefly, cardiac samples obtained from left ventricles of explanted, pathological human hearts were dissected and washed to remove residual body fluids. Samples were then snap-frozen and sliced by a cryostat into 350 μm thick sections. The sections obtained were decellularized using a solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS in combination, for 24 hours, until observing the color change from brownish-red to translucent-white. As a result, the protocol shows efficiency in preserving ECM architecture and protein composition during the whole process, suggesting that it is worthwhile, highly reproducible and produces a well- preserved decellularized extracellular matrix from cardiac samples. Notwithstanding, some limitations need to be addressed, such as the risk for microbial contamination and the unpredictable trend of the protocol when applied to decellularize samples other than myocardium, vessels, or skin. These issues require antibiotics mixture supplement during the procedure followed by UV sterilization, and appropriate adjustments for a tissue-specific utilization, respectively. The protocol is intended to produce a cardiac d-ECM for cell settlement, representing the ideal scaffold for tissue engineering purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4306833404,"Managing postoperative pain require good understanding of the bio-ethical principles in order to preserve patients' rights. Bio-ethical principles in health care include autonomy, beneficence, justice and nonmaleficence. It is important that health care professionals understand that patients in pain have the right to satisfactory management. Good insight on ethical principles and how they relate to pain management places the nurse on a better pedestal to manage postoperative pain effectively. However, there is scanty literature on the level of Ghanaian nurses' knowledge and application of bio-ethical principles in postoperative pain management. Therefore, the study objectives were to: explore nurses' understanding of the bio-ethical principles in postoperative pain management; explore how nurses apply bioethical principles in postoperative pain management. The study employed qualitative exploratory descriptive design. Purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants from the surgical wards. Semi-structured interview guide was designed for data collection. Data saturation was reached at the fourteenth participant. Thematic analysis method was used and themes emerged inductively. Three main themes identified through inductive content analysis of data were: beneficence, autonomy and justice. Findings showed that nurses had some appreciable level of knowledge of the fundamental principles related to ethics and applied them in postoperative pain management. Nurses knew their duties in advocating for patients. Patients rights to refuse treatment was also appreciated by some nurses. Nurses also demonstrated humanity by helping patients financially to settle hospital debts which explicitly shows the empathetic characteristics of nurses. The study concluded that nurses are knowledgeable in bioethical principles underpinning post operative pain management and also applied these principles when caring for surgical patients."

Participants run a virtual lemonade stand and face a trade-off between exploiting a known strategy and exploring untested approaches. Innovation through testing new approaches comes along with a risk of failure because participants are compensated based on the profits generated by their virtual business. We test whether we can draw attention away from this risk by implementing a salience mechanism, which ought to focus participants on the input rather than the outcome of the innovative process. However, we find that this intervention is not effective in motivating innovative behavior—rather, it jeopardizes innovation. We discuss potential behavioral channels and encourage further research of risk salience as a tool to foster innovation. Our pre-registered study highlights the importance of evaluating interventions before implementation, as even carefully designed interventions may turn out to be ineffective or even backfire."
https://openalex.org/W4306816424,"Several disciplines, among them health, sociology, and economics, provide strong evidence that social context is important to individual choices. It is therefore surprising that relatively little research has been focused on integrating the effect of social influence into choice models, especially given the importance of such choices in healthcare. This study developed and empirically tested a choice model that accounts for social network influences in a discrete choice experiment (DCE). We focused on maternal choices for childhood vaccination in Australia, and used an econometric choice model that explicitly 1) incorporated vaccine schedule characteristics, benefits and costs, and 2) represented up to ten different identifiable key influencer types (e.g., partner, parents, friends, healthcare professionals, inter alia), allowing for the attribution of directional importance of each influencer on the gravid woman's decision to adhere to or reject childhood vaccination. Pregnant women (N = 604) aged 18 years and older recruited from an online panel completed a survey, including a DCE and questions about key influencers. A two-class ordered latent class model was conducted to analyse the DCE data, which assumes that the underlying latent driver (in our case the WHO vaccine hesitancy scale) is ordered, to give a practical interpretation of the meaning of the classes. When the choice model considered both childhood vaccination attributes and key influencers, a very high model fit was reached. The impact of key influencers on maternal choice for childhood vaccination was massive compared to the impact of childhood vaccination attributes. The marginal impact differed between key influencers. Our DCE study showed that the maternal decision for childhood vaccination was essentially almost completely socially driven, suggesting that the potential impact of social network influences can and should be considered in health-related DCEs, particular those where there are likely to be strong underlying social norms dictating decision maker behaviour."

Malposition is associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity. Most previous studies report the incidence and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes of persistent fetal malposition in the second stage of labour and do not include outcomes that may be present in the first stage of labour.To assess the incidence and health outcomes for women and their newborn infants of a fetal malposition in the first or second stage of labour.A retrospective cohort study of 738 maternity records (randomly selected) from a tertiary hospital in New Zealand. Maternal and neonatal characteristics are described. Outcomes for women with a fetus in an OP or OT position in labour are compared to those for women with a fetus in an occiput-anterior position (OA).499 (68%) women had an OP/OT positioned fetus and 239 (32%) had an OA positioned fetus on vaginal examination in labour. Women had similar characteristics except a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 was more common in the OP/OT group. Fetal malposition appears to be more likely in women with a right-sided fetal occiput. Three quarters of OP/OT fetuses rotated anteriorly by birth. Fetal malposition compared to no malposition was associated with oxytocin augmentation, epidural use, a longer first stage of labour, fewer normal vaginal births, and more caesarean sections. Fetal malposition during labour was not associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.Interventions such as maternal posture in the first and second stage of labour could potentially reduce the incidence of malposition and improve health outcomes for mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4306816529,"Many studies show that in many countries (especially the G7), volatility in government bill rates far exceeds that in consumption growth rates. This volatility puzzle cannot be predicted by traditional disaster models, in which rare economic disasters are defined as a peak-to-trough percent fall in consumption (or real per capita GDP) by a high threshold (≥10%). For this purpose, we extend the traditional definition of rare economic disasters and propose a novel asset pricing model that models both good and bad events. We define a bad (or good) event as a peak-to-trough absolute decline (or a trough-to-peak absolute rise) in consumption growth rates by a low threshold (&lt;10%). Compared to traditional disaster models, our model contains three improvements. First, model good and bad events, not just bad ones (e.g., rare economic disasters). Second, the event’s impact lasts for multiple periods rather than one period. Third, model non-rare economic events. We calibrate the parameters in our model to match the moments from U.S. asset return data. Simulation results indicate that the model can successfully predict the volatility of U.S. government bill rates higher than that of U.S. consumption growth rates."
https://openalex.org/W4306818344,"Auxospore production is a sexual reproductive strategy by diatoms to re-attain normal size after the size-reducing effect of clonal reproduction. Aside from the minimum size threshold used as a sex clock by diatoms, the environmental or chemical triggers that can induce sex in diatoms are still not well understood. Here we investigated the influence of six marine bacteria from five families on the production of sexual cells and auxospores of the ubiquitous marine polar centric diatom, Odontella sp. Microbiome association and co-occurrence with the diatom in culture and in nature were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Indole acetic acid (IAA) secretion, a phytohormone that regulates plants’ growth and sexual development, was explored as a potential inducer of sexual reproduction in Odontella and compared between bacterial associates. We found that Odontella co-cultured with Flavobacteriaceae ( Polaribacter and Cellulophaga ) have significantly more sexual cells and auxospores than bacteria-free Odontella and Odontella co-cultured with other bacteria from Vibrionaceae ( Vibrio ), Pseudoalteromonadaceae ( Pseudoalteromonas ), Rhodobacteraceae ( Sulfitobacter ), or Planococcaceae ( Planococcus ) family. Differences in IAA secretion were observed between bacterial isolates, but this did not correspond consistently with the diatom’s clonal growth or production of sexual cells and auxospores. Microbiome composition survey of Odontella cultures showed that the diatom harbors homologous sequences of the four bacterial isolates at varying proportions, with Sulfitobacter and Polaribacter at high abundances. Microbiome surveys at Santa Cruz Wharf, Monterey Bay, from 2014–2015 showed that Odontella abundance is positively correlated with Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae abundances. Our study demonstrates that specific members of the diatom microbiome can enhance the host’s sexual reproduction, with the interkingdom interaction driven by partner compatibility and long-term association. Sex-enhancing bacteria may even be needed by the diatom host to carry out the optimal inducement of sex under normal conditions, allowing for size restitution and maintaining genetic diversity in culture and in nature."
https://openalex.org/W4306818362,"Urbanization is one of the most widespread and extreme examples of habitat alteration. As humans dominate landscapes, they introduce novel elements into environments, including artificial light, noise pollution, and anthropogenic food sources. One understudied form of anthropogenic food is refuse from restaurants, which can alter wildlife populations and, in turn, entire wildlife communities by providing a novel and stable food source. Using data from the Maricopa Association of Governments and the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) project, we investigated whether and how the distribution of restaurants influences avian communities. The research aimed to identify restaurants, and thus the associated food they may provide, as the driver of potential patterns by controlling for other influences of urbanization, including land cover and the total number of businesses. Using generalized linear mixed models, we tested whether the number of restaurants within 1 km of bird monitoring locations predict avian community richness and abundance and individual species abundance and occurrence patterns. Results indicate that restaurants may decrease avian species diversity and increase overall abundance. Additionally, restaurants may be a significant predictor of the overall abundance of urban-exploiting species, including rock pigeon ( Columba livia ), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) , and Inca dove ( Columbina Inca ). Understanding how birds utilize anthropogenic food sources can inform possible conservation or wildlife management practices. As this study highlights only correlations, we suggest further experimental work to address the physiological ramifications of consuming anthropogenic foods provided by restaurants and studies to quantify how frequently anthropogenic food sources are used compared to naturally occurring sources."

The intestinal barrier affects the interaction of microbiota in healthy or unhealthy individuals. This study investigates the relationship between hot flashes and gut permeability in postmenopausal women.In this cross-sectional study, we divided 289 women, aged 40-65 years, into four groups based on their hot-flash severity: HF0: never experienced hot flashes; HFm: mild hot flashes; HFM: moderate hot flashes; HFS: severe hot flashes. The measured variables included the clinical parameters; hot flashes experience; fasting plasma levels of zonulin, fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2), endotoxin, and cytokines/chemokines. We used multiple linear regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between hot flashes and the previously mentioned gut barrier proteins.The study was performed in a hospital medical center.The hot flashes had a positive tendency toward increased levels of circulating FABP2 (P-trend = 0.001), endotoxin (P-trend = 0.031), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (P-trend = 0.033), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P-trend = 0.017), and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP10) (P-trend = 0.021). Spearman's correlation analysis revealed significant correlations of FABP2 with endotoxin, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IP10, and hs-CRP in the 289 postmenopausal women included in this study. Linear regression analysis revealed that hot-flash severity had significant assoiciations with FABP2 (P-trend = 0.002), but not with zonulin. After adjusting for body mass index, age, and menopause duration, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed the differences between HFs (% difference (95% confidence interval), 22.36 (8.04, 38.59), P = 0.01) and HF0 groups in terms of FABP2 levels.This study shows that hot flashes are significantly associated with FABP2 levels in postmenopausal women. It suggests that severe hot flashes are linked to an increase in intestinal barrier permeability and low-grade systemic inflammation."

This paper proposes a new method for adjusting the vehicle body using the damping asymmetric characteristic of semi-active suspensions, which is based on the idea that the dampers with damping asymmetric characteristics will cause a change in the mean position of the vehicle body vibration. To verify the feasibility of this method, a single-wheel vehicle model containing asymmetric damping is established. The system’s responses under the sinusoidal and random roads excitation are obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, the influences of key parameters on the vehicle body’s shifting height are analyzed, and the mechanism of vehicle body’s shift is explained from the perspective of energy conservation. Then a vehicle body height controller based on third-order linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is designed. Simulation results show that the proposed method for controlling the vehicle height with asymmetric damping can quickly adjust the vehicle to the expected height whether under the sinusoidal road or random road. In addition, no additional hardware and energy consumption are required, providing a new idea for vehicle height control."

Most previous studies have not systematically analyzed the level of social integration of migrants from the perspective of spatial ternary dialectics or systematically analyzed physical, social, and spiritual spaces. Based on space production theory, this study used principal component analyses to evaluate the ternary spatial integration level of physical, social, and spiritual spaces of ecological migrants in a specific resettlement area in Yinchuan City, China, and the Tobit regression model was used to identify the key constraint factors. The results demonstrate that the overall socio-spatial integration levels of ecological migrants in Yinchuan City are lower than that of the overall migrant population nationwide, and the levels of their spatial adaptation and spatial practice integration lag behind that of spatial belonging and spatial identity integration. Meanwhile, length of residency, occupation type, monthly income, and household type have facilitating effects on the ecological migrants' social integration, while gender, age, ethnicity, and education levels have insignificant effects. In particular, occupation type is a key factor in promoting social integration and improving employment among ecological migrants. It is concluded that upgrading production skills and raising employment for ecological migrants can foster sustainable social space production patterns, facilitate virtuous cycles, and eliminate inhibiting factors such as lagging spatial practices, regional cultural differences, and socio-spatial deprivation."

As bladder is constantly filled with urine, it is worthwhile to investigate whether it could have any detrimental effects on bladder cancer cells. Methods We investigated the cytotoxicity of urine samples from CaB patients and normal controls on four CaB cell lines and tested the percentage of cell death, proliferation, adhesion, invasion and colonies formation ability. In order to identify the potential components involving in urine cytotoxicity, we evaluated some basic physiochemical parameters of urines, such as pH, osmolarity, creatinine (Cr), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca) and phosphate (PO 4 ). We further compared the pH values of urine samples between CaB who developed recurrence versus those who did not. A more in-depth analysis on inflammatory markers was performed for two representative urine samples which demonstrated opposite cytoxic effects. Results 23 CaB patients and 20 normal controls were recruited into this study. According to in vitro experiments, both CaB and non-CaB urines had comparable effect on cell toxicity, proliferation, adhesion, invasion and colonies formation ability in four cell lines, HTB9, RT4, T24 and UMUC3, while RT4 was the most sensitive to urine toxicity. After evaluating the relationship between basic physiochemical parameters and cytotoxicity, we found out that there were strong negative correlations between pH value and 24 hours death rate for the 4 CaB cell lines (HTB9 r = -0.6651, p&lt;0.001; RT4 r = -0.8335, p&lt;0.001; T24 r = -0.4924, p&lt;0.001; UMUC3 r = -0.7066, p&lt;0.001). Osmolarity, urine Cr and PO 4 all had weakly or moderately positive correlations with CaB cells on 24 hours death rate. CaB patients who developed recurrence had more alkaline urine than those who did not develop recurrence. In the urine sample with the highest cytoxicity, high concentrations of IL-6 and IFN-gamma were found. Conclusions Our study confirmed that there was not statistically significant difference in cytotoxicity between CaB and non-CaB urines. However, we identified some parameters that could have an impact on cytotoxicity towards CaB cells. Modifying certain urine characteristics peri-operatively may induce cytotoxicity, avoid tumour re-implantation, and reduce the chance of cancer recurrence."
