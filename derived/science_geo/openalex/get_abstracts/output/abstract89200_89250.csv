https://openalex.org/W2023211111,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is known to cause an irreversible destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and symptoms of parkinsonism in humans and in monkeys. However, MPTP has been reported to act only minimally or not at all in several other animal species. When MPTP (30 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) was administered parenterally to mice, a decrease in concentrations of neostriatal dopamine and its metabolites, a decrease in the capacity of neostriatal synaptosomal preparations to accumulate [3H]dopamine, and a disappearance of nerve cells in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra were observed. In contrast, MPTP administration had no effect on neostriatal concentrations of serotonin and its metabolites. MPTP administration thus results in biochemical and histological changes in mice similar to those reported in humans and monkeys and similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease in humans. The mouse should prove to be a useful small animal with which to study the mode of action of MPTP."
https://openalex.org/W2082030057,"The chromosomal breakpoint of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells of the B-cell type carrying the translocated long arms of chromosomes 11 and 14 [t(11;14) (q13;q32)] was cloned. The breakpoint was found to be within the joining segment of the human heavy chain locus on the translocated long arm of chromosome 14. A probe that is specific for chromosome 11 and that maps immediately 5' to the breakpoint on the 14q+ chromosome was isolated. The probe detected a rearrangement of the homologous genomic DNA segment in the parental CLL cells and also in DNA from a diffuse large cell lymphoma with the t(11;14) translocation. This rearranged DNA segment was not present in Burkitt lymphoma cells with the t(8;14) translocation or in nonneoplastic human lymphoblastoid cells. The probe can thus be used to identify and characterize a gene located on band q13 of chromosome 11 that appears to be involved in the malignant transformation of human B cells carrying the t(11;14) translocation. This gene, named bcl -1, appears to be unrelated to any of the known retrovirus oncogenes described to date."
https://openalex.org/W2063572593,"The FBJ murine osteosarcoma virus (FBJ-MuSV) induces tumors in vivo and transformation in vitro. Transformation is due to the expression of a single viral protein (p55v-fos) which is encoded by sequences derived from mouse genetic material. The homologous cellular gene (c-fos) does not transform cultured cells after introduction by transfection. We show that even though the c-fos protein is completely different from the v-fos protein at its C terminus, it is capable of transforming cultured fibroblasts. However, activation of the transforming potential of the c-fos gene requires two manipulations--a transcriptional enhancer sequence must be linked to the gene and an interaction at the 3' end of the gene, which inhibits transformation, must be disrupted. Our studies show that normal cellular protein can induce transformation when expressed in an inappropriate cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1495233477,"The stimulation of hepatocytes by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists and vasoactive peptides results in a mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ which is accompanied by breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to release myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). The possible involvement of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was tested using a preparation of saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes. Added Ca2+ was sequestered by intracellular organelles in the presence of ATP until the medium free Ca2+ concentration was lowered to a new steady state level. The subsequent addition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 caused a rapid Ca2+ release, which was complete within 5 s. Half-maximal and maximal Ca2+ release were obtained at concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 of 0.1 and 0.5 microM, respectively. The maximal amount of Ca2+ mobilized was 450 pmol/mg of cell dry weight. Using experimental conditions designed to permit selective Ca2+ accumulation into mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial stores, it was determined that all of the Ca2+ released by Ins(1,4,5)P3 originated from non-mitochondrial, vesicular stores. After Ca2+ release was completed, reaccumulation occurred until the medium free Ca2+ concentration was restored to its original level. Experiments using 32P-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 indicated that Ca2+ reaccumulation was associated with dephosphorylation of this compound. From a consideration of the properties of the Ca2+ release induced by Ins(1,4,5)P3, with respect to its kinetics, dose response, specificity, and the amount of Ca2+ released, the data strongly suggest that this compound is a second messenger involved in the hormonal mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores."

https://openalex.org/W1489663455,"Addition of platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or serum to quiescent human fibroblasts, loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin-2, causes an immediate, up to 3-fold, rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i). In contrast, insulin and tumor-promoting phorbol ester have no effect on [Ca2+]i. The mitogen-induced [Ca2+]i response is initiated within a few s, reaches a maximum by 20-40 s, and then slowly declines to a new steady level. The [Ca2+]i response is not prevented by removal of external Ca2+ and is independent of the transmembrane Na+ gradient and membrane potential. It is concluded that platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and serum rapidly mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores, presumably due to the prior breakdown of inositol phospholipids, and that the resulting rise in [Ca2+]i may function as an initial signal in growth factor action."

A biochemical procedure for purifying the La protein from HeLa cells is described. The interaction of the isolated protein with a collection of model tRNA precursors, generated by ligation of specific oligonucleotides to the 3' terminus of yeast tRNAPhe, was studied. The most stable complexes are formed with adducts possessing three or four terminal uridylate residues. Addition of a terminal phosphate, fragmentation of the RNA, or substitution of other nucleotides reduce the affinity for the La protein. The preferred terminal sequence recognized and bound by La protein is homologous to the transcriptional termination signal for RNA polymerase III."

The purification scheme consisted of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, lentil lectin-Sepharose chromatography, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified glycoprotein was homogeneous by the criteria of high pressure liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions. The specific activity of the purified lymphotoxin is approximately 40 X 10(6) units/mg. The protein has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 20,000, and RF of 0.33 on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels at pH 8.8 and an isoelectric point of 5.8. A tryptic digest of the purified native material produced two major fragments of approximately 15,000 and 5,000 Da. The amino acid compositions of the intact molecule and of the tryptic fragments are presented."

An integrated set of experiments was performed during Spacelab 1, as well as before and after the flight, to evaluate responses mediated by the otolith organs and semicircular canals. A variety of measurements were used, including eye movements, postural control, perception of orientation, and susceptibility to space sickness."
https://openalex.org/W1599221914,"Stoichiometric amounts of MgATP disassemble dephosphorylated smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin filaments to a 10 S monomer. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain reassembles the myosin into filaments (Suzuki, H., Onishi, H., Takahashi, K., and Watanabe, S. (1978) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 84, 1529-1542). The conformation of the dephosphorylated 10 S monomer is highly unusual in that the 1500 A long myosin tail is folded into approximately equal thirds (Onishi, H., and Wakabayashi, T. (1982) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 92, 871-879; Trybus, K. M., Huiatt, T. W., and Lowey, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6151-6155). It was recently reported that phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain causes the bent monomer to unfold to the extended conformation characteristic of 6 S myosin in high salt (Craig, R., Smith, R., and Kendrick-Jones, J. (1983) Nature (Lond.) 302, 436-439). Here we show that phosphorylated myosin can exist in a stable 10 S conformation provided that the salt concentration is kept sufficiently low. Only in a narrow range of salt concentration does the monomer conformation depend on the state of phosphorylation. Above 0.3 M KCl, all myosins revert to the extended form; below 0.1 M KCl, all monomeric myosin is folded. As the salt concentration is decreased to 0.05 M KCl, the 10 S monomers form antiparallel folded dimers. Because phosphorylation increases filament formation even when 10 S monomer remains in equilibrium with polymer, assembly could proceed via the association of 10 S monomers or by a transient 6 S intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1534713573,"The properties and the purity of a cytochrome P-450 (17 alpha-hydroxylase) from porcine adrenal microsomes have been examined following a report that the corresponding enzyme from bovine adrenocortical microsomes is inactive as a 17 alpha-hydroxylase and fails to show a high spin spectrum on addition of substrate, once the enzyme has been purified (Bumpus, J. A., and Dus, K. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12696-12704). The purity of the porcine enzyme was demonstrated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide with sodium dodecyl sulfate, immunoelectrophoresis, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (16 residues). The pure enzyme shows Mr = 54,000, heme content of greater than 0.8 nmol/nmol of protein, and absorption spectra typical of cytochrome P-450. The enzyme is active with both delta 4 (progesterone) and delta 5 (pregnenolone) substrates as a 17 alpha-hydroxylase and with the corresponding 17 alpha-hydroxysteroids as a C17,20-lyase. All four substrates produce typical type I spectra with the enzyme (so-called high spin form). We conclude that: 1) porcine adrenal microsomes contain a 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase which is a single protein molecule readily purified to an enzymatically active form; 2) the C17,20-lyase activity is largely suppressed in the microsomes; and 3) the enzyme closely resembles that found in testicular microsomes. We propose that this enzyme be referred to as the adrenal C21 steroid side chain cleavage enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2056454654,"A comparison of proteins encoded by normal human ras genes and by mutant rasH or rasK genes activated in human carcinomas revealed no changes in subcellular localization, posttranslational modification, or guanine nucleotide binding associated with activation. Subcellular fractionation indicated that both normal and activated ras proteins were associated exclusively with the membrane fraction. Furthermore, both normal and activated ras proteins exhibited similar degrees of posttranslational acylation. The KD for dGTP binding was 1.0-2.2 X 10(-8) M, with no consistent differences between normal and activated ras proteins. In addition, a survey of 13 possible competing nucleotides revealed no differences in the specificity of nucleotide binding associated with ras gene activation. These results indicate that structural mutations which activate ras gene transforming activity do not alter the protein's known biochemical parameters and in particular do not affect the protein's intrinsic ability to bind guanine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1966115309,"We have transferred the mouse Aαk and Aβk genes, which encode the class II I-Ak molecule, into mouse L-cell fibroblasts and hamster B cells. I-Ak molecules are expressed on the surface of both cell types. The L-cell and hamster B-cell I-Ak molecules appear normal by serological analyses and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the I-Ak molecules on L cells can act as targets for the allogenic T-cell killing of the transformed L cells. The I-Ak molecules in both mouse fibroblasts and hamster B cells can present certain antigens to T-cell helper hybridomas. Thus only class II molecules are required to convert the nonantigen-presenting mouse L cell into an effective antigen-presenting cell. Accordingly, it will be possible to dissect the structure-function relationships existing between la molecules, foreign antigen, and T-cell receptor molecules by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis and gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2051583892,"The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent chemoattractant for cells that respond to PDGF as a mitogen. The chemotactic response of these cells to PDGF is inversely related to their rate of proliferation, with quiescent cells exhibiting a 25-fold greater chemotactic response than exponentially growing cells. Factors that stimulate the growth of quiescent cells (EGF, FGF, PDGF, and serum) decrease the cells' migratory response to PDGF but not to fibronectin, suggesting that the decreased migration is not due to a general paralysis of cell motility. Transformed lines of NIH/3T3 cells lose their ability to respond to PDGF as a chemoattractant but can still migrate in response to fibronectin. Similarly, after treatment of 3T3 cells with the tumorpromoter phorbol myristate acetate, which induces a transformation-like phenotype, the cells no longer respond to PDGF as a chemoattractant but retain their migratory response to fibronectin. Thus it appears that the growth state of the cells can alter their migratory response to PDGF. These data suggest that growth factors, transformation, and tumor promoters specifically alter the cells' ability to respond to the PDGF-mediated chemotactic signal. It appears that both transformation and tumor promoters accomplish this by altering PDGF-binding to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2050214031,"During the flight of Spacelab 1 the crew performed a number of experiments to explore changes in vestibular function and visual-vestibular interactions on exposure to microgravity. Measurements were made on the threshold for detection of linear oscillation, vestibulo-ocular reflexes elicited by angular and linear movements, oculomotor and posture responses to optokinetic stimulations, and responses to caloric stimulation. Tests were also conducted on the ground, during the 4 months before and on days 1 to 6 after flight. The most significant result was that caloric mystagmus of the same direction as on the earth could also be evoked in the weightless environment."
https://openalex.org/W1545078091,"The amino acid sequence of a corn inhibitor for trypsin and activated Hageman Factor (Factor XIIa) was determined by automated Edman degradation from the intact inhibitor and two fragments generated by specific cleavage of the inhibitor. The 112-residue sequence is unique at each position except 91, where both Ala and Glu were found. The structural heterogeneity suggests the occurrence of two genes (possibly allelic) for the inhibitor. Based on analysis of fragments produced by the interaction of the inhibitor with trypsin-agarose, the reactive site peptide bond is identified as Arg 36-Leu 37. There is no strong similarity between the sequence of the corn inhibitor and the sequences published for other serine protease inhibitors. Thus, the corn inhibitor represents a new family of protease inhibitors. Circular dichroism measurements and a theoretical prediction of secondary structure indicate that the inhibitor has helix and beta sheet contents of approximately 40 and 20%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1973204840,"The vestibulo-ocular reflex helps to stabilize retinal images by generating smooth eye movements that are equal to and opposite each rotatory head movement. It is well known that the reflex undergoes adaptive plasticity or ""motor learning"" whenever there is persistent image motion during head turns: the resulting changes in the reflex occur gradually and help to restore image stability. A new approach makes it possible to identify the pathways containing the site of motor learning according to their total latency in response to natural vestibular stimuli. The fastest pathways required 14 milliseconds to initiate a vestibulo-ocular reflex, but the site of motor learning was in pathways having latencies of at least 19 milliseconds."
https://openalex.org/W1607549921,"The primary deuterium and tritium isotope effects on Vm/Km and on Vm have been measured for the O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin catalyzed by two purified isozymes of cytochrome P-450. From these data the intrinsic isotope effects have been calculated as described by D. B. Northrop (Biochemistry (1975) 14, 2644-2651). The observed deuterium isotope effects on Vm/Km are 3.79 and 1.90 for the isozymes isolated from the livers of rats induced by phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene, respectively. The calculated intrinsic isotope effects, however, are similar and much larger (kH/kD = 12.8 to 14.0) than the observed isotope effects on Vm/Km for the two enzymes. This demonstrates that the intrinsic isotope effects are attenuated by various steps preceding the isotopically sensitive C-H bond cleavage step resulting in the low values for the observed isotope effects. Thus, the observed isotope effects do not accurately reflect the magnitude of the intrinsic isotope effect associated with this reaction. No incorporation of 18O into the 7-hydroxycoumarin product was observed in studies employing H218O or 18O2 demonstrating that the phenolic oxygen arises exclusively from the substrate. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that both cytochrome P-450 isozymes catalyze the O-dealkylation of this substrate by an identical radical recombination mechanism during the obligatory formation of a hemiacetal intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2171873299,"Inducer T-cell clones reactive to the p-azobenzenearsonate (arsonate) hapten possess binding sites for radioactive arsanylated proteins, which are not present on clones with other antigen specificities. Binding occurred in the absence of histocompatibility proteins. Binding was specific for the p-azobenzenearsonate hapten, since unconjugated proteins and proteins conjugated to the nonactivating o-azobenzenearsonate hapten neither bound to the clones nor competed binding of radioactive antigen. One of the clones was studied in more detail, using a panel of structural analogs of arsonate conjugated to the carrier protein ovalbumin. All conjugates that activated the clone in the presence of antigen-presenting cells also competed binding of radioactive antigen in the absence of antigen-presenting cells. Nonactivating conjugates did not compete binding. Based on evidence in this and the succeeding paper (Rao et al., accompanying paper), we suggest that these arsonate-binding sites may include the physiological antigen receptors of arsonate-reactive T-cell clones."

https://openalex.org/W1525195730,"Human C3a, a 77-residue fragment released during activation of the serum complement system, is a potent spasmogen that contracts a variety of smooth muscle tissues and enhances vascular permeability. Previous studies have suggested that a 5-residue, COOH-terminal segment of C3a constitutes the essential active site of this molecule; however, the pentapeptide is 1000-fold less active than C3a. Human C3a 57-77, a synthetic segment containing the 21 COOH-terminal residues of C3a, exhibits potencies nearly equivalent to those of natural C3a in several biologic assay systems. The circular dichroism spectra of synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences 57-77, 65-77, and 73-77 in human C3a were measured in water and trifluoroethanol. The CD spectra in the far-UV region indicate that each C3a peptide assumes a random coil conformation in aqueous solution with little evidence of alpha-helical structure. However, C3a peptide 57-77 assumes predominantly an alpha-helical conformation (47%) in 25% trifluoroethanol, while the shorter tridecapeptide 65-77 and pentapeptide 73-77 appear by CD to contain beta-turn conformations only Crystallographic analysis of human C3a indicated that the NH2-terminal portion of peptide 57-77 adopts an alpha-helical structure and that the COOH-terminal portion, including residues 73-77, contains an irregular fold much like a beta-turn. Since C3a peptide 57-77 exhibits activities qualitatively and quantitatively similar to natural C3a, we propose that this synthetic peptide adopts a helical conformation when bound to its cellular receptor which corresponds to that in the intact C3a molecule. Consequently, the NH2-terminal portion (residues 1-21) and the disulfide-linked core region (residues 22-57) in intact C3a serve primarily to stabilize ordered conformation in the COOH-terminal region (residues 58-77) and thereby orient side chains at the essential active site for optimal receptor interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1490545395,"We have examined the effects of folate compounds and the folate analog amethopterin (methotrexate) as inhibitors of mammalian xanthine oxidase and have found that they offer potent inhibition of the enzyme. We have compared the inhibitory potency of folic acid and its coenzyme derivative tetrahydrofolic acid to that of allopurinol, a known inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, and have demonstrated that folic acid and tetrahydrofolic acid are severalfold more potent than allopurinol as inhibitors of xanthine oxidase. Comparative inhibition constants calculated were 5.0 X 10(-7) M for folic acid. 1.25 X 10(-6) M for tetrahydrofolic acid, and 4.88 X 10(-6) M for allopurinol. Incubation of xanthine oxidase with folic acid at a concentration of 10(-6) M abolished 94% of the enzymic activity within 1 min of incubation with the enzyme. At the same concentration, allopurinol was almost ineffective as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. The substrate xanthine protected the enzyme against total inhibition by folic acid. Reversibility of the enzymic inhibition by folic acid was demonstrated. Folic acid-inactivated enzyme was totally regenerated either by filtration through Sephadex G-200 or by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. 2-Amino-4-hydroxypteridine was a poor substrate for the enzyme but a potent inhibitor for the oxidation of xanthine by the enzyme. The inhibition constant calculated was 1.50 X 10(-6) M. In the presence of an excess of xanthine oxidase, neither folic acid nor tetrahydrofolic acid and allopurinol exhibited any change in intensity of their absorbance or in the wavelength of their maximal absorbance that might have been suggestive of substrate utility. The folate analog amethopterin was also determined a potent inhibitor of mammalian xanthine oxidase. The inhibition constant calculated was 3.0 X 10(-5) M."
https://openalex.org/W1558499662,"An NAD-dependent 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase has been purified to homogeneity from autotrophically and heterotrophically grown cells of Acetobacterium woodii. The enzymes from the differently grown cells were indistinguishable by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and have a final specific activity of 670 units mg-1. The enzyme is oxygen-labile; therefore, it was isolated under anaerobic conditions in the presence of dithiothreitol. The oxidized enzyme can be reactivated with 5 mM dithiothreitol, the half-time of activation being 19 min. The forward and reverse reaction initial velocity kinetics was studied and the enzyme was found to follow a substituted (ping-pong) reaction mechanism. With this model, the Km values for NAD and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate are 4.0 and 0.26 mM, while for NADH and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, they are 2.0 and 1.0 mM, respectively.

Addition of actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin simultaneously with 1,25-(OH)2D3 prevented hormonal elevation of BGP levels but did not affect basal BGP synthesis. Neither transcriptional inhibitor had any effect on BGP synthesis in cultures which had already been fully stimulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked BGP synthesis in both untreated and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells. Inhibitor effects on media BGP levels corresponded in all cases to effects on the rapidly turned over intracellular BGP pool. These results support a model of transcriptional control for the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and suggest that the hormone elicits a transient burst of transcription of the BGP gene."

https://openalex.org/W1502554246,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) undergoes a specific series of alterations during the course of its binding and internalization into cultured fibroblasts. The modified EGF species can be distinguished from each other and from native EGF by their isoelectric points. We employed peptide mapping techniques to determine the nature of these alterations. We found that 125I-EGF with a pI of 4.55 was converted to a pI 4.2 species by removal of 1 or 2 amino acid moieties from the COOH-terminal end of the protein. A pI 4.35 species was generated by a trypsin-like cut between amino acid residues 48 and 49, for a total of 5 amino acid moieties removed from the native EGF. The pI 4.0 species was formed by removal of at least the COOH-terminal arginine from the pI 4.35 species. Thus, upon binding and internalization, EGF was sequentially cleaved in the COOH-terminal region. Removal of the COOH-terminal polypeptide has been shown to dramatically reduce the affinity of EGF for its receptor, raising the possibility that intracellular dissociation of EGF from its receptor may be a direct result of the intracellular processing of EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1569326806,"The oxygen dependence of cholesterol side chain cleavage to form pregnenolone was measured, using both purified phospholipid vesicle-reconstituted cytochrome P-450scc and rat adrenal mitochondria. At saturating cholesterol and nonlimiting electron supply (via NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin) the Km(O2) is low (4 microM). Limitations in the availability of both cholesterol and reductant caused elevations in the observed Km(O2). Pregnenolone synthesis was measured in mitochondria from variously pretreated rats, using a phospholipid-cholesterol dispersion as the source of exogenous substrate. In mitochondria obtained from ether-stressed rats (which elevates adrenocorticotropic hormone) two phases of malate-supported pregnenolone production are seen, a rapid (first 2 min) highly oxygen-dependent phase (Km = 150 microM) and a slow (2-10 min) relatively oxygen-independent phase (Km less than 10 microM). Comparison of side chain cleavage rates with mitochondrial 11 beta-hydroxylation rates at various oxygen concentrations suggests that the rapid phase is limited by the availability of reducing equivalents. In cycloheximide-pretreated ether-stressed rats, only a linear slow rate of pregnenolone production was seen (about 25% of the rate of the slow phase in the ether-stressed group), while in mitoplasts from both groups only a linear rapid rate was seen. Data are consistent with the proposal (Privalle, C. T., Crivello, J. F., and Jefcoate, C. R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 702-706) that the adrenocorticotropic hormone-regulated cycloheximide-inhibitable rate of cholesterol side chain cleavage is limited by the rate of cholesterol transfer from outer to inner mitochondrial membranes."

The enzyme will accept as substrates a variety of divalent metal ions and trinucleotides. The products of the reaction are 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, ADP, and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of about 28,000. The stability of the enzyme is unusually sensitive to pH and ionic strength. Initial velocity studies suggest that the enzyme catalyzes a sequential mechanism. The turnover number of the enzyme is 300/min at 30 degrees C. The Km values for MgATP and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate are 0.3 mM and 0.5 microM, respectively. Product and dead-end inhibition studies indicate that substrates bind to the enzyme by a random mechanism. Vmax and the Km for MgATP are essentially constant over the pH range of 5.0-7.5. The results suggest that the enzyme catalyzes a reaction which serves as a salvage pathway to generate metabolically active one-carbon units from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate."
https://openalex.org/W1522495070,"To elucidate the mechanism for the previously reported increase in calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the presence of palmitic acid, the ability of this fatty acid to bind calcium was investigated by dual wavelength spectrophotometry using the calcium indicator arsenazo III, and by Millipore filtration using 45CaCl2. In the presence of 120 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 15 microM CaCl2, and 40 mM histidine (pH 6.8, 25 degrees C), calcium binding to 10-80 microM palmitic acid occurred slowly (approximately 3-7 min halftime) and was accompanied by an increase in turbidity (measured by difference spectrophotometry) and a decrease in exchangeable calcium. The stoichiometry of calcium binding to palmitic acid under this condition was 0.15 mol of calcium/mol of palmitate, but increased to approximately 0.4 mol of calcium/mol of palmitate in the presence of 0.03-3 mM calcium. The rate of calcium binding to palmitic acid also increased with calcium concentration such that in the presence of 1-3 mM calcium, palmitic acid bound approximately 0.4 mol of calcium/mol of palmitate within 15 s. Thus, palmitic acid may represent a calcium-precipitating anion in regions of the cell, such as the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where calcium concentration is high. Analyses of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium sequestration in the presence of various palmitic acid concentrations support this hypothesis and suggest that 10% of the palmitic acid is accessible to luminal calcium."

https://openalex.org/W1531195829,"Abstract We have measured the size of the glucocorticoid receptors from two murine lymphoid cell lines, one displaying a wild type cytolytic response to hormone, the other a resistant variant. Using radiation inactivation and target analysis, we first compared the and cytoplasmic forms of the steroid receptors in a wild type line, WEHI 7.1 (W7). Within the variation expected for this type of measurement (+/- 14%), the and cytoplasmic forms have the same size, 75,000 and 79,000 daltons, respectively. We have also measured the size of the receptor in a hormone-insensitive nuclear transfer-increased (nti) variant (S49 143R). In contrast to reports indicating that the nti phenotype is associated with a much smaller cytoplasmic receptor, we found little or no difference in sizes of translocated receptor in wild type and nti cells. We have found significant differences, however, in the release of wild type and nti receptors from nuclei by nuclease digestion, salt, and spermidine. Approximately 80% of the nti receptor was readily released from nuclei incubated with micrococcal nuclease, while only 40-50% of the wild type receptor was released under similar conditions. The wild type nuclei also contained a fraction of receptor (approximately 30%) which was resistant to extraction by NaCl and spermidine. This fraction was greatly diminished in the nti nuclei. Thus, a portion of the wild type receptors appears to be stabilized within the nuclei, possibly through a type of interaction which cannot be sustained by the nti receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1544413898,"The hemoglobin of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, forms aggregates larger than tetramers in two ways. The first, which results from intermolecular disulfide bonds, can be prevented by treatment with iodoacetamide. The second way results from the association of the deoxygenated forms of the two major components, B and C, to form reversibly an aggregate which is believed to be a trimer, BC2. The sedimentation velocity data show that the stoichiometry of the aggregate cannot be 1:1. The electrophoretic pattern of the deoxygenated B/C mixture suggests that the association is not indefinite. No significant aggregation of the separate deoxygenated tetramers of the components nor of the oxygenated components or mixture occurs. Gel chromatography of the oxygenated forms of components B and C and of mixtures indicates that the B and C tetramers both form dimers upon dilution with a dissociation constant of 2-3 micron. The oxygen-binding data indicate that the B/C aggregate has a much lower oxygen affinity than its constituent tetramers. Dissociation of the low affinity B/C aggregate to higher affinity B and C tetramers with increasing oxygenation gives rise to enhanced cooperativity as measured by the Hill coefficient which is maximal near 75-80% oxygenation and is as high as 4.1 at a heme concentration of 15 mM."

https://openalex.org/W1581780014,"Cell-specific differences occur in the primary structure of ferritin. For example, red cell and liver ferritin from bullfrog tadpoles differ by 1.5 times in serine content. To determine if cell-specific differences in ferritin primary structure are expressed in the tetraeicosomer, which thus might distinguish the proteins in a functional state, phosphorylation in vitro was employed as a probe using [gamma-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit from the cAMP-dependent protein kinase of bovine skeletal muscle. Subunits of both proteins in the tetraeicosomers were phosphorylated. Based on tryptic peptide maps, five regions common to both red cell and liver apoferritin were phosphorylated, as confirmed for two peptides by amino acid analyses. [32P]Apoferritin from red cells yielded an additional four 32P-fragments by mapping, at least three of which were unique by amino acid analysis and, in one case, might represent a 32P-Fe complex bound by a fragment of the iron-binding site. One peptide appeared to be unique to liver apoferritin. High concentrations of ATP yielded one additional peptide common to liver and red cell and one red cell-specific peptide in the tryptic peptide maps. The maximum moles of 32P/molecule were 13 +/- 4 and 6 +/- 2, respectively, for red cell and liver apoferritin, which corresponded within experimental error to the number of 32P-tryptic peptides. The level of phosphorylation was, on the average, not more than one site/subunit. Furthermore, above certain levels of phosphorylation, some subunits in the assemblage of 24 appeared to be unavailable as substrates, possibly because of charge repulsion or conformational changes. The possibility that post-translational modifications of ferritin which amplify cell-specific structural features occur in vivo with cytoplasmic components, e.g. protein kinases, is considered in terms of the physiological availability of iron from different iron storage cells and developmental changes in iron storage."

https://openalex.org/W1519734735,"Monoclonal B cell hybridoma cell lines express glycolipids characteristic of both the myeloma and normal lymphocyte parents. The neutral glycolipids from hybridoma cell lines metabolically radiolabeled with [14C]galactose plus [14C]glucosamine separate by high performance thin layer chromatography into patterns that may reflect differences in glycolipid expression among B cell subsets. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of oligosaccharides released by trifluoroacetolysis from neutral glycolipids extracted from 10(9) clonally expanded hybridoma cells reveals the carbohydrate composition of the major glycolipid components detected by thin layer chromatography. Glycolipids differentially expressed among six cell lines analyzed include monohexosylceramide, lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, globoside, asialo-GM2, and 2'fucosyllactosylceramide. The latter compound has not been described previously in cells from the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1522762601,"Recent studies of oxygen exchange have shown that there are two normal pathways for the hydrolysis of MgATP by myosin in the presence of actin, each producing Pi at the same rate. These two apparent pathways for actin-activated hydrolysis differ greatly in the extent of oxygen exchange they support. This is revealed by an analysis of the distribution of [18O]Pi species produced by the hydrolysis of [gamma-18O]ATP. We have extended these studies to certain abnormal substrates, using Mn2+ in place of Mg2+, and dATP or ITP in place of ATP. The results, together with past findings, lead to the proposal that the two heads of myosin are functionally different. One of these (Head 1) is able to reversibly cleave bound MgATP and thereby support oxygen exchange while it is free of actin; the other (Head 2) cannot cleave bound MgATP at its active site while free of actin. However, in the presence of actin, both Head 1 and Head 2 cleave bound MgATP, support some oxygen exchange, and produce Pi at the same rapid actin-activated rate. Apparently, MgATP is positioned differently on the two heads when they are free of actin, with Mg2+ and the 6-amino group of ATP playing an important role in the orientation. This proposed difference between the heads could serve to make Head 1 react first with the actin filament, followed by Head 2. Thus, in muscle, the two heads on a myosin cross-bridge would interact with an actin filament and exert their pull in a fixed sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1513786548,"Transferrin, the plasma iron transport protein, has two iron-binding sites but is usually only partly saturated. (Essentially all plasma iron is bound to transferrin.) Thus, changes in transferrin saturation reflect differences in the concentrations of plasma iron and/or transferrin. Developmental changes in red cell ferritin content coincide with a 2.5 times increase in plasma transferrin and a proportional decrease in saturation, in the bullfrog model system. The possible relationship of the degree of transferrin saturation and structure on the distribution of iron between heme and ferritin was examined in suspensions of reticulocytes, which synthesize both ferritin and heme. The extra transferrin in adult plasma was indistinguishable from transferrin in tadpole plasma in terms of the ability to donate iron to red cell heme and ferritin in vitro and in terms of surface charge (pI 6.55, 6.34), molecular weight (73,000), carbohydrate content (2%), amino acid composition, and immunological reactivity. Only the saturation in vivo appeared to differ. When the saturation of transferrin was manipulated in vitro, an effect on the relative distribution of iron between heme and ferritin was observed. The heme-synthesizing system consumed a disproportionately large amount of the delivered iron until it was saturated, a point which coincided with transferrin saturation; as the degree of transferrin saturation decreases, iron delivered to red cell iron stores (ferritin) decreases disproportionately. Thus, the developmental increase in plasma transferrin and consequent decrease in saturation minimize the amount of iron available for storage in red cells. The effect is further enhanced by the decreased ability of adult erythrocytes to incorporate iron from transferrin, a property which may be related to quantitative changes observed in iodination of a Mr = 168,000 membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1548671940,"Rat osteosarcoma cells respond to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with a 6- to 10-fold increase in the secretion of citric acid. The time required to attain a half-maximal response is 12 h, a time course which is consistent with the postulated steroidal hormone action of this vitamin D metabolite. The citrate response is achieved by physiological concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, with half of the maximal response at a vitamin concentration of 0.03 ng/ml. Both the time course and the dose dependence of the citrate response closely parallel the previously reported stimulation of bone Gla protein synthesis by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in these cells. Citrate and bone Gla protein bind avidly to bone mineral and are numerically the most abundant organic acid and protein in bone. The parallel secretion of both in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated osteoblastic cells suggests that they may act in tandem to mediate an action of this vitamin D metabolite on the mineral phase of bone."
