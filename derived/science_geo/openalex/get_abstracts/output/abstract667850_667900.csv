https://openalex.org/W3127556601,"Abstract Annotating the molecular basis of human disease remains an unsolved challenge, as 93% of disease loci are non-coding and gene-regulatory annotations are highly incomplete 1–3 . Here we present EpiMap, a compendium comprising 10,000 epigenomic maps across 800 samples, which we used to define chromatin states, high-resolution enhancers, enhancer modules, upstream regulators and downstream target genes. We used this resource to annotate 30,000 genetic loci that were associated with 540 traits 4 , predicting trait-relevant tissues, putative causal nucleotide variants in enriched tissue enhancers and candidate tissue-specific target genes for each. We partitioned multifactorial traits into tissue-specific contributing factors with distinct functional enrichments and disease comorbidity patterns, and revealed both single-factor monotropic and multifactor pleiotropic loci. Top-scoring loci frequently had multiple predicted driver variants, converging through multiple enhancers with a common target gene, multiple genes in common tissues, or multiple genes and multiple tissues, indicating extensive pleiotropy. Our results demonstrate the importance of dense, rich, high-resolution epigenomic annotations for the investigation of complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W3128627243,"Cas13a has been used to target RNA viruses in cell culture, but efficacy has not been demonstrated in animal models. In this study, we used messenger RNA (mRNA)-encoded Cas13a for mitigating influenza virus A and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in mice and hamsters, respectively. We designed CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) specific for PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 of influenza virus, and against the replicase and nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and selected the crRNAs that reduced viral RNA levels most efficiently in cell culture. We delivered polymer-formulated Cas13a mRNA and the validated guides to the respiratory tract using a nebulizer. In mice, Cas13a degraded influenza RNA in lung tissue efficiently when delivered after infection, whereas in hamsters, Cas13a delivery reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduced symptoms. Our findings suggest that Cas13a-mediated targeting of pathogenic viruses can mitigate respiratory infections. Cas13a delivered to the lung of mice and hamsters inhibits replication of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3127796635,"In the quest for post-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technologies, driven by the need for improved efficiency and performance, topologically protected ferromagnetic 'whirls' such as skyrmions1-8 and their anti-particles have shown great promise as solitonic information carriers in racetrack memory-in-logic or neuromorphic devices1,9-11. However, the presence of dipolar fields in ferromagnets, which restricts the formation of ultrasmall topological textures3,6,8,9,12, and the deleterious skyrmion Hall effect, when skyrmions are driven by spin torques9,10,12, have thus far inhibited their practical implementation. Antiferromagnetic analogues, which are predicted to demonstrate relativistic dynamics, fast deflection-free motion and size scaling, have recently become the subject of intense focus9,13-19, but they have yet to be experimentally demonstrated in natural antiferromagnetic systems. Here we realize a family of topological antiferromagnetic spin textures in α-Fe2O3-an Earth-abundant oxide insulator-capped with a platinum overlayer. By exploiting a first-order analogue of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism20,21, we stabilize exotic merons and antimerons (half-skyrmions)8 and their pairs (bimerons)16,22, which can be erased by magnetic fields and regenerated by temperature cycling. These structures have characteristic sizes of the order of 100 nanometres and can be chemically controlled via precise tuning of the exchange and anisotropy, with pathways through which further scaling may be achieved. Driven by current-based spin torques from the heavy-metal overlayer, some of these antiferromagnetic textures could emerge as prime candidates for low-energy antiferromagnetic spintronics at room temperature1,9-11,23."
https://openalex.org/W3126839734,"Tissue damage increases the risk of cancer through poorly understood mechanisms1. In mouse models of pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis associated with tissue injury collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to markedly accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and, ultimately, adenocarcinoma2,3. Here, by integrating genomics, single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous mouse models, we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a unique chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is selected for throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges within 48 hours of pancreatic injury, and involves an ‘acinar-to-neoplasia’ chromatin switch that contributes to the early dysregulation of genes that define human pancreatic cancer. Among the factors that are most rapidly activated after tissue damage in the pre-malignant pancreatic epithelium is the alarmin cytokine interleukin 33, which recapitulates the effects of injury in cooperating with mutant Kras to unleash the epigenetic remodelling program of early neoplasia and neoplastic transformation. Collectively, our study demonstrates how gene–environment interactions can rapidly produce gene-regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment, and provides a molecular framework for understanding the interplay between genetic and environmental cues in the initiation of cancer. In mouse models of pancreatic cancer, a cooperative interaction between tissue damage and Kras gene mutation rapidly induces cancer-associated chromatin states in pre-malignant tissue, leading to gene dysregulation and neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3126563441,"Tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) help sustain barrier function and respond to local signals. ILCs are traditionally classified as ILC1, ILC2 or ILC3 on the basis of their expression of specific transcription factors and cytokines1. In the skin, disease-specific production of ILC3-associated cytokines interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 in response to IL-23 signalling contributes to dermal inflammation in psoriasis. However, it is not known whether this response is initiated by pre-committed ILCs or by cell-state transitions. Here we show that the induction of psoriasis in mice by IL-23 or imiquimod reconfigures a spectrum of skin ILCs, which converge on a pathogenic ILC3-like state. Tissue-resident ILCs were necessary and sufficient, in the absence of circulatory ILCs, to drive pathology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles of skin ILCs along a time course of psoriatic inflammation formed a dense transcriptional continuum-even at steady state-reflecting fluid ILC states, including a naive or quiescent-like state and an ILC2 effector state. Upon disease induction, the continuum shifted rapidly to span a mixed, ILC3-like subset also expressing cytokines characteristic of ILC2s, which we inferred as arising through multiple trajectories. We confirmed the transition potential of quiescent-like and ILC2 states using in vitro experiments, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) and in vivo fate mapping. Our results highlight the range and flexibility of skin ILC responses, suggesting that immune activities primed in healthy tissues dynamically adapt to provocations and, left unchecked, drive pathological remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W3129120649,"E3 ligases are typically classified by hallmark domains such as RING and RBR, which are thought to specify unique catalytic mechanisms of ubiquitin transfer to recruited substrates1,2. However, rather than functioning individually, many neddylated cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) and RBR-type E3 ligases in the ARIH family-which together account for nearly half of all ubiquitin ligases in humans-form E3-E3 super-assemblies3-7. Here, by studying CRLs in the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) family, we show how neddylated SCF ligases and ARIH1 (an RBR-type E3 ligase) co-evolved to ubiquitylate diverse substrates presented on various F-box proteins. We developed activity-based chemical probes that enabled cryo-electron microscopy visualization of steps in E3-E3 ubiquitylation, initiating with ubiquitin linked to the E2 enzyme UBE2L3, then transferred to the catalytic cysteine of ARIH1, and culminating in ubiquitin linkage to a substrate bound to the SCF E3 ligase. The E3-E3 mechanism places the ubiquitin-linked active site of ARIH1 adjacent to substrates bound to F-box proteins (for example, substrates with folded structures or limited length) that are incompatible with previously described conventional RING E3-only mechanisms. The versatile E3-E3 super-assembly may therefore underlie widespread ubiquitylation."
https://openalex.org/W3128948688,"Active matter consists of units that generate mechanical work by consuming energy. Examples include living systems, such as assemblies of bacteria and biological tissues, biopolymers driven by molecular motors, and suspensions of synthetic self-propelled particles. A central question in the field is to understand and control the self-organization of active assemblies in space and time. Most active systems exhibit either spatial order mediated by interactions that coordinate the spatial structure and the motion of active agents or the temporal synchronization of individual oscillatory dynamics. The simultaneous control of spatial and temporal organization is more challenging and generally requires complex interactions, such as reaction-diffusion hierarchies or genetically engineered cellular circuits. Here, we report a novel and simple means to simultaneously control the spatial and temporal self-organization of bacterial active matter. By confining an active bacterial suspension and manipulating a single macroscopic parameter, namely the viscoelasticity of the suspending fluid, we have found that the bacterial fluid first self-organizes in space into a millimeter-scale rotating vortex; then displays temporal organization as the giant vortex switches its global chirality periodically with tunable frequency, reminiscent of a torsional pendulum - a self-driven one. Combining experiments with an active matter model, we explain this striking behavior in terms of the interplay between active forcing and viscoelastic stress relaxation. Our findings advance the understanding of bacterial behavior in complex fluids, and demonstrate experimentally for the first time that rheological properties can be harnessed to control active matter flows. Coupled with actuation, our tunable self-oscillating bacterial vortex may be used as a ""clock"" for locomotion of soft robots and microfluidic pumping."
https://openalex.org/W3128609655,"Amplification of chromosomal region 8p11-12 is a common genetic alteration that has been implicated in the aetiology of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)1-3. The FGFR1 gene is the main candidate driver of tumorigenesis within this region4. However, clinical trials evaluating FGFR1 inhibition as a targeted therapy have been unsuccessful5. Here we identify the histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyltransferase NSD3, the gene for which is located in the 8p11-12 amplicon, as a key regulator of LUSC tumorigenesis. In contrast to other 8p11-12 candidate LUSC drivers, increased expression of NSD3 correlated strongly with its gene amplification. Ablation of NSD3, but not of FGFR1, attenuated tumour growth and extended survival in a mouse model of LUSC. We identify an LUSC-associated variant NSD3(T1232A) that shows increased catalytic activity for dimethylation of H3K36 (H3K36me2) in vitro and in vivo. Structural dynamic analyses revealed that the T1232A substitution elicited localized mobility changes throughout the catalytic domain of NSD3 to relieve auto-inhibition and to increase accessibility of the H3 substrate. Expression of NSD3(T1232A) in vivo accelerated tumorigenesis and decreased overall survival in mouse models of LUSC. Pathological generation of H3K36me2 by NSD3(T1232A) reprograms the chromatin landscape to promote oncogenic gene expression signatures. Furthermore, NSD3, in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity, promoted transformation in human tracheobronchial cells and growth of xenografted human LUSC cell lines with amplification of 8p11-12. Depletion of NSD3 in patient-derived xenografts from primary LUSCs containing NSD3 amplification or the NSD3(T1232A)-encoding variant attenuated neoplastic growth in mice. Finally, NSD3-regulated LUSC-derived xenografts were hypersensitive to bromodomain inhibition. Thus, our work identifies NSD3 as a principal 8p11-12 amplicon-associated oncogenic driver in LUSC, and suggests that NSD3-dependency renders LUSC therapeutically vulnerable to bromodomain inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W3128201067,"Purpose The goal of this study is to construct a mortality prediction model using the XGBoot (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) decision tree model for AKI (acute kidney injury) patients in the ICU (intensive care unit), and to compare its performance with that of three other machine learning models. Methods We used the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for model development and performance comparison. The prediction performance of the XGBoot model was compared with the other three machine learning models. These models included LR (logistic regression), SVM (support vector machines), and RF (random forest). In the model comparison, the AUROC (area under receiver operating curve), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. Results A total of 7548 AKI patients were analyzed in this study. The overall in-hospital mortality of AKI patients was 16.35%. The best performing algorithm in this study was XGBoost with the highest AUROC (0.796, p &lt; 0.01), F1(0.922, p &lt; 0.01) and accuracy (0.860). The precision (0.860) and recall (0.994) of the XGBoost model rank second among the four models. Conclusion XGBoot model had obvious advantages of performance compared to the other machine learning models. This will be helpful for risk identification and early intervention for AKI patients at risk of death."
https://openalex.org/W3128307568,"The germinal centre is a dynamic microenvironment in which B cells that express high-affinity antibody variants produced by somatic hypermutation are selected for clonal expansion by limiting the numbers of T follicular helper cells1,2. Although much is known about the mechanisms that control the selection of B cells in the germinal centre, far less is understood about the clonal behaviour of the T follicular helper cells that help to regulate this process. Here we report on the dynamic behaviour of T follicular helper cell clones during the germinal centre reaction. We find that, similar to germinal centre B cells, T follicular helper cells undergo antigen-dependent selection throughout the germinal centre reaction that results in differential proliferative expansion and contraction. Increasing the amount of antigen presented in the germinal centre leads to increased division of T follicular helper cells. Competition between T follicular helper cell clones is mediated by the affinity of T cell receptors for peptide-major-histocompatibility-complex ligands. T cells that preferentially expand in the germinal centre show increased expression of genes downstream of the T cell receptor, such as those required for metabolic reprogramming, cell division and cytokine production. These dynamic changes lead to marked remodelling of the functional T follicular helper cell repertoire during the germinal centre reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3126378075,"Introduction In low-and middle-income countries, pregnancy-related complications are major causes of death for young women. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of first adolescent pregnancy and its associated factors in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We undertook a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 32 sub-Saharan African countries between 2010 and 2018. We calculated the prevalence of first adolescent (aged 15 to 19 years) pregnancy in each country and examined associations between individual and contextual level factors and first adolescent pregnancy. Results Among all adolescents, Congo experienced the highest prevalence of first adolescent pregnancy (44.3%) and Rwanda the lowest (7.2%). However, among adolescents who had ever had sex, the prevalence ranged from 36.5% in Rwanda to 75.6% in Chad. The odds of first adolescent pregnancy was higher with increasing age, working, being married/cohabiting, having primary education only, early sexual initiation, knowledge of contraceptives, no unmet need for contraception and poorest wealth quintile. By contrast, adolescents who lived in rural areas and in the West African sub-region had lower odds of first adolescent pregnancy. Conclusion The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in sub-Saharan African countries is high. Understanding the predictors of first adolescent pregnancy can facilitate the development of effective social policies such as family planning and comprehensive sex and relationship education in sub-Saharan Africa and can help ensure healthy lives and promotion of well-being for adolescents and their families and communities."
https://openalex.org/W3127764293,"Strong connections exist between R-loops (three-stranded structures harbouring an RNA:DNA hybrid and a displaced single-strand DNA), genome instability and human disease1-5. Indeed, R-loops are favoured in relevant genomic regions as regulators of certain physiological processes through which homeostasis is typically maintained. For example, transcription termination pause sites regulated by R-loops can induce the synthesis of antisense transcripts that enable the formation of local, RNA interference (RNAi)-driven heterochromation6. Pause sites are also protected against endogenous single-stranded DNA breaks by BRCA17. Hypotheses about how DNA repair is enacted at pause sites include a role for RNA, which is emerging as a normal, albeit unexplained, regulator of genome integrity8. Here we report that a species of single-stranded, DNA-damage-associated small RNA (sdRNA) is generated by a BRCA1-RNAi protein complex. sdRNAs promote DNA repair driven by the PALB2-RAD52 complex at transcriptional termination pause sites that form R-loops and are rich in single-stranded DNA breaks. sdRNA repair operates in both quiescent (G0) and proliferating cells. Thus, sdRNA repair can occur in intact tissue and/or stem cells, and may contribute to tumour suppression mediated by BRCA1."
https://openalex.org/W3128093294,"Heat stress is an important abiotic factor that limits wheat production globally, including south-east Asia. The importance of micro (mi) RNAs in gene expression under various biotic and abiotic stresses is well documented. Molecular markers, specifically simple sequence repeats (SSRs), play an important role in the wheat improvement breeding programs. Given the role of miRNAs in heat stress-induced transcriptional regulation and acclimatization, the development of miRNA-derived SSRs would prove useful in studying the allelic diversity at the heat-responsive miRNA-genes in wheat. In the present study, efforts have been made to identify SSRs from 96 wheat heat-responsive miRNA-genes and their characterization using a panel of wheat genotypes with contrasting reactions (tolerance/susceptible) to heat stress. A set of 13 miRNA-derived SSR markers were successfully developed as an outcome. These miRNA-SSRs are located on 11 different common wheat chromosomes (2A, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4D, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6A, 6D, and 7A). Among 13 miRNA-SSRs, seven were polymorphic on a set of 37 selected wheat genotypes. Within these polymorphic SSRs, three makers, namely HT-169j, HT-160a, and HT-160b, were found promising as they could discriminate heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible genotypes. This is the first report of miRNA-SSR development in wheat and their deployment in genetic diversity and population structure studies and characterization of trait-specific germplasm. The study suggests that this new class of molecular makers has great potential in the marker-assisted breeding (MAB) programs targeted at improving heat tolerance and other adaptability or developmental traits in wheat and other crops."
https://openalex.org/W3126862140,"Fundamental mathematical constants like $e$ and $\pi$ are ubiquitous in diverse fields of science, from abstract mathematics to physics, biology and chemistry. For centuries, new formulas relating fundamental constants have been scarce and usually discovered sporadically. Here we propose a novel and systematic approach that leverages algorithms for deriving mathematical formulas for fundamental constants and help reveal their underlying structure. Our algorithms find dozens of well-known as well as previously unknown continued fraction representations of $\pi$, $e$, Catalan's constant, and values of the Riemann zeta function. Two example conjectures found by our algorithm and so far unproven are: \begin{equation*} \frac{24}{\pi^2} = 2 + 7\cdot 0\cdot 1+ \frac{8\cdot1^4}{2 + 7\cdot 1\cdot 2 + \frac{8\cdot2^4}{2 + 7\cdot 2\cdot 3 + \frac{8\cdot3^4}{2 + 7\cdot 3\cdot 4 + \frac{8\cdot4^4}{..}}}} \quad\quad,\quad\quad \frac{8}{7 \zeta(3)} = 1\cdot 1 - \frac{1^6}{3\cdot 7 - \frac{2^6}{5\cdot 19 - \frac{3^6}{7\cdot 37 - \frac{4^6}{..}}}} \end{equation*} We present two algorithms that proved useful in finding conjectures: a Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM) algorithm and a Gradient Descent (GD) tailored to the recurrent structure of continued fractions. Both algorithms are based on matching numerical values and thus they conjecture formulas without providing proofs and without requiring prior knowledge on any underlying mathematical structure. This approach is especially attractive for constants for which no mathematical structure is known, as it reverses the conventional approach of sequential logic in formal proofs. Instead, our work supports a different approach for research: algorithms utilizing numerical data to unveil mathematical structures, thus trying to play the role of intuition of great mathematicians of the past, providing leads to new mathematical research."
https://openalex.org/W3127469982,"The transplutonium elements (atomic numbers 95–103) are a group of metals that lie at the edge of the periodic table. As a result, the patterns and trends used to predict and control the physics and chemistry for transition metals, main-group elements and lanthanides are less applicable to transplutonium elements. Furthermore, understanding the properties of these heavy elements has been restricted by their scarcity and radioactivity. This is especially true for einsteinium (Es), the heaviest element on the periodic table that can currently be generated in quantities sufficient to enable classical macroscale studies1. Here we characterize a coordination complex of einsteinium, using less than 200 nanograms of 254Es (with half-life of 275.7(5) days), with an organic hydroxypyridinone-based chelating ligand. X-ray absorption spectroscopic and structural studies are used to determine the energy of the L3-edge and a bond distance of einsteinium. Photophysical measurements show antenna sensitization of EsIII luminescence; they also reveal a hypsochromic shift on metal complexation, which had not previously been observed in lower-atomic-number actinide elements. These findings are indicative of an intermediate spin–orbit coupling scheme in which j–j coupling (whereby single-electron orbital angular momentum and spin are first coupled to form a total angular momentum, j) prevails over Russell–Saunders coupling. Together with previous actinide complexation studies2, our results highlight the need to continue studying the unusual behaviour of the actinide elements, especially those that are scarce and short-lived. An einsteinium coordination complex is synthesized and spectroscopically characterized using less than 200 nanograms of einsteinium, enabling examination of its structure and measurement of an einsteinium bond distance."
https://openalex.org/W3127917384,"Treatment of respiratory viral infections remains a global health concern, mainly due to the inefficacy of available drugs. Therefore, the discovery of novel antiviral compounds is needed; in this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like temporins hold great promise. Here, we discovered that the harmless temporin G (TG) significantly inhibited the early life-cycle phases of influenza virus. The in vitro hemagglutinating test revealed the existence of TG interaction with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Furthermore, the hemolysis inhibition assay and the molecular docking studies confirmed a TG/HA complex formation at the level of the conserved hydrophobic stem groove of HA. Remarkably, these findings highlight the ability of TG to block the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit, which are essential for the viral envelope fusion with intracellular endocytic vesicles, thereby neutralizing the virus entry into the host cell. In comparison, in the case of parainfluenza virus, which penetrates host cells upon a membrane-fusion process, addition of TG to infected cells provoked ~1.2 log reduction of viral titer released in the supernatant. Nevertheless, at the same condition, an immunofluorescent assay showed that the expression of viral hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein was not significantly reduced. This suggested a peptide-mediated block of some late steps of viral replication and therefore the impairment of the extracellular release of viral particles. Overall, our results are the first demonstration of the ability of an AMP to interfere with the replication of respiratory viruses with a different mechanism of cell entry and will open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against a large variety of respiratory viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2."
https://openalex.org/W3129162474,"Background Mean kurtosis (MK), one of the parameters derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), has shown increased sensitivity to tissue microstructure damage in several neurological disorders. Methods Thirty-seven patients with relapsing-remitting MS and eleven healthy controls (HC) received brain imaging on a 3T MR scanner, including a fast DKI sequence. MK and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured in the white matter of HC, normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of MS patients, contrast-enhancing lesions (CE-L), FLAIR lesions (FLAIR-L) and black holes (BH). Results Overall 1529 lesions were analyzed, including 30 CE-L, 832 FLAIR-L and 667 BH. Highest MK values were obtained in the white matter of HC (0.814 ± 0.129), followed by NAWM (0.724 ± 0.137), CE-L (0.619 ± 0.096), FLAIR-L (0.565 ± 0.123) and BH (0.549 ± 0.12). Lowest MD values were obtained in the white matter of HC (0.747 ± 0.068 10 −3 mm 2 /sec), followed by NAWM (0.808 ± 0.163 10 −3 mm 2 /sec), CE-L (0.853 ± 0.211 10 −3 mm 2 /sec), BH (0.957 ± 0.304 10 −3 mm 2 /sec) and FLAIR-L (0.976 ± 0.35 10 −3 mm 2 /sec). While MK differed significantly between CE-L and non-enhancing lesions, MD did not. Conclusion MK adds predictive value to differentiate between MS lesions and might provide further information about diffuse white matter injury and lesion microstructure."
https://openalex.org/W3127492930,"Introduction Patient safety culture is defined as the attitudes, perceptions, and values that staffs share within an organization related to patient safety. The safety of health care is now a major global concern. It is likely that millions of people suffer disabling injuries or death directly related to medical care. Particularly in developing and transitional countries, patient harm is a global public health problem. The objective of the study is to assess patient safety culture and associated factors among health care professionals working in public hospitals in Dessie town, North East Ethiopia, 2019. Methods Facility based quantitative study was employed from March 15 –April 30, 2019 in public hospitals in Dessie town. Four hundred and twenty two health care professionals were recruited to complete a structured pretested self-administered questionnaire. The data was cleaned, coded and entered in to Epi Info-7 and exported to SPSS version 20. Data was further analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Variables with P value of less than 0.05 in multivariate analysis were declared as statistically significant at 95% CI. Results Of the 422 recruited a total of 411 participants completed the survey with a response rate of 97.4%. Close to half (184(44.8%)) of the participants indicated good patient safety culture. Good patient safety culture was positively associated with working in primary hospital (AOR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.56, 4.21). On the other hand, good patient safety culture was negatively associated with health professional’s age between 25–34 year (AOR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08–0.74) and working in Pediatrics ward (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.17–0.9) and in emergency ward (AOR = O.25, 95%CI = 0.09–0.67). Conclusion The overall level of patient safety culture was under 50%. Good patient safety culture had positive association with working in primary hospital and negative association with professionals’ age between 25–29 year, 30–34 year and working in pediatrics and emergency ward. Implementing actions that support all dimensions of safety culture should be promoted at all levels of hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3128962351,"Actinobacteria produce numerous antibiotics and other specialized metabolites that have important applications in medicine and agriculture1. Diffusible hormones frequently control the production of such metabolites by binding TetR family transcriptional repressors (TFTRs), but the molecular basis for this remains unclear2. The production of methylenomycin antibiotics in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is initiated by the binding of 2-alkyl-4-hydroxymethylfuran-3-carboxylic acid (AHFCA) hormones to the TFTR MmfR3. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of an MmfR-AHFCA complex, establishing the structural basis for hormone recognition. We also elucidate the mechanism for DNA release upon hormone binding through the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of an MmfR-operator complex. DNA binding and release assays with MmfR mutants and synthetic AHFCA analogues define the role of individual amino acid residues and hormone functional groups in ligand recognition and DNA release. These findings will facilitate the exploitation of actinobacterial hormones and their associated TFTRs in synthetic biology and in the discovery of new antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3126518540,"Aphid feeding behavior and performance on a given host plant are influenced by the plants' physical and chemical traits, including structural characters such as trichomes and nutritional composition. In this study, we determined the feeding behavior and performance of soybean aphids (Aphis glycines) on the stem, the adaxial (upper), and the abaxial (lower) leaf surfaces during early vegetative growth of soybean plants. Using the electrical penetration graph technique, we found that aphids feeding on the stem took the longest time to begin probing. Once aphids began probing, the sieve elements were more conducive to feeding, as evidenced by less salivation on the stem than either leaf surface. In whole-plant assays, stems harbored higher aphid populations, and aphids had shorter development time on stems than the adaxial and the abaxial leaf surfaces. We compared trichome density and length on the stem, the adaxial, and the abaxial leaf surfaces to investigate whether plant trichomes affected aphid feeding and performance. There were higher density and longer trichomes on stems, which likely resulted in aphids taking a longer time to probe. Still a negative impact on aphid population growth was not observed. Analysis of phloem sap composition revealed that vascular sap-enriched exudates from stems had higher sugars and amino acids than exudates from leaves. In artificial diet feeding assays, the population of aphids reared on a diet supplemented with stem exudates was higher than on a diet supplemented with leaf petiole exudates which is in agreement with results of the whole-plant assays. In summary, our findings suggest that the performance of soybean aphids on a specific plant location is primarily driven by accessibility and the quality of phloem composition rather than structural traits."
https://openalex.org/W3128598448,"The international trade is one of the classic areas of study in economics. Nowadays, given the availability of data, the tools used for the analysis can be complemented and enriched with new methodologies and techniques that go beyond the traditional approach. The present paper shows the application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Models, a well known technique from the area of Natural Language Processing, to search for latent dimensions in the product space of international trade, and their distribution across countries over time. We apply this technique to a dataset of countries' exports of goods from 1962 to 2016. The findings show the possibility to generate higher level classifications of goods based on the empirical evidence, and also allow to study the distribution of those classifications within countries. The latter show interesting insights about countries' trade specialisation."
https://openalex.org/W3126170109,"We present elPrep 5, which updates the elPrep framework for processing sequencing alignment/map files with variant calling. elPrep 5 can now execute the full pipeline described by the GATK Best Practices for variant calling, which consists of PCR and optical duplicate marking, sorting by coordinate order, base quality score recalibration, and variant calling using the haplotype caller algorithm. elPrep 5 produces identical BAM and VCF output as GATK4 while significantly reducing the runtime by parallelizing and merging the execution of the pipeline steps. Our benchmarks show that elPrep 5 speeds up the runtime of the variant calling pipeline by a factor 8-16x on both whole-exome and whole-genome data while using the same hardware resources as GATK4. This makes elPrep 5 a suitable drop-in replacement for GATK4 when faster execution times are needed."

This rise in risk behavior associated with the advent of PrEP is known as “risk compensation.” The aim of this study is to measure clinical and behavioral changes associated with the introduction of PrEP by analyzing condom use for anal intercourse, number of sexual partners, sexualized drug use and STI incidence. Methods We performed a retrospective descriptive study of PrEP users followed every 3months over a 2-year period spanning 2017–2019 in a referral clinic specializing in STI/HIV in Madrid, Spain. One hundred ten men who have sex with men and transgender women underwent regular screening for STIs and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral data were gathered for all subjects studied. Results The risk compensation observed in this study consisted primarily of a lower rate of condom use, while the number of sexual partners and recreational drug consumption remained stable. We observed a very high incidence of STIs in this sample, particularly rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia. The factors shown to be independently associated with the presence of an STI on multivariate analysis were age below 30 years and over 10 sexual partners/month. Conclusion The incidence of STI acquisition was higher than expected, indicating a need for strategies to minimize this impact, particularly among younger individuals with a higher number of sexual partners."
https://openalex.org/W3127859040,"The assessment of human spatial short-term memory has mainly been performed using visual stimuli and less frequently using auditory stimuli. This paper presents a framework for the development of SLAM-based Augmented Reality applications for the assessment of spatial memory. An AR mobile application was developed for this type of assessment involving visual and tactile stimuli by using our framework. The task to be carried out with the AR application is divided into two phases: 1) a learning phase, in which participants physically walk around a room and have to remember the location of simple geometrical shapes; and 2) an evaluation phase, in which the participants are asked to recall the location of the shapes. A study for comparing the performance outcomes using visual and tactile stimuli was carried out. Fifty-three participants performed the task using the two conditions (Tactile vs Visual), but with more than two months of difference (within-subject design). The number of shapes placed correctly was similar for both conditions. However, the group that used the tactile stimulus spent significantly more time completing the task and required significantly more attempts. The performance outcomes were independent of gender. Some significant correlations among variables related to the performance outcomes and other tests were found. The following significant correlations among variables related to the performance outcomes using visual stimuli and the participants’ subjective variables were also found: 1) the greater the number of correctly placed shapes, the greater the perceived competence; 2) the more attempts required, the less the perceived competence. We also found that perceived enjoyment was higher when a higher sense of presence was induced. Our results suggest that tactile stimuli are valid stimuli to exploit for the assessment of the ability to memorize spatial-tactile associations, but that the ability to memorize spatial-visual associations is dominant. Our results also show that gender does not affect these types of memory tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3126345144,"Both the intake of beneficial olive oil and of harmful trans-fatty acids (TFAs) in consumed foods are of great significance in tumor biology. In our present study we examined the effects they exert on the expression patterns of miR-134, miR-132, miR-124-1, miR-9-3 and mTOR in the liver, spleen and kidney of mice treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA). Feeding of TFA-containing diet significantly increased the expression of all studied miRs and mTORC1 in all organs examined, except the expression of mTORC1 in the spleen and kidney. Diet containing olive oil significantly reduced the expression of miR-124-1, miR-9-3 and mTORC1 in the liver and spleen. In the kidney, apart from the mTORC1 gene, the expression of all miRs examined significantly decreased compared to the DMBA control. According to our results, the cell membrane protective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of olive oil and the cell membrane damaging, inflammatory, and carcinogenic properties of TFA suggest negative feedback regulatory mechanisms. In contrast to our expectations, mTORC1 gene expression in the kidney has not been shown to be an appropriate biomarker–presumably, because the many complex effects that regulate mTOR expression may quench each other."
https://openalex.org/W3127871046,"Cancer cell lines are widely used in basic research to study cancer development, growth, invasion, or metastasis. They are also used for the development and screening of anticancer drugs. However, there are no clear criteria for choosing the most suitable cell lines among the wide variety of cancer cell lines commercially available for research, and the choice is often based on previously published reports. Here, we investigated the characteristics of liver cancer cell lines by analyzing the gene expression data available in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Unsupervised clustering analysis of 28 liver cancer cell lines yielded two main clusters. One cluster showed a gene expression pattern similar to that of hepatocytes, and the other showed a pattern similar to that of fibroblasts. Analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma gene expression profiles available in The Cancer Genome Atlas showed that the gene expression patterns in most hepatoma tissues were similar to those in the hepatocyte-like cluster. With respect to liver cancer research, our findings may be useful for selecting an appropriate cell line for a specific study objective. Furthermore, our approach of utilizing a public database for comparing the properties of cell lines could be an attractive cell line selection strategy that can be applied to other fields of research."
https://openalex.org/W3129098438,"Objective This study evaluated the influence of family meal frequency on the occurrence of common mental disorders (CMD) in children and adolescents over eight months of follow-up. Design Data from this longitudinal study were derived from the PAAPAS— Parents , Students , Community Health Agents , and Teachers for Healthy Eating— community trial. CMD were evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire. Frequency of family meals (breakfast and dinner) was categorized as “breakfast and dinner regularly with the family”, “at least breakfast or dinner regularly with the family”, and “does not have any meal regularly with the family.” The effect of family meal frequency on CMD was analyzed using generalized estimation equations with log-binomial models for repeated measures. Setting This study was conducted in public schools ( N = 18) of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. Participants Children (aged 9–11 years) and adolescents (aged 12–17 years) from the fifth and sixth grades ( N = 2,743). Results These findings suggested that regular family meals were a protective factor for mental health. The adjusted relative risk of CMD was 0.75 (95% confidence interval = 0.69–0.83) for those who had two family meals regularly and 0.87 (95% confidence interval = 0.77–0.97) for those who had only one regular family meal, compared to students who had no regular family meals. Conclusions Potential strategies that educate and encourage families about the mental health benefits of eating regular meals together must be explored and implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3126501141,"The rate of glucose uptake dramatically increases in cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen and fully functioning mitochondria. Cancer cells produce ATP by glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation under aerobic conditions, a process termed as the “Warburg effect.” In the present study, we treated canine melanoma cells with the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and investigated its effect on cell growth. 2-DG attenuated cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell growth was also inhibited following treatment with the glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor WZB-117. The treatment of 2-DG and WZB-117 attenuated the glucose consumption, lactate secretion and glucose uptake of the cells. The mRNA expression of the subtypes of GLUT was examined and GLUT1 and GLUT3 were found to be expressed in melanoma cells. The growth, glucose consumption and lactate secretion of melanoma cells transfected with siRNAs of specific for GLUT1 and GLUT3 was suppressed. These findings suggest that glucose uptake via GLUT1 and GLUT3 plays a crucial role for the growth of canine melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W3127270742,"Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are causing high morbidity and mortality for humans. Urban livestock keeping is still common in cities around the world. The animals may serve as reservoirs for zoonotic MBDs, which increase the risks for humans. Here we assess the knowledge and practices related to MBDs in households with livestock and without livestock and explore the perceptions of the health care sector about MBDs and livestock keeping in Hanoi city of Vietnam in a cross-sectional study. A quantitative survey was conducted including 513 households with and without livestock-keeping in six districts and complemented with qualitative surveys with four health staff from Hanoi Center of Disease Control and three district health centers. The quantitative survey indicated that the participants possessed basic knowledge on MBDs with an average score of 18.3 out of 35, of which non-livestock-keeping households had a better knowledge than households keeping livestock (p&lt;0.05). Both household categories had low score, 3.5 out of 11, regarding preventive practices against MBDs. The negative binomial model showed that occupation and location of living were factors associated to the knowledge on MBDs. Farmers were likely to have better preventive practices as compared to office workers (p&lt;0.05). Those who had better knowledge also had more adequate preventive practices against MBDs (p&lt;0.001). The qualitative survey revealed that livestock keeping was determined as increasing risks of MBDs due to the increase of mosquito population. It is recommended that community campaigns to raise the awareness and change behavior on MBDs should be organized based on collaboration between the health sector and the veterinary sector for households with and without livestock living in central urban and peri-urban areas. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between urban livestock keeping and potential increasing risks of MBDs such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis."
https://openalex.org/W3127833336,"Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ). It was originally a Latin American endemic health problem, but now is expanding worldwide as a result of increasing migration. The currently available drugs for Chagas disease, benznidazole and nifurtimox, provoke severe adverse effects, and thus the development of new drugs is urgently required. Ubiquinone (UQ) is essential for respiratory chain and redox balance in trypanosomatid protozoans, therefore we aimed to provide evidence that inhibitors of the UQ biosynthesis have trypanocidal activities. In this study, inhibitors of the human COQ7, a key enzyme of the UQ synthesis, were tested for their trypanocidal activities because they were expected to cross-react and inhibit trypanosomal COQ7 due to their genetic homology. We show the trypanocidal activity of a newly found human COQ7 inhibitor, an oxazinoquinoline derivative. The structurally similar compounds were selected from the commercially available compounds by 2D and 3D ligand-based similarity searches. Among 38 compounds selected, 12 compounds with the oxazinoquinoline structure inhibited significantly the growth of epimastigotes of T . cruzi . The most effective 3 compounds also showed the significant antitrypanosomal activity against the mammalian stage of T . cruzi at lower concentrations than benznidazole, a commonly used drug today. We found that epimastigotes treated with the inhibitor contained reduced levels of UQ 9 . Further, the growth of epimastigotes treated with the inhibitors was partially rescued by UQ 10 supplementation to the culture medium. These results suggest that the antitrypanosomal mechanism of the oxazinoquinoline derivatives results from inhibition of the trypanosomal UQ synthesis leading to a shortage of the UQ pool. Our data indicate that the UQ synthesis pathway of T . cruzi is a promising drug target for Chagas disease."
https://openalex.org/W3128260359,"Interest has been growing in regard to increasing the public health workforce and standardizing training to ensure there are competent professionals to support rebuilding and reinforcing the public health infrastructure of the United States. The need for public health leaders was recognized as early as the hookworm control campaign during 1909–1914 when it became apparent that prevention of disease should be distinct from clinical medicine and should be conducted by professionally trained, dedicated full-time public health practitioners. In recent years, research on the public health workforce and on standardizing health workforce education has significantly expanded. A key element of such a workforce is public health leadership, and DrPH programs are the means to provide effective public health education for these future health professionals. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the general trend of DrPH programs from past to present and analyze the common themes and variations of 28 Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH)-accredited DrPH programs in the United States. This research utilized a mixed-methods approach, investigating DrPH education at each school or program to improve our understanding of the current status of DrPH programs."
https://openalex.org/W3128600299,"Rapid modernization in China has impacted the daily lives and health of women, including a rise in obesity. However, little is known about the impact of menopausal status, behavior, and psychosocial factors on the risk of obesity for rural women in China. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors, including demographic information (education, family history of T2DM, menopausal status), obesity-related behavior, and psychosocial factors associated with overweight/general obesity and abdominal obesity. In a cross-sectional study design, participants had their weight, height, and waist circumference measured and completed questionnaires regarding family demographics, obesity-related health behaviors (physical activity, diet, sleep), and psychosocial information (stress, social support, and self-efficacy related to physical activity and healthy diet). A total of 646 women were included in this study; 46.6% were overweight/generally obese, and 48% had abdominal obesity. Postmenopausal women had a higher prevalence of general and central obesity. Regular physical activity decreased the risk for overweight/general obesity and abdominal obesity (OR = .41 and .31, respectively, p = .04) in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women who had not breastfed their infants and reported moderate/high-stress had a higher risk for overweight/general obesity (OR = 3.93, and 2, respectively) and those who reported less than 6 hours of sleep per day increased their risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 2.08). Different factors associated with obesity were found in Chinese women, depending on menopausal status. Future studies should examine the impact of menopause on a woman’s risk for obesity, as well as develop tailored interventions to improve health, well-being and reduce the risk of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3126999157,"Purpose Stuttering is a multifactorial speech disorder with significant social and psychological consequences. There is a lack of knowledge about public attitudes towards people who stutter (PWS) and the factors that can determine such attitudes in underprivileged communities. This study aimed to assess the public attitudes in South Egypt towards PWS and compare our results with those stored in a reference database representing 180 different samples. Methods A multi-stage random sampling approach was used to recruit 650 people from Beni-Suef City in South Egypt. All participants were interviewed using the Arabic version of the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) after getting their informed consent. This instrument assesses people’s Beliefs and Self Reactions towards PWS in addition to their sociodemographic characteristics. Results The Beliefs and Self Reactions subscores in addition to the Overall Stuttering Score of the Egyptian sample were remarkably lower than the median values of the reference database (12 versus 34), (-4 versus 2), and (4 versus 18), respectively. TV, radio, and films were the main sources of knowledge about stuttering. Egyptian participants who reported average to high income were more likely to have a positive attitude (≥50% of Overall Stuttering Score) towards PWS than their counterparts with low income (Odds Ratio = 1.57, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.08–2.28). Conclusion People in South Egypt showed a less positive attitude towards PWS compared with other populations worldwide. Further studies should focus on changing the public attitudes towards PWS through awareness programs that consider the cultural perspectives of the society."
https://openalex.org/W3128426436,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate hypersensitivity reactions to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs. Methods We retrospectively compared the clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes of single and multiple drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs). Results Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with anti-TB DHRs using oral drug provocation tests. Of these 28 patients, 17 patients (60.7%) had DHRs to a single drug and 11 (39.3%) had multiple DHRs. The median age of patients was 57.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39.2–73.2). Of the total patients, 18 patients (64.3%) were men. The median number of anti-TB drugs causing multiple DHRs was 2.0 (IQR 2.0–3.0). Rifampin was the most common drug that caused DHRs in both the single and multiple DHR groups (n = 8 [47.1%] and n = 9 [52.9%], respectively). The treatment success rate was lower in the multiple DHR group than in the single DHR group; however, the difference was not statistically significant (81.8% vs. 94.1%; P = 0.543). Conclusions Multiple anti-TB DHRs were common in all patients who experienced DHRs, and rifampin was the most common causative drug. The treatment outcomes appeared to be poorer in patients with multiple DHRs than in those with single DHRs."
https://openalex.org/W3127297680,"Background Knowledge about the distribution of Escherichia Coli ( E . coli ) pathotypes in Iran is limited. This nation-wide survey aims to provide a comprehensive description of the distribution of five pathogenic E . coli in Iran. Methods Stool samples were collected from 1,306 acute diarrhea cases from 15 provinces (2013–2014). E . coli -positive cultures underwent PCR testing for the detection of STEC, ETEC, EPEC, EAEC, and EIEC pathotypes. Pathotype frequency by province, age-group, and season was estimated. Results 979 diarrhea samples (75.0%) were culture-positive for E . coli (95% CI: 72.6, 77.3%), and 659 (50.5%) were pathogenic E . coli (95% CI: 47.8, 53.2%). STEC was the most frequent pathotype (35.4%). ETEC (14.0%) and EPEC (13.1%) were the second and the third most frequent pathotypes, respectively. EAEC (4.3%) and EIEC (0.3%) were not highly prevalent. Fars (88.7%) and Khorasan-e-Razavi (34.8%) provinces had the highest and lowest frequencies, respectively. E . coli pathotypes were more frequent in warmer than cooler seasons, showed the highest frequency among children under five years of age (73%), and had no significant association with participants’ gender. Conclusions Diarrheagenic E . coli may be an important cause of acute diarrhea in adults and children in Iran. STEC and ETEC seem to be widespread in the country with a peak in warmer seasons, impacting the recommended use of seasonal STEC and ETEC vaccines, especially in high-risk groups. Monitoring the incidence of E . coli pathotypes, serotypes, and antibiotic resistance over time is highly recommended for evaluation of interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3127584827,"Animal movement data are widely collected with devices such as sensors and collars, increasing the ability of researchers to monitor animal movement and providing information about animal behavioral patterns. Animal behavior is used as a basis for understanding the relationship between animals and the environment and for guiding decision-making by researchers and public agencies about environmental preservation and conservation actions. Animal movement and behavior are widely studied with a focus on identifying behavioral patterns, such as, animal group formation, the distance between animals and their home range. However, we observed a lack of research proposing a unified solution that aggregates resources for analyses of individual animal behavior and of social interactions between animals. The primary scientific contribution of this work is to present a framework that uses trajectory analysis and association rule mining [Jaiswal and Agarwal, 2012] to provide statistical measures of correlation and dependence to determine the relationship level between animals, their social interactions, and their interactions with other environmental factors based on their individual behavior and movement data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by applying it to movement data from jaguars in the Pantanal, Brazil. This allowed us to describe jaguar behavior, social interactions among jaguars and their behavior in different landscapes, thus providing a highly detailed investigation of jaguar movement decisions at the fine scale."
https://openalex.org/W3127801432,"Brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO 2 )-guided care, a therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent cerebral hypoxia through modifying determinants of cerebral oxygen delivery, including arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), has recently been introduced. Studies have reported that cerebral hypoxia occurs after cardiac arrest in the absence of hypoxemia or hypotension. To obtain preliminary information on the degree to which PbtO 2 is responsive to changes in the common target variables for PbtO 2 -guided care in conditions without hypoxemia or hypotension, we investigated the relationships between the common target variables for PbtO 2 -guided care and PbtO 2 using data from an experimental study in which the animals did not experience hypoxemia or hypotension after resuscitation. We retrospectively analyzed 170 sets of MAP, ETCO 2 , PaO 2 , PbtO 2 , and cerebral microcirculation parameters obtained during the 60-min post-resuscitation period in 10 pigs resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. PbtO 2 and cerebral microcirculation parameters were measured on parietal cortices exposed through burr holes. Multiple linear mixed effect models were used to test the independent effects of each variable on PbtO 2 . Despite the absence of arterial hypoxemia or hypotension, seven (70%) animals experienced cerebral hypoxia (defined as PbtO 2 &lt;20 mmHg). Linear mixed effect models revealed that neither MAP nor ETCO 2 were related to PbtO 2 . PaO 2 had a significant linear relationship with PbtO 2 after adjusting for significant covariates (P = 0.030), but it could explain only 17.5% of the total PbtO 2 variance (semi-partial R 2 = 0.175; 95% confidence interval, 0.086–0.282). In conclusion, MAP and ETCO 2 were not significantly related to PbtO 2 in animals without hypoxemia or hypotension during the early post-resuscitation period. PaO 2 had a significant linear association with PbtO 2 , but its ability to explain PbtO 2 variance was small."
https://openalex.org/W3126538021,"In this article we investigate how the public communication of the Hungarian Central Bank’s Monetary Council (MC) affects Hungarian sovereign bond yields. This research ties into the advances made in the financial and political economy literature which rely on extensive textual data and quantitative text analysis tools. While prior research demonstrated that forward guidance, in the form of council meeting minutes or press releases can be used as predictors of rate decisions, we are interested in whether they are able to directly influence asset returns as well. In order to capture the effect of central bank communication, we measure the latent hawkish or dovish sentiment of MC press releases from 2005 to 2019 by applying a sentiment dictionary, a staple in the text mining toolkit. Our results show that central bank forward guidance has an intra-year effect on bond yields. However, the hawkish or dovish sentiment of press releases has no impact on maturities of one year or longer where the policy rate proves to be the most important explanatory variable. Our research also contributes to the literature by applying a specialized dictionary to monetary policy as well as broadening the discussion by analyzing a case from the non-eurozone Central-Eastern region of the European Union."
https://openalex.org/W3127378260,"Quaking aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) is a valued, minor component on northeastern California landscapes. It provides a wide range of ecosystem services and has been in decline throughout the region for the last century. This decline may be explained partially by the lack of fire on the landscape due to heavier fire suppression, as aspen benefit from fire that eliminates conifer competition and stimulates reproduction through root suckering. However, there is little known about how aspen stand area changes in response to overlapping fire. Our study area in northeastern California on the Lassen, Modoc and Plumas National Forests has experienced recent large mixed-severity wildfires where aspen was present, providing an opportunity to study the re-introduction of fire. We observed two time periods; a 52-year absence of fire from 1941 to 1993 preceding a 24-year period of wildfire activity from 1993 to 2017. We utilized aerial photos and satellite imagery to delineate aspen stands and assess conifer cover percent. We chose aspen stands in areas where wildfires overlapped (twice-burned), where only a single wildfire burned, and areas that did not burn within the recent 24-year period. We observed these same stands within the first period of fire exclusion for comparison (i.e., 1941–1993). In the absence of fire, all aspen stand areas declined and all stands experienced increases in conifer composition. After wildfire, stands that burned experienced a release from conifer competition and increased in stand area. Stands that burned twice or at high severity experienced a larger removal of conifer competition than stands that burned once at low severity, promoting expansion of aspen stand area. Stands with less edge:area ratio also expanded in area more with fire present. Across both time periods, stand movement, where aspen stand footprints were mostly in new areas compared to footprints of previous years, was highest in smaller stands. In the fire exclusion period, smaller stands exhibited greater loss of area and changes in location (movement) than in the return of fire period, highlighting their vulnerability to loss via succession to conifers in the absence of disturbances that provide adequate growing space for aspen over time."
https://openalex.org/W3127950178,"In this study, we describe a process of preparing, surgically manipulating, and validating a novel “small diameter” 4mm circular Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) graft in vitro . Three small diameter DMEK grafts can be prepared from a single donor endothelium and could, therefore, potentially expand the donor pool. Prior to clinical use, however, we aimed to examine each step of the process to determine the effect on the endothelial cell loss and whether or not cells retained their capacity to migrate uniformly. For this study, circular small diameter grafts, obtained from twelve corneas of ten donors deemed ineligible for transplantation, were included. Small diameter DMEK graft preparation was successful in all cases (n = 36). Endothelial cell density (ECD), determined in the eye bank on seventeen grafts, showed an average decrease from 2413 (±189) cells/mm 2 before to 2240 (±413) cells/mm 2 after preparation. Twenty-four grafts were used to simulate DMEK-surgery in vitro and were successfully stained with 0.06% trypan blue, loaded into a straight DMEK-injector, unfolded, positioned, and centered within the circular ~ 4mm descemetorhexis. The estimated % area populated by viable cells on the grafts decreased from on average 92 (±3) % before to 78 (±10) % (n = 4) after in vitro surgery. Cells displayed a capacity for uniform cell migration from all edges of the graft (n = 4) when embedded in the 3D hydrogel system. Our data show, that by using an in vitro model of DMEK-surgery it was possible to test the 4mm circular DMEK grafts from eye bank preparation to surgical implantation. The cell loss after in vitro surgery was comparable with the in vivo ECD decline early after DMEK and the capacity of the cells to migrate to potentially cover bare stroma indicates that these small diameter grafts may be a viable clinical option to treat central endothelial disease."
https://openalex.org/W3128057495,"Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme events in northern ecosystems. The outcome of these events across the landscape, might be mediated by species effects, such as niche construction, with likely consequences on vegetation resilience. To test this hypothesis, we simulated an extreme event by removing aboveground vegetation in tundra heathlands dominated by the allelopathic dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum , a strong niche constructor. We tested the hypothesis under different climate regimes along a 200-km long gradient from oceanic to continental climate in Northern Norway. We studied the vegetation recovery process over ten years along the climatic gradient. The recovery of E . nigrum and subordinate species was low and flattened out after five years at all locations along the climatic gradient, causing low vegetation cover at the end of the study in extreme event plots. Natural seed recruitment was low at all sites, however, the addition of seeds from faster growing species did not promote vegetation recovery. A soil bioassay from 8 years after the vegetation was removed, suggested the allelopathic effect of E . nigrum was still present in the soil environment. Our results provide evidence of how a common niche constructor species can dramatically affect ecosystem recovery along a climatic gradient after extreme events in habitats where it is dominant. By its extremely slow regrowth and it preventing establishment of faster growing species, this study increases our knowledge on the possible outcomes when extreme events harm niche constructors in the tundra."
https://openalex.org/W3129126024,"Purpose To explore how symptom perception affects functioning in patients with advanced cancer. Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 459 advanced cancer patients at the national cancer center. Functioning was assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) II, and symptoms were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to develop a structural model based on different symptom perceptions, such as somatic sensation and experienced symptoms. Results The structural model of disability revealed a significant direct pathway involving somatic sensation (β = 16.11, p &lt; 0.001). Experienced symptoms significantly affected somatic sensations (β = 0.717, p &lt; 0.001) but were not directly associated with disability. Unidimensional models exhibited a poor fit. In contrast, a complex model with first-order (somatic sensation) and second-order (experienced symptoms) factors provided an excellent fit, with comparative fit indexes (CFIs) and Tucker Lewis indexes (TLI) of more than 0.950 threshold. Conclusions Our findings suggest that relationships to functioning may vary between somatic sensations versus experienced symptoms. The structure of symptoms is best conceptualized by direct somatic sensation and indirect experienced symptoms. A better understanding of symptom perception and the relationship between symptoms and function would facilitate the development of effective rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W3126221597,"Cataracts are a common consequence of aging; however, pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we observed that after 3 months of age mice lacking the G protein-coupled leukocyte chemotactic receptor Fpr1 (N-formyl peptide receptor 1) began to develop bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts that progressed to lens rupture and severe degeneration, without evidence of either systemic or local ocular infection or inflammation. Consistent with this, Fpr1 was detected in both mouse and human lens in primary lens epithelial cells (LECs), the only cell type present in the lens; however, expression was confined to subcapsular LECs located along the anterior hemispheric surface. To maximize translucency, LECs at the equator proliferate and migrate posteriorly, then differentiate into lens fiber cells by nonclassical apoptotic signaling, which results in loss of nuclei and other organelles, including mitochondria which are a rich source of endogenous N-formyl peptides. In this regard, denucleation and posterior migration of LECs were abnormal in lenses from Fpr1-/- mice, and direct stimulation of LECs with the prototypic N-formyl peptide agonist fMLF promoted apoptosis. Thus, Fpr1 is repurposed beyond its immunoregulatory role in leukocytes to protect against cataract formation and lens degeneration during aging."
https://openalex.org/W3126391152,"Bacterial species of the genera Agrobacterium and Borrelia possess chromosomes terminated by hairpin telomeres. Replication produces dimeric replication intermediates fused via replicated telomere junctions. A specialized class of enzymes, referred to as telomere resolvases, promotes the resolution of the replicated intermediate into linear monomers terminated by hairpin telomeres. Telomere resolution is catalyzed via DNA cleavage and rejoining events mechanistically similar to those promoted by topoisomerase-IB and tyrosine recombinase enzymes. Examination of the borrelial telomere resolvase, ResT, revealed unanticipated multifunctionality; aside from its expected telomere resolution activity ResT possessed a singled-stranded DNA (ssDNA) annealing activity that extended to both naked ssDNA and ssDNA complexed with its cognate single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). At present, the role this DNA annealing activity plays in vivo remains unknown. We have demonstrated here that single-stranded DNA annealing is also a conserved property of the agrobacterial telomere resolvase, TelA. This activity in TelA similarly extends to both naked ssDNA and ssDNA bound by its cognate SSB. TelA’s annealing activity was shown to stem from the N-terminal domain; removal of this domain abolished annealing without affecting telomere resolution. Further, independent expression of the N-terminal domain of TelA produced a functional annealing protein. We suggest that the apparent conservation of annealing activity in two telomere resolvases, from distantly related bacterial species, implies a role for this activity in hairpin telomere metabolism. Our demonstration of the separation of the telomere resolution and annealing activities of TelA provides a platform for future experiments aimed at identifying the role DNA annealing performs in vivo ."

While this phytoplasma has been examined in depth for its disease characteristics, knowledge about the spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogen spread is lacking. The phytoplasma is found in plant’s phloem and is vectored by leafhoppers (Cicadellidae: Hemiptera), including the aster leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus Forbes. The aster leafhopper is a migratory insect pest that overwinters in the southern United States, and historical data suggest these insects migrate from southern overwintering locations to northern latitudes annually, transmitting and driving phytoplasma infection rates as they migrate. A more in-depth understanding of the spatial, temporal and genetic determinants of Aster Yellows disease progress will lead to better integrated pest management strategies for Aster Yellows disease control. Carrot, Daucus carota L., plots were established at two planting densities in central Wisconsin and monitored during the 2018 growing season for Aster Yellows disease progression. Symptomatic carrots were sampled and assayed for the presence of the Aster Yellows phytoplasma. Aster Yellows disease progression was determined to be significantly associated with calendar date, crop density, location within the field, and phytoplasma subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W3128714198,"Aphids provide a good model system to understand the ecological speciation concept, since the majority of the species are host-specific, and they spend their entire lifecycle on certain groups of host plants. Aphid species that apparently have wide host plant ranges have often turned out to be complexes of host-specialized biotypes. Here we investigated the various host-associated populations of the two recently diverged species, Aphis gossypii and A . rhamnicola , having multiple primary hosts, to understand the complex evolution with host-associated speciation. Using mitochondrial DNA marker and nine microsatellite loci, we reconstructed the haplotype network, and analyzed the genetic structure and relationships. Approximate Bayesian computation was also used to infer the ancestral primary host and host-associated divergence, which resulted in Rhamnus being the most ancestral host for A . gossypii and A . rhamnicola . As a result, Aphis gossypii and A . rhamnicola do not randomly use their primary and secondary host plants; rather, certain biotypes use only some secondary and specific primary hosts. Some biotypes are possibly in a diverging state through specialization to specific primary hosts. Our results also indicate that a new heteroecious race can commonly be derived from the heteroecious ancestor, showing strong evidence of ecological specialization through a primary host shift in both A . gossypii and A . rhamnicola . Interestingly, A . gossypii and A . rhamnicola shared COI haplotypes with each other, thus there is a possibility of introgression by hybridization between them by cross-sharing same primary hosts. Our results contribute to a new perspective in the study of aphid evolution by identifying complex evolutionary trends in the gossypii sensu lato complex."
https://openalex.org/W3129042342,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting about 1.6% of the population in England. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are approved AF treatments that reduce stroke risk. In this study, we estimate the equality in individual NOAC prescriptions with high spatial resolution in Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) across England from 2014 to 2019. Methods A Bayesian spatio-temporal model will be used to estimate and predict the individual NOAC prescription trend on ‘prescription data’ as an indicator of health services utilisation, using a small area analysis methodology. The main dataset in this study is the “Practice Level Prescribing in England,” which contains four individual NOACs prescribed by all registered GP practices in England. We will use the defined daily dose (DDD) equivalent methodology, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), to compare across space and time. Four licensed NOACs datasets will be summed per 1,000 patients at the CCG-level over time. We will also adjust for CCG-level covariates, such as demographic data, Multiple Deprivation Index, and rural-urban classification. We aim to employ the extended BYM2 model (space-time model) using the RStan package. Discussion This study suggests a new statistical modelling approach to link prescription and socioeconomic data to model pharmacoepidemiologic data. Quantifying space and time differences will allow for the evaluation of inequalities in the prescription of NOACs. The methodology will help develop geographically targeted public health interventions, campaigns, audits, or guidelines to improve areas of low prescription. This approach can be used for other medications, especially those used for chronic diseases that must be monitored over time."
