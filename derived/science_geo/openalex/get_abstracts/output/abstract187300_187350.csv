https://openalex.org/W2078075583,"The male-specific region of the Y chromosome, the MSY, differentiates the sexes and comprises 95% of the chromosome's length. Here, we report that the MSY is a mosaic of heterochromatic sequences and three classes of euchromatic sequences: X-transposed, X-degenerate and ampliconic. These classes contain all 156 known transcription units, which include 78 protein-coding genes that collectively encode 27 distinct proteins. The X-transposed sequences exhibit 99% identity to the X chromosome. The X-degenerate sequences are remnants of ancient autosomes from which the modern X and Y chromosomes evolved. The ampliconic class includes large regions (about 30% of the MSY euchromatin) where sequence pairs show greater than 99.9% identity, which is maintained by frequent gene conversion (non-reciprocal transfer). The most prominent features here are eight massive palindromes, at least six of which contain testis genes."

https://openalex.org/W2114800671,"Over the past five years evidence has mounted that long-duration (> 2 s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)--the most brilliant of all astronomical explosions--signal the collapse of massive stars in our Universe. This evidence was originally based on the probable association of one unusual GRB with a supernova, but now includes the association of GRBs with regions of massive star formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' in the optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshly synthesized elements in the spectra of a few X-ray afterglows. These observations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumably arising from core collapse. Here we report evidence that a very energetic supernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a GRB at redshift z = 0.1685. The timing of the supernova indicates that it exploded within a few days of the GRB, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events can give rise to GRBs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model."

The frame-by-frame structural evolution, resolved to 1.8 angstroms, allows one to literally ""watch"" the protein as it executes its function. Time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy of flash-photolyzed L29F MbCO revealed a short-lived CO intermediate whose 140-ps lifetime is shorter than that found in wild-type protein by a factor of 1000. The electron density maps of the protein unveil transient conformational changes far more dramatic than the structural differences between the carboxy and deoxy states and depict the correlated side-chain motion responsible for rapidly sweeping CO away from its primary docking site."

https://openalex.org/W2099487698,"Spore formation by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is an elaborate developmental process that is triggered by nutrient limitation. Here we report that cells that have entered the pathway to sporulate produce and export a killing factor and a signaling protein that act cooperatively to block sister cells from sporulating and to cause them to lyse. The sporulating cells feed on the nutrients thereby released, which allows them to keep growing rather than to complete morphogenesis. We propose that sporulation is a stress-response pathway of last resort and that B. subtilis delays a commitment to spore formation by cannibalizing its siblings."

We have used the transformed endothelial cell line SVR as an effective screen of natural product extracts to isolate anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor compounds. Aqueous extracts of Magnolia grandiflora exhibit potent activity in our SVR proliferation assays. We found that the small molecular weight compound honokiol is the active principle of magnolia extract. Honokiol exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity against SVR cells in vitro. In addition, honokiol demonstrated preferential inhibition of primary human endothelial cells compared with fibroblasts and this inhibition was antagonized by antibodies against TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. In vivo, honokiol was highly effective against angiosarcoma in nude mice. Our preclinical data suggests that honokiol is a systemically available and non-toxic inhibitor of angiogenesis and should be further evaluated as a potential chemotherapeutic agent."

https://openalex.org/W1993408206,"Thioredoxin (Trx1) is a redox-active protein containing two active site cysteines (Cys-32 and Cys-35) that cycle between the dithiol and disulfide forms as Trx1 reduces target proteins. Examination of the redox characteristics of this active site dithiol/disulfide couple is complicated by the presence of three additional non-active site cysteines. Using the redox Western blot technique and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry mass spectrometry, we determined the midpoint potential (E 0) of the Trx1 active site (–230 mV) and identified a second redox-active dithiol/disulfide (Cys-62 and Cys-69) in an α helix proximal to the active site, which formed under oxidizing conditions. This non-active site disulfide was not a substrate for reduction by thioredoxin reductase and delayed the reduction of the active site disulfide by thioredoxin reductase. Within actively growing THP1 cells, most of the active site of Trx1 was in the dithiol form, whereas the non-active site was totally in the dithiol form. The addition of increasing concentrations of diamide to these cells resulted in oxidation of the active site at fairly low concentrations and oxidation of the non-active site at higher concentrations. Taken together these results suggest that the Cys-62-Cys-69 disulfide could provide a means to transiently inhibit Trx1 activity under conditions of redox signaling or oxidative stress, allowing more time for the sensing and transmission of oxidative signals.

The active site of Trx1, WCGPC, is conserved among species from cyanobacteria to humans (5Eklund H. Gleason F. Holmgren A. Proteins. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The active site cysteines are readily accessible on the surface of the protein and become oxidized to a disulfide upon reduction of a target protein. This disulfide is cycled back to the dithiol by Trx reductase (6Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Unlike Trxs from lower species, mammalian Trx1 contains additional conserved cysteine residues (at positions 62, 69, and 73 of human Trx1; See Fig. 1). Whether these non-active site Cys residues have biologic function is unknown. Cys-73 was present as an intermolecular disulfide bond (Trx1 homodimer) in x-ray crystal studies (7Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible function for Cys-73. However, a mutant Trx1 bearing a serine at this position still appeared as a homodimer in the crystal structure, suggesting that Cys-73 was not essential for dimerization (7Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). More recently, S-glutathionylation of Trx1 at Cys-73 has been found during oxidative stress (8Casagrande S. Bonetto V. Fratelli M. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Massignan T. Slamona M. Chang G. Holmgren A. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9745-9749Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, S-nitrosylation of Cys-69 has recently been described (9Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The midpoint potential (E 0) for the active site dithiol of Trx is available for several lower species (10Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. de la Cuesta C.P. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Equilibrium with NADPH in the presence of a catalytic amount of Trx reductase, where it is assumed that each mole of NADPH consumed translates into 1 mol of Trx reduced, indicated that Escherichia coli Trx had a midpoint potential of –270 mV (10Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. de la Cuesta C.P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moore E.C. Reichard P. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternate approach using the equilibrium between glutathione (GSH) redox buffers and E. coli Trx yielded a similar value for E 0 (15Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6649-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the latter approach, the relative amounts of reduced and oxidized Trx were determined by quantification of the number of thiols with Ellman's reagent (dithionitrobenzoic acid) because E. coli Trx contains only one redox-active pair of cysteines. Oxidized and reduced forms of bovine Trx1 have been separated by carboxymethylation of thiols, native gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting (16Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagata-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The fully reduced (fully carboxymethylated) and fully oxidized forms of bovine Trx1 were identified, but intermediate bands on the immunoblot were only identified as “partially carboxymethylated” (16Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagata-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the present report we have used mass spectrometry to positively identify the forms of human Trx1 that are resolved by this native gel electrophoresis/Western blot (Redox Western blot) method. The results show that the resolved bands include fully reduced Trx1, a band with the active site in the disulfide form, and a band in which the protein has two disulfides, one at the active site and the other involving Cys-62 and Cys-69. The midpoint potential (E 0) for the active site was found to be –230 mV. Using this value and redox Western blot analysis of THP1 cells, the steady state redox (Eh) of Trx1 was –280 mV, a value that is comparable with the Eh for GSH/GSSG in these cells (–259 mV). During oxidative stress induced by diamide, both the Trx1 active site and non-active site disulfides were observed. In vitro, the non-active site disulfide was found to inhibit the regeneration of the active form of Trx1 by thioredoxin reductase, supporting the interpretation that oxidation of this non-active site dithiol could provide a structural switch affecting Trx1 function during oxidative stress and redox signaling. Cell Culture—THP1 human monocytes were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Eh calculations for cells were done using the Nernst equation with E 0 values for pH 7.4 and assuming a 5-μl cell volume per mg of cell protein. Glutathione Redox Buffers—Redox buffers were prepared in a 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. All solutions were de-oxygenated by bubbling with O2-free nitrogen (O2 < 0.5 ppm) for at least 2 h. The GSH/GSSG redox potential was calculated according to the Nernst equation (Eh = E 0 + 2.3 × RT/nF × log([GSSG]/[GSH]2), where E 0 = –240 mV at pH 7.0 (17Rost J. Rapoport S. Nature. 1964; 201: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and n = 2 for the 2-electron oxidation of 2GSH to GSSG). The following concentrations were used to achieve the desired potentials (Eh , [GSH] and [GSSG]): –150 mV, 6.5 and 43.5 mm; –180 mV, 18 and 32 mm; –210 mV, 36 and 14 mm; –240 mV, 50 and 2.5 mm; –270 mV, 50 and 0.25 mm; –300 mV, 50 and 0.025 mm. After incubation with Trx1 at room temperature for 2 h, samples were taken for the measurement of GSH and GSSG and for determination of the redox state of Trx1. Preliminary studies showed that equilibration periods from 15 min to 4 h yielded similar results, indicating that equilibrium had been achieved. GSH and GSSG were quantified by HPLC as S-carboxymethyl, N-dansyl derivatives relative to γ-glutamylglutamate as an internal standard (18Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Samiec P.S. Sternberg Jr., P. Mody Jr., V.C. Reed R.L. Brown L.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1998; 275: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Redox Western Blot Analysis—Separation of the redox forms of Trx1 was based upon the procedures of Holmgren and Fagerstedt (19Holmgren A. Fagerstedt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6926-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fernando et al. (16Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagata-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Trx1 was carboxymethylated in guanidine-Tris solution (6 m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 50 mm iodoacetic acid (IAA). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, excess IAA was removed by Sephadex chromatography (MicroSpin G-25 columns, Amersham Biosciences). Eluates were diluted in 5× sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and separated on a discontinuous native polyacrylamide gel (5% stacking gel, 15% resolving gel). Gels were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed for Trx1 using anti-Trx1 primary antibody (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat immunoglobulin G secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescent detection (SuperSignal West Dura, Pierce) with x-ray film. Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis of exposed film with Un-Scan-It software (Silk Scientific Corp.). In-gel Digestion of Trx1—Coomassie-stained bands containing Trx1 were subjected to in-gel digestion with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), and the peptides were extracted as described (20Li G. Waltham M. Anderson N.L. Unsworth E. Treston A. Weinstein J.N. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were desalted using C18-ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA) before analysis by mass spectrometry. ESI-MS—Flow injection ESI-MS analysis of the peptides was performed on a model API3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Foster City, CA) equipped with MicroIonSpray electrospray source and operated in the positive mode of operation. Low energy collision-induced dissociation spectra of the peptides (ESI MS/MS) were performed to confirm peptide identity. MALDI-TOF MS—Positive-ion MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed using model ReflexIII delayed-extraction MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billarica, MA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser; α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (MALDI-Quality, Hewlett-Packard) was used as the matrix. Monobromobimane Labeling and Fluorescence Detection of Trx1— For some experiments samples were treated with 100 mm monobromobimane (mBBr, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) instead of IAA. Labeling was carried out in the guanidine-Tris solution for 30 min at 37 °C, and excess mBBr was removed with G-25 MicroSpin columns. The mBBr-labeled samples were digested with trypsin in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.5 (20 h at 35 °C), and then 10% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (pH < 2) was added. The resulting peptides were separated by microbore reversed phase HPLC on an Applied Biosystems model 140A solvent delivery system using a C18 silica column (1 × 150 mm, Zorbax-SB300) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fluorescence of the effluent was monitored at an emission wavelength of 380 nm with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Eluted peaks were collected, and the identity of the peptide in each peak was established by Edman sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Molecular Modeling—An energy minimization model for Trx1 with a disulfide bond between Cys-62 and Cys-69 was developed with the InsightII/Discover software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The starting coordinates were from the reduced human crystal structure, Protein Data Bank code 1ERT. The model was first energy-minimized using the cvff parameter file without forming any disulfide linkages. The Cys-62–Cys-69 disulfide was then formed, and the model was further minimized. Ribbon drawings of the resulting models were prepared using MOLSCRIPT (21Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (22Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), and RASTER3D (23Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid pcDNA3.1 encoding human Trx1 was a kind gift of Dr. Jiyang Cai of Emory University. Point mutations were introduced using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system of Promega. The C62S,C69S and C32S,C35S doubles mutants were generated by hybridization of the plasmid with oligonucleotides of the sequence 5′-GTGGATGACTCTCAGGATGTTGCTTCAGAGTCTGAAGTCAAATGC-3′ and 5′-TTCTCAGCCACGTGGTCTGGGCCTTCCAAAATGATCAAGCC-3′, respectively. Clones containing the desired mutations were selected by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Trx1 Mutants—For expression in E. coli, Trx1 mutants were subcloned into pET-15b (Novagen) via PCR amplification of the coding region of the pcDNA3.1/Trx1 mutants. A forward primer encoding an NcoI restriction site and a reverse primer encoding a 6× His tag followed by a stop codon and a BamHI restriction site were used. Both the pET-15b vector and the PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated overnight at 16 °C. Competent DL21-Gold(DE3) cells (Stratagene) were transformed with pET/Trx1 plasmids. Expression of the mutant proteins was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and His-tagged proteins were purified under native conditions using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen). Reduction of Oxidized Thioredoxin by Thioredoxin Reductase and NADPH—Purified His-tagged Trx1(wt), Trx1(C32S,C35S), and Trx1(C62S,C69S) were oxidized with 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature, then dialyzed overnight against two changes of Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 7.5 (reaction buffer). In a final volume of 0.5 ml of Tris/EDTA buffer, Trx1 mutants were reduced in the presence of 0.3 mm NADPH and 14 μm bovine thioredoxin reductase (American Diagnostica). Oxidation of NADPH was monitored by the change in absorbance at 340 nm (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of Reduced and Oxidized Trx1—Purified Trx1 was reduced with DTT or oxidized with diamide, carboxymethylated with IAA, separated by native PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2). DTT-treated Trx1 moved as a single band (labeled as Band 3 in Fig. 2). Diamide-treated Trx1 also moved as a single band (labeled Band 1 in Fig. 2) but migrated more slowly than DTT-treated Trx1. Fig. 3A shows the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of tryptic digests of reduced and oxidized Trx1. The predicted and observed masses of the relevant peptides are given in Table I. All five cysteines were carboxymethylated in DTT-treated Trx1 (Band 3) (Table I). The mass spectrum of diamide-treated Trx1 (Band 1) revealed the presence of two disulfides, one between Cys-32 and Cys-35 and one between Cys-62 and Cys-69 (Table I). No masses were observed that corresponded to carboxymethylation at any of these four cysteines. Both unmodified and carboxymethylated Cys-73 was present in diamide-treated Trx1. Thus, the redox state of the sulfur of Cys-73 was unclear, perhaps indicating a mixture of redox states. The identities of the peptides representing the observed masses as well as the positions of the carboxymethyl groups within these peptides were verified by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3A, comparison of tryptic digests of oxidized and reduced Trx1.

The reduced/carboxymethylated and oxidized/carboxymethylated proteins were digested with trypsin, and the digests were then desalted and analyzed by nanospray ESI-MS/MS (positive mode) on a triple quadrupole. For the reduced species, the doubly charged ion at m/z 871.4, corresponding to the addition of two carboxymethyl groups (cm), was selected for fragmentation. The carboxymethyl group adds a mass of 58 Da for each group, resulting in an increase in mass of 58 Da for the y2, y3, and y4 ions and an increase in mass of 116 Da for the y5 through y15 ions as compared with the non-carboxymethylated sequence. In addition, the b11 through b13 ions increase by 58 Da, and the b14 and b15 ions increase by 116 Da due to the carboxymethyl groups. For the oxidized species, the doubly charged ion at m/z 812.3, corresponding to the disulfide, was selected for fragmentation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Redox States of Trx1 after Equilibration with Redox Buffers—Purified Trx1 was equilibrated with 50 mm GSH/GSSG redox buffers over a range of potentials (–270 to –210 mV) likely to be found within cells (25Kirlin W.G. Cai J. Thompson S.A. Diaz D. Kavanagh T.J. Jones D.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Jones D.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), carboxymethylated, and separated on a native gel as before (Fig. 4). The redox potentials of the redox buffers were verified by HPLC analysis of the GSH and GSSG content of the redox buffers at the beginning and the end of the equilibration period; these were found to be unchanged over the course of the equilibration (not shown). Experiments were also performed with GSH/GSSG redox buffers at 5 mm total concentration instead of 50 mm, and identical results were obtained. Because IAA may shift the thiol-disulfide equilibrium of proteins (27Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to compare results obtained with 10 and 50 mm IAA. The results were not distinguishable; thus, the conditions used here (50 mm IAA) did not allow significant changes in Trx1 redox state during processing. At –270 mV, the predominant band co-migrated with the DTT-treated Trx1. MALDI-TOF analysis showed that this band (Band 3) contained only fully carboxymethylated Trx1 (see Table I). At –240 mV, Trx1 was distributed between Bands 2 and 3, and at –210 mV, Band 2 predominated. MALDI-TOF analysis showed that Band 2 contained both dithiol and disulfide forms of tryptic fragments T4 and T6, indicating that Band 2 is a mixture of two forms. One form contained a disulfide between Cys-32 and Cys-35 (active site) with Cys-62 and Cys-69 present as thiols, and the other form, which had a smaller signal, contained a disulfide between Cys-62 and Cys-69, with Cys-32 and Cys-35 present as thiols. Calculation of the Midpoint Potential (E0) of the Active Site (Cys-32–Cys-35) Disulfide of Human Trx1—Because immunoblotting yielded results comparable with those obtained with Coomassie staining of the different redox states of Trx1 (e.g. compare Figs. 2 and 4), redox state analyses were performed with the redox Western blot technique. Trx1 was equilibrated with redox buffers from –300 to –150 mV, and Bands 1, 2, and 3 were quantified by densitometry. E 0 was calculated by fitting the data to the Nernst equation using the intensity of Band 3 for the reduced form of the active site and the total of Bands 1 and 2 as the corresponding disulfide (Fig. 5). The line represents the best fit to the Nernst equation, yielding a midpoint potential of –230 mV for n = 2. To provide an independent confirmation of the E 0 of the active site, Trx1 was equilibrated at different redox potentials, labeled with the thiol-specific fluorescent probe mBBr, digested with trypsin, separated by C18 liquid chromatography, and detected by fluorescence (Fig. 6). Eluates corresponding to peaks of fluorescence were collected, and the identities of the peptides were established by Edman sequencing (Table II). Because monobromobimane labels thiols, but not disulfides, the redox-dependent change in fluorescence intensity of the peaks corresponding to peptides T4, T6, and T7 was reflective of the oxidation state of the thiols in each peptide. With this analysis half of the fluorescence of the active site peptide (T4) was lost at a potential of –225 mV. These results are in good agreement with the value of –230 mV from the redox Western blot approach and show that the E 0 for the active site of human Trx1 is more positive than that for E. coli Trx, i.e. in the range of –230 mV rather than –270 mV (10Krause G.

Open table in a new tab Redox Dependence of the Non-active Site Disulfide—The mass spectrometry data showed that the oxidized form of Trx1 that moved as Band 1 on the redox Western blot contained two disulfide bonds. Band 1 was detected at potentials as low as –270 mV, and the intensity of Band 1 increased at –240 mV and –210 mV. However, there was an overall loss of signal and the appearance of a fourth (minor) band at redox potentials more oxidizing than –210 mV; approximately half of the total signal (Bands 1, 2, and 3) was lost at –150 mV (Fig. 3,Fig. 3). Thus, the E 0 for the non-active site is more positive than –210 mV. The nature of the changes responsible for the loss of signal in the redox Western blot at potentials more positive than –210 mV are unclear. Redox State of Endogenous Trx1 in Cells—To determine the redox state of intracellular Trx1, extracts from control and oxidant-exposed THP1 human monocytes were analyzed by redox Western blot (Fig. 7) and compared with the redox state of Trx1 at known redox potentials (Fig. 4). About 95% of the Trx1 from proliferating cells was in the fully reduced state, with some Band 2 and no fully oxidized Trx1 (Fig. 7, lane 1). This corresponded to an Eh value of –280 + 5 mV after correction for the effect of intracellular pH (7.4). By comparison, the redox state of glutathione in these cells was –259 + 3 mV (mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments). Upon exposure of the cells to diamide, there was a rapid, dose-dependent oxidation of the endogenous Trx1. The amount of the two-disulfide form of Trx1 (Band 1) went from undetectable to a maximum of 50% of the total Trx1 after 2 min of exposure to 3 mm diamide, the highest concentration tested. At this concentration, there was a 75-mV oxidation of the active site relative to the untreated controls (i.e. from –265 to –190 mV). Even the lowest dose of diamide tested (0.1 mm) caused a 20-mV oxidation of the active site (Fig. 7). Modeling of the Non-active Site Disulfide in the Trx1 Structure—The crystal structure of fully reduced human Trx1 is known but not that of the Cys-62–Cys-69-oxidized structure. In the reduced structure, the sulfhydryls for Cys-62 and Cys-69 lie partially buried at opposite ends of a short α-helix, about 10 Å apart. In this conformation, the Cys-62–Cys-69 disulfide bond cannot form. However, this helix is only loosely attached to the core of the protein through two loops, and this helix in solution could dynamically pull away from the protein core and sufficiently unravel to allow disulfide bond formation. We modeled this possibility starting with the crystal coordinates for the fully reduced protein (Protein Data Bank code 1ERT), connecting Cys-62 and Cys-69 and energy-minimizing. The resulting structure (Fig. 8) supports the hypothesis that local unfolding would allow the disulfide to form and substantially alter the structure in this region proximal to the active site. Reduction of Trx1 Mutants by Thioredoxin Reductase—Earlier studies showed that fully oxidized mammalian Trx1 was much more slowly reduced by thioredoxin reductase than was Trx1 that was oxidized only at the active site (24Holmgren A.

Three N-methyltransferase enzymes are involved in caffeine biosynthesis in coffee plants — CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 (theobromine synthase) and CaDXMT1 (caffeine synthase), which successively add methyl groups to xanthosine in converting it into caffeine2,3,4. Here we describe the construction of transgenic coffee plants in which expression of the gene encoding theobromine synthase (CaMXMT1) is repressed by RNA interference (RNAi). The caffeine content of these plants is reduced by up to 70%, indicating that it should be feasible to produce coffee beans that are intrinsically deficient in caffeine."

Its nature remains a mystery, but assuming that it is composed of weakly interacting subatomic particles, is consistent with large-scale cosmic structure. However, recent analyses of structure on galactic and subgalactic scales have suggested discrepancies and stimulated numerous alternative proposals. We discuss how studies of the density, demography, history, and environment of smaller-scale structures may distinguish among these possibilities and shed new light on the nature of dark matter."
https://openalex.org/W1998802487,"Abstract Atherosclerotic plaques preferentially localize to areas of the vasculature with complex laminar or oscillatory blood flow. Prior data implicate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. In cultured endothelial cells, oscillatory but not unidirectional shear significantly increases MMP-9 mRNA as well as secretion of the MMP-9 protein (p < 0.05). In contrast, cell-associated protein levels of Tissue Inhibitor of MMP 1 (TIMP-1), an inhibitor of MMP-9, are insensitive to the shear regimen. To investigate transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 gene expression, we utilized retroviral-based reporter constructs containing different lengths of the human MMP-9 promoter. The activity of the full MMP-9 promoter is 3-fold higher (p < 0.05) in unidirectional shear compared with static conditions, and the activity is further increased ∼10-fold by oscillatory shear (p < 0.01) over unidirectional flow. Our data identify a shear-sensitive binding site at –152 in the MMP-9 promoter. We show that the c-Myc transcription factor binds specifically to this site and that reporter constructs in which the c-Myc binding site was abolished lacked the shear responsiveness of native MMP-9 reporter constructs. Our results suggest that endothelial MMP-9 expression is flow-sensitive and is up-regulated by oscillatory flow via activation of c-Myc. This effect may contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions in areas of vasculature that are subject to disturbed flow."
https://openalex.org/W2152611124,"One of the most important functions of vision is to direct actions to objects. However, every time that vision is used to guide an action, retinal motion signals are produced by the movement of the eye and head as the person looks at the object or by the motion of other objects in the scene. To reach for the object accurately, the visuomotor system must separate information about the position of the stationary target from background retinal motion signals-a long-standing problem that is poorly understood. Here we show that the visuomotor system does not distinguish between these two information sources: when observers made fast reaching movements to a briefly presented stationary target, their hand shifted in a direction consistent with the motion of a distant and unrelated stimulus, a result contrary to most other findings. This can be seen early in the hand's trajectory (approximately 120 ms) and occurs continuously from programming of the movement through to its execution. The visuomotor system might make use of the motion signals arising from eye and head movements to update the positions of targets rapidly and redirect the hand to compensate for body movements."
https://openalex.org/W2041209144,"Many past studies of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been limited because of the large distance to typical GRBs, resulting in faint afterglows.

However, GRBs nearer than z=0.2 are extremely rare, with an estimated rate of localisation of one every decade. Here, we report the discovery of bright optical afterglow emission from GRB 030329. Our prompt dissemination and the brilliance of the afterglow resulted in extensive followup (more than 65 telescopes) from radio through X-ray bands, as well as measurement of the redshift, z=0.169. The gamma-ray and afterglow properties of GRB 030329 are similar to those of cosmological GRBs (after accounting for the small distance), making this the nearest known cosmological GRB.

Under this condition, the possibility that kin-based cooperative breeding is an unselected consequence of dispersal patterns can never be ruled out because helpers can only help their relatives. Here we show that a population of carrion crows (Corvus corone corone) fully fits the central prediction of kin selection theory that cooperative breeding should arise among relatives. On their territory, resident breeders are aided not only by nonbreeding retained offspring but also by immigrants (mainly males), with whom they share matings. Philopatry cannot account, however, for the high degree of genetic relatedness found between breeders and immigrants of the same sex that cooperate at a nest, indicating that crows actively choose to breed cooperatively with their relatives."

To delineate mediators of CD437 signaling, we utilized a random antisense-dependent functional knockout genetic approach. We identified a cDNA that encodes ∼130-kDa HBC cell perinuclear protein (termed CARP-1). Treatments with CD437 or chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin, as well as serum deprivation of HBC cells, stimulate CARP-1 expression. Reduced levels of CARP-1 result in inhibition of apoptosis by CD437 or adriamycin, whereas increased expression of CARP-1 causes elevated levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 and apoptosis. CARP-1 interacts with 14-3-3 protein as well as causes reduced expression of cell cycle regulatory genes including c-Myc and cyclin B1. Loss of c-Myc sensitizes cells to apoptosis by CARP-1, whereas expression of c-Myc or 14-3-3 inhibits CARP-1-dependent apoptosis. Thus, apoptosis induction by CARP-1 involves sequestration of 14-3-3 and CARP-1-mediated altered expression of multiple cell cycle regulatory genes.

The natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, collectively known as retinoids, are involved in many biological processes including development, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (1DeLuca L.M.

On the basis of our research, CD437 was found to enhance expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21WAF1/CIP1 and DNA damage-inducible GADD45 genes (10Li X.S. Rishi A.K. Shao Z.-M.

We also found that CD437 potently induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and that induction occurred upstream of caspase activation and apoptosis (12Zhang Y. Huang Y.

Inactivation of c-Jun, a downstream effector of activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, was also found to impair CD437-dependent apoptosis but not the induction of the expression of the CDKI p21WAF1/CIP1 in A549 lung cancer cells (13Li Y. Lin B. Agadir A. Lu R. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Fontana J.A. Bost F. Hobbs P. Zeng Y. Chen G.-Q. Shroot B. Marcola D. Zhang X.-K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4719-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The roles of apoptosis mediators have been ascertained by expressing dominant negative peptides directed to specific cellular proteins involved in apoptotic signaling cascades. This powerful approach allows us to inactivate a known mediator, but not novel mediators that may either be key signaling molecules or co-operate with known mediators. Given that CD437 utilizes unique pathways for growth arrest and apoptosis, we hypothesized that novel mediators of CD437-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis existed. We then utilized a functional knockout genetic approach by overexpressing antisense cDNAs (14Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) to obtain novel molecules involved in CD437-dependent apoptotic signal cascades. The antisense knockout approach involves random inactivation of genes via a cDNA library cloned in an antisense orientation in an expression vector plasmid (14Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This approach is based on the premise that specific inactivation or knockout of a growth-inhibitory and/or apoptosis-promoting gene would result in a growth advantage to the transfected cells in a specific restrictive environment. This growth advantage constitutes a powerful forward selection that is helpful in isolating the desired inactivation event from random inactivation. Although nascent protein synthesis may be unnecessary for CD437-dependent apoptosis in certain cell types (such as leukemia), stable overexpression of a particular antisense RNA should over time deplete the target protein, thereby causing a partial or complete block in the CD437-dependent apoptotic signal. This methodology allows, in principle, the identification of important genes, the products of which may be modulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, or post-translational level during the CD437-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Thus, if a set of novel mediators of growth arrest and/or apoptosis is activated in the presence of CD437, their specific inactivation via overexpression of a transfected antisense cDNA library should lead to cellular resistance to CD437 apoptosis. The functional knockout genetic approach yielded several CD437-resistant MDA-MB-468 HBC sublines. Plasmids expressing antisense cDNAs were rescued, and one of the plasmids (AS-6) harbored a cDNA insert that belongs to a novel ∼130-kDa protein (referred to as cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory protein (CARP)-1). CARP-1 expression in HBC cells is regulated by serum as well as by agents such as CD437 and adriamycin. This report details the role(s) of CARP-1 in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis pathways.

Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), where SV40 promoter has been replaced by CMV promoter elements. RT-PCR analysis of Escherichia coli DH10B transformed with the above library showed greater than 80% colonies having recombinant plasmids with a range of cDNA insert sizes (0.1–2.5 kb), suggesting excellent recombination efficiency and complexity of the library. The library was then transfected into MDA-MB-468 HBC cells and stable sublines selected in the presence of hygromycin (400 μg/ml) and CD437 (1 μm), followed by plasmid DNA extraction from each subline and subsequent sequencing of the inserts as described (11Rishi A.K. Sun R.-J. Gao Y. Hsu C.K.A. Gerald T.M. Sheikh M.S. Dawson M.I. Reichert U. Shroot B. Fornace A.J. Brewer G. Fontana J.A.

The CARP-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AY249140) having the entire CARP-1 protein encoding ORF was cloned by RT-PCR methodology utilizing total RNA derived from MDA-MB-468 HBC cells. The sequence of the primers for PCR amplification (see Table I) were derived from the GenBank™ data base having mouse and human cDNAs with homologies to the cDNA insert of plasmid AS-6 (see below). Multiple subfragments of the CARP-1 cDNA were independently PCR-amplified by using combinations of oligos AS-6.1 plus AS-6.9 (fragment 1), AS-6.8 plus AS-6.11 (fragment 2), AS-6.10 plus AS-6.13 (fragment 3), AS-6.12 plus AS-6.15 (fragment 4), or AS-6.14 plus AS-6.17 (fragment 5). The PCR-amplified cDNA fragments were digested with either BamHI plus DraI (fragment 1), DraI plus NheI (fragment 2), NheI plus SacI (fragment 3), SacI plus EcoRV (fragment 4), or EcoRV plus XhoI (fragment 5) followed by their sequential ligation into BamHI plus XhoI cut vector plasmid pcDNA3/myc-HisA (Invitrogen) to obtain a recombinant plasmid clone 6.1 (Fig. 1). This recombinant plasmid has CARP-1 cDNA with the entire protein encoding ORF, the translation start codon ATG but lacks translation termination codon TGA, whereas Myc and polyhistidine epitope tags are fused in-frame at the C terminus of the CARP-1 protein. In addition, ∼1.4-kb CARP-1 cDNA fragment was PCR-amplified using oligos AS-6.1 and AS 6.11, followed by restriction digestion of the cDNA with BamHI plus NheI. This cDNA subfragment was then cloned in antisense orientation in BamHI- and NheI-digested plasmid vector pcDNA3/Hygro (Invitrogen) to obtain plasmid clone 1.6 (Fig. 1).Table ISequence and positions of various oligonucleotidesOligo IDOligo sequence (5′ to 3′)Position (relative to ATG)AS-6.1GCGGGATCCGCATCATGGCTCAATTTGGSense; -5 to +14AS-6.8TATGCCTTTTAAATGGAATGSense; 583 to 602AS-6.9CATTCCATTTAAAAGGCATATAntisense; 583 to 602AS-6.10GCTGATGGCTAGCCCTAGTASense; 1349 to 1368AS-6.11TACTAGGGCTAGCCATCAGCAntisense; 1349 to 1368AS-6.12GAAAGTCGAGCTCTTAGTTCSense; 1944 to 1963AS-6.13GAACTAAGAGCTCGACTTTCAntisense; 1944 to 1963AS-6.14CAAAAGAGATATCAACAGATSense; 2684 to 2703AS-6.15ATCTGTTGATATCTCTTTTGAntisense; 2684 to 2703AS-6.17GCGCTCGAGTACACTGGCACCATTCTCCTTAntisense; 3429 to 3449AS-6.23CAGCTCTTTAAAAACACGCTGCTTCTGAGGCAntisense; 427 to 449AS-6.25CTCGGATCCGCTGACGGGTTTGAAATGGCSense; -97 to -78 Open table in a new tab Approximately 0.8-kb cDNA fragment containing the entire protein encoding ORF of 14-3-3 σ protein (21; GenBank™ accession number AF029082) was RT-PCR-amplified using total RNA derived from MDAMB-468 HBC cells and a combination of oligos 14-3-3-1 (sense oligo 5′-CGCGGATCCCCAGAGCCATGGAGAGAG-3′ positions 61–80) and 14-3-3-2 (antisense oligo 5′-CGCTCTAGAGCTCTGGGGCTCCTGGGGAG-3′ positions 796–851). The PCR-amplified product was digested with BamHI plus XbaI and ligated into BamHI-XbaI-digested vector plasmid pEF-1/V5-HisA (Invitrogen) to obtain plasmid pEF-1/14-3-3-V5-His clone 1 (encoding 14-3-3 protein fused with V5 and His tags at the C terminus). The inserts of plasmids of clones 1.6 and 6.1 having CARP-1 cDNAs, as well as pcDNA3-c-Myc antisense plasmid and pEF-1/14-3-3-V5-His clone 1, were sequenced to confirm validity of the inserts. MTT and Apoptosis Assays—Sublines transfected with vector plasmid pCDNA3/Hygro or clone 1.6 were either untreated or separately treated with 1 μm CD437 for 72 h, followed by determination of their viability by MTT assay (18Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. G., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1990) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 2.Google Scholar). The parental MDA-MB-468 as well as vector- or clone 1.6-transfected HBC sublines were also treated either with adriamycin (34 μm), taxol (30 μm), cisplatin (10 μg/ml), or etoposide (10 μg/ml) over a range of time points, and their viabilities were determined by MTT assays as described (18Ausubel, F.

Liu D. Black E. Moshier J.A. Majumdar A.P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1083-C1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assessment of the live cells was derived by measuring the absorbance of the converted dye at a wavelength of 570 nm. In addition, the parental MDA-MB-468 as well as vector plasmidtransfected subline or two independent sublines derived from stable transfection of clone 1.6 were separately treated with either 1 μm CD437 or 34 μm adriamycin for 72 h. The parental MDA-MB-468 HBC cells were also independently transduced with retroviruses expressing either CARP-1-myc-His fusion protein or alkaline phosphatase (see below). Cell lysates were prepared from untreated as well as treated cells to determine apoptosis by utilizing cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics). The net absorbances at the suggested wavelengths (A 405 nm minus A 490 nm) were obtained for the lysates derived from treated as well as untreated cells. The histograms indicating levels of apoptosis were generated either by plotting net absorbances or by calculating the “enrichment factor” as suggested by the manufacturer's protocols. The enrichment factor indicating release of mono- and oligonucleosomes following apoptosis was calculated by dividing the net absorbance values from the treated samples by those obtained from untreated controls. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Logarithmically growing parental HBC cells as well as various sublines were either untreated or treated with different agents for the indicated time points. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots of cell lysates containing 1.0 mg of proteins were incubated with indicated antibodies and Sepharose G at 4 °C for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates or the protein extracts were electrophoresed on 9–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels essentially as described before (10Li X.S. Rishi A.K. Shao Z.-M. Dawson M.I. Jong L. Shroot B.

The filters containing protein extracts were independently probed with indicated antibodies per the manufacturer's guidelines and the protocols described before (10Li X.S. Rishi A.K. Shao Z.-M. Dawson M.I. Jong L. Shroot B. Reichert U. Ordonez J.V. Fontana J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5055-5062PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was performed to assess the cell cycle phase distribution as described previously (23Fontana J.A. Sun R.-J. Rishi A.K. Dawson M.I. Ordonez J.V. Zhang Y. Tschang S.-H. Bhalla K. Han Z. Wyche J. Poirer G. Sheikh M.S. Shroot B. Reichert U. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 313-324PubMed Google Scholar). Normally growing parental wild type, the vector plasmid-transfected, c-Myc antisense-transfected sublines, or clone 1.6-transfected HBC sublines were independently stained for DNA content using propidium iodide. After staining, cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan cytometer (San Jose, CA). The data were analyzed using the multicycle program from Phoenix Flow Systems (San Diego, CA). Gene Regulation by CARP-1—To study the downstream targets of CARP-1, Atlas Human 1.2 array membranes (Clontech) with ∼1200 genes were utilized in conjunction with radiolabeled total RNAs from vector pcDNA3/Hygro subline 1 or clone 1.6 subline 9. Total RNAs (3.0 μg) from each subline were separately labeled with [32P]dATP and hybridized with the array membranes essentially following the manufacturer's guidelines. The membranes were washed and autoradiographed for 2 weeks, and the hybridization signals were quantitated utilizing the manufacturer's suggested program. Retroviral Expression of CARP-1—Retroviral gene transfer and expression system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to generate retroviruses expressing CARP-1. First, the entire CARP-1-myc-His-tagged cDNA insert of plasmid clone 6.1 was excised with BamHI and PmeI and ligated into BglII and StuI cut retroviral vector plasmid pLNCX2 to obtain plasmid clone 16.1. Next, the plasmid clone 16.1 or pLAPSN (retroviral vector expressing alkaline phosphatase) were independently transfected into the RetroPack PT67 packaging cells (Clontech), followed by selection of PT67 sublines in the presence of neomycin (500 μg/ml). Multiple, independent sublines or pooled populations expressing either myc-His-tagged CARP-1 or alkaline phosphatase were obtained. The expression of myc-His-tagged CARP-1 protein in each subline was determined by Western immunoblot using anti-His (C-terminal) monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Two independent PT-67 sublines expressing the highest levels of myc-His-tagged CARP-1 (lines 16.4 and 16.6) and one subline expressing alkaline phosphatase were selected for determination of viral titers essentially per the suggested protocols. Immunolocalization of CARP-1—CARP-1 antibodies α1 and α2 were generated (Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) by immunizing rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides containing epitopes RERERERRR (amino acids 320–328) and EDDKEEEERKRQEEI (amino acids 698–712), respectively, of the putative sequences deduced from the CARP-1 cDNA. Localization of CARP-1 in parental HBC cells or HBC subline expressing CARP-1-myc-His fusion protein was studied by immunocytochemical analyses (22Yu Y. Rishi A.K. Turner J.J. Liu D. Black E. Moshier J.A. Majumdar A.P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1083-C1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by utilizing α1 anti-CARP-1 (1:2000 dilution) polyclonal antibody or anti-His-tag (27E8) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), respectively. In addition, α1 anti-CARP-1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) in conjunction with mouse monoclonal antibody for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were utilized to study expression of CARP-1 and PCNA proteins in a human breast cancer biopsy specimen. Dual labeling of CARP-1 and PCNA was carried out as above followed by confocal microscopic analysis to determine expression of CARP-1 and PCNA proteins. The antibody-stained sections were then photographed under different magnifications utilizing Zeiss microscope with attached 35-mm camera for recording the photomicrographs. Isolation of CARP-1 cDNA by Functional Gene Knockout— CD437 is a novel retinoid that utilizes a retinoid receptor-independent mechanism(s) to elicit anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in the HBC cells (6Shao Z.M.

We hypothesized that novel mediators of CD437 signaling exist, and their specific inactivation via overexpression of the transfected antisense cDNA library should lead to resistance to apoptosis by CD437. To accomplish inactivation of rare proteins and those encoded by low abundance mRNAs, poly(A)+ RNAs were used as template for generating a cDNA library such that mRNA species that are present at ∼20 copies per cell are included in the library (14Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). RNAs were prepared from MDA-MB-468 HBC cells treated with CD437 over a range of time points to allow cloning of molecules involved in early, middle, and late signaling events triggered by CD437. CD437 at a concentration of 1 μm was found previously (6Shao Z.M. Dawson M.I. Li X.S. Rishi A.K. Sheikh M.S. Han Q.X. Ordenez J.V. Shroot B. Fontana J.A.

After cDNA library was transfected into HBC cells, stable sublines were selected in the combined presence of hygromycin and CD437 as described (11Rishi A.K. Sun R.-J. Gao Y. Hsu C.K.A. Gerald T.M.

Of the several HBC colonies isolated and propagated to obtain plasmid DNAs, one harbored the recombinant plasmid AS-6 having an ∼0.15-kb insert (positions 1760–1900; Fig. 1). A composite restriction map was created from the human and mouse partial cDNAs in the GenBank™ that were homologous to the insert of the AS-6 plasmid, followed by cloning of the full-length cDNA that encodes a novel 130-kDa protein CARP-1 (Fig. 1). A protein data base search yielded very high homology scores for two putative motifs in the CARP-1 peptide. A sequence of 31 amino acids (from positions 637 to 667) showed 88% alignment with a putative DNA-binding (bihelical) motif predicted to be involved in chromosomal organization. A 41-amino acid sequence (positions 151–191) showed 76% alignment with a putative cold-shock protein domain that function as an RNA-binding domain. The partial mouse cDNA-encoded peptides also contain DNA-binding (bihelical) and cold-shock protein domains that are identical to those present in the human CARP-1 protein. The plasmid expressing myc-His-tagged wild-type CARP-1 having putative cold-shock and DNA-binding motifs was then generated as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” (clone 6.1, Fig. 1). Furthermore, the CARP-1 5′-untranslated region subfragment having part of the protein encoding ORF was RT-PCR-amplified using oligos AS-6.23 and AS-6.25 (Table I) and total RNA from MDA-MB-468 HBC cells. The PCR product was subcloned into pBSK vector plasmid, and multiple independent recombinant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of a translation termination codon located 67 nucleotides upstream and in-frame of the CARP-1 ATG (not shown). Thus, CARP-1 peptide encoded by the plasmid clone 6.1 (see Fig. 1) possesses the com"

The period of reionization started with the ionizing light from the first stars, and it ended when all the atoms in the intergalactic medium had been reionized. The most distant sources of light known at present are galaxies and quasars at redshift z congruent with 6, and their spectra indicate that the end of reionization was occurring just at that time.

These compounds are gaining increasing importance as inducers of different cellular responses (inflammation, proliferation, or cell death). It was the aim of this study to understand their impact on intracellular signal transduction pathways that are responsible for these biological effects. We found that in arterial smooth muscle cells, PGPC and POVPC activated sphingomyelinases, in particular the acid isoform, which is known to participate in the very early phase of apoptotic stress responses. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are involved in induction of stress response and apoptosis were phosphorylated (activated). Finally, activation of caspase 3 was observed, showing that stimulation of smooth muscle cells with POVPC and PGPC is associated with apoptosis. Stimulation of all these enzymes by the oxidized phospholipids almost perfectly matched their activation by minimally modified LDL. Consequently, these phospholipids seem to be responsible for the effect of this particle on cell signaling. Survival and proliferation pathways including NF-κB or AKT kinase were not induced by POVPC and PGPC. Experiments with a specific inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase named NB6 showed that this enzyme plays a central role in mediating the apoptotic effects of the oxidized lipids.

Interaction of SMC with oxidized LDL and the biological consequences thereof are an important issue and much is known about the effects of highly oxidized LDL as a whole particle (6Boullier A.

Whereas highly oxidized LDL is modified at both its lipid and protein part, minimally modified LDL (mmLDL) is mainly oxidized at its lipid part, and thus exhibits unique properties, which are different from those of oxidized LDL (8Leitinger N. Berliner J.A. Keany J., Jr. Oxidative Stress and Vascular Disease, Developments in Cardiovascular Disease. Vol. 224. Kluwer Academic Publishers, London1999Google Scholar). These features might be due to its content in biologically active lipids mainly originating from oxidation of arachidonic acid of the surface phospholipids (9Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M.

As a consequence they are highly exchangeable between cells, tissues, and lipoproteins.

The effects of oxidized phospholipids present in mmLDL on signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells have not been investigated to date. Sphingomyelinases are very early upstream elements of stress-induced cell signaling (14Andrieu-Abadie N. Gouazé V. Salvayre R. Levade T. Free Radic. Biol.

It was the aim of this study to identify the effects of POVPC and PGPC on signal transduction pathways involved in proliferative and apoptotic stress responses of vascular SMC and find out how these phenomena induced by chemically defined compounds are related to the parent (minimally oxidized) lipoprotein particle. We found that POVPC and, to a lesser extent, PGPC activated apoptotic signaling pathways finally leading to caspase 3 activation. They did not stimulate survival and proliferation pathways. More specifically acid sphingomyelinase represents a central element in the POVPC- and PGPC-induced apoptotic signaling cascade. Collectively, our studies suggest that PGPC and especially POVPC are the components that are responsible for the stress effects of mmLDL on SMCs as they mimicked mmLDL in activating the same signaling components.

Cell Culture—Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5 (ATCC number CRL 1444), smooth muscle, thoraic aorta, DBIX Rat; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 25 mm Hepes at 37 °C in humidified CO2 (8%) atmosphere. For SMase experiments and Western blot analysis of cell lysates, cells were growth-arrested by incubation with DMEM + 0.1% FCS for 24 h prior to treatment with POVPC, PGPC, native LDL, minimally modified LDL, or NB6 in DMEM + 10% FCS. Synthesis of Oxidized Phospholipids—POVPC and PGPC were synthesized according to an extensively modified version of the procedure by Watson et al. (9Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F.

Isolation and Modification of Low Density Lipoprotein—Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063) was isolated from pooled fresh plasma using a Beckman NVT-rotor (23Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL was minimally modified as described by Watson et al. (9Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). According to the latter procedure mildly oxidized LDL was obtained. It was characterized by a moderate content of lipid peroxidation products (30–60 nmol of peroxide equivalents/mg of apolipoprotein B (24EL-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and a slightly enhanced relative electrophoretic mobility (REM) (0.34) as compared with native LDL (0.30) in 0.8% agarose-gels and a virtually intact protein moiety. The protein-content of isolated and modified LDL was determined by the method of Lowry (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Sphingomyelinase Activity—Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) were grown in six-well plates until 80% of confluence was reached. Growth was arrested with DMEM + 0.1% FCS for 24 h, and subsequently cells were incubated with either POVPC, PGPC (10 μm each), native LDL, or minimally modified LDL (60 μg apoB/ml) for 15–360 min. For studying the effects of NB6, cells were pretreated with 10 μm of this substance for 30 min. Excess NB6 was removed and cells were then exposed to the oxidized lipids or mmLDL as indicated above. After treatment of the smooth muscle cells with the respective compounds, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, harvested, and lyzed by incubation with either neutral lysis buffer for determination of neutral SMase activity or acid lysis buffer for determination of acid SMase activity as described previously (26Loidl A. Claus R. Deigner H.P. Hermetter A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were subjected to protein quantification according to the method by Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar), and aliquots containing 20 μg of protein were analyzed for acid and neutral sphingomyelinase activity using fluorescent sphingomyelin as described (26Loidl A. Claus R. Deigner H.P. Hermetter A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of Phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AKT/PKB, and Activation of Caspase 3—A7r5 cells were grown in Petri-dishes (d = 10 cm) to 80% confluence in DMEM + 10% FCS, growth arrested for 24 h in DMEM + 0.1% FCS, and, subsequently, incubated with either POVPC, PGPC (10 μm each), or mmLDL (60 μg apoB/ml) for 5, 10, 30, 60, or 240 min in DMEM + 10% FCS. In addition, cells were pretreated with 10 μm NB6 for 30 min before incubation with the respective stimuli. After stimulation cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, harvested, and for MAPK and AKT-kinase/PKB analysis, lyzed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes-Na, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 μm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidin, 10 μg/ml soya bean trypsin inhibitor, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6). For caspase 3 measurement, cell lysis was carried out in a specific lysis buffer from Molecular Probes followed by freezing to –80 °C, thawing, and vortexing. The protein content of cell lysates was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar), and aliquots containing 20 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels using the mini-PROTEAN III electrophoresis cell according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Unspecific binding was blocked by incubation of the blotting membranes with 1% bovine serum albumin in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 volume % Tween 20, pH 8.0). Blots were then incubated with primary antibodies against phosphorylated forms of JNK, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AKT/PKB, or activated caspase 3 in incubation buffer (dilution 1:4000) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobuline (dilution 1:1500). Blots were developed with BCIP/NBT liquid substrate system. Quantification of Caspase 3 Activity—A7r5 cells were seeded into 96 micro well plates employing a cell number of 15,000 cells/well and grown for 24 h in 100 μl DMEM + 10% FCS. Subsequently, the medium was removed and cells were incubated for 2–8 h with a 100 μl suspension of either POVPC or PGPC corresponding to final lipid concentrations of 1, 10, or 50 μm. For inhibition experiments, cells were preincubated with 10 μm NB6 for 30 min prior to addition of oxidized lipid. A 100 μl solution of (Z-DEVD)2-rhodamine 110 in cell lysis/activity buffer was added to each well followed by shaking the plate for 30 min on an Eppendorf thermomixer. After incubation at room temperature for an additional 4 h, fluorescence in the wells was measured (excitation wavelength 485 nm, emission wavelength 530 nm) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 B fluorometer with plate reader equipment. Measurement of NF-κB Activity—For transient transfection, A7r5 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (9.6 cm2), grown to 50–70% confluence, and incubated with the transfection mixture containing 0.3 μg of pNF-κB Luc plasmid, 0.5 μg of pSVβ-galactosidase, and and 4.8 μl of Tfx™-50 transfection reagent per ml of serum-free DMEM (supplemented with HEPES and l-glutamine) for 1 h. Afterward, cells were supplied with fresh medium (DMEM + 10% FCS) and incubated for an additional 48 h followed by stimulation with POVPC, PGPC (10 μm each), or mmLDL (60 μg/ml apoB) for 60–240 min. For termination, stimulated cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lyzed, and scraped. Aliquots of the cell lysates were used to measure luciferase activity. 100 μl of luciferase substrate reagent were mixed gently with 40 μl of the cell lysate, and after a 20 s delay, light emission was measured in a BIOLUMAT LB9500 luminometer from Berthold (Vienna, Austria) using an integration time of 10 s. The background signal obtained by measurement of untransfected cells was substracted. For the β-galactosidase assay 150 μl of cell lysate were mixed with 150 μl of ortho-nitrophenyl-galactopyranoside-reagent by brief vortexing. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of 1 m Tris. The mixture was vortexed again, and the absorbance was read at 420 nm. Luciferase activity was standardized with reference to β-galactosidase activity by dividing luciferase by β-galactosidase activity, and this is reported as a percentage activity compared with control cells. Activation of Sphingomyelinases by Oxidized Phospholipids—Sphingomyelinases are central elements in stress-induced signal transduction leading to apoptosis or proliferation (29Levade T. Jaffrézou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of the pure oxidized phospholipids PGPC and POVPC, which are typically present in minimally oxidized LDL, on acid and neutral sphingomyelinases in smooth muscle cells using fluorescent sphingomyelin as a substrate (26Loidl A. Claus R. Deigner H.P. Hermetter A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Minimally modified LDL and native LDL were applied as control stimuli. In addition, experiments were performed with NB6, which has been shown to specifically inhibit acid sphingomyelinase on the transcriptional level (30Deigner H.P. Claus R. Bonaterra G.A. Gehrke C. Bibak N. Blaess M. Cantz M. Metz J. Kinscherf R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, 10 μm POVPC stimulated activity of acid sphingomyelinase to the same extent as mmLDL (60 μg/ml) after 30 min (180% of control). In contrast, PGPC and native LDL showed only minor effects. The maximum effect of POVPC was reached after 30 min. However, significant activation was already detectable after 5 min (data not shown). After 360 min of incubation with POVPC, aSMase activity returned to control levels. Incubation of smooth muscle cells with 10 μm NB6 for 30 min prior to stimulation with either POVPC, PGPC, or mmLDL led to a decrease of acid sphingomyelinase activity to control levels. The neutral isoform of this enzyme was activated by POVPC and PGPC to the same extent (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, in contrast to the acid isoform, neutral SMase remained activated after 360 min. MmLDL caused substantially higher stimulation as compared with the oxidized phospholipids. In this context, it has to be emphasized that native LDL also strongly activated neutral SMase. Thus, the lipoprotein effect seems not to be specific for the oxidized particle. Treatment of SMC with the acid SMase inhibitor NB6 prior to stimulation with either the oxidized phospholipids or mmLDL did not affect neutral sphingomyelinase activation at all. Influence of POVPC and PGPC on JNK and p38 MAPK— JNK and p38 MAPK belong to the family of MAPKs and mediate apoptotic stress response (31Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3508) Google Scholar). They are supposed to be downstream targets of ceramide and, as a consequence, of sphingomyelinase activity. Thus, we investigated the role of JNK and p38 MAPK in cell signaling triggered by oxidized phospholipids and the potential involvement of acid sphingomyelinase as an upstream element. For this purpose, SMC were exposed to 10 μm POVPC or PGPC or 60 μg/ml mmLDL for 5–30 min with or without pretreatment with NB6 as an inhibitor of aSMase. Fig. 2, A and B show data from the Western blot analysis of cell extracts for phosphorylated (activated) JNK/SAPK (A) and p38 MAPK (B), respectively. The blots clearly demonstrate that mmLDL-induced activation of both JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK is mimicked by POVPC and PGPC, POVPC being the more efficient inducer of phosphorylation (activation). Activation was already observed after 5 min in all cases. Maximum activity was detected after 10 min of incubation. Addition of NB6 to the cells prior to stimulation abolished POVPC-, PGPC-, and mmLDL-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK, indicating that acid sphingomyelinase is essential for SMC signaling initiated by mmLDL and its oxidized phospholipid constituents. Activation of Caspase 3 by Oxidized Phospholids—To provide more direct evidence that the incubation of smooth muscle cells with POVPC or PGPC does, in fact, lead to apoptosis we measured caspase 3 activity after stimulation of the cells with various concentrations (1–50 μm) of POVPC and PGPC for different lengths of time. According to Fig. 3, POVPC induced caspase 3 activation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Maximum caspase 3 activity was reached after incubation with 50 μm POVPC for 6 h. In contrast, caspase 3 was only slightly activated by PGPC. Inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase by NB6 led to a substantial decrease of POVPC-induced caspase 3 activity, providing additional evidence that acid sphingomyelinase seems to be a central element in mediating the apoptotic effect of POVPC. Data obtained from analysis of caspase 3 activity were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4), showing activated caspase 3 in lysates of cells, which have been exposed to the oxidized phospholipids.Fig. 4Western blot analysis of caspase 3. Effects of POVPC and PGPC. A7r5 cells were incubated with POVPC or PGPC (10 μm each) for 4 h. Cells were collected, lyzed, and aliquots containing 20 μg of protein were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti caspase 3 antibody (for a detailed description see “Experimental Procedures”). Data are representative for 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lack of Activation of Proliferative and/or Salvage Pathways—Further experiments were performed to find out whether or not POVPC and PGPC affect survival and proliferation pathways in addition to apoptotic signaling cascades. In this context, activity of NF-κB was measured using a luciferase reporter gene assay. This transcription factor might play a role in atherogenesis because it mediates survival, proliferation and inflammation (21De Martin R. Hoeth M. Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: E83-E88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To make sure that the luciferase expression system worked properly, activation of NF-κB by the cytokine TNF-α was examined, this being a potent activator of NF-κB in many cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells (32Hoshi S. Goto M. Koyama N. Nomoto K.I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 883-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that TNF-α induced NF-κB activity in smooth muscle cells in a time-dependent manner. Stimulation of cells with mmLDL (60 μg apoB/ml) for 60 or 240 min did not lead to any NF-κB-induced luciferase expression. Under the same conditions, NF-κB levels were neither affected by POVPC nor PGPC (10 μm each), coinciding with results obtained by stimulation of the cells with mmLDL. Consequently, we may conclude that the NF-κB pathway is not involved in POVPC- and PGPC-induced signaling. In addition to NF-κB, there are two other components important for survival and proliferation signaling pathways. AKT-kinase/PKB and ERK are protein kinases that participate in cytokine- and growth factor-induced signal transduction leading to proliferation of most cells (19Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to 10 μm of the oxidized lipids or mmLDL (60 μg apoB/ml) neither stimulated ERK nor AKT/PKB. Western blot analysis (Fig. 6) of stimulated cell extracts for the phosphorylated (activated) proteins did not show any differences compared with the controls. These results again confirm the assumption that mmLDL and its biologically active components POVPC and PGPC do not activate signaling pathways responsible for proliferation and/or survival of vascular smooth muscle cells. This work reports on the role of POVPC and PGPC in mmLDL-induced signaling of vascular SMC. We demonstrate that both phospholipids under consideration evoked apoptotic cell death by time- and concentration-dependent induction of caspase 3 activity, albeit to a different extent. POVPC was the more potent apoptotic lipid. Both POVPC and PGPC activated the sphingomyelinase pathway, particularly acid sphingomyelinase, to which an important role in stress-induced apoptosis has been assigned (33Kolesnick R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We found a maximum of SMase activity in SMCs after 30 min of incubation with POVPC and PGPC. A significant increase of aSMase activity (150% of control) was already found after 5–10 min (data not shown). POVPC and PGPC also activated p38 MAPK and JNK, both playing an eminent part in apoptotic signaling. Phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK due to cell stimulation with POVPC and PGPC was again very fast (within 5–30 min), POVPC being more potent than PGPC. POVPC- and PGPC-induced activation of acid SMase could be abrogated by a specific inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (NB6). NB6 also prevented activation of the downstream targets p38 MAPK and JNK. Finally, the execution of apoptosis by caspase 3 could be inhibited by NB6 as well. These results indicate that acid sphingomyelinase is a central mediator in oxidized phospholipid-triggered apoptotic signaling. Survival pathways, based on activation of ERK, NF-κB and AKT-kinase/PKB, were neither activated by POVPC nor PGPC. Obviously, the SMCs are bound to death if these compounds are present in sufficient amounts, e.g. in an atheroma. Remarkably, POVPC and, to a minor extent, PGPC closely mimic the biological activity of mmLDL. They activate the same signaling pathways leading to apoptosis. POVPC might be a component in the oxidized particle, which determines its properties to a major extent. Activation of aSMase and its downstream elements occurs extremely fast (within a few minutes). This might be due to the rapid transfer of the respective lipids into the plasma membrane of the cell. The oxidized phospholipids have only one long hydrophobic side chain in position 1 of glycerol. The fatty acyl chain at position 2 is short and contains either a polar (C = O) or a charged polar (COO–) group. Hence, this chain becomes a part of a tremendously large head group. Consequently, these lipids may be considered highly surface active substances, similar to lysophophatidylcholine, which is also known for its potency to activate signaling and apoptosis (34Hsieh C.C. Yen M.H. Liu H.W. Lau Y.T. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Takahashi M. Okazaki H. Ogata Y. Takeuchi K. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) Activation of sphingomyelinase and its downstream components after 10 min is too fast to be explained in terms of an increased protein expression level. It might rather be due to a direct interaction of the lipids with the plasma membrane or the enzyme itself. On the one hand, accumulation of the oxidized lipids could cause unspecific alterations of membrane composition and, as a consequence, lead to activation of SMase. On the other hand, a direct contact of the lipids with SMase could initiate enzyme activation as well. In this context it has to be emphasized that POVPC is a more efficient stimulant than PGPC. POVPC is able to modify proteins covalently due to its aldehydic group (36Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Similar protein modification by aldehydic groups has already been reported for 4-hydroxynonenal in endothelial cells. This lipid was shown to react with the free aminogroups of the epidermal growth factor receptor leading to activation of the receptor and its associated signaling pathways (37Liu W. Akhand A.A. Kato K. Yokoyama I. Miyata T. Kurokowa K. Uchida K. Nakashima I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Suc I. Meilhac O. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Vandaele J. Jürgens G. Salvayre R. Nègre-Salvayre A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In summary, our data provide strong evidence that POVPC is one of the main biologically active lipids rendering mmLDL apoptotic for vascular SMC. Acid sphingomyelinase has been identified as a key mediator of the involved signaling pathways finally leading to apoptosis of SMC, which is a hallmark in the development of atherosclerosis.

The underlying mechanisms have been extensively investigated. However, the physiological relevance of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. To address the role of CD4 down-modulation in HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo, we have characterized the functional properties of nef alleles isolated from seven HIV-1-infected patients at either the stage of AIDS (late alleles) or during the asymptomatic phase of infection (early alleles). HIV-1 variants carrying these nef alleles showed striking differences in CD4 down-modulation, virus infectivity, and replication properties. Infection of T cells with late strains resulted in production of viral particles with enhanced infectivity, as compared with variants carrying early nef alleles. These differences in infectivity were observed only when viruses were produced in cells with high levels of the viral receptor, suggesting a functional link between CD4 levels and the ability of Nef to down-modulate CD4 and to enhance viral infectivity. Similarly, late nef alleles were substantially more active than early nef genes in stimulating HIV-1 replication in high CD4-positive cells, including primary lymphocytes, but not in cells expressing low levels of the CD4 receptor. Single-round assays showed that differences in infectivity between late and early strains are largely reduced when evaluated in target cells with high levels of CD4, suggesting that the inhibitory effect occurs at the entry step. Supporting this, enhanced CD4 down-modulation by late nef alleles was associated with higher levels of envelope incorporation into viral particles, a phenomenon that likely accounted for the augmented infectivity. Our data suggest a mechanistic link between the Nef-mediated CD4 down-modulation and the enhancement of replication in CD4-positive lymphocytes. As progression to disease occurs, HIV-1 Nef variants with enhanced ability to down-modulate CD4 are selected. These strains efficiently overcome the deleterious effects of CD4 and replicate more aggressively in CD4-positive primary lymphocytes.

Nef transcripts constitute the most abundantly expressed early viral gene, and overall Nef plays the major role in down-modulation of the receptor (14Guatelli J.C. Gingeras T.R. Richman D.D. J.

Furthermore, Nef is the only gene product capable of down-regulating CD4 molecules already present on the cell surface prior to infection. Early studies with SIV 1The abbreviations used are: SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; LTNPs, long-term nonprogressors; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear primary cells; FCS, fetal calf serum; PHA, phytohemag-glutinin; RT, reverse transcriptase; PSL, photo-stimulated luminescence; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.-infected monkeys highlighted the importance of Nef in viral pathogenesis.

Cell. 1991; 65: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that some of the pathologies associated with HIV infection, including immunodeficiency and loss of CD4-positive cells, can be recapitulated in transgenic mice expressing HIV-1 Nef, emphasizing the importance of this protein in HIV pathogenesis (17Hanna Z.

However, it has been difficult to determine which of the in vitro functions of Nef contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 19Wei B. Arora V.K. Foster J.L. Sodora D.L. Garcia J.V. Curr. HIV Res. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to down-modulating the viral receptor, HIV-1 Nef reduces cell surface levels of class I MHC and CD28 (20Schwartz O. Marechal V. Le Gall S. Lemonnier F. Heard J.M. Nat.

A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Studies with monkeys have specifically evaluated the role of CD4 down-modulation in SIV pathogenesis in vivo. Mutations in SIV Nef that disrupt the ability to down-modulate CD4 strongly reduce viremia in infected monkeys and revert efficiently to restore the CD4 down-modulation function (32Iafrate A.J. Carl S. Bronson S. Stahl-Hennig C. Swigut T. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9836-9844Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Insights into the role of Nef in HIV pathogenesis have also come from analysis of long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). The average time of progression to AIDS is about 10 years. However, a small percentage of infected individuals can live free of symptoms for extended periods of time. One study (Sydney Blood Bank Cohort) analyzed the outcome of eight patients infected after receiving blood transfusions from a single donor infected with a Nef-deleted HIV-1 strain. In this study three of the cohort members remained asymptomatic for at least 14–18 years (33Birch M.R. Learmont J.C. Dyer W.B. Deacon N.J. Zaunders J.J. Saksena N. Cunningham A.L. Mills J.

Other examples of LTNPs infected with Nef-deleted viruses have been reported, suggesting that the absence of Nef may dramatically slow the course of disease (35Kirchhoff F. Greenough T.C.

Virol. 2000; 74: 10581-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One study has shown that nef alleles isolated from LTNPs are less efficient in CD4 down-modulation than those found in progressors or asymptomatic carriers (40Tobiume M. Takahoko M. Yamada T. Tatsumi M. Iwamoto A. Matsuda M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5959-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another study has analyzed the modulation of HIV-1 Nef functions during progression to disease. Interestingly, nef alleles isolated at early stages of infection efficiently down-modulate class I MHC. In comparison, nef late alleles isolated after progression to AIDS show enhanced ability to down-modulate CD4 and to stimulate HIV-1 replication in PBMCs, whereas class I MHC down-modulation activity is diminished in late nef alleles (41Carl S. Greenough T.C. Krumbiegel M. Greenberg M. Skowronski J. Sullivan J.L. Kirchhoff F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that down-modulation of class I MHC plays an important role at early stages of infection, in which selective pressure to evade the action of CD8-positive cytotoxic lymphocytes is high. The above studies also suggest that down-modulation of CD4 may influence HIV pathogenesis in vivo. However, these studies have failed to explain why CD4 down-modulation might confer a replicative advantage to HIV-1. Several hypotheses have been presented to address this issue (reviewed in Ref. 42Lama J. Curr. HIV Res. 2003; 1: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Binding to, or cross-linking of CD4 on the surface of infected cells may result in the transduction of signals that inhibit transcription through the HIV long terminal repeat (43Tremblay M. Meloche S. Gratton S. Wainberg M.A. Sekaly R.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These signals may also induce apoptosis and cytopathic effects before release of the new progeny occurs. Alternatively, down-modulation of the CD4 receptor may impede superinfection, a phenomenon that may also jeopardize particle production (44Benson R.E. Sanfridson A. Ottinger J.S. Doyle C. Cullen B.R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). More recent findings suggest that elevated levels of CD4 may interfere with infectivity and release of viral particles (45Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 46Bour S. Perrin C. Strebel K. J. Biol.

To understand the role of CD4 down-modulation in HIV pathogenesis we have functionally characterized nef alleles isolated from seven HIV patients at different stages of infection. To evaluate specifically the contribution of CD4 down-modulation to viral pathogenesis we have utilized an experimental approach where the infectivity of HIV particles is analyzed in producer and target cells expressing varying degrees of CD4. Our results suggest that HIV variants with strong CD4 down-modulation activity, emerging as progression to disease occurs, overcome more efficiently the inhibitory effects of CD4 and, thus, replicate more aggressively in CD4-positive T cells. Cell Lines—Construction of Jurkat T cells expressing different amounts of surface-CD4 has been described before (48Cortes M.J. Wong-Staal F. Lama J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1770-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, Hepes, and 10% fetal calf serum. High CD4 cells were maintained in the presence of Zeocin (0.1 mg/ml) and G418 (0.2 mg/ml), whereas low CD4 cells were grown with G418 alone (0.2 mg/ml) to avoid selection of high CD4 expressor cells. The enrichment/purification procedure was optimized to engineer high CD4 cells with receptor levels about 2-fold higher than those found in human CD4-positive primary lymphocytes, as estimated by flow cytometry. Jurkat-Low-CD4 cells expressed surface-CD4 amounts 25-fold lower than high CD4 cells. Infectivity assays were performed in either MAGIC-5 or MAGIC-5B cells (kindly provided by Dr. M. Matsuda and Dr. M. Tatsumi, Osaka University). These cell lines are derivatives of HeLa CD4-positive cells and express the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter (49Tobiume M. Takahoko M. Tatsumi M. Matsuda M. J. Virol. Methods. 2001; 97: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). MAGIC-5B cells (referred to herein as MAGIC-High-CD4) have CD4 receptor levels 12-fold higher than MAGIC-5 (MAGIC-Low-CD4), as estimated by flow cytometry after staining with CD4-specific antibodies. Viruses—The HIV-1 nef alleles analyzed in this study have been described before (41Carl S. Greenough T.C. Krumbiegel M. Greenberg M. Skowronski J. Sullivan J.L. Kirchhoff F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These samples were obtained from seven individuals from the New England Hemophilia Center at the University of Massachusetts. For each patient, samples were taken at time points when CD4-positive T counts were within the normal range (median, early alleles: 763 ± 125 CD4+ cells/μl) and after declining to less than 200 cells/μl (median, late alleles: 84 ± 31 CD4+ cells/μl). Primary nef alleles were PCR-amplified and used to replace the nef gene in HIV-1 NL4.3. Except in the case of SP7–88, SP7–91, P2–87, and P2–93, which constituted time point representative individual clones, the nef alleles used in these experiments were cloned as pools. Transfections, Virus Preparations, and Infectivity Assays—Virus stocks were produced by calcium phosphate chemical transfection of human kidney fibroblastic CD4-negative 293T cells with HIV-1 NL4.3 plasmids or by electroporation of CD4-positive Jurkat-T cells. When indicated, a CD4 expression plasmid (pCMX-CD4) was included in 293T cells transfection mixtures. Jurkat-T cells were electroporated in 4-mm gap cuvettes with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporation system set at 240 V and 950 microfarads. Unless specified, infection of T cells was performed following a spinoculation method. Briefly, 0.5 × 106 cells were incubated with viral supernatants (2 μg of p24 protein) in 24-well plates in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at room temperature for 90 min (2,500 rpm) in a table-top centrifuge (Sorvall RT6000B). After centrifugation, cells were washed three times with RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then incubated in the same medium for 1–2 days at 37 °C. The amount of p24 antigen in supernatant fluids was estimated with an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Beckman Coulter) and used to normalize samples containing virus. Infection of MAGIC cells was performed for 48 h in the presence of 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. Routinely, after 8 h of infection of target cells 10 μm 3′-azido-3-deoxythymidine was added to block new cycles of virus replication. Infected cells were scored after staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal). Viral Replication Assays—The impact of Nef in viral replication was evaluated in transformed T cell lines (Jurkat, H9, or SupT1) and peripheral blood mononuclear primary cells (PBMCs). Infection of T cell lines was initiated by electroporation with 10 μg of proviral DNA, as described above. Production of p24 in culture supernatants was estimated at regular intervals. Human PBMCs were isolated with a lymphocyte separation medium (Organon Teknika). Immediately afterward, cells were infected with virus stocks containing 2 ng of p24 core antigen and kept in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS. Three days post-infection, cells were stimulated with PHA (4 μg/ml, Sigma). Supernatants were collected at regular intervals, and virus production was measured by reverse transcriptase (RT) assay. The radioactivity level present in each dot was quantitated as photo-stimulated luminescence (PSL) by using a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimaging device as described elsewhere (50Carl S. Daniels R. Iafrate A.J. Easterbrook P. Greenough T.C. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Surface staining of CD4 was performed with either OKT4 mAb, followed by addition of goat anti-mouse Cy-5-conjugated antibody, or with CD4-V4 mAb (R-phycoerythrin-conjugated, BD Biosciences). The epitopes recognized by these mAbs do not overlap with the gp120-binding domain (51Saggioro D. Sorio C. Calderazzo F. Calleagro L. Panozzo M. Berton G. Chieco-Bianchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1368-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular staining of p24 was performed with a p24-specific mAb (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated KC57 clone, Coulter) using a cell permeabilization kit following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Caltag Laboratory). After staining, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed in a FACS Calibur system (BD Biosciences) running with CellQuest software. Detection of Virion-bound Env and CD4 Proteins—Incorporation of viral and cellular proteins into viral membranes was determined with a quantitative p24 virion-binding ELISA assay. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of carbonate buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm NaN3 (pH 9.6)) containing 7.5 μg/ml of either goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Wells were washed five times with PBS and then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After one wash with PBS, plates were incubated with 100 μl of either 20 μg/ml anti-CD4 mAb (OKT4) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum (DMEM-HS) or anti-gp120 mAb (b12, National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Program) in DMEM medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (DMEM-FCS). After 150 min at 37 °C, wells were washed five times with bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then 100 μl of virus-containing supernatants were added (10 ng/ml p24 antigen). After 1 h at 37 °C, unbound HIV virions were washed six times with RPMI 1640 containing 1% FCS. Bound virions were lysed for 1 h at room temperature with 250 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. At this step lysates were frozen at –20 °C until quantification of bound p24 was performed with an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (BD Biosciences). Nonspecific binding was estimated by coating wells with either mouse IgG or human IgG (SouthernBiotech). Additional controls for nonspecific binding were performed by estimating the capture of Env-defective virions to anti-gp120 mAb-coated plates. Statistical Analysis—Mean values from early and late strains were compared with the paired T-Student test with software available in Microsoft Excel 98. In Vivo Selection of HIV Viruses with Enhanced CD4 Down-modulation Activity—A previous study (41Carl S. Greenough T.C. Krumbiegel M. Greenberg M. Skowronski J. Sullivan J.L. Kirchhoff F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) has evaluated a set of nef alleles isolated from PBMC samples taken from seven HIV-infected patients either early after infection when CD4+ counts were normal and no symptoms were present (early alleles), or after declining to less than 200 counts/μl at the stage of AIDS (late alleles). Primary nef alleles were PCR-amplified and cloned into HIV-1 NL4.3 proviral constructs. To address whether subtle variations in the CD4 down-modulation activity of Nef may influence the ability of the virus to eliminate the receptor in the context of an HIV infection, we evaluated the extent of CD4 down-modulation in Jurkat T cells infected with HIV-1 NL4.3 strains. Isogenic NL4.3 proviral constructs differing solely in their nef genes were used to transfect 293T cells. The viral progeny was harvested and used to infect Jurkat T cells. The extent of CD4 down-modulation in p24-positive infected cells (region R4) was evaluated after staining with CD4-specific antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). For comparison, Jurkat cells infected with a Nef-defective NL4.3 virus were also analyzed (Fig. 1C). In a representative experiment the mean CD4 levels in cells infected with the NL4.3 P10–96 late strain were half of those found on the surface of cells infected with the strain carrying the corresponding early nef allele P10–84 (mean CD4 levels: 109 and 205, respectively). Analysis of cells infected with the different alleles revealed that all the strains maintained the ability to reduce surface-CD4 beyond the levels achieved by Nef-defective viruses (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, CD4 receptor levels were significantly lower in cells infected with HIV-1 late strains (130 ± 9), as compared with their early versions (190 ± 25, p = 0.04). These findings suggest that subtle variations in the CD4 down-modulation activity of Nef that are selected during disease progression may impact the ability of the virus to eliminate the receptor from the surface of infected cells.Fig. 2CD4-dependent enhancement of infectivity in HIV-1 strains carrying late nef alleles. Jurkat-High-CD4 cells were infected for 24 h with NL4.3 isogenic viruses differing in their nef alleles. In A, CD4 down-modulation 24 h after infection was evaluated by flow cytometry as shown in Fig. 1. Viral supernatants produced during the 8- to 24-h period after infection were harvested and used to infect either MAGIC-Low-CD4 (B), or MAGIC-High-CD4 target cells (D), with equal amounts of p24 antigen protein. Eight hours after infection 10 μm 3′-azido-3-deoxythymidine was added to impede further rounds of infection. Infectivity was estimated after 48 h by scoring the number of blue foci after X-gal staining. CD4-surface levels estimated by flow cytometry after staining with CD4-specific mAb (OKT4) in mock-infected MAGIC-Low-CD4 and MAGIC-High-CD4 are compared in C. Control staining with isotypic IgG is shown (dotted line). E and F show an experiment in which the infectivity of HIV-1 strains produced in Jurkat-Low-CD4 cells was analyzed in target MAGIC-Low-CD4 cells (F). CD4 down-modulation in Jurkat-Low-CD4 producer cells was evaluated at 24 h post infection (E). Nef alleles are grouped into early (gray columns) and late-stage (dark columns). Values represent the average from duplicate experiments with error bars indicating standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nef-mediated CD4 Down-modulation Enhances Infectivity of HIV-1—We have previously reported that expression of CD4 in virus producer cells leads to decreased HIV-1 infectivity (47Lama J.

To address whether enhanced CD4 down-modulation by late nef alleles may lead to augmented HIV-1 infectivity, we utilized an in vitro system in which viral particles are produced from T cells expressing varying amounts of CD4 (Fig. 2). HIV-1 NL4.3 particles produced in CD4-negative 293T cells were used to infect Jurkat-High-CD4 cells. These cells express surface-CD4 levels 2-fold higher than those observed in CD4-positive lymphocytes, as estimated by flow cytometry (48Cortes M.J. Wong-Staal F. Lama J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1770-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After 24 h of infection of Jurkat cells viral supernatants were harvested and the amount of p24 antigen protein estimated by ELISA. The infectivity of these particles was determined by infecting MAGIC-Low-CD4 cells with equal amounts of p24 protein and scoring the number of blue foci (Fig. 2B). All the HIV-1 strains carrying late nef alleles showed significantly enhanced infectivities, as compared with their early variants (3- to 7-fold, average increase 4.2-fold, p = 0.0002). Interestingly, differences in infectivity were largely reduced when the same viruses were analyzed in the target cells MAGIC-High-CD4, expressing surface-CD4 levels 12-fold higher than MAGIC-Low-CD4 (Fig. 2, C and D) (early: 136 ± 7; late: 177 ± 13 blue foci/ng of p24; p = 0.015).

https://openalex.org/W2057152378,"NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like protein that controls vital biological events through its conjugation to target proteins. We previously identified a negative regulator of the NEDD8 conjugation system, NUB1, which works by recruiting NEDD8 and its conjugates to the proteasome for degradation. Recently, we found its splicing variant, NUB1L. It possesses an insertion of 14 amino acids that codes for a UBA domain. Structural study revealed that NUB1 has a NEDD8-binding site at the C terminus, whereas NUB1L has an additional site at the newly generated UBA domain. Interestingly, the sequence A(X 4)L(X 10)L(X 3)L was conserved in these NEDD8-binding sites among human and other mammals. Mutational studies revealed that at least three Leu residues in the conserved sequence are required for binding with NEDD8. Functional study suggested that the NEDD8-binding ability at the C terminus of NUB1 and NUB1L is mainly involved in the down-regulation of NEDD8, but the NEDD8-binding ability at the UBA2 domain of NUB1L is minimally or not involved at all. The NEDD8-binding ability at the UBA2 domain might be required for an unknown function of NUB1L.

Functional study suggested that the NEDD8-binding ability at the C terminus of NUB1 and NUB1L is mainly involved in the down-regulation of NEDD8, but the NEDD8-binding ability at the UBA2 domain of NUB1L is minimally or not involved at all. The NEDD8-binding ability at the UBA2 domain might be required for an unknown function of NUB1L. NEDD8 is a highly conserved 81-amino acid protein that shares 60% identity and 80% homology with ubiquitin. NEDD8 conjugates to a large number of target proteins (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and this conjugation is thought to be catalyzed by four enzymes, NEDD8-carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (2Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), NEDD8-activating enzyme, NEDD8-conjugating enzyme, and NEDD8-ligating enzyme, in a manner analogous to ubiquitination and sentrinization (also known as SUMO-conjugation) (3Yeh E.T.H. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). So far, all of the known NEDD8 targets are cullin family members, and these include Cul-1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, and -5 (4Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S.

Each cullin family member appears to be a component of the SCF complex, a ubiquitin E3 ligase composed of Skp1, Cullin, F-box protein, and ROC1 (also called RBX1 or HRT1) (3Yeh E.T.H. Gong L.

For example, Cul-1 is a major component of an SCF complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination of IκBα, β-catenin, and p27 (Kip1) (7Pagano M.

Recently, several groups reported that NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-1 is required for the ubiquitin-ligase activity of the Cul-1-containing SCF complex (10Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the NEDD8 conjugation system is involved in many important biological functions. Indeed, the NEDD8 conjugation system was shown to be essential for cell cycle progression and morphogenesis in mice (14Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and for eye development in Drosophila (15Ou C.Y. Lin Y.F. Chen Y.J. Chien C.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel down-regulator of the NEDD8 conjugation system, NUB1 (NEDD8 ultimate buster-1), using a yeast two-hybrid system with NEDD8 as bait (16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NUB1 is a NEDD8-interacting protein composed of 601 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 69.1 kDa. It is an interferon-inducible protein and predominantly localizes in the nucleus. In a biochemical analysis, we found that NUB1 overexpression led to a severe reduction in the NEDD8 monomer and its conjugates in cells (16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this reduction was completely blocked by proteasome inhibitors (17Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that NUB1 interacted with the 19 S proteasome activator (PA700) (17Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that NUB1 recruits NEDD8 and its conjugates to the proteasome for degradation, making NUB1 a down-regulator in the NEDD8 conjugation system. The ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain is a small domain of about 40 residues that was initially identified in ubiquitination enzymes, including E2s, E3s, and other proteins linked to ubiquitination (18Buchberger A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Human NUB1 has two UBA domains, whereas NUB1 homologues of other species such as mouse (accession number: AF534114), Drosophila (accession number: AE003752), and Arabidopsis (accession number: AC007295) have three UBA domains. This suggests that there is an isoform of human NUB1 with three UBA domains. To isolate isoforms of NUB1, we recently screened the human cDNA library by plaque hybridization and identified a splicing variant of NUB1 that encodes a longer protein, termed NUB1L (accession number: AF459743). In the studies described here, we characterized NUB1L and compared NUB1 and NUB1L. Cell Culture—HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and COS-M6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Antibodies—Mouse anti-RH antibody (specific for the amino acid sequences RGSHHHH and GGSHHHH) was purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA). Mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M5) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). GST-12, mouse monoclonal antibody specific for glutathione S-transferase (GST), was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-human NUB1 antiserum was generated by immunization with a GST fusion protein of NUB1 corresponding to amino acids 432–601 (16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody (specific for the C-terminal actin fragment) was purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—To express proteins tagged with epitope at the N terminus in mammalian cells, pcDNA3/RH-N and pcDNA3/FLAG-N were used as described previously (17Kamitani T.

To express NUB1L, the cDNA insert was subcloned into pcDNA3/RH-N from pBK-CMV/NUB1L, which was isolated by cDNA library screening. The other human cDNAs used in this report were described previously. These include ubiquitin (20Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), NEDD8 (1Kamitani T. Kito K.

These cDNAs were inserted into the aforementioned plasmid vectors, and the plasmids were transfected into COS-M6 cells or HeLa cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The transfected cells were harvested for immunostaining or Western blotting 20 h after transfection. Screening of cDNA Library by Plaque Hybridization—A human testis cDNA library constructed in the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with the probe of NUB1 cDNA fragment, which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Approximately 1 × 106 plaques were transferred to Hybond-N+ replicated filters (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were hybridized with the probe in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and washed in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed at –80 °C. Determination of Ubiquitin-like Domain and Ubiquitin-associated Domain—Ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains were determined by the ProfileScan program. Ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains were determined by the SMART program. These programs are available via the World Wide Web. RT-PCR—To detect messages of NUB1 and its isoform NUB1L in various human tissues, RT-PCR was performed using specific primers. For NUB1, a forward primer A (5′-CAGAGAGGAACTGGCCCAA-3′) and a reverse primer B (5′-GTACACCAATCGGTCAATG-3′) were used. For NUB1L, a forward primer A (5′-CAGAGAGGAACTGGCCCAA-3′) and a reverse primer C (5′-CTTCAGGGCCTCATCCAAGTTC-3′) were used. As a template, human multipanel cDNAs were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Two microliters of human multipanel cDNA was used for each PCR in a final volume of 15 μl in the presence of 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 2% Me2SO, and 0.15 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega). The PCR condition was 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. As a control, we amplified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA using a forward primer (5′-GTGGAGTCCACTGGCGTCTT-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-TGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC-3′). The amplified products were loaded onto 1% agarose gel, followed by staining with ethidium bromide. Treatment with Proteasome Inhibitors—N-Acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL) was purchased from Sigma. MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). 1 × 106 COS-M6 cells were transfected by FuGENE6. After overnight culture, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing proteasome inhibitor such as LLnL (50 μm), MG132 (20 μm), or lactacystin (10 μm). The transfectants were cultured at 37 °C with these proteasome inhibitors for 6 h. Then the cells were harvested, and the total cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis. Western Blotting—Protein samples were treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 150 μl of 2% SDS-treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. After SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was performed using the protocol provided with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). As a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used. Immunostaining—Immunocytochemical staining was performed by the avidin-biotin-HRP complex (ABC-HRP) method, using the Vectastain ABC kit system (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Transfected HeLa cells on a coverslip were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at 4 °C and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS containing 5% H2O2 for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and then washed with PBS. The cells were incubated for 10 min with PBS containing 5% horse serum for blocking, followed by additional incubation with anti-RH antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and treated with the ABC reagent (avidin-biotin-HRP complex) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the enzymatic disclosing procedure was performed as reported previously (25Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Using PCR, we prepared cDNAs of the mutated NUB1 and NUB1L shown in Fig. 8. To examine the in vivo interaction of NEDD8 with these mutants, the yeast MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech) was used as described previously (26Kito K. Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 303-314Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cDNA of NEDD8-G was subcloned into pGADT7 (Gal4 DNA-activating domain vector for Gal4-AD fusion) from pcDNA3/HA-NEDD8-G (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), whereas the cDNA of each mutant of NUB1 and NUB1L was subcloned into pGBKT7 (Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector for Gal4-BD fusion). The plasmids for the two fusion constructs were cotransfected into AH109 yeast cells using the lithium acetate method (27Geitz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown on a His–/Trp–/Leu– synthetic agar plate for 3 days at 30 °C. The specific protein-protein interaction was determined by the growth of the cells on the selection plate. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed according to manual of the manufacturer (Clontech). The β-galactosidase expression levels in liquid yeast cultures were measured in six independent transformants. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Leu-to-Ala substitutions were generated in NUB1 at Leu-573 and Leu-577 and in NUB1L at Leu-464, Leu-468, Leu-587, and Leu-591. The cDNAs of wild type NUB1 and NUB1L were mutated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (28Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mutated cDNAs were subcloned into pTrcHis (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3/RH-N (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assay—RH-tagged proteins and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using pTrcHis plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pGEX-2TK plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed by brief sonication. The GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (28Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crude bacterial lysate containing RH-tagged proteins was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins on the beads were solubilized in sample treating buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-RH antibody. Domain Structure of Human NUB1 and Its Homologues in Other Species—To examine NUB1 homologues in other species, we searched the protein data base of GenBank™ and found the homologous sequences of Drosophila and Arabidopsis. These homologues had three UBA domains. In addition, we found the mouse homologue BS4 (accession number: U27462) in the data base. On the basis of the cDNA sequence, BS4 is composed of 677 amino acids. Unlike NUB1 and the other homologues we examined, BS4 had a longer C-terminal region next to the UBA repeat. In the C-terminal region, BS4 shared no homology to other homologues, implying sequencing errors in the BS4 cDNA. To confirm this, we isolated and sequenced the cDNA from the testis cDNA library of BALB/c mouse. It revealed that the cDNA isolated in our laboratory was not identical to that of BS4. In particular, we found six differences in the coding region between the sequences. All the differences appeared to result from the sequencing errors of BS4, which in turn caused a frameshift. The cDNA and protein sequences of our clone were submitted to GenBank™ (accession number: AF534114). We termed the gene product “mouse NUB1.” It is composed of 614 amino acids and possesses three UBA domains, as do the Drosophila homologue and the Arabidopsis homologue (Fig. 1). In the data base, we could not find any NUB1 homologues containing two UBA domains (Fig. 1). cDNA Cloning of NUB1 Isoform—Whereas human NUB1 has two UBA domains, a search for NUB1 homologues in the protein data base of GenBank™ revealed that the homologues in other species have three UBA domains, as described above (Fig. 1). This observation suggested that there is an isoform of human NUB1 possessing three UBA domains. To isolate this possible isoform of NUB1, we recently screened the human testis cDNA library by plaque hybridization and obtained seven positive clones. Subsequent analysis by DNA sequencing showed that three of the seven clones had a 3113-bp insert containing a single open reading frame from nucleotides 78 to 1883 (Fig. 2, Clone 1). The cDNA sequence of Clone 1 was identical to that of NUB1, which was previously reported by our group (accession number: AF300717) (16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Another two of the seven clones had a 2687-bp insert containing a single open reading frame from nucleotides 37 to 1842 (Fig. 2, Clone 2 (accession number: AY129295)). Although the non-coding regions at both the 5′- and 3′-ends were shorter than those of Clone 1, its coding region (nucleotides 37–1842) was identical to that of Clone 1 (nucleotides 78–1883). The remaining two of the seven clones had a 3114-bp insert containing a single open reading frame from nucleotides 37 to 1884 (Fig. 2, Clone 3 (accession number: AF459743)). The non-coding region at the 5′-end (nucleotides 1–36) was identical to that of Clone 2 (nucleotides 1–36), whereas the non-coding region at the 3′ end (nucleotides 1885–3114) was identical to that of Clone 1 (nucleotides 1884–3113). The coding region of Clone 3 was 42 bp longer than that of Clone 1 and Clone 2 because of a single insertion from nucleotides 1390 to 1431. As a result, Clone 3 coded for a longer form of NUB1 that had an insertion of 14 amino acids. We termed this isoform NUB1L. Alternative Splicing of NUB1 Gene and the Domain Structure of Its Product—To determine how the cDNA of NUB1L was generated, we searched the genomic data base of GenBank™ and found the genomic sequence of human NUB1 in chromosome 7q36 (accession number: AC005486). Sequence analysis revealed that the NUB1 gene was composed of 15 exons and that the 42-bp insertion in the NUB1L cDNA was generated by alternative splicing of an extended exon 12 of the NUB1 gene. As described above, the 42-bp insertion of the cDNA resulted in a 14-amino acid insertion between residue 451 and 452 in the protein sequence of NUB1 (Fig. 1, see also Fig. 8C). This short insert in NUB1L led to the generation of an additional UBA domain (termed UBA2) between the two original UBA domains (termed UBA1 and UBA3). Thus, we found a novel isoform, NUB1L, containing three UBA domains as initially expected (see Figs. 1 and 8C). Subcellular Localization of NUB1L—The subcellular localization of NUB1L was determined in HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid containing an insert of RH-NUB1L cDNA. As controls, we transfected HeLa cells with either an expression plasmid alone or a plasmid containing an insert of RH-USP21 or RH-NUB1 cDNA. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-RH antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, RH-USP21 was detected equally in both the cytosol and the nucleus, whereas RH-NUB1 and RH-NUB1L were mainly found in the nucleus. The nuclear localization of NUB1 and NUB1L is consonant with the fact that both molecules have an NLS located from Arg-414 to Arg-431 (16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, NUB1 and NUB1L were also detected weakly in the cytosol. Tissue Distribution of NUB1 and NUB1L—To identify the expression of NUB1 and NUB1L, we employed RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4B, the NUB1 message was detected almost equally in all examined tissues other than the pancreas (lane 13). In contrast, the NUB1L message could not be detected equally. The NUB1L message in the prostate (lane 3), leukocyte (lane 7), liver (lane 10), and skeletal muscle (lane 11) was detected much less than that in the other tissues. Activity of NUB1L in the Down-regulation of NEDD8 Expression—The COS cell coexpression assay was used to examine the functions of NUB1 and NUB1L. In brief, FLAG-tagged NEDD8 was coexpressed in COS cells with empty vector, RH-tagged glucocorticoid receptor (GR), NUB1, or NUB1L. As shown in Fig. 5A, when FLAG-NEDD8 was expressed with empty vector (lane 2) or RH-tagged GR (lane 3), we clearly detected a 7.0-kDa band of unconjugated FLAG-NEDD8 and high molecular mass bands of NEDD8-conjugated proteins. This NEDD8 expression pattern was identical to the one we observed previously (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). When FLAG-NEDD8 was coexpressed with RH-NUB1 (lane 4) or RH-NUB1L (lane 5), both the unconjugated and conjugated forms of NEDD8 were dramatically reduced. This result suggested that NUB1 and NUB1L possess the ability to down-regulate the expression of NEDD8 monomer and its conjugates. As controls, we also coexpressed FLAG-tagged ubiquitin or sentrin-3 with empty vector, RH-GR, RH-NUB1, or RH-NUB1L. As shown in Fig. 5 (B and C), the overexpression of NUB1 and NUB1L did not reduce the expression of ubiquitin or sentrin-3 (lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the down-regulation induced by NUB1 and NUB1L was specific to NEDD8. We previously reported that the reduction of NEDD8 expression by NUB1 was completely blocked by proteasome inhibitors (17Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of the proteasome in NUB1 function. In this article, we examined the same possible involvement in NUB1L function. RH-NUB1L was coexpressed with FLAG-NEDD8 in COS cells in the absence or presence of various proteasome inhibitors, including N-acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL), MG132, and lactacystin. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6, the overexpression of NUB1L led to a dramatic reduction of NEDD8 expression (lane 2 versus lane 3). As expected, all of the proteasome inhibitors prevented the reduction in NEDD8 conjugates caused by NUB1L overexpression (lanes 4–6). However, they did not restore the levels of unconjugated NEDD8. This is probably because the unconjugated NEDD8 was quickly consumed for the conjugation of its targets during the treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Increased Interaction of NUB1L with NEDD8 —In our initial study, we isolated the cDNA of the C-terminal fragment (Glu-372 to Asn-601) of NUB1 by a yeast two-hybrid screening using NEDD8 as bait (16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This indicated that the NEDD8-binding site is located on this C-terminal region of NUB1. We therefore hypothesized that the inserted sequence in the C-terminal region of NUB1L may exert an influence on its interaction with NEDD8. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction of NEDD8 with the C-terminal region of NUB1 (termed NUB1c) or NUB1L (termed NUB1Lc) by a liquid culture assay of the yeast two-hybrid system in which β-galactosidase activity was measured to quantify the interaction. Before the assay, we prepared cDNAs of NUB1c and NUB1Lc. NUB1c is the C-terminal fragment (Glu-372 to Asn-601) of NUB1, and NUB1Lc is the C-terminal fragment (Glu-372 to Asn-615) of NUB1L. These cDNAs were inserted into a plasmid, pGBKT7 (Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector for Gal4-BD fusion). We also used a plasmid, pGADT7 (Gal4 DNA-activating domain vector for Gal4-AD fusion), in which a cDNA of NEDD8-G had been inserted (pGADT7/NEDD8-G). Because NEDD8-G has a C-terminal deletion from Gly-76 to Gln-81 and is unable to form conjugates with target proteins, its use allowed us to examine the interaction of NUB1c and NUB1Lc with NEDD8 itself, not with the target proteins of NEDD8 (1Kamitani T.

For the yeast two-hybrid assay, yeast cells were cotransformed with pGADT7/NEDD8-G and pGBKT7 plasmid described above. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 7A, yeast cells transformed with pGADT7/NEDD8-G alone (negative control) produced low levels of β-galactosidase. Yeast cells transformed with pGADT7/NEDD8-G and pGBKT7/HHR23B (negative control) also produced low levels of β-galactosidase due to the lack of interaction between NEDD8 and HHR23B. In contrast, yeast cells transformed with pGADT7/NEDD8-G and pGBKT7/NUB1c displayed high levels of β-galactosidase because of the interaction between NEDD8 and NUB1c.

However, the signaling mechanism of α-MSH action has not yet been clearly elucidated. Here, we have investigated signaling pathways by which α-MSH inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-α production in leukocytes such as THP-1 cells. We focused on the possible roles of protein kinase A (PKA), p38 kinase, and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling. In THP-1 cells, LPS is known to activate p38 kinase, which in turn activates NFκB to induce TNF-α production. We found that pretreatment of cells with α-MSH blocked LPS-induced p38 kinase and NFκB activation as well as TNF-α production. This response was proportional to α-MSH receptor expression levels, and addition of an α-MSH receptor antagonist abolished the inhibitory effects. In addition, α-MSH treatment activated PKA, and PKA inhibition abrogated the inhibitory effects of α-MSH on p38 kinase activation, NFκB activation, and TNF-α production. Taken together, our results indicate that stimulation of PKA by α-MSH causes inhibition of LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and NFκB to block TNF-α production.

However, the molecular mechanism of intracellular signal transduction leading to the anti-inflammatory action of α-MSH is not yet clearly understood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major inflammatory molecule that triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α in various cell types (21Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 22Hawiger J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 99-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In monocytes and macrophages, LPS is known to stimulate TNF-α production by activating mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase subtypes including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (23White J.E.

Among the MAP kinase subtypes, specific inhibitors for p38 kinase have been shown to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production (26Salituro F.G. Germann U.A. Wilson K.P. Bemis G.W. Fox T. Su M.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 807-823PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rutault K. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. J. Biol.

Chhajlani V. Gantz I. Rajora N. Demitri M.T. Kelly L. Zhao H. Ichiyama T. Catania A. Lipton J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1289-R1294PubMed Google Scholar), and the inhibitory effects of α-MSH are mediated by the inhibition of NFκB, which stimulates TNF-α production at the transcriptional level (29Luger T.A.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the signaling pathway by which α-MSH blocks TNF-α production is not clearly understood, the above observations suggest the possibility that α-MSH blocks LPS-induced TNF-α production by modulating MAP kinase and NFκB activation. Accordingly, we have investigated the functional relationships among PKA, p38 kinase, and NFκB in the antiinflammatory action of α-MSH within inflammatory leukocytes (i.e. macrophages and neutrophils). For this purpose, we treated THP-1 and HL-60 cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or Me2SO, which induces differentiation into macrophages and neutrophils, respectively. Using these cells, we found that activation of PKA by α-MSH inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α production in differentiated THP-1 cells by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and subsequent NFκB activation to block TNF-α production. However, the differentiated HL-60 cells expressing lower expression of MC1R did not show the significant effect of α-MSH on the activation of p38 kinase and NFκB. To our knowledge, this would appear to be the first report to show that p38 kinase is a major signaling molecule that transduces α-MSH-mediated anti-inflammatory intracellular signal to the nucleus by inhibiting the NF-κB activation and TNF-α production.

The α-MSH antagonist, GHRP-9, and MC3R antagonist, SHU9119, were purchased from Bachem (Bubendrof, Switzerland). Cell Culture—HL-60 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were treated with 1.25% Me2SO for 6 days to induce differentiation into neutrophils (31Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% β-mercaptoethanol were treated with 150 nm PMA for 3 days to induce differentiation into macrophages (32Kurosaka K. Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6245-6249PubMed Google Scholar). The differentiated neutrophils and macrophages were treated with LPS to induce TNF-α production in the absence and presence of various pharmacological reagents as indicated below. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from differentiated HL-60 and THP-1 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA was performed with SuperScript II+ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). TNF-α primers were: forward, 5′-CAGAGGGAAGAGTCCCCCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTTGGTCTGGTAGGAGACG-3′. PCR amplification consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 58 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 30 s.

MC5R primers were: forward, 5′-TGATAGCAGACGCCTTGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTGAGGGCAAGAAAGCAT-3′. PCR amplification consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s; 56 °C for 45 s; and 72 °C for 45 s. Human β-actin primers (positive control) were: forward, 5′-ATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGGTCACACTTCATGATGC-3′. PCR amplification consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s; 56 °C for 45 s; and 72 °C for 45 s. Western Blot Analysis—Differentiated HL-60 and THP-1 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Equivalent amounts of protein (30 μg) were size-fractionated in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 (0.05%) and blotted with the appropriate antibodies. The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). NFκB Luciferase Assay—NFκB activity was also directly determined by reporter gene assay. Briefly, differentiated THP-1 cells were electroporated with a plasmid containing a luciferase gene and three tandem serum response element repeats or a control vector. The transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h and untreated or treated with various pharmacological reagents as indicated in each experiment, and luciferase activity was determined by using a luciferase reporter gene assay kit from promega (Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation Assay—Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and protease inhibitors (1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysates were precipitated with antibody against IKK-α. Immune complexes were collected using protein A/G-agarose beads. Kinase Assay for IKK and PKA—Differentiated THP-1 cells were lysed, and IKK was immunoprecipitated as described above. IKK activity was determined by resuspending immune complexes in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij 35, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 m NaCl) and conducting kinase reactions for 30 min at 30 °C by adding 10 μCi/μl[γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of bacterially expressed GST-IκB-α as a substrate. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. PKA activity was determined by measuring the transfer of [32P]-labeled phosphates to a phosphocellulose filter-bound peptide substrate using the SignaTECT PKA assay kit. Briefly, the kinase reaction was initiated by adding 25 μg of proteins with 100 μm biotinylated Kemptide (LRRASLG) to 25 μl of reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 12.5 μl of 7.5 m guanidine hydrochloride. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted to a phosphocellulose filter, and PKA activity was measured using an LS 6000TA liquid scintillation counter. α-MSH Inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α Production in THP-1 Cells—We first investigated α-MSH receptor (MC1R) expression levels in Me2SO-treated HL-60 and PMA-treated THP-1 cells, i.e. cells that had been caused to differentiate into macrophages and neutrophils, respectively. RT-PCR using primers specific to MC1R mRNA yielded the expected 495-bp product. The mRNA expression levels of MC1R in differentiated THP-1 cells were significantly higher than those in differentiated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1A). The expression levels of MC1R protein determined by Western blot analysis also indicated that PMA-treated THP-1 cells expressed significantly more MC1R than did Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the observations by others (25MacKenzie S. Fernandez-Troy N. Espel E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 1026-1032PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nagahira A. Nagahira K. Murafuji H. Abe K. Magota K. Matsui M. Oikawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), LPS treatment caused TNF-α production in both PMA-treated THP-1 cells and Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. To examine the role of α-MSH in LPS-induced TNF-α production, we incubated cells with α-MSH for 24 h prior to stimulation with LPS. As shown in Fig. 1C, α-MSH treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced TNF-α production in PMA-treated THP-1 cells. However, α-MSH did not significantly affect LPS-induced TNF-α production in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the ability of α-MSH to block LPS-induced TNF-α production is dependent on the levels of its receptor expression. α-MSH Blocks LPS-induced TNF-α Production by Inhibiting p38 Kinase Signaling—LPS is known to stimulate TNF-α production in monocytes and macrophages by activating MAP kinase signaling (21Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 27Rutault K. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether α-MSH inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α production by modulating LPS-induced p38 kinase activation. As expected, Western blot analysis showed that LPS treatment activated p38 kinase in both differentiated THP-1 cells and HL-60 cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with α-MSH (50 nm) prior to LPS stimulation significantly reduced the amount of activated p38 kinase in PMA-treated THP-1 cells but not in Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the ability of α-MSH to block LPS-induced p38 kinase activity is proportional to the levels of its receptor expression, which is consistent with the previous set of experimental results. We further confirmed the significance of the inhibition of LPS-induced p38 kinase activation by α-MSH in TNF-α production by a p38 inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3, α-MSH inhibited LPS-induced p38 kinase activation (Fig. 3A) and TNF-α-production (Fig. 3C) in PMA-treated THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, direct inhibition of LPS-induced p38 kinase activation with specific inhibitor PD169316 also blocked LPS-induced p38 kinase activation (Fig. 3A) and TNF-α production (Fig. 3D) in a dose-dependent manner. The results from multiple Western blots were scanned and quantified. The densitometric analysis indicated that the phospho-p38 kinase levels were reduced to 27–31% and 25–28% of the control level (treated with LPS only) by 50 nm α-MSH and 2 μm PD169316 (Fig. 3B). The results suggest that the inhibition of p38 kinase by α-MSH contributes to the inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production in PMA-treated THP-1 cells.Fig. 3Inhibition of LPS-stimulated p38 kinase activation by α-MSH causes the blockade of TNF-α production. PMA-treated THP-1 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of α-MSH for 24 h (upper panel) or PD169316 for 30 min (lower panel) and then stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Expression levels of p38 and phosphorylated p38 kinase (pp38) were determined by Western blot analysis (A). Blots of pp38 in A were scanned, and the band intensities were quantitated. The band intensity values were used to determine the relative amount of pp38. The relative value of pp38 protein is expressed as the percentage of that in the presence of LPS only; *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus the value in the presence of LPS only (B). Transcript levels for TNF-α and β-actin were determined by RT-PCR in PMA-treated THP-1 cells pretreated with the indicated concentrations of α-MSH for 24 h (C) or PD169316 for 30 min (D) and then stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The data represent a typical result from four independent experiments.

Neurol. 1999; 157: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether α-MSH inhibits LPS-induced NFκB activation and whether there is a functional relationship between p38 kinase and NFκB activation. NFκB activation was determined by examining phosphorylation of IκB because degradation of IκB via its phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear translocation of NFκB and subsequent activation of target gene expression. In PMA-treated THP-1 cells, LPS treatment caused activation of NFκB as demonstrated by the measures of IκB phosphorylation (Fig. 4A , upper panel) and NFκB reporter gene assay (Fig. 4C). As expected, the level of the IκBα protein decreased as the phosphorylation level of the IκBα protein increased (Fig. 4A , upper panel). Pretreatment of α-MSH that inhibits LPS-induced p38 kinase activation or direct inhibition of p38 kinase with PD169316 blocked LPS-induced IκB phosphorylation and LPS-induced IκB degradation (Fig. 4A , middle and lower panels) and transcriptional activity of NFκB (Fig. 4C), suggesting that inhibition of LPS-induced p38 kinase activation by α-MSH is responsible for the inhibition of NFκB. The phospho-IκB levels were reduced to 22–28 and 26–33% of the control level (treated with LPS only) by 50 nm α-MSH and 2 μm PD169316, respectively (Fig. 4B). The ability of α-MSH to inhibit IκB-α phosphorylation appears related to its ability to inhibit IKK as α-MSH inhibits the LPS-induced IKK activity (Fig. 4D). In contrast to the inhibition of NFκB by the blockade of p38 kinase activation, inhibition of NFκB activation by treatment with SN50 peptide, which blocks NFκB activation by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB (35Uzzo R.G.

Taken together, these results suggest that LPS-induced p38 kinase activation is necessary for NFκB activation and that α-MSH inhibits TNF-α production by blocking LPS-induced p38 kinase activation and subsequent NFκB activation.Fig. 5α-MSH blocks TNF-α production by inhibiting NFκB activation. PMA-treated THP-1 cells were untreated or treated with α-MSH (50 nm) for 24 h or with SN-50 peptide (50 nm) for 30 min and then stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Expression levels of p38 and phosphorylated p38 kinase (pp38) were determined by Western blot analysis (A). Transcript levels for TNF-α and β-actin were determined by RT-PCR (B). The data represent a typical result from four independent experiments. M.W., molecular weight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was found that the PMA-treated THP-1 cells also expressed MC3R and MC5R, in addition to the MC1R receptor, whereas the Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells only expressed the MC1R receptor (Fig. 6A). As such, this finding is consistent with the recent report by Taherzadeh et al. (19Taherzadeh S. Sharma S. Chhajlani V. Gantz I. Rajora N. Demitri M.T. Kelly L. Zhao H. Ichiyama T. Catania A. Lipton J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1289-R1294PubMed Google Scholar), who found that THP-1 cells express MC1R, MC3R, and MC5R. Since MC1R and MC3R, and yet not MC5R, are known to be associated with the anti-inflammatory effect of α-MSH (15Getting S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 447-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Mandrika I. Muceniece R. Wikberg J.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), plus the expression level of MC5R in THP-1 cells and MC5R affinity to α-MSH are much lower than those for MC1R and MC3R (37Wikberg J.E. Muceniece R. Mandrika I. Prusis P. Lindblom J. Post C. Skottner A. Pharmacol. Res. 2000; 42: 393-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the receptor specificity was investigated using GHRP-6, which is a non-selective antagonist of α-MSH receptors, and SHU9119, which is a specific antagonist of MC3R. When the differentiated THP-1 cells were pretreated with GHRP-6, the inhibitory effects of α-MSH on LPS-induced p38 kinase activation (Fig. 6B) and IκB-α phosphorylation (Fig. 6C) were completely abrogated, whereas MC3R-specific SHU9119 had no impact on the effects of α-MSH (Fig. 6, B and C). Accordingly, these findings support the conclusion that MC1R is the major α-MSH receptor that mediates the inhibitory effect of α-MSH on the LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and NFκB, leading to a reduced TNF-α production in differentiated THP-1 cells. Activation of PKA Is Required for the Inhibitory Effects of α-MSH on p38 Kinase and NFκB—Because α-MSH binding to MC1R is known to activate the PKA signaling pathway (15Getting S.J. Trends Pharmacol.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1996; 17: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we also examined the functional relationship between PKA activation and α-MSH inhibition of p38 kinase and NFκB. As expected, α-MSH stimulated PKA activity in PMA-treated THP-1 cells. The addition of LPS alone did not significantly affect PKA activation, whereas addition of the PKA-specific inhibitor H-89 dramatically blocked α-MSH-induced PKA activation (Fig. 7A). The inhibition of α-MSH-induced PKA activation by H-89 treatment blocked the inhibition of LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase, IκB phosphorylation, and IκB degradation (Fig. 7B) as well as TNF-α production (Fig. 7C). These results clearly indicate that stimulation of PKA by α-MSH causes inhibition of LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and subsequent NFκB activation to block TNF-α production. α-MSH is known to suppress inflammation by inhibiting expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α in leukocytes by inhibiting NF-κB activation (38Lipton J.M. Zhao H. Ichiyama T. Barsh G.S. Catania A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of these α-MSH anti-inflammatory effects have not been defined previously. MC1R is constitutively expressed in monocytes and subpopulations of lymphocytes and plays an important role in the anti-inflammatory action of α-MSH (19Taherzadeh S. Sharma S. Chhajlani V. Gantz I. Rajora N. Demitri M.T. Kelly L. Zhao H. Ichiyama T. Catania A. Lipton J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1289-R1294PubMed Google Scholar, 39Neumann Andersen G. Nagaeva O. Mandrika I. Petrovska R. Muceniece R. Mincheva-Nilsson L. Wikberg J.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2001; 126: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we found that PMA-treated THP-1 cells express significantly more MC1R when compared with Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells. By using differentiated THP-1 (high MC1R cells) and HL-60 (low MC1R cells), we demonstrated that α-MSH blocks LPS-induced TNF-α production by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and subsequent NFκB activation in a manner dependent on MC1R expression. We also demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of α-MSH require MC1R-mediated activation of PKA. Since MC1R and MC3R are known to be associated with the anti-inflammatory effect of α-MSH (15Getting S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 447-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Mandrika I. Muceniece R. Wikberg J.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and PMA-treated THP-1 cells express MC3R, we checked the effects of α-MSH antagonists, GHRP-6 (a non-selective antagonist of α-MSH receptors) and SHU9119 (an antagonist of MC3R), on the activation of p38 kinase and the phosphorylation of IκBα. We found that the anti-inflammatory effects of α-MSH were observed only in high MC1R cells and that these effects were completely abolished by the addition of GHRP-6 but not by that of SHU9119 (Fig. 6). These observations also suggest that MC1R expression is required for the inhibitory action of α-MSH in differentiated THP-1 cells. Studies using cultured human astrocytes, whole murine brain, and human monocyte/macrophages have indicated that a primary effect of α-MSH is modulation of activation of NFκB (38Lipton J.M. Zhao H. Ichiyama T. Barsh G.S. Catania A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is our observation that the ability of α-MSH to inhibit TNF-α production is due to the blockade of LPS-induced NFκB activation. The ability of α-MSH to inhibit NFκB activation appears to be indirect in that it involves inhibition of IKK activity. This is based on the observation that α-MSH inhibits LPS-induced IKK activity, leading to decreased IκB-α phosphorylation (Fig. 4). We also observed that α-MSH inhibits TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation and NFκB activation (data not shown), as has already been reported by Manna et al. (40Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2873-2880PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that the inhibition of NFκB by α-MSH is due to inhibition of the upstream signaling molecule p38 kinase. This is consistent with observations by others indicating that LPS stimulates p38 kinase in various cell types (41Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 42Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T.F. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and that p38 kinase activation by various extracellular stimuli leads to the activation of NFκB (43Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3650-3659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Experimentally, we found that the optimal α-MSH concentration for inhibition of p38 kinase activation and subsequent NFκB activation under our experimental conditions was 50 nm. Indeed, we found that higher concentrations of α-MSH were less effective in attenuating p38 kinase activation (Fig. 3A). This biphasic inhibitory effect of α-MSH on p38 kinase is consistent with the previous observation that α-MSH is most effective at a nanomolar concentration and that its anti-inflammatory effects are biphasic in terms of concentration (20Catania A.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1996; 17: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the inhibitory effects of α-MSH on LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and NFκB are mediated by the activation of PKA via the stimulation of the MC1R receptor. This is based on the observation that inhibition of PKA with H-89 blocks the inhibitory effects of α-MSH on the inhibition of p38 kinase activation and TNF-α production (Fig. 7). Negative control of PKA on NFκB activation has been reported previously (46Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and this result, in combination with our findings, suggests that it would be interesting to elucidate the mechanisms leading to the inhibition of p38 kinase by the activation of PKA. One possibility is that the inhibition is mediated through inhibition of Raf-1 by PKA (47Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) because Raf-1 is reported to induce the activation of NFκB through MAP kinase kinase kinase (MEKK)-1, which induces MAP kinase kinase (MEK)-3/-6 and p38 kinase activation (44Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3650-3659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 48Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J. Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recently, Mandrika et al. (30Mandrika I. Muceniece R. Wikberg J.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of PKA by H-89 blocks the inhibitory effects of α-MSH on LPS/interferon-γ-induced nitric oxide production and NFκB activation measured by NFκB-dependent reporter assay but that it does not affect NFκB translocation to the nucleus in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage. This group suggested that α-MSH acts via two mechanisms: one cAMP-independent and the other dependent on MC1R/cAMP activation. In this study, we demonstrated that PKA activity is required for the blockade of LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase and subsequent NFκB activation and TNF-α production. Thus the α-MSH inhibition of p38 kinase activation in LPS-stimulated THP-1 occurs through a MC1R/cAMP-dependent mechanism. The current work demonstrated that the LPS-induced activation of p38 kinase was decreased by α-MSH treatment and that the IKK activity was subsequently down-regulated, thereby leading to a decrease in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the inhibition of NFκB activation. It was reported that p38 kinase inhibitors could be used for the therapeutic drug for cytokine-mediated diseases (26Salituro F.G. Germann U.A. Wilson K.P. Bemis G.W. Fox T. Su M.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 807-823PubMed Google Scholar). Because our results showed that the down-regulated p38 kinase in LPS-induced monocytes treated with α-MSH or the p38 kinase inhibitor PD169316 induces the inhibition of IKK, NFκB activation, and TNF-α production, the application of α-MSH as a therapeutic drug for inflammatory diseases by acting as a p38 kinase inhibitor should be attempted.

https://openalex.org/W2027041685,"Drosophila melanogaster thioredoxin reductase-1 (DmTrxR-1) is a key flavoenzyme in dipteran insects, where it substitutes for glutathione reductase. DmTrxR-1 belongs to the family of dimeric, high M r thioredoxin reductases, which catalyze reduction of thioredoxin by NADPH. Thioredoxin reductase has an N-terminal redox-active disulfide (Cys57–Cys62) adjacent to the flavin and a redox-active C-terminal cysteine pair (Cys489′–Cys490′ in the other subunit) that transfer electrons from Cys57–Cys62 to the substrate thioredoxin. Cys489′–Cys490′ functions similarly to Cys495–Sec496 (Sec = selenocysteine) and Cys535-XXXX-Cys540 in human and parasite Plasmodium falciparum enzymes, but a catalytic redox center formed by adjacent Cys residues, as observed in DmTrxR-1, is unprecedented. Our data show, for the first time in a high M r TrxR, that DmTrxR-1 oscillates between the 2-electron reduced state, EH2, and the 4-electron state, EH4, in catalysis, after the initial priming reduction of the oxidized enzyme (E ox) to EH2. The reductive half-reaction consumes 2 eq of NADPH in two observable steps to produce EH4. The first equivalent yields a FADH–-NADP+ charge-transfer complex that reduces the adjacent disulfide to form a thiolate-flavin charge-transfer complex. EH4 reacts with thioredoxin rapidly to produce EH2. In contrast, E ox formation is slow and incomplete; thus, EH2 of wild-type cannot reduce thioredoxin at catalytically competent rates. Mutants lacking the C-terminal redox center, C489S, C490S, and C489S/C490S, are incapable of reducing thioredoxin and can only be reduced to EH2 forms. Additional data suggest that Cys57 attacks Cys490′ in the interchange reaction between the N-terminal dithiol and the C-terminal disulfide.

The thioredoxin system is widely distributed in nature, and in most organisms it functions in concert with the glutathione system. However, because insects such as Drosophila melanogaster have no glutathione reductase, glutathione disulfide is reduced non-enzymatically by reduced Trx (1Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); thus, TrxR serves an additional role in insects. TrxR from higher eukaryotes, including D. melanogaster, is of the high molecular weight type, having a M r of 54,000–58,000, which contrasts with the well studied TrxR of Escherichia coli with a M r of 34,000. There is an interesting difference in the mechanism whereby these enzymes transfer reducing equivalents from the protein interior to the enzyme surface where Trx is bound and reduced. In low M r TrxR, one domain rotates from a conformation in which the redox-active disulfide is reduced by the flavin in the apolar interior to a conformation in which the nascent dithiol is carried to the hydrophilic surface of the enzyme, where it can reduce bound Trx. In this unusual mechanism, when the dithiol is near the surface to reduce Trx, the NADPH is in position to reduce the FAD (2Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). High M r thioredoxin reductases, on the other hand, have a second redox-active disulfide or selenosulfide pair that shuttles reducing equivalents from the nascent dithiol that is near the flavin to Trx bound at the surface (3Williams C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). High M r TrxRs are part of the disulfide reductase family that includes lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, mercuric reductase, trypanothione reductase, and peroxiredoxin reductase. All of these flavoenzymes are homodimers (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar), and each monomer comprises three domains: a flavin binding domain, a pyridine nucleotide binding domain, and a domain that provides an interface between the two monomers, as shown in Scheme 1. Each active site of thioredoxin reductase contains FAD and a so-called N-terminal redox-active disulfide (Cys57 and Cys62 in the D. melanogaster enzyme), both in the flavin-binding domain of one polypeptide chain, and a C-terminal redox disulfide (Cys489′and Cys490′ in the D. melanogaster enzyme) originating from the other polypeptide chain (5Zhong L. Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 6Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9533-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This modus operandi of using both monomers to carry out catalysis, which is common to all members of this enzyme family, is symbolized in Scheme 1 by the use of primes. The approach also requires His464′ from the adjacent subunit as the active site base involved in catalysis of the dithiol-disulfide interchange between the N-terminal Cys57-Cys62 pair and the C-terminal Cys489′-Cys490′ pair. Thus, the path of reducing equivalents in catalysis is from NADPH to FAD, from the reduced flavin to the N-terminal disulfide, from the newly formed dithiol pair to the C-terminal redox pair on the other subunit, and finally, to bound Trx (Scheme 1) (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The C-terminal redox group used depends on the source of the TrxR. In TrxR from mammals a Cys-Sec (Sec = selenocysteine) sequence motif is present (7Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To fully understand the mechanism of this family of enzymes, it is important to know the redox states involved in catalysis. For this purpose we have analyzed the redox behavior of functional wild-type TrxR, as well as the three C-terminal mutants, C489S, C490S, and C489S/C490S. We provide evidence that these directly adjacent cysteines form a dithiol-disulfide redox center in DmTrxR that functions similarly to the Sec-Cys pair that is essential for catalysis in mammalian TrxR (14Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). It has long been known that, in catalysis, lipoamide dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase utilize the E ox state and a 2-electron reduced state, EH2 (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F.

Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present evidence that DmTrxR oscillates between the EH2 and EH4 states in catalysis, after the initial priming reduction of the oxidized enzyme (E ox) to the EH2 state. We also provide evidence that Cys490′ in the C-terminal pair is involved in dithiol-disulfide interchange with Cys57 in the N-terminal pair. Materials—Recombinant DmTrxR-1 and DmTrxR-1 mutant forms, C489S, C490S, and C489S/C490S, as well as DmTrx-2, were prepared as His-tagged proteins from E. coli and purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as previously described (1Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17Bauer H. Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17457-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All reagents and other enzymes were obtained from Serva and Sigma and were of highest available purity. Titrations and stopped-flow experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions using methods described previously (18Böhme C.C. Arscott L.D. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37317-37323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and all reactions were conducted in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Determination of Free Thiol Groups—Free thiol groups were determined by reaction with DTNB, which was added in at least 5-fold excess. The number of free thiol groups was calculated by the absorbance of the released TNB anion (ϵ412 nm = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1). Determinations of total thiol groups in enzymes were carried out under denaturing conditions by incubating with 8 m guanidinium hydrochloride before adding Ellman's reagent. Reduction of DmTrxR Enzymes with NaBH4—Wild-type DmTrxR and DmTrxR mutants can be reduced rapidly by ∼100-fold excess sodium borohydride (100 mm in 0.02 n NaOH) under anaerobic conditions. Because borohydride is completely hydrolyzed at neutral or acidic pH within a few minutes, enzyme reduced in this manner could be directly used for titrations and stopped-flow experiments without concern about excess reductant being present. NADPH-regenerating System—In experiments in which it was desirable to have no significant quantities of NADP+ present, an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of G6P and G6PDH was applied. To a mixture of 200 milliunits of G6PDH and 18 μm DmTrxR-1, 1 mm G6P and 6 μm NADPH were added from the sidearm of the anaerobic cuvette. The reduction was followed spectrophotometrically over 2 h. Xanthine/Xanthine Oxidase System—DmTrxR-1 was mixed in an anaerobic cuvette with ∼200 μm xanthine, and 50 μm methyl viologen was added as an electron shuttle. To start the reaction, 10 μl of milk xanthine oxidase (A 450 nm of stock ∼ 0.4) was added from the side arm of the cuvette and the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically for 1–3 h (19Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar). EDTA/Light—DmTrxR-1 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, 9 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, was mixed with 0.1–1 eq of methyl viologen. After making the solution anaerobic, the cuvette was irradiated with light (unfocused SunGun tungsten-halogen lamp, rheostat ∼80 V, 15 cm from the sample) while keeping the temperature constant with a water bath. The photoreduction was monitored spectrophotometrically (20Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Anaerobic Titrations—Titrations were conducted in an anaerobic cuvette with an attached Hamilton syringe that allowed the exact addition of the reaction partner (16Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13888-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rapid Reaction Kinetics—The rapid reaction kinetics studies were all conducted in a Hi-Tech SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow photometer under anaerobic conditions at 10 °C. The DmTrxR concentration was 10–15 μm after mixing. The data of the kinetic traces were analyzed by curve fitting with multiple exponential functions in a program written by Rong Chang, Chung-yen Chiu, and D. P. Ballou (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The analysis methods are based on the Marquardt algorithm for solving differential equations (21Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C, the Art of Scientific Computing. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, New York1992: 683-688Google Scholar). The reaction of NADPH with E ox was carried out in the stopped-flow photometer. Time-dependent spectra were followed using the diode array detector, and single wavelength kinetic traces were recorded with a photomultiplier. The kinetic traces at 460, 440, 505, and 540 nm were recorded and, in the case of the reductive half-reaction, also at 360 nm to follow NADPH consumption at an isosbestic point between E ox and EH4. For the oxidative half-reaction, enzyme was reduced with NaBH4 and then reacted with oxidized DmTrx-2 in the stopped-flow instrument. Reduction of Wild-type DmTrxR-1 by NADPH—Titration of DmTrxR-1 with its reducing substrate NADPH (Km ∼ 4.5 μm suggesting that binding is tight; see below) led to spectral changes that are similar to those of other flavin-dependent disulfide oxidoreductases (Fig. 1A) (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar, 12Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37317-37323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reduction of DmTrxR-1 was detected as a decrease in the flavin absorbance maximum (ϵ462 nm = 11.9 mm–1 cm–1 for E ox), and this was accompanied by an increase in absorbance around 540 nm that was caused by a charge-transfer interaction between the thiolate of Cys62 and the isoalloxazine ring. Two sharp isosbestic points (433 and 507 nm) were identified in the first phase that consumed 1 eq of NADPH (spectra 1–5). This indicated the predominance of two enzyme species, E ox and the equilibrium mixture of EH2B and EH2C shown in Scheme 2. The maximal charge-transfer absorbance (ϵ540 nm = 2.6 mm cm–1) was not observed until 2 eq of NADPH were added (inset), leading to the formation of EH4. It should be pointed out that the maximum CT absorbance value in the titration, in which equilibrium is reached after each addition of NADPH, is significantly lower than the transient value observed after a single addition of excess NADPH (ϵ540 nm ∼ 4.0 mm–1 cm–1) (see below). Spectrum 8 in Fig. 1A resulted from the consumption of 2 eq of NADPH. Because the FAD is still substantially oxidized, the high absorbance at 460 nm indicates that there are two redox centers in addition to the flavin. The first is the N-terminal redox-active disulfide with Cys62 contributing the flavin-interacting thiolate and Cys57 containing the interchange thiol. The other redox center is a disulfide made up of residues Cys489′ and Cys490′ in the C-terminal extension of the other subunit (Scheme 1).Scheme 2Model of the catalytic mechanism of DmTrxR-1. The reductive half-reaction involves the steps designated by rate constants k 1–k 16 and the oxidative half-reaction the steps k 17–k 20. NADPH activates the enzyme in the steps designated k 1–k 5, and the catalytic cycle is k 7–k 19. MC, Michaelis complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The addition of more than 2 eq of NADPH in the titration leads to small further decreases in the flavin absorbance at 460 nm and to a loss of the charge-transfer absorption at 540 nm. Both of these spectral effects are the result of the reduction of the FAD as a small amount of EH6 is formed (presumably from EH4B, Scheme 2). Addition of excess NADPH, however, does not result in complete reduction, because of the presence of NADP+. We therefore used more forcing conditions by coupling the reaction to an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of G6P and G6PDH to eliminate NADP+ from the equilibrium (Fig. 1B). Indeed, this resulted in fully reducing the enzyme to EH6 as shown by the decrease in absorbance at 460 nm and complete loss of the 540 nm absorbance. EH6 was very unstable, and enzymatic activity was completely lost in a few minutes. The mechanism of this inactivation is not known. However, the results described below show that the redox potential for the formation of EH6 is considerably lower than that of free FAD, implying that the FADH– is bound much less tightly than is FAD to DmTrxR-1. Thus, loss of activity could be associated with loss of FAD in the EH6 form of DmTrxR-1. Reoxidation by Ferricyanide—DmTrxR-1 can be conveniently reduced by sodium borohydride, as noted under “Experimental Procedures.” Although NaBH4 is a strong reductant, it does not reduce DmTrxR-1 to EH6, but rather to a reduced enzyme species with strong CT absorption (ϵ540 nm = 3.3 mm–1 cm–1) that is similar to the EH4 spectrum obtained from reduction with NADPH (ϵ540 nm ∼ 4.0 mm–1 cm–1). The extinctions are not the same because NADPH enhances the CT (22Krauth-Siegel R.L. Arscott L.D. Schönleben-Janas A. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13968-13977Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Four eq of ferricyanide were required to restore the E ox spectrum, which is consistent with the assumption that borohydride produced the EH4 form of TrxR and that two reducible disulfides occur in the enzyme. Curiously, the reoxidation from EH2 to E ox by [Fe(CN)6]3– was significantly slower (0.013 s–1) than that from EH4 to EH2 (0.15 s–1), so that several minutes were required after each ferricyanide addition for the spectrum to stabilize. Presumably, the conversion from EH4 to EH2 involves the reaction of [Fe(CN)6]3– with the FADH–; because the equilibrium between EH2A and EH2B favors the latter overwhelmingly, the second phase is very slow. Behavior of DmTrxR-1 toward Oxygen—The oxidation of EH2 to E ox in the wild-type enzyme by molecular oxygen proceeds even more slowly than with ferricyanide. Freshly prepared DmTrxR-1 has a reddish color, and its spectrum indicates a partially reduced enzyme species (EH2). When exposed to air, the color changes in a period of hours from reddish orange to yellow as reoxidation occurs. The high stability of EH2 against auto-oxidation to E ox in vitro was a first hint that E ox does not serve as an intermediate in the catalysis under in vivo conditions. The reactions of the three mutants of DmTrxR-1, C489S, C490S, and C489S/C490S, with oxygen are distinct from that of the wild-type enzyme. C490S and C489S/C490S are oxidized by O2 within a few minutes, as are most members of this enzyme family (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The C489S mutant, on the other hand, is more resistant to auto-oxidation than is wild-type DmTrxR-1, and thus it behaves very similarly to the closely related yeast glutathione reductase (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar, 23Arscott L.D. Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Even after 3 weeks of exposure to air, the enzyme stock solution had some reddish color, indicating partial reduction. Spectral analysis supported this assumption, the ϵ460 nm and ϵ540 nm values being approximately 9.8 and 2.3 mm–1 cm–1, respectively, significantly different from the values observed for E ox species (ϵ462 nm ∼ 11.9 mm–1 cm–1 and ϵ540 nm ∼ 0.5 mm–1 cm–1 for wild-type DmTrxR-1). The observed stability of a form with CT absorbance may be the result of the C489S mutant form becoming trapped in a form resembling EH2C (Schemes 2 and 3). The lack of Cys489′ prevents formation of the EH2B forms. The latter is probably required for reacting readily with O2. This is evidence for Cys490′ being the interchange thiol (see “Discussion”). The C489S and C490S mutants became turbid with time, requiring 5–6 weeks in the case of C489S and several days for C490S. The fine precipitate could not be cleared by filtration or centrifugation, but treatment with either dithiothreitol or reduced thioredoxin removed the cloudiness. This finding suggested that, over long periods of time under oxidizing conditions, intermolecular disulfides formed via the remaining thiol, and these led to the turbidity. These observations suggest the specific functions of the C-terminal thiols (see below and “Discussion”). Accessible Thiol Groups in the Various Redox States of DmTrxR-1—Determination of the free thiol groups revealed further information about the redox state of the C-terminal cysteine pair. There are 9 cysteines per FAD in the protein, yet treatment of the oxidized enzyme (E ox) with excess DTNB revealed less than 0.3 accessible thiol groups (Table I). This indicates that the 5 Cys residues not involved in redox-active disulfides are all buried or are otherwise inaccessible to DTNB. After reduction with borohydride of wild-type enzyme to the EH4 state, ∼4 additional thiol groups are observed than are present in E ox. Moreover, as expected, ∼3 additional thiols are observed after reduction in C489S and ∼2 additional in C489S/C490S. It is well known from other closely related flavoenzymes that the N-terminal cysteine pair forms a disulfide bridge in the E ox state but is reduced when the enzyme is reacted with borohydride (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The values for the C490S mutant refer to enzyme that has been stored aerobically for 3 weeks. Thus, the gain of 1–2 thiols rather than 3 is not surprising. After reduction of C490S with dithiothreitol and dialysis, the values increase by ∼1 thiol, which is consistent with the hypothesis that Cys489′ in C490S can form an intermolecular disulfide as discussed in the previous section. The data further suggest that Cys489′ in C490S and Cys430′ in C489S are exposed to DTNB.Table IDetermination of the number of free thiol groups in wild-type and mutant DmTrxR-1No. of accessible free thiol groupsNative conditionsDenaturing conditionsOxidized enzymeNaBH4-treated enzymeOxidized enzymeNaBH4-treated enzymeWild-type0.3 (0)3.8 (4)5.7 (5)9.7 (9)C489S1.4 (1)3.1 (3)8.7 (6)9.5 (8)C490S0.6 (1)2.1 (3)6.3 (6)7.8 (8)C489S/C490S0.4 (0)2.3 (2)5.9 (5)7.4 (7) Open table in a new tab The evidence given above indicates that a second disulfide is present in E ox. We conclude that it is made up of cysteines Cys489′ and Cys490′, which provide a catalytically significant dithiol-disulfide redox center. This hypothesis is not only supported by the results from the NADPH and ferricyanide titrations described above, but also by the data from the C-terminal mutants that are all lacking a functional redox center and are therefore inactive for Trx reduction. Other Reducing Systems—Based upon the findings with NADPH, we applied alternative reduction methods to study the EH6 species in which the FAD and both redox-active Cys pairs are reduced. Reduction with the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system (19Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar) gave incomplete formation of EH6 (data not shown). We had similar difficulties in forming EH6 when applying the photoreduction method in the presence of EDTA (20Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). With 0.12 eq of 5-deazaflavin sulfonate present, CT absorbance was not observed (Fig. 2, curves 1–5), rather the spectral characteristics indicate the formation of an anionic FAD semiquinone species (24Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Subsequent addition of 0.1 eq of MV promoted electron equilibration to yield a spectrum best explained by a mixture of EH4 and a small amount of the semiquinone (spectrum 6). Increasing the MV concentration to be equimolar with DmTrxR-1, and further irradiation gave a final spectrum indicating no detectable semiquinone and almost full reduction to EH6 (spectrum 7). Spectra taken immediately after irradiation revealed low MV radical concentrations that gradually decreased below detection level within 5–10 min. This indicates that the redox potential of the flavin is similar to that of the MV/MV•+ pair (E 0 ∼ –400 mV at pH 7.0) (25Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar); this is extremely low relative to other members of the enzyme family (4Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). These data, knowledge of the redox milieu in eukaryotic cells (∼ –230 to –250 mV) (26Keese M.A. Saffrich R. Dandekar T. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3674) Google Scholar), and the considerable instability of EH6 led to the conclusion that the 6-electron reduced form of DmTrxR-1 is not relevant in vivo. The low redox potential also implies that FADH– is not bound to DmTrxR-1 as tightly as is FAD.

However, the role of the αM β-propeller in ligand binding remains less well defined, and the functional residues are still unknown. In the present study, we studied the function of the αM β-propeller in specific ligand recognition by αMβ2 using a number of different approaches, and we report four major findings. 1) Substitution of five individual segments (Asp398–Ala402, Leu412–Leu419, Tyr426–Met434, Phe435–Glu443, and Ser444–Thr451) within the W4 blade of the β-propeller with their homologous counterparts in integrin α2 abrogated C3bi binding, whereas substitution of eight other segments outside this blade had no effect. 2) These five mutants defective in C3bi binding supported strong αMβ2-mediated and cation-dependent cell adhesion to fibrinogen, suggesting that the conformations of these five defective mutants were intact. 3) Polyclonal antibodies recognizing sequences within the W4 blade significantly blocked C3bi binding by wild-type αMβ2. 4) A synthetic peptide corresponding to Gln424–Gly440 within W4 interacted directly with C3bi.

The physiological functions of αMβ2 include roles in adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes through endothelium (4Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar), activation of neutrophils and monocytes (5Shappell S.B. Toman C. Anderson D.C. Taylor A.A. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J.

The importance of the β2 integrin subfamily in general in human physiology is underscored by the severe phenotype of individuals with congenital deficiencies of these integrins (8Crowley C.A.

Like other integrins, αMβ2 is notorious in its ability to recognize multiple structurally unrelated ligands, including fibrinogen (Fg) 1The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline; EC3bi, C3bi-coated sheep erythrocytes; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NIF, neutrophil inhibitory factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

Studies from our laboratory and others suggested that the underlying molecular mechanism for such broad ligand specificity of the receptor is several overlapping but not identical binding pockets within αMβ2. For example, both C3bi and Fg recognize an inserted region of ∼200 amino acids in the αM subunit termed the I-domain (αMI-domain) (12Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbí A.L.

Additionally, ligand binding by αMβ2 is mediated by other regions including the β-propeller region of αM (16Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Yalamanchili P. Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) to map the ligand-binding sites in αMβ2 (13Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding sites identified have been confirmed using a number of different complementary approaches, including gain-in-function mutations, synthetic peptides, and epitope mapping studies of function-blocking mAbs. Importantly, the recently published crystal structure of the collagen-α2I-domain complex (the α2I-domain has 47% homology with the αMI-domain) agrees well with our results (22Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to employ homolog-scanning mutagenesis in this study to identify critical regions within the αM β-propeller for C3bi binding. We report here that the W4 blade, containing residues Asp398 to Thr451, is involved specifically in C3bi but not Fg binding. Combined with our published studies on the C3bi-binding site within the other two domains of the αMβ2 receptor, we propose a working model where three individual domains (the αMI-domain, the αM β-propeller, and the β2I-domain) reside proximally in space and contribute to the formation of a single functional C3bi-binding site. Materials—Human kidney 293 cells and the expression vector, pCIS2M, were gifts from Dr. F. J. Castellino (Notre Dame, IN). The cDNAs of αM and β2 were obtained from Dr. B. Karan-Tamir (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). mAbs 2LPM19c, MHM23, and P1E6 were from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). The cDNA of α2, as well as mAbs TS1/18, TS1/22, OKM1, M1/70, M1/87, 44a, 904, and LM2/1 were from the ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA). mAb 44 was from Sigma, and mAb 31H4 was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines— The detailed procedures for homolog-scanning mutagenesis and establishment of stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant αMβ2 in human kidney 293 cells have been published (21Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar procedures were used to generate 13 αM β-propeller mutants that contain individual switches between the αM and α2 β-propellers, which have 52% homology. To obtain cell lines that express equivalent receptor numbers as wild-type αMβ2, each mutant cell line was sub-cloned by cell sorting using αM-specific mAb 44a. Up to 20 colonies were picked and analyzed for integrin expression by FACS analysis. Cells expressing similar levels of receptor to those expressing wild-type αMβ2 were selected and subcloned. To exclude the possibility of subcloning artifacts, all of our studies have been repeated using the original pool for every mutant. Ligand Binding to α M β 2-expressing Cells—C3bi binding was performed with slight modification of the method of Bilsland (23Bilsland C.A. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar). Sheep erythrocytes coated with C3bi (EC3bi) were prepared using anti-sheep erythrocyte IgM antibody M1/87 and human C5-deficient serum (Sigma). Briefly, 7 × 108 sheep erythrocytes (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO) were washed twice in HBSS, containing 5 mm HEPES and 1 mm Mg2+, and coated with IgM as described (24Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coated erythrocytes were surface-labeled with biotin using 1 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (Pierce) at 37 °C for 20 min. The biotinylated cells were resuspended in 0.9 ml of HBSS with 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm Ca2+, and 1 mm Mg2+, mixed with 100 μl of C5-deficient serum, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After washing twice, the resulting EC3bi was resuspended in 2 ml of the above solution. To perform the EC3bi binding assays, a total of 2 × 105 αMβ2-expressing cells were seeded onto polylysine (50 μg/ml)-coated 24-well non-tissue culture polystyrene plates (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 2 × 107 EC3bi. After 60 min at 37 °C, unbound EC3bi were removed by washing with PBS. Bound EC3bi were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde overnight, and excess paraformaldehyde was neutralized with 1% BSA at 37 °C for 2 h. Bound EC3bi were quantitated by addition of 300 μl of avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:2000 dilution) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). After 90 min at 37 °C, the plates were washed three times with PBS, and 250 μl of 3 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 405 nm was determined. Cell adhesion to the Fg γ-module was carried out as described previously (13Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A total of 2 × 106 αMβ2-expressing cells were added to 24-well non-tissue culture polystyrene plates, which were pre-coated with recombinant γ-module (10 μg/ml) and subsequently blocked with 0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone in DPBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the unbound cells were removed by three washes with DPBS, and the adherent cells were quantified by cell-associated acid phosphatase activity. Solid Phase Binding Assay—To test interactions between identified sequences of the αM β-propeller and the αMβ2 ligand C3bi, 100 μl of the synthetic peptides at different concentrations (0–5 mm in DPBS) were coated onto the center of a 24-well plate overnight at 4 °C. The efficiency of peptide coating was determined by labeling the N-terminal free sulfhydryl (–SH) group within each peptide, using the EZ-link PEO-maleimide-activated biotin kit (Pierce), based on the product instruction. After washing with PBS and blocking with BSA, the amount of the immobilized biotin group within each well was determined using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate and measuring the absorption at 405 nm. For C3bi binding, the peptide-coated plate was blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 22 °C, and then biotinylated EC3bi in 300 μl of HBSS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ was added. After incubating for 1 h at 37 °C, non-adherent EC3bi were removed by washing. The plate was then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 2% BSA. C3bi binding was measured with a conjugate of avidin-alkaline phosphatase as described above and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. FACS Analysis—A total of 1 × 106 cells in HBSS containing 1 mm Mg2+ were incubated with 5 μg of mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. A subtype-matched mouse IgG served as a control. After 3 washes with PBS, cells were mixed with FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment ((Zymed Laboratories Inc.), kept at 4 °C for another 30 min, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. FACS analysis was then performed using FACScan (BD Biosciences), counting 10,000 events. Mean fluorescence intensities were quantitated using the FACScan program, and the values were used to compare αMβ2 expression levels and reactivity of the cells with various mAbs. Contribution of the α M β-Propeller to C3bi Binding—Previously, we showed that switching the β-propeller and the stalk region between αM and αL (αLβ2 does not interact with C3bi) had no effect on C3bi binding (13Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that the functional residues within the β-propellers of αM and αL are well conserved. Therefore, we chose another I-domain containing integrin α subunit (α2) in this study, which is less homologous to αM. The αM and α2 β-propellers have 52% homology, yet the α2 subunit does not recognize C3bi as its ligand. Because the αMI-domain plays a major role in ligand binding, we tested whether its ligand binding property could be affected by other domains of the receptor, including the β-propeller. Thus, we placed the αMI-domain in the context of α2 by substituting the α2I-domain with the αMI-domain, and we expressed the chimeric receptor α2(I/αM)β1 on Chinese hamster ovary cells. FACS analyses showed that the chimeric α2(I/αM)β1 receptor was well expressed (Fig. 1A); it reacted with a mAb (31H4) that recognizes the α2 β-propeller (Fig. 1A, e) but not with a mAb (P1E6) that recognizes the α2I-domain (Fig. 1A, d). The presence of the αMI-domain within α2(I/αM)β1 was confirmed by its reactivity toward the αM-specific mAb 44a (Fig. 1A, f), whose epitope is located within the αMI-domain (12Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbí A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As a control, α2β1 reacted with both α2-specific mAbs (31H4 and P1E6) but did not bind the αM-specific mAb 44a (Fig. 1A, a–c), whereas αMβ2 reacted with mAb 44a but not with mAb 31H4 or P1E6 (data not shown). To test if the expressed chimeric receptor is functional, we incubated the Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either wild-type α2β1 or the chimeric α2(I/αM)β1 receptor with biotinylated NIF, which recognizes specifically αMβ2 (11Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we then detected bound NIF with avidin-FITC by FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, wild-type α2β1 did not interact with biotinylated NIF significantly. However, insertion of the αMI-domain in α2 conferred α2β1 the ability to bind NIF. Compared with wild-type α2β1, NIF binding to α2(I/αM)β1 was increased 7-fold (mean fluorescence intensity 4 versus 28), demonstrating that the αMI-domain, when placed in the context of the α2 β-propeller, is still functional. Verifying specificity of the FACS analysis, NIF binding to either αMβ2 or α2(I/αM)β1 could be blocked by addition of 1 mm EDTA or 50-fold excess of non-labeled NIF (data not shown). To see if the chimeric receptor α2(I/αM)β1 is capable of binding another αMβ2 ligand C3bi, we carried out the C3bi binding assays with α2β1, α2(I/αM)β1, and αMβ2. As shown in Fig. 1C, whereas αMβ2 bound C3bi strongly, neither α2β1 nor α2(I/αM)β1 had detectable C3bi binding, suggesting that 1) the α2 β-propeller did not support C3bi binding, and/or 2) efficient C3bi binding required the β2 subunit as well. Homolog-scanning Mutagenesis of the α M β-Propeller—To localize functional residues within the β-propeller, we carried out homolog-scanning mutagenesis using our established methods (21Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We focused our attention primarily on four individual blades (W4 to W7) of the β-propeller, particularly the W4 blade, based on our earlier study showing that the C3bi-binding site within the β2I-domain resides proximal to the W4 and W5 blades of the β-propeller (19Xiong Y.M. Haas T.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46639-46644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Guided by the crystal structure of αVβ3 (25Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) and the protein model of the αM β-propeller (16Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the connecting loops on both upper and lower faces of the αM β-propeller were individually substituted with their homologous counterparts of α2 (Fig. 2A), using the mutagenic primers listed in Table I. The presence of the expected mutations and the correctness of the rest of the αM sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated αM was then expressed, together with wild-type β2, on human 293 cells using our previously published methods. Altogether, a total of 13 mutants was constructed, and their corresponding stable cell lines were established. We found that all 13 αMβ2 mutants could be well expressed on the cell surface and could react with both an αM-specific mAb (44a) and a β2-specific mAb (IB4). In addition, we have used a panel of conformation-dependent mAbs to probe the folding of these αM β-propeller mutants, and we found that reactivity toward these mAbs was preserved for all the 13 mutants (data not shown), suggesting that substitution of these individual sequences within αM did not significantly affect the gross structure of the αMβ2 receptor. Furthermore, surface labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments using mAb 44a showed that all 13 mutants formed correct heterodimers with β2 on the cell surface and exhibited expected molecular weights as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B).Table IMutagenic primers used in the homolog-scanning mutagenesis of αMβ2PositionFromToMutagenic Primers (5′ to 3′)1398-402DMNDALQDRNHSSACCAGAGTGGATTCACTGCAGGACCGCAATCACTCCAGCTACTTGGGTTATGCT2412-419LRNRVQSLSTGESTHFGCTGCCGCCATCATCTCCACAGGGGAAAGCACACACTTCGTTCTGGGGGCACCT3426-434YQHIGLVAMANYTGQIVLGTTCTGGGTGCACCTCGAGCGAATTATACTGGCCTGGTAGCGATGTTC4435-443FRQNTGMWEYSVNENGNITGGCCTGGTAGCGATGTACTCCGTGAACGAGAATGGCAACATCACCTCCAACGCTAATGTC5444-451SNANVKGTVIQAHRGDAGGCAGAACACTGGCAACATTACCGTGATTCAGGCGCATAAGGGCACCCAGATCGGC6468-471SNGSKDTIGAGGACCAGGTCGGTGATTGTATCCTTGTCCACGTCCACGG37483-491YEQTRGGQVMSDLKKEEGGGGGCCCCCCATTACATGAGCGACCTGAAGAAGGAGGAAGGATCCGTGTGCCCCTTGCCC8497-505PRGQRARWQFTIKKGILGTCCGTGTGCCCCTTGTTCACCATCAAGAAAGGAATCCTGGGCTGTGATGCTGTTCTC9511-519YGEQGQPWQEGPEGIENTTGTGATGCTGTTCTCGAGGGACCCGAAGGCATTGAGAATACTCGCTTTGGGGCAGCC10543-550APGEEDNRSPLENQNSGACGTGGCCATTGGATCTCCCCTCGAGAATCAAAATTCCGGTGCTGTTTACCTG11559-568TSGSGISPSHHQGTIRTKYTACCTGTTTCACGGCCACCAAGGAACCATAAGAACCAAGTACAGCCAGCGGATAGCA12576-580KLSPRDGAFRSHCGGATAGCAGGCTCAGACGGCGCTTTCAGGTCTCATCTTCAGTATTTTGGTC13589-598SGGQDLTMDGDGYGDLNGDSCAGTCACTGAGTGGGTACGGCGACCTGAACGGCGACTCCCTGGTAGACCTGACT Open table in a new tab A Critical Role of the W4 Blade in C3bi Binding to α M β 2—To evaluate the impact of the homolog-scanning mutations of the αM β-propeller on ligand binding function of αMβ2, we conducted ligand binding assays using two representative ligands of αMβ2, Fg and C3bi. As shown in Fig. 3A, all 13 homolog-scanning mutants interacted with the γ-module (a major recognition domain within Fg for αMβ2 (13Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) in a cation-dependent manner very similar to the wild-type receptor, indicating that 1) all 13 mutants exhibited correct conformations capable of ligand binding, and 2) switching these sequences did not alter the cation-dependent nature of the αMβ2/ligand interaction. Verifying the specificity of the cell adhesion assay, mock-transfected cells did not adhere to the γ-module, and for all 13 mutants, cell adhesion could be completely blocked by addition of 10 nm NIF (data not shown). We next evaluated C3bi binding activity of the 13 mutant αMβ2 receptors using our established procedures (15Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type αMβ2-expressing but not the mock-transfected cells reacted well with C3bi, which could be blocked by addition of 1 mm EDTA. Of the 13 αM β-propeller mutants, 8 mutants reacted well with C3bi, in a fashion comparable with the wild-type αMβ2 receptor (<1.3-fold different from wild-type αMβ2). These mutants include αM(Ser468–Val471)β2, αM(Tyr483–Val491)β2, αM (Pro495–Gln505)β2, αM(Tyr511–Gly519)β2, αM(Ala543–Arg550)β2, and αM(Ser589–Gly598)β2. The first three mutants (Ser468–Ser471, Tyr483–Val491, and Pro495–Gln505) are located within the W5 blade; the middle three mutants (Tyr511–Gly519, Ala543–Arg550, and Thr559–His568) are located within the W6 blade; and the last two mutants (Lys576–Arg580 and Ser589–Gly598) are located within the W7 blade. In sharp contrast, five mutants lost most of their C3bi binding activities, with reductions of 14.0-, 4.5-, 14.2-, 62.5-, and 23.8-fold, respectively, for αM(Asp Met398–Ala402)β2, αM(Leu412–Leu419)β2, αMTyr426–Met434)β2, αM(Phe435–Glu443)β2, and αM(Ser444–Thr451)β2. These five mutated segments are all located within the W4 blade of the β-propeller (Fig. 2A). These data suggested that the W4 blade contributed significantly to the formation of the C3bi binding pocket. Similar expression levels for the wild-type receptor and the 13 mutants were verified by FACS analysis using mAb 44a, and the mean fluorescence intensity did not vary by more than 1.5-fold compared with wild-type αMβ2-bearing cells. Most importantly, these five mutants exhibited similar cell adhesion to Fg (Fig. 3A). Thus, differences in receptor expression level or global conformation of the receptors were not responsible for the loss of C3bi binding by these five mutants. Inhibition of C3bi Binding by Antibodies Specific for the W4 Blade—To confirm the importance of the W4 blade in C3bi binding, we prepared polyclonal antibodies against the functional sequences of the W4 blade. One of the polyclonal antibodies, recognizing the sequence NMTRVDSDMNDAYL at the beginning of W4, gave a high titer in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In addition, an antibody specific for a sequence on the upper face of the W2 blade (QEIVAANQRGSLYQ) was prepared as a control. This antibody gave a similar titer as the antibody specific for the W4 sequence. The ability of these two antibodies to react with αMβ2 was confirmed by FACS analysis (data not shown). To see if the two antibodies were capable of blocking C3bi binding, we pre-incubated these two antibodies with the wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells, and we then performed the C3bi binding assays. Fig. 4 shows that addition of the W4-specific antibody reduced C3bi binding significantly (p < 0.01), whereas neither a rabbit IgG control nor the W2-specific antibody displayed significant inhibition. As the αMI-domain plays an important role in C3bi binding by αMβ2, we expected that the W4-specific antibody would exert stronger inhibition when combined with NIF, a high affinity antagonist of αMβ2 that is specific for the αMI-domain (13Zhang L.

Indeed, addition of NIF (10 nm) alone reduced C3bi binding to αMβ2 by 60%, and combining NIF with the W4-specific antibody resulted in more than 90% inhibition of C3bi binding. In contrast, addition of the W2-specific antibody or a rabbit IgG control did not produce any further inhibition over NIF alone (Fig. 4). These data demonstrated that the W4 blade of the β-propeller, along with the αMI-domain, contributed significantly to C3bi binding by αMβ2. C3bi Binding to the W4 Peptides—As an ultimate proof for the direct involvement of the W4 blade in C3bi binding, we tested whether C3bi would bind directly to peptides derived from the W4 blade. Based on the three-dimensional model of the αM β-propeller and our above mutagenesis data, we synthesized four peptides pN391-L404 (C391NMTRVDSDMNDAYL404), pI411-V420 (C411ILRNRVQSLV420), pP424-G440 (C424PRYQHIGLVAMFRQNTG440), and pM441-G454 (C441MWESNANVKGTQIG454), and their corresponding scrambled controls. In our preliminary experiments, we tested the ability of these synthetic peptides to support direct C3bi binding, when immobilized on the surface of a 24-well plate. All four peptides were immobilized readily on the plastic surface with similar coating efficiencies (∼0.3 nmol of each peptide were immobilized per well when 100 μm of the peptide were used for coating). Of the four synthetic peptides, one peptide pP424-G440 bound C3bi well. The other three peptides did not support detectable C3bi binding (data not shown), possibly due"

E2 transforms kinase function and regulation through serving as an adaptable binding framework that directly abets efficient phosphorylation, acting as a processing unit in translating and transmitting effector signals, and modifying the sensitivity to allosteric effectors that directly bind to the kinases (reviewed in Refs. 3Roche T.E.

Thus, it is important for understanding these roles to elucidate the nature of the dynamic interactions of the kinases with E2.E2 and the E3BP component have remarkable structures that allow them to carry out their related general roles. These components form an adjustable framework that binds the other components and integrates the sequential reactions in the assembled complex. When expressed by itself, 60 E2 subunits associate by their C-terminal domains as 20 trimers assembled in the form of a dodecahedron; each C-terminal domain of this inner core connects by a series of mobile linker regions to an E1-binding domain and then to two lipoyl domains (1Roche T.E.

This difference in kinase activity is increasingly amplified when samples with equivalent E1 but including or not including E2 are evaluated under increasingly more dilute conditions. 2Y.

Additionally, PDK2 responsiveness to regulatory effectors both requires (NADH and acetyl-CoA effects) and is altered (pyruvate and ADP) by the E2-confining interactions within the complex (3Roche T.E.

Specifically, NADH and acetyl-CoA stimulate PDK2 activity by increasing the state of reduction and acetylation of the lipoyl domains, particularly the L2 domain (9Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T.

E2 activation of PDK2 activity transforms PDK2 from being poorly inhibited by pyruvate or dichloroacetate to being markedly inhibited (9Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Synergistic inhibition by allosteric binding of pyruvate or dichloroacetate results from the binding of these inhibitors by PDK2·ADP (and PDK2·ATP) but not by free PDK2, which slows down ADP dissociation. 3X.

Bao H. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: A197Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To investigate the dynamic interactions of PDK2, we utilize free monomeric lipoyl domains, dimeric fusion constructs (GST-lipoyl domains), as well as E2 60-mer and E2·E3BP subcomplex with their lipoyl groups in an oxidized or reduced state. The L2 domain and its lipoyl group make a critical contribution to the E2-activated function of PDK2 (9Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Beyond establishing that PDK2 is a stable dimer, we have used biophysical studies to evaluate the contributions of the interactions of the PDK2 dimer with the free L2 domain, GST-L2 dimer, GST bearing the L1 and L3 domains, the E2–60-mer alone and with E2 binding E1 and phosphorylated E1. We also evaluated the effects of catalytic reduction of the lipoyl domains of these structures on PDK2 binding. Our data establish that preferential binding to a lipoyl domain-bearing structure acutely depends on the oligomeric state of the lipoyl domain source and is markedly influenced by the state of oxidation/reduction state of the lipoyl group. Reduction of lipoyl groups alters PDK2 binding in a manner that fits a gain in cofactor-kinase interactions, which is apparently needed for reduction of E2 lipoyl groups enhancing PDK activity (1Roche T.E.

The event illustrated how important impact cratering has been, and still is, for all solid bodies in the solar system. In his Perspective, [Reimold][1] charts the history of research into impact cratering, which began in earnest when the Apollo missions returned lunar samples. Many of these samples showed signs of shock deformation that could only have been created by major impacts. Today, there is evidence for past impact events throughout Earth's history. Major impact have been implicated in several mass extinctions, and surveys and space exploration are investigating the future threat from asteroid and comet impact to humankind.
