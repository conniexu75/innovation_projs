https://openalex.org/W2002054992,"The influence of inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides on the α isoform of the RAC-protein kinase B (RAC/PKB) was studied using purified wild type and mutant kinase preparations and a recombinant pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Binding of inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides to the PH domain was measured as the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Inositol phosphates and D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides bound with affinities of 1-10 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively. Similar values were obtained using RAC/PKB expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells in the fluorescence assay. The influence of synthetic dioctanoyl derivatives of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate on the activity of RAC/PKB purified from transfected COS-1 cells was studied. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was found to inhibit the RAC/PKB kinase activity with half-maximal inhibition at 2.5 μM. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate stimulated kinase activity (half-maximal stimulation at 2.5 μM). A mutant RAC/PKB protein lacking the PH domain was not affected by D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. These results demonstrate that the PH domain of RAC/PKB binds inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides with high affinity, and suggest that the products of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase can act as both a membrane anchor and modulator of RAC/PKB activity. The data also provide further evidence for a link between phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and RAC/PKB regulation.

The assembly of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane is one important feature of RTK signal transduction mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Numerous studies suggest that the activation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) by growth factors is also involved (3Panayotou G.

RAC/PKB is a subfamily of the second messenger-regulated serine/threonine kinases (12Ingley E. Hemmings B.A. Hardie D.G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. Acadamic Press, London1995: 95-97Google Scholar). Three isoforms (α, β, α) have been identified, each consisting of an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central kinase domain, and a serine/threonine-rich carboxyl-terminal region (13Jones P.F.

Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), lead to activation of RAC/PKB kinase activity. The activation is promoted by signals emanating from RTK-regulated PI3-K and is accompanied by an increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of RAC/PKB (6Burgering B.M. Th. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 9Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, the Ser-473 site is conserved in many of the second messenger subfamily of protein kinases. The inactivation of kinase activity by in vitro phosphatase treatment suggest that protein phosphatase 2A is also involved in the regulation of RAC/PKB (9Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The inhibition of growth factor-mediated RAC/PKB activation by wortmannin and LY 294002 suggests that RAC/PKB plays a crucial role in perceiving and transmitting signals from RTK-activated PI3-K (6Burgering B.M.

In particular, the amino-terminal PH domain of RAC/PKB appears to be important in kinase regulation because its deletion abrogates activation by PDGF and serum (7Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O.

Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The PH domain is a module of approximately 100 amino acids identified in over 90 different proteins (19Haslam R.J. Koide H.B. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 310-311Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 20Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D.

The primary structure of the PH domain varies in different proteins. The three-dimensional structures have been determined for pleckstrin (22Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), dynamin (23Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), β-spectrin (24Macias M.J. Musacchio A. Ponstingl H. Nilges M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1994; 369: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and phospholipase CΔ-1 (25Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and all are similarly folded. It was noted that the three-dimensional structure of the pleckstrin PH domain had similarities to lipid-binding proteins (22Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Subsequently, inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides were found to bind to PH domains from pleckstrin (26Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), β-spectrin (27Hyvönen M. Macias J.M. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmans M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and phospholipase CΔ-1 (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Structural studies have revealed the critical amino acid residues involved in the binding of inositol phosphates. The structures of the β-spectrin and the phospholipase CΔ-1 (PLCΔ-1) PH domains complexed with inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), indicated that Trp-23 of β-spectrin and Trp-36 of PLCΔ-1 are hydrogen bonded to a phosphate group of the ligand (27Hyvönen M. Macias J.M. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmans M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The existence of an homologous Trp-22 in RAC/PKB prompted us to use the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the RAC/PKB PH domain to monitor interactions with phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates. Here we demonstrate that this PH domain binds with high affinity to certain inositol phosphates and to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. Conflicting results on the influence of D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides on RAC/PKB activity (7Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlaukas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) also led us to examine the effect of these ligands on RAC/PKB kinase activity. The data obtained show that these compounds can both inhibit and activate the kinase in a PH domain-specific manner. The dioctanoyl derivatives of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were synthesized according to the method of Reddy et al. (31Reddy K.K. Saady M. Whited G. Falck J.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3385-3390Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 and inositol phosphates were purchased from Fluka, Switzerland. The RAC/PKB PH domain consisting of amino acids 1-131 was subcloned as a 5′-BamHI/3′-EcoRI PCR fragment into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) vector. The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged constructs (HA-RAC/PKBα and HA-ΔNRAC/PKBα) were previously described (9Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 18Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B.F. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). The 1.6-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment of human RAC/PKBα (13Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen) in the correct orientation. The plasmid was cotransfected into Sf9 cells together with the purified wild-type baculovirus (AcMNPV) DNA. The culture supernatant was collected and the recombinant virus was purified by limiting dilution and screened by dot-blot hybridization. The pure recombinant virus was amplified and then used for recombinant protein production. Escherichia coli JM109 transformed with the pGEX2T PH131 expression construct was diluted in 2 × YT media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, grown at 37 °C to a density OD600 of 0.8 to 0.9, and then induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. Bacterial pellets were lysed in 5 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using lysozyme (1 mg/ml). After lysis, the extracts were treated with 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate and 20 μg/ml DNase I for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose (Sigma) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The glutathione-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the fusion protein eluted with 10 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA for 2 h at room temperature. Following cleavage with 2 units of thrombin (Sigma) per mg of fusion protein, the PH domain preparation was purified to homogeneity by Mono Q FPLC (Pharmacia). The PH domain was eluted from the column with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0-600 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The PH domain eluted at 450 mM NaCl and peak fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE. The Sf9 cells were harvested 72 h after infection with recombinant baculovirus by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with TBS (Tris-buffered saline: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl) and then lysed with extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μM leupeptin, 20 μM aprotinin) at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted 5-fold with the appropriate column buffer and applied directly to the Mono Q column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. The sample was applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and the column was washed with 2 bed volumes before a linear ascending gradient from 0 to 0.4 M NaCl (20 ml) and then from 0.4 to 1.0 M NaCl (10 ml) in column buffer was applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Fractions were analyzed for protein content and by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for RAC/PKB. The fractions containing RAC/PKB were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon-30 to 200 μl and subjected to further purification by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 (HR 10/30) column (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3. The protein was eluted in the above buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for protein content by SDS-PAGE. Epitope-tagged HA-RAC/PKB was purified from 40 × 10-cm dishes of transfected COS-1 cells without treatment or following stimulation with 0.1 mM pervanadate as described previously (9Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 40 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM pervanadate, 100 nM okadaic acid, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g and 4 °C, and the supernatant applied to a 1-ml affinity column of the HA-specific monoclonal antibody 12CA5 covalently attached to protein A-Sepharose according to the supplier's protocol (Pierce). The bound protein was eluted stepwise with 1 mg/ml HA-epitope peptide (AAYPYDVPDYA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pooled fractions were dialyzed for 3 h at 4 °C against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 nM okadaic acid. The dialyzed protein preparation was loaded onto a HR5/5 Mono Q column (FPLC Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and protein eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 50-550 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 nM okadaic acid. The kinase eluted at about 350 mM NaCl and the fractions were analyzed by Western blot and assayed for kinase activity (as described below). Fractions were pooled and spin concentrated with a Centricon-30 (Amicon). HA-ΔNRAC/PKB was purified in the same way from pervanadate-stimulated COS-1 cells, but the kinase eluted from Mono Q at 300 mM NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad kit. Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 50 or 100 μl consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 μM cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, 30 μM Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG) (10Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar), 50 μM ATP with [α-32P]ATP (specific activity 4000 cpm/pmol). Where indicated, PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or other inositol phosphates were added. The reactions were equilibrated at 30 °C for 5 min and initiated by addition of purified protein. At appropriate time points, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction solution were spotted onto P81 filters (Whatman) and washed 4 times with 1% phosphoric acid. Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Under the conditions used the assay is linear for 60 min (see Fig. 4A). The fluorescence measurements were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50 B at 25 °C in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2 at a protein concentration of 1.6-3.2 μg/ml (0.1-0.2 μM) in a volume of 1 ml. The purified protein was excited at a wavelength of 290 nm and fluorescence measured at 345 nm. Titration data were fitted using simple weighting to a rectangular hyperbolic function by nonlinear regression analysis (Grafit 3.0 Erithacus software). To study the function of the PH domain of RAC/PKB we expressed the PH domain (amino acids 1-131 of the RAC/PKBα sequence) as a soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The fusion protein was isolated by affinity chromatography, cleaved by thrombin, and purified to homogeneity by Mono Q ion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1A). Full-length wild type RAC/PKB was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The final purification step involved gel filtration on Superose 12; the purity of the protein obtained by this procedure is shown in Fig. 1B. The RAC/PKB obtained from Sf9 cells had a low specific activity and therefore was probably only phosphorylated on Ser-124 and Thr-450 (18Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B.F. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for activation of RAC/PKB (18Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B.F. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). In order to produce activated RAC/PKB we therefore chose to express the kinase in COS-1 cells. The hemagglutinin-tagged RAC/PKB protein was overexpressed in COS-1 cells and purified as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” The different purified enzyme preparations were used for the characterization of their interaction with inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides. We examined the binding of inositol phosphates to the bacterially expressed PH domain and with RAC/PKB purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Following excitation at 290 nm, the PH domain exhibited an emission spectra typical for tryptophan with a maximum fluorescence at 345 nm; the fluorescence was quenched by approximately 30% upon addition of ligands (Fig. 2A). Similar changes in the fluorescence were detected for the full-length native protein isolated from Sf9 cells, but the fluorescence was only quenched maximally 15% upon addition of ligands (Fig. 2B). No shift of the maximum of the emitted fluorescence was observed with both purified preparations in the presence of ligands. Changes in the fluorescence in the presence of inositol phosphates were used to determine the dissociation constants (Kd) for the complexes. Inositol phosphates bound to the PH domain with micromolar affinities (Table I). For Ins(1)P and Ins(2)P the Kd values were 7.0 and 8.4 μM, respectively (Table I). With Ins(1,4)P2 the affinity was about 3-fold higher with a Kd of 2.4 μM. The highest affinities for inositol phosphates were found with Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, with Kd values of 1.2 μM and 1.5 μM, respectively.TABLE I.Dissociation constants for RAC/PKB inositol phosphate or phosphoinositide complexesPH domainRAC/PKBCompoundDissociation constantStoichiometryDissociation constantStoichiometryμMμMIns(1)P7.0 (±0.42)11.8 (±0.6)Ins(2)P8.4 (±0.64)NDaND, not determined.Ins(1,4)P22.4 (±0.3)4.1 (±0.4)Ins(1,4,5)P31.2 (±0.1)3.2 (±0.4)Ins(1,3,4,5)P41.5 (±0.2)0.952.5 (±0.3)Ins(3,4,5,6)P46.4 (±1.0)ND aND, not determined.Ins(1,2,3,5)P45.0 (±0.5)ND aND, not determined.Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P68.7 (±0.4)7.5 (±0.1)PtdIns(4,5)P22.5 (±0.5)NPbNP, not possible.PtdIns(3,4)P20.57 (±0.03)0.901.0 (0.2)1.02PtdIns(3,4,5)P30.40 (±0.03)0.920.6 (0.05)1.1a ND, not determined.b NP, not possible.

The affinity of the PH domain for Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6 was slightly higher with a Kd of 8.7 μM. The observed affinity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 is about 30-fold higher than values previously reported for β-spectrin (27Hyvönen M. Macias J.M. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmans M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and 3500-fold higher than the affinity of 1-(α-glycerophosphoryl)-inositol(4,5)-bisphosphate for dynamin (32Zheng J. Cahill S. Lemmon M.A. Fushman D. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The PLCΔ-1 PH domain bound Ins(1,4,5)P3 6-fold better than the RAC/PKB PH domain, showing a clear preference for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In contrast to the PH domain of PLCΔ-1, we found specific binding of D3-phosphorylated inositol phosphates by the RAC/PKB PH domain; however, the RAC/PKB PH domain distinguished poorly between Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,4,5)P3. Furthermore, the phosphate groups at positions 3, 4, and 5 of the inositol ring were important for the interaction with the RAC/PKB PH domain, as additional phosphate groups interfered with binding, as observed with Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, Ins(1,2,3,5)P4, and Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6. To examine whether there are dramatic differences in the binding characteristics between the isolated PH domain and the full-length protein, we further determined the affinities for several inositol phosphates to the purified RAC/PKB expressed in Sf9 cells (Table I). Here, we measured a dissociation constant of 11.8 μM for Ins(1)P and 4.1 μM for Ins(1,4)P2, for Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6 the dissociation constant was 7.5 μM. As for the isolated PH domain the inositol phosphates with the highest affinities were found with Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with Kd values of 3.2 and 2.5 μM, respectively. The overall picture of the affinities for the full-length protein was therefore similar to that of the isolated PH domain. To study the interaction of the RAC/PKB PH domain with phosphoinositides we used PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the dioctanoyl derivatives (31Reddy K.K. Saady M. Whited G. Falck J.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3385-3390Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3A). The Kd determined for PtdIns(4,5)P2 was 2.5 μM, which is in the same range as values reported for dynamin (32Zheng J. Cahill S. Lemmon M.A. Fushman D. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and PLCΔ-1 (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The values determined for PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, 570 and 400 nM, respectively, reflect the preference of the RAC/PKB PH domain for D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. The stoichiometry of binding examined by Scatchard analysis indicated a 1:1 complex for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3B). With the dioctanoyl derivatives of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 we were able to determine their affinities for the full-length RAC/PKB;"

It has recently been reported that ceramide activates stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, also known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase JNK), a subfamily member of mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily molecules and that the ceramide/SAPK/JNK signaling pathway is required for stress-induced apoptosis.

This classical MAPK (simply called MAPK here, also known as ERK) is activated by dual phosphorylation catalyzed by MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which is phosphorylated and activated by a serine/threonine kinase, generally called MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). Recently, two novel members of MAPK-related enzymes have been identified (4Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). One subgroup is called stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (5Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

We have recently identified a novel member of mammalian MAPKKK, TAK1. Several lines of evidence suggested that TAK1 functions in the signal transduction pathways triggered by members of the transforming growth factor-μ (TGF-μ) superfamily (10Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). During the course of further biochemical characterization of TAK1, we have found that TAK1 can be activated in response to several stimuli that have been shown to activate SAPK/JNK. Moreover, we noticed that these stimuli are known to induce an increase in ceramide. Ceramide has recently emerged as a second messenger molecule that induces multiple cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis (11Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 12Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been reported that ceramide activates SAPK/JNK and the ceramide-induced activation of SAPK/JNK is required for stress- and ceramide-initiated apoptosis (13Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). This may highlight the role of SAPK/JNK as a mediator of cellular responses induced by ceramide. But the molecular mechanism by which ceramide induces the activation of SAPK/JNK is unknown. In this report, we first show that TAK1 is activated in cells treated with agents and stresses that induce the generation of ceramide. We then show that ceramide itself can activate TAK1. Furthermore, expression of an active form of TAK1 induced activation of SAPK/JNK and its activator, SEK1/MKK4. In addition, expression of a kinase-deficient form of TAK1 interfered with the activation of SAPK/JNK induced by ceramide. These results indicate that TAK1 acts as a mediator for the ceramide-induced activation of SAPK/JNK. A673 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, COS7 cells, and rat 3Y1 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both kinase-negative MPK2 (KN-MPK2) and wild-type SAPKα were expressed as His-tagged proteins and purified using a Ni2+-affinity column (14Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both wild-type XMEK2/SEK1 and kinase-negative MAPK were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified as described (14Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recombinant c-Jun was expressed and purified as described previously (14Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Wild-type and kinase-negative forms of TAK1 cDNAs were subcloned into pSRα-HA vector (15Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K.

Rat SAPKα, mouse SEK1, Xenopus MAPK, and Xenopus MAPKK cDNAs were also subcloned into pSRα-HA vector to generate pSRα-HA-SAPK, pSRα-HA-SEK1, pSRα-HA-MAPK, and pSRα-HA-MAPKK, respectively. TAB1 (1-418) and a kinase-negative form of TAK1 were previously expressed in the pEF vector (16Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transfected into COS7 cells by the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were lysed in an extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM μ-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against COOH-terminal 19 amino acids of TAK1 for 30 min at 4 °C. After the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) beads, the lysates were incubated for an additional 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with a wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM μ-glycerophosphate, and 5 mM EGTA) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to in vitro coupled kinase assays. For immunoprecipitation of HA-TAK1, the cells were homogenized in an extraction buffer. For immunoprecipitation of other HA-tagged kinases, the cells were homogenized in the buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) for 30 min at 4 °C. After the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads, the lysates were incubated for an additional 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed as above and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. The activity of immunoprecipitated TAK1 was assayed by its ability to activate recombinant XMEK2/SEK1, whose activity was assayed by its ability to phosphorylate recombinant KN-MPK2. The immunoprecipitate was incubated with recombinant XMEK2/SEK1 (0.5 mg/ml) in a solution (22 μl) containing 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Then, KN-MPK2 (5 mg/ml, 3 μl) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) was added, and the mixtures were incubated further for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling. After electrophoresis, incorporation of phosphate into KN-MPK2 was detected by autoradiography and quantified by using an image analyzer (Fujix BAS 2000). The activities of immunoprecipitated SAPK, SEK1, MAPK, and MAPKK were assayed by their ability to phosphorylate recombinant c-Jun, recombinant SAPKα, myelin basic protein, and recombinant kinase-negative form of MAPK (KN-MAPK), respectively. The immunoprecipitate was incubated with c-Jun (3.5 mg/ml), SAPKα (2 mg/ml), myelin basic protein (1 mg/ml), or KN-MAPK (1 mg/ml) in a solution containing 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by using an image analyzer. A673 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells were stimulated with TNF-α, IL-1, or anti-Fas antibody, and the immunoprecipitate with anti-TAK1 antibody was subjected to an in vitro coupled kinase assay. This antibody specifically immunoprecipitated endogenous TAK1 (Fig. 1A). TAK1 activity increased in cells exposed to these agents, peaked after 5–10 min, and declined gradually with time (Fig. 1B). We next examined whether TAK1 could be activated by treatment of cells with stresses. An expression construct encoding epitope-tagged TAK1 (HA-TAK1) was transiently transfected into COS7 cells. After treatment of the cells with UV irradiation or sorbitol, TAK1 activity was determined in a coupled kinase assay. TAK1 activity increased within 5 min of exposure of cells to UV irradiation and peaked at 10 min (Fig. 1C). Exposure of the cells to hyperosmolarity with 0.5 M sorbitol also caused an increase in TAK1 activity (Fig. 1C). TAK1 activity was maximal after 30 min, and the high level of activity was sustained for 60 min (Fig. 1C). Because TNF-α (17Kim M.Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) were all known to induce an increase in ceramide, we tested whether TAK1 could be activated by treatment of cells with ceramide itself. COS7 cells were transfected with HA-TAK1 and treated with the membrane-permeable ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide. HA-TAK1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and its activity was determined. TAK1 activity increased within 5 min of exposure of cells to C2-ceramide, was maximal after 10–30 min, and declined with time (Fig. 2B). C2-ceramide stimulated TAK1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). This activation was not observed in immune complexes from cells transfected with an HA epitope-tagged, kinase-negative form of TAK1 (Fig. 2A). The endogenous TAK1 was also activated by treatment with C2-ceramide (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results have demonstrated that ceramide is capable of inducing TAK1 activation. We tested the effect of other lipids on the TAK1 activity. C2-dihydroceramide, which lacks the trans double bond at C-4-C-5 of the sphingoid base backbone, and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, which is an activator of protein kinase C, failed to activate TAK1 activity efficiently (Fig. 2E). Arachidonic acid also failed to activate TAK1 (Fig. 2E). Thus, C2-ceramide specifically activates TAK1. TAK1 was originally identified as a mediator of the signal transductions triggered by the TGF-μ superfamily (10Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Most recently, one of TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1, has been identified as an activator for TAK1 (16Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A truncated form of TAB1 lacking the TAK1-binding domain (TAB1 (1-418)) was shown to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of TGF-μ-induced gene expression (16Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TAB1 (1-418) almost completely suppressed the activation of TAK1 induced by TGF-μ stimulation but had little effect on the ceramide-induced activation of TAK1 (data not shown). These results may indicate that ceramide and TGF-μ activate TAK1 through TAB1-independent and -dependent pathways, respectively. A recent report of Verheij et al. (13Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) suggested the central role of SAPK/JNK in the ceramide-induced signal transduction. We therefore examined whether TAK1 participates in SAPK/JNK activation induced by ceramide. We have previously shown that a truncated form of TAK1 lacking NH2-terminal 20 amino acids (TAK1ΔN) is constitutively active (10Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). The expression vector encoding TAK1ΔN was co-transfected into COS7 cells with an expression vector encoding HA-tagged SAPK/JNK or HA-tagged MAPK, and the activity of SAPK/JNK or MAPK was determined in the immunoprecipitate obtained with anti-HA antibody. Co-expression of TAK1ΔN induced activation of SAPK/JNK (Fig. 3A) but not that of MAPK (Fig. 3B). Co-expression of TAK1ΔN with SEK1/MKK4 or MAPKK, direct activators of SAPK/JNK and MAPK, respectively, resulted in activation of SEK1/MKK4 (Fig. 3C) but not that of MAPKK (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrated that TAK1 is able to activate the SEK1/MKK4 → SAPK/JNK cascade but unable to activate the MAPKK → MAPK cascade. Furthermore, when a kinase-negative form of TAK1 was co-expressed, the C2-ceramide-induced activation of SAPK/JNK was suppressed markedly (Fig. 3E), indicating that TAK1 is required for SAPK/JNK activation induced by ceramide. In this study we have shown that TAK1, a recently identified MAPKKK family molecule, is activated in cells treated with cytokines and stresses that are known to induce the generation of ceramide (13Verheij M.

We have here further shown that ceramide itself is able to activate TAK1 (Fig. 2). TAK1 activation was not observed in cells treated with other types of lipids, including diacylglycerol and arachidonic acid (Fig. 2). These results thus suggest that TAK1 may participate in the signal transduction pathway initiated by ceramide. In the present study, expression of a constitutively active mutant of TAK1 resulted in the activation of SAPK/JNK and its direct activator SEK1/MKK4 (Fig. 3, A and C). Expression of a kinase-negative mutant of TAK1 suppressed the activation of SAPK/JNK induced by ceramide (Fig. 3E). Therefore, TAK1 is necessary and sufficient for the activation of SAPK/JNK induced by ceramide. Although Raf-1, another member of MAPKKK family, has been shown to be a mediator of ceramide signaling to classical MAPK (23Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

Our present results have identified TAK1 as a crucial mediator of ceramide signaling to SAPK/JNK. The mechanism of TAK1 activation in response to ceramide should be elucidated. Several molecules have previously been reported as direct targets for ceramide, including ceramide-activated protein kinase (26Joseph C.K. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

Neurite outgrowth mediated by the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) requires the src family tyrosine kinase p59fyn in nerve growth cones, but the molecular basis for this interaction has not been defined. The NCAM140 isoform, which is found in migrating growth cones, selectively co-immunoprecipitated with p59fyn from nonionic detergent (Brij 96) extracts of early postnatal mouse cerebellum and transfected rat B35 neuroblastoma and COS-7 cells. p59fyn did not associate significantly with the NCAM180 isoform, which is found at sites of stable neural cell contacts, or with the glycophosphatidylinositol-linked NCAM120 isoform. pp60c-src, a tyrosine kinase that promotes neurite growth on the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1, did not interact with any NCAM isoform. Whereas p59fyn was constitutively associated with NCAM140, the focal adhesion kinase p125fak, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase known to mediate integrin-dependent signaling, became recruited to the NCAM140-p59fyn complex when cells were reacted with antibodies against the extracellular region of NCAM. Treatment of cells with a soluble NCAM fusion protein or with NCAM antibodies caused a rapid and transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and p59fyn. These results suggest that NCAM140 binding interactions at the cell surface induce the assembly of a molecular complex of NCAM140, p125fak, and p59fyn and activate the catalytic function of these tyrosine kinases, initiating a signaling cascade that may modulate growth cone migration.

INTRODUCTIONNeuronal migration, axon pathfinding, and fasciculation are fundamental processes that underlie the formation of accurate synaptic connections during development. These processes are governed by interactions of cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix, and neurotrophic factors with receptors on the neuronal cell surface. How these interactions are integrated and translated biochemically into molecular signals that guide growth cones to their synaptic targets is not well understood.NCAM, 1The abbreviations used are:NCAMneural cell adhesion moleculeGPIglycophosphatidylinositolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidmAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPNDpostnatal day. a neural cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, promotes axon growth, fasciculation, and cell adhesion by homophilic and heterophilic interactions (1Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.A. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). NCAM has a complex expression pattern due to alternative splicing, developmental regulation, and posttranslational processing, producing a number of isoforms. Alternative splicing of a single gene results in three major NCAM isoforms as follows: transmembrane forms of 140 and 180 kDa, and a 120-kDa glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked isoform (2Murray B.A. Hemperly J.J. Prediger E.A. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of the transmembrane isoforms lack catalytic activity but may mediate interactions with intracellular cytoskeletal and signaling molecules. NCAM180 is identical to NCAM140 except for a 261-amino acid insert in the cytoplasmic domain (2Murray B.A. Hemperly J.J. Prediger E.A. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This insert confers the potential for interaction with spectrin and reduces lateral mobility of NCAM in the plasma membrane (3Pollerberg G.E. Burridge K. Krebs K.E. Goodman S.R. Schachner M. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). NCAM140 is present in free, migratory growth cones, whereas NCAM180 is found at sites of cell-cell contact, where it may be involved in stabilization of synapses (3Pollerberg G.E. Burridge K. Krebs K.E. Goodman S.R. Schachner M. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Persohn E. Pollerberg G.W. Schachner M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 288: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). NCAM120 is present in some neurons but is mainly found in glia (5Noble M. Albrechtsen M. Moller C. Lyles J. Bock E. Goridis C. Watanabe M. Rutishauser U. Nature. 1985; 316: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All three isoforms can be posttranslationally modified by addition of polysialic acid, a carbohydrate moiety that modulates axon guidance (6Rutishauser U. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 3: 709-715Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Tang J. Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). NCAM can also be expressed as an isoform with a 10-amino acid insertion in the 4th Ig domain (VASE isoform), resulting in down-regulation of its axon growth-promoting ability (8Small S.J. Haines S.L. Akeson R. Neuron. 1988; 1: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Liu L. Haines S. Shew R. Akeson R.A. J. Neurosci.

NCAM functions in the adult as a modulator of learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity, as NCAM antibodies reduce long term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices (11Lüthi A. Laurent J.P. Figurov A. Muller D. Schachner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and mice with a total NCAM gene knockout have deficits in spatial memory (12Cremer H. Lange R.

L1, another transmembrane glycoprotein of the Ig superfamily found in growth cones and axons, plays similar roles in adhesion and neurite growth and may also function in learning and memory (11Lüthi A.

Studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein have demonstrated positive as well as negative effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on neurite outgrowth (21Miller D.R. Lee G.M. Maness P.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2134-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Bixby J.L. Jhabvala P. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Williams E.J.

Saito H. Cell. 1996; 84: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Two members of the src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, p59fyn and pp60c-src, act as positive regulators of neurite growth (27Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Ignelzi M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). During the major period of neuronal process outgrowth, these kinases are widely expressed on many axonal tracts, where they are localized to the plasma membrane of growth cones and axons (29Fults D.W. Towle A.C. Lauder J.M. Maness P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Maness P.F. Aubry M. Shores C.G. Frame L. Pfenninger K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1429-1436PubMed Google Scholar). p59fyn and pp60c-src exhibit a remarkable specificity for stimulating neurite growth on NCAM and L1, respectively. Cerebellar and dorsal root ganglion neurons from fyn-minus mice display complete inhibition of NCAM-dependent neurite growth on NCAM140-expressing fibroblast monolayers, whereas src-minus and yes-minus neurons show unimpaired neurite growth on NCAM (27Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). On an L1 substrate, neurons from src-minus but not fyn- or yes-minus mice are impaired for neurite outgrowth, although in this case neurite growth is reduced by only 50% (28Ignelzi M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These results suggest the existence of separately regulated pathways for NCAM and L1 signaling.NCAM and L1 signaling pathways appear to be capable of some degree of functional compensation, as fyn-minus and src-minus mice do not have severe neurological phenotypes. However, the hippocampus of fyn-minus mice is mildly affected, showing loosely organized dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, increased neuronal number, and blunted long term potentiation (32Grant S.G.N. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Another strain of fyn-minus mice displays partially impaired myelination (33Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). src-minus mice show no neurological abnormalities but instead develop osteopetrosis, a bone remodeling disease of osteoclasts (34Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Because both NCAM and L1 are coexpressed on many neuroanatomical tracts, the effects of eliminating either p59fyn or pp60c-src might be minimized due to compensation by the other intact adhesion pathway. In support of this possibility, src/fyn double mutants show defective axonal growth in vivo (35Morse W.R. Whitesides J.G. Morell P. LaMantia A.-S. Maness P.F. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1469Google Scholar) and die perinatally (36Stein P.L. Vogel H. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1999-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Such separately regulated adhesion pathways may serve to minimize errors in axonal pathfinding.A biochemical approach has been undertaken to identify the molecular components of the NCAM signaling pathway. Here it is reported that p59fyn but not pp60c-src associated preferentially with the NCAM140 isoform. In addition the focal adhesion kinase (p125fak) (37Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that mediates extracellular matrix signaling through integrin receptors, was recruited to the complex by NCAM cross-linking, and both p125fak and p59fyn became rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine upon NCAM stimulation. These results suggest that NCAM140, p125fak, and p59fyn comprise a functional adhesion signaling complex that may modulate growth cone motility.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures, Antibodies, and NCAM Fusion ProteinSimian COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Rat B35 neuroblastoma cell lines stably expressing cDNAs encoding NCAM140 or −180 (9Liu L. Haines S. Shew R. Akeson R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 327-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Richard Akeson (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The following monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal (pAb) antibodies were used: p59fyn pAb FYN3 (Santa Cruz, CA), pp60c-src mAb 327 (38Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.L. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NCAM mAbs 14.2 and 16.2 (Becton Dickinson, Inc.), NCAM mAb 5B8 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), NCAM mAb 310 (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), NCAM pAb 1505 (Sigma), p125fak pAbs BC3 and HUB3 (M. Schaller, University of North Carolina; T. Parsons, University of Virginia), phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), normal rabbit and mouse IgG (Sigma), and goat anti-rat and anti-mouse IgG (Sigma).Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a fusion protein consisting of the entire NCAM extracellular domain fused to the Fc region of human IgG were provided by Melitta Schachner (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). The NCAM-Fc protein was isolated from conditioned medium by affinity chromatography using Protein G-Sepharose.Plasmids, Transfection, and Extract PreparationThe eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 containing the human cytomegalovirus promoter was used for all constructs. Plasmid constructs contained full-length cDNA clones encoding the B isoform of mouse p59fyn, which is expressed in brain and other tissues (39Cooke M.P. Perlmutter R.M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar), the mouse c-src+ isoform containing a 6-amino acid insert in the SH3 domain (40Martinez R. Mathey-Prevot B. Bernards A. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 237: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the chicken c-src isoform lacking that insert (M. Schaller, University of North Carolina), or the rat NCAM140 and NCAM180 isoforms with and without VASE sequences (R. Akeson laboratory, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH).COS-7 or B35 neuroblastoma cells (2 × 106 cells/plate) were transferred to serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with indicated plasmid DNA (10 μg) for 8 h at 37 °C using lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fetal calf serum (10%) was added, and cells were incubated for a further 16 h. Medium was replaced with either Opti-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (COS-7 cells) or 0.5% fetal calf serum and 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP to induce neuronal differentiation (B35 cells). Cells were incubated for a further 24 h before lysis or NCAM cross-linking. For lysis the medium was removed and cells were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C with Opti-MEM containing 1 mM sodium pervanadate to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases. Cells were then solubilized at 4 °C in a nonionic detergent buffer (Brij lysis buffer) containing 1% Brij 96, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM NaEDTA, 1 mM NaEGTA, 500 μg/ml Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), 200 μM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 0.01% leupeptin, 0.11 trypsin-inhibiting units/ml aprotinin. Lysates were passed through a 22-gauge syringe and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cerebella were isolated from wild type C57Bl/6 mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley) at postnatal day 4 as described (27Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and Brij extracts were prepared similarly. Protein concentrations were determined by the micro-BCA method (Pierce).The efficiency of solubilization of p59fyn and pp60c-src was evaluated in pilot experiments with a membrane fraction from fetal rat brain using a variety of nonionic detergents including Brij 96, Triton X-100, digitonin, N-octylglucoside, CHAPS, and sodium deoxycholate. Only Brij 96 (0.1-1%) and to a lesser extent Triton X-100 (1%) afforded complete solubilization with retention of kinase activity, as judged by the distribution of p59fyn and pp60c-src protein and kinase activities in supernatant and pellet fractions (17Klinz, S. G., (1995) Analysis of Cell Adhesion Molecules L1 and N-CAM in Phosphorylation-mediated Signal Transduction Pathways in Growth Cones from Fetal Rat Brain.

Cells were rinsed with Opti-MEM and incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG for 20 min at 4 °C and then transferred to 37 °C. Alternatively, cells were incubated with the NCAM Fc-fusion protein (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. Prior to lysis, cells were incubated for 5 min in Opti-MEM containing 1 mM sodium pervanadate at 4 °C; then extracts were prepared in Brij lysis buffer (0.75 ml). NCAM immunoprecipitates were collected by the addition of 35 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) suspension of Protein G-Sepharose in Brij lysis buffer.Immunoprecipitation, in Vitro Kinase Assays, and ImmunoblottingImmunoprecipitationCell lysates were precleared by incubation with normal IgG for 30 min and Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Primary antibody in excess amount (1 μg) or normal IgG was added to equal amounts of extract (500 μg to 1 mg) in a 1-ml volume, and extracts were incubated with gentle inversion for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 40 μl of Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose for polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Pellets were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min and washed 4 times with Brij lysis buffer.In Vitro Kinase AssaysImmunoprecipitates were incubated in a kinase reaction buffer (30 μl) containing 7.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MnCl2, 3 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 1 μM ATP. In vitro kinase assays of immune complexes from cerebellum were performed with 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) per reaction without additional unlabeled ATP. Phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. Beads were washed and proteins eluted by boiling for 10 min in 3% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 100 μM Na3VO4, with removal of beads by centrifugation. For re-immunoprecipitation, supernatants were diluted 1/12 in Brij lysis buffer, incubated with antibody (1 μg) for 1 h, and Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose for 30 min. The beads were washed 3 times, heated to 95 °C for 3 min in SDS sample buffer, and the supernatant proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE, pH 8.8. Autoradiography on Dupont Chronex 6-plus x-ray film was carried out with intensifying screens at −70 °C.Stoichiometry of Association of p59fyn and p125fak with NCAMNCAM140 was immunoprecipitated from Brij lysis buffer extracts of mouse cerebellum or cell cultures under conditions of antibody excess, and in vitro kinase assays were carried out as described above and in Fig. 1A. Proteins were eluted from the immune complexes, incubated with Fyn or Fak antibodies, and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The amount of 32P-labeled p59fyn or p125fak was quantitated by Cerenkov counting of excised gel bands and compared with the total amount of 32P-labeled p59fyn or p125fak immunoprecipitated from the same amount of extract protein. In some experiments stoichiometry was estimated by densitometric scanning of bands obtained by enhanced chemiluminescence of immunoblots.ImmunoblottingProteins were separated under nonreducing (p59fyn) or reducing (p125fak) conditions by SDS-PAGE, pH 8.8, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were blocked for 2 h in 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. After 5 washes of 5 min each in TBS/Tween buffer (0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), filters were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 5 washes in TBS/Tween buffer. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). To reprobe immunoblots the membranes were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 10% SDS, 0.02 M Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and rinsed with TBS/Tween.DISCUSSIONThe results reported here demonstrate a physical and functional interaction of the 140-kDa isoform of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM with the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase p125fak and the src-related tyrosine kinase p59fyn. Antibody-mediated ligation of cell surface NCAM140 or stimulation with soluble NCAM fusion protein led to a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both p125fak and p59fyn, suggesting that activation of these nonreceptor tyrosine kinases is a proximal event in the NCAM signal transduction pathway.The interaction of p59fyn with NCAM was consistent with the impaired NCAM-dependent neurite growth displayed by fyn-minus neurons in culture and the widespread distribution of p59fyn in developing axonal tracts and nerve growth cones (31Bare D.J. Lauder J.M. Wilkie M.B. Maness P.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1429-1436PubMed Google Scholar). The binding preference of NCAM for p59fyn and not pp60c-src was in accord with the impaired NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth of fyn-minus but not src-minus neurons (27Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The distinct but overlapping molecular associations mediated by the SH2 and SH3 domains of src family members provides a molecular basis for substratum-specific cellular responses displayed by growth cones (79Maness P.F. Beggs H.E. Klinz S.G. Morse W.R. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 4: 159-181Google Scholar). Neurons display different growth cone morphologies when plated on NCAM, L1, N-cadherin, laminin, and p84 suggesting that adhesive contacts and cytoskeletal structure are differentially modulated on these substrates (54Payne H.R. Burden S.M. Lemmon V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 21: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 55Abosch A. Lagenaur C. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 56Burden-Gulley S.M. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A molecular basis for these differences is not easily explained by a model in which a single tyrosine kinase, the fibroblast growth factor receptor, is responsible for neurite outgrowth on NCAM, L1, and N-cadherin (57Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Unlike p59fyn, we have not been able to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor upon NCAM antibody binding in our assays. However, the fibroblast growth factor receptor may provide trophic support that is permissive for neurite extension in certain neuronal cell types.Strict specificity was displayed by p59fyn and p125fak for the NCAM140 transmembrane isoform. Since NCAM140 is preferentially found in free migratory growth cones in contrast to NCAM180, which is associated with stable cell contacts (3Pollerberg G.E. Burridge K. Krebs K.E. Goodman S.R. Schachner M. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Persohn E. Pollerberg G.W. Schachner M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 288: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), these kinases may be necessary for migration of growth cones toward their targets. A developmentally regulated isoform switch from NCAM140 to NCAM180 in neurons could facilitate the transition from growth cone to synapse by terminating p59fyn and p59fak signaling, and down-regulation of expression of p59fyn and p59fak during maturation (31Bare D.J. Lauder J.M. Wilkie M.B. Maness P.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1429-1436PubMed Google Scholar, 58Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.-A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) could contribute to such a transition. A primary role for p59fyn compared with pp60c-src in p125fak activation is also indicated by reduced p125fak tyrosine phosphorylation in the brains of fyn-minus but not src-minus mice (59Grant S.G.N. Karl K.A. Kiebler M.A. Kandel E.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and preferential complex formation between p125fak and p59fyn in nontransformed, nonneural cells (47Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar).p59fyn appeared to be constitutively bound to NCAM140, either directly or indirectly, whereas p125fak was recruited to the NCAM complex. The binding site for p59fyn (or an adaptor protein) may reside within the cytoplasmic domain of NCAM140, because the 261-amino acid insert in the corresponding region of NCAM180 effectively disrupts the association. The NCAM140 “tail” does not contain any known phosphorylated tyrosine residues for the binding of the p59fyn SH2 domain (60Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and hence the interaction is unlike that of p59fyn with myelin-associated glycoprotein, which is mediated by the p59fyn SH2 and SH3 domains (33Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Instead, NCAM140 might interact with the amino-terminal unique"
https://openalex.org/W1991708828,"During cell-matrix adhesion, both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases are activated. Integrin ligation correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the later stages of spreading and focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in primary fibroblasts requires interactions of cell surface proteoglycan with heparin-binding moieties. This correlates with protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and PKCα can become localized to focal adhesions in normal, but not transformed, cells. PKC activation has been thought to be downstream of initial receptor-ligand interactions. We now show, however, that syndecan-4 transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan and PKC co-immunoprecipitate and co-patch in vivo. The core protein of syndecan-4 can directly bind the catalytic domain of PKCα and potentiate its activation by phospholipid mediators. It can also directly activate PKCα in the absence of other mediators. This activity resides in the sequence LGKKPIYKK in the center of the short cytoplasmic domain, and other syndecans lack this sequence and PKC regulatory properties.

During adhesion to fibronectin, integrin clustering activates tyrosine kinases (1Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J.

Adhesion to the “cell-binding” 105-kDa fragment of fibronectin through ligation of integrin α5μ1 is sufficient only for attachment and spreading in anchorage-dependent primary fibroblasts in the absence of serum and protein synthesis (8Woods A.

To drive the cytoskeletal and receptor clustering that accompany the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, an additional activation of protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CPKMprotein kinase MDLdioleinGSTglutathione S-transferasePLphospholipidPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePSphosphatidylserineREFrat embryo fibroblasts; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is needed (2Clark E.A.

Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 313: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This can be provided by addition of heparin-binding fibronectin moieties (8Woods A. Couchman J.R. J.

These agents appear to signal through a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, since treatment with heparinase prevents the response (11Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and mutant cells lacking (13LeBaron R.G. Esko J.D. Woods A. Johansson S. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), or having undersulfated cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (14Couchman J.R. Austria R. Woods A. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Physiol. 1988; 136: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), have reduced capacity to form focal adhesions or stress fibers. Similarly, addition of PRARI peptides to synovial fibroblasts prespread on substrates of 105-kDa fragment markedly increased the size of vinculin-positive adhesion plaques (12Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The need for addition of heparin-binding agents can be circumvented by treatment of cells with active, but not inactive, phorbol esters (8Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there is downstream activation of the RhoA G-protein (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar), which may initiate a contractile response (3Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev.

Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) when PKC is activated (20Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PKCα is also localized in focal adhesions of normal cells (21Hyatt S.L. Klauck T. Jaken S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1990; 3: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is presumably anchored there, but the mechanism of anchorage has not been elucidated. Although activation of PKC is usually considered a downstream effect following receptor-ligand interactions, these previous studies led us to investigate whether syndecan-4 core protein could directly bind PKC and effect its localization to forming adhesions. We now report the first example of a mechanism for signaling through a transmembrane proteoglycan. The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 core protein can directly regulate both the localization and activity of PKC through interactions of a sequence unique to syndecan-4 with the catalytic domain of PKC. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, subconfluent rat embryo fibroblasts (REF) were scraped (107 cells/immunoprecipitate) into 10 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine HCl, 1 mM leupeptin, 750 μM CaCl2), precleared by centrifugation, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-blocked (30 min) with 10% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, supernatants were sequentially incubated (30 min each) with 20 μg/ml monoclonal anti-syndecan-4 150.9 IgG raised against its NH2 terminus, 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp. Carpinteria, CA) and fresh preblocked protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were centrifuged, washed eight times with lysis buffer, boiled for 3 min, and released material immunoblotted with pan-specific anti-PKC recognizing the COOH terminus of the catalytic domains of PKCα, PKCμI, PKCμII, PKCγ, and PKCδ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) following 3–15% SDS-PAGE. Bound antibody was detected by goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). Some cultures were pretreated before lysis with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA: 200 nM, 15 min); in others 4V or scrambled peptide (50 μg/ml) was added at lysis and was present throughout. To demonstrate co-patching in vivo, REF were plated for 20 min onto coverslips coated with fibronectin (19Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), treated sequentially with 150.9 IgG and goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC), warmed for 20 min in the presence or absence of 200 nM PMA (22Burn P. Kupfer A. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and stained with anti-PKC followed by goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Texas Red (Organon Teknika) after fixation and permeabilization (19Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). No breakthrough or inappropriate cross-reactivity of antibodies was detected in controls. For affinity chromatography on Affi-Gel-102 to which peptides were coupled through NH2-terminal cysteine by sulfo-LC-SPDP (Pierce), REF (5 × 106 cells/sample) were scraped into 6 ml of lysis buffer lacking calcium, centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and CaCl2 (750 μM) and PMA (200 nM) were added to the supernatant as indicated. Columns were washed with 50 mM NaCl and eluted with 1 mM EDTA, or 1 M NaCl, released material being concentrated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and immunoblotted with anti-PKC following 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.). In solid phase binding assays (Pierce), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate wells were coated with peptides (1 μg/well in NaHCO3, pH 9.6, 4 °C, overnight), washed, and unoccupied sites blocked with 5% milk (1 h). Second, PKCα (10 ng) was allowed to bind (37 °C, 30 min) in the presence or absence (for binding conditions, see legend to Fig. 1D) of phospholipid (50 μg/ml PS, 5 μg/ml DL) and/or 1 mM CaCl2. Third, bound enzyme was activated with 0.2 mg/ml PS, 0.02 mg/ml DL, 750 μM CaCl2 to phosphorylate added dye-labeled serine-substituted PKC pseudosubstrate (16 ng/well, 37 °C for 30 min). Phosphorylation was monitored by absorbance at 570 nm following affinity separation. Absorbance is normally proportional to the amount of PKCα bound. cDNA for full-length or truncated core proteins of syndecan-4 in glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia) were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, solubilized with 1% N-laurylsarcosine in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine HCl, purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma), washed to exchange bound detergent to 0.1% Triton X-100, eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM reduced glutathione (Janssen Chimica, New Brunswick, NJ), subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE, and labeled by Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted with anti-GST (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Similar results were seen with PKCαμγ (1.2 ng) from rat brain (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or 1 ng of recombinant PKCα (Molecular Probes and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). These were incubated (10 min, room temperature) in 20 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 3 mM magnesium acetate, 750 μM CaCl2, 200 μM ATP (0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 3 μg of histone III-S (Sigma) with preformed phospholipid (PL: 4 μg of PS and 0.4 μg of DL, briefly sonicated) micelles as indicated. Dose-response assays (not shown) determined that these conditions gave maximum activation of PKCα. Fusion proteins (1 μg) or synthetic peptides were added to preformed micelles, except for 4L, which was only effective when added during their formation. In phosphorylation assays with protein kinase M (PKM: 1.3 ng; PKC catalytic subunit from rat brain, Calbiochem), calcium was omitted, but PL was present to control for any contamination with whole PKC, which would be activated by PL. The commercial PKM preparation did not contain PKC, since no increased activity was seen on addition of PL (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Other PKM assays also, therefore, contained PL for comparative purposes. Reactions were stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid (to 20%) and 0.5% SDS (fusion protein assays) and the precipitates analyzed or by direct analysis following addition of 5 × SDS-PAGE mixture (peptide assays). Products were subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis (n = 2–10, values shown are mean ± S.E., means compared by Student's t test). The presence of NH2-terminal cysteine to allow conjugation to affinity matrices had no effect except to enhance direct activation. All assays terminated when activity was maximal and linear. The cytoplasmic domains of the syndecan family members are highly homologous except for one central region (16Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 17Couchman J.R. Woods A. Roberts D.D. Mecham R.P. Cell Surface and Extracellular Glycoconjugates.

Since syndecan-4 is the only syndecan present in focal adhesions of fibroblasts, we tested in several ways whether this unique region (here termed 4V) mediated interactions with PKC. First, PKC was co-immunoprecipitated from REF cell lysate with syndecan-4 proteoglycan in the presence, but not the absence, of phorbol ester (PMA) to activate PKC (23Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Marks F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This was prevented by inclusion of the cytoplasmic domain peptide 4V as a competitor, but not by a peptide of scrambled sequence (Fig. 1A). Second, when syndecan-4 was patched on the surface of spreading cells, PKC was co-patched (Fig. 1B). This co-patching of initially diffuse syndecan-4 and PKC was accelerated by PMA (not shown). Third, when cell lysates were passed over an affinity matrix of syndecan 4V peptide (but not the equivalent 2V peptide), two components corresponding in molecular mass to PKCα and PKM (the catalytic domain of PKC) were specifically eluted and detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against PKC catalytic domain (Fig. 1C). Again, binding of PKC or PKM was not detected in the absence of calcium and PMA to activate PKC (23Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Marks F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (compare lanes 3 and 4). PMA was the required agent, however, since elution with EDTA (lane 2) had no effect. Fourth, interaction was also seen in solid phase assays (Fig. 1D) where substrates of 4V specifically and directly bound PKCα. This assay requires coating substrates with the peptide of interest, adding PKCα under differing binding conditions, washing, and then activating bound PKCα by addition of PL. Minimal binding occurred to wells coated only with milk (M: negative control; nonspecific binding). Maximal binding occurred to wells blocked with milk after addition of PKCα (P: positive control), but phosphorylation was even more evident in wells coated with 4V peptide, since this reflects not just binding, but also potentiation of activity. Binding of PKCα was again optimal where the enzyme had been activated with calcium and PL during binding to 4V-coated substrates (compare last three lanes in Fig. 1D). Since syndecan-4 appeared to bind PKC, both in vivo and in vitro, we monitored whether this could affect enzyme activity. Fig. 2A shows a diagram of three GST-fusion proteins containing either full-length syndecan-4 core protein (4W) or with truncated cytoplasmic domains (4I, 4R). Fig. 2B shows these purified fusion proteins by Coomassie Blue staining (lanes 1–3) and immunoblotting with antibodies against GST (lanes 4–6). All the fusion proteins migrated with Mr much greater than the predicted molecular mass (44-47 kDa), indicative of the formation of SDS-resistant oligomers as seen in all syndecans and confirming that the cytoplasmic domain is not essential for self-association (24Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These fusion proteins were used in in vitro assays to test for regulation of activity of a mixture of PKCαμγ. When phosphorylation by PKC of histone III-S was already maximal due to the presence of PL and calcium, full-length syndecan-4 fusion protein potentiated the activity of a mixture of PKCαμγ (lane 1, Fig. 2C) a further 3-fold. This was not seen in the presence of 4I or 4R (Fig. 2C). Similar potentiation was seen with recombinant PKCα (not shown). None of the fusion proteins served as a PKC substrate. Syndecan-4 appeared to act through the catalytic domain of PKCα, since 4W fusion protein, but not truncated fusion protein, could also potentiate the activity of PKM (Fig. 3A), which lacks the regulatory PL- and calcium-binding domains, and is, therefore, constitutively active. It also bound both PKC and PKM (Fig. 1C). From binding studies and the different effects of the truncated fusion proteins, it appeared that the active region in syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain was the V region. Similar assays were performed, therefore, with synthetic peptides corresponding to the whole cytoplasmic domain (4L) and V (4V, 2V) regions of syndecan-4 or its closest homolog, syndecan-2 (Fig. 3B). PKM is constitutively active in the absence of PL, since it lacks the regulatory domain. An absence of intact PKC in the PKM preparation was confirmed by a comparison of histone phosphorylation in the absence or presence of PL (compare lanes 1 and 2). Peptide 4L (lane 3) and 4V (lane 4) potentiated phosphorylation of histones by PKM with an average increase of 3.5-4-fold. Neither a peptide of scrambled 4V sequence (Scr; lane 5) nor the corresponding sequence from syndecan-2 (2V; lane 6) showed any enhancement of histone phosphorylation. The equivalent sequence from syndecan-1 was also ineffective (not shown). Whole PKCα was inactive in the absence of PL (Fig. 3C, lane 1), but activated by PL (lane 2). This PL-mediated PKCα activity was potentiated by the addition of peptide 4V (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Quantification indicated an average increase to 302 ± 41% in the presence of 4V over normally maximal PL-mediated activity (Fig. 3C, lane 2), and 40-fold increase over base-line activity (i.e. in the absence of PL; Fig. 3C, lane 1). This was dose-dependent, and clearly detectable at 0.45 μM peptide (not shown). As a further indication of the independent regulatory properties of syndecan-4 V region, histone phosphorylation by PKCα was detected, even in the absence of PL (Fig. 3C, lane 6) when 4V was added. Direct activation was also dose-dependent with maximal activation at 0.1 mM (not shown), but never reached the levels seen in the presence of PL; the average increase was 3-fold over base line. No activity was again seen with the scrambled peptide or 2V (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 8). Similar potentiation of PL-mediated activation, and direct activation of PKCαμγ, was seen in assays using a physiological substrate, an epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (25Lund K.A. Lazar C.S. Chen W.S. Walsh B.J. Welsh J.B. Herbst J.J. Walton G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20517-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). Therefore, the effects of 4V on potentiation of PL-mediated PKC activation were not merely due to facilitation of histone interaction with PL vesicles. Furthermore, direct activation of PKC by 4V peptide can occur in the absence of PL (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 1 and 6). The 4V region is highly cationic, and protamine has been shown previously to activate PKC in a PL-independent manner (26Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further experiments with 4V peptides of altered or scrambled sequence confirmed the specificity for PKCα regulation by syndecan-4 (Fig. 4, A and B). Even conservative substitutions markedly diminished the ability to potentiate PL-mediated activation or to directly activate PKCα in the absence of PL. Protein kinase C binding to syndecan-4 was seen using intact core protein and cytoplasmic peptides in vitro and intact glycosylated syndecan-4 in vivo. A specific region of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 was mapped as a site that interacts with and regulates the activity of PKCα and PKM. This region of syndecan-4 is the first example of a protein sequence from a cell surface receptor that can directly regulate PKC localization and activity. Syndecan-4 probably interacts through the catalytic domain of PKC, since it elevated the activity of this isolated domain (PKM), and PKCα activity was additive in the presence of both 4V and PL. Binding of PKCα to the V region of syndecan-4 in vitro was only clearly detectable after enzyme activation by PMA, whereas co-patching occurred in vivo without additional treatment. Treatment of cells with PMA did, however, accelerate the patching process, indicating that binding of mediators to the regulatory domain may enhance the availability of the catalytic domain of PKC for binding to syndecan-4. PKC is active early during cell spreading (4Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its activation results in syndecan-4 translocation to stabilizing sites of cell-matrix adhesion (20Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that, during cell adhesion, conventional activation of PKCα facilitates its interaction with ligated and clustered syndecan-4 and the colocalization of this complex to focal adhesions. Syndecan-4 may then, at these sites, compartmentalize PKCα and regulate its phosphorylation of other cytoplasmic components. Consistent with a role for syndecan-4 core protein regulating PKC activity during focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (8Woods A. Couchman J.R. J.

Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Direct measurement of the endogenous production of CO from vascular smooth muscle cells has also recently been realized (2Cook M.N. Nakatsu K. Marks G.S. McLaughlin B.E. Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Brien J.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our previous study (3Wang R. Can. J. Cardiol. 1995; 11: 69PubMed Google Scholar), as well as those of others (4Furchgott R. Jothianandan D. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 52-61PubMed Google Scholar, 5Graser T. Vedernikov Y.P. Li D.S. Biomed.

For example, CO relaxed precontracted rat tail artery strips in a concentration-dependent manner (3Wang R. Can. J. Cardiol. 1995; 11: 69PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of CO was mediated partially by a cGMP signaling pathway and partially by calcium-activated K (KCa) channels. Using the single channel recording patch-clamp technique, we found that CO increased the open probability (NPo) of KCa channels. 2R. Wang, L. Wu, and Z. Z. Wang, unpublished observation. This effect of CO may be caused by a direct interaction between CO and KCa channels as the activities of the cGMP pathway and G proteins are not involved in the activation of KCa channels by CO. To date, the mechanism by which CO directly affects KCa channels remains unclear.The electrical properties of KCa channels are determined by different amino acid residues that are constitutive components of the channel protein. The primary structure of KCa channels in several cell types, excluding vascular smooth muscle cells, is known, but the functional roles of various amino acids in the gating and conducting of KCa channels are still in question. Limited studies show that the modification of one or more amino acid residues may significantly change the conductance and/or NPo of KCa channels (7Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 8Frace A.M. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1081-C1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9MacKinnon R. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both synthetic chemical reagents and some simple biological active molecules such as nitric oxide (7Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) and hydrogen peroxide (10Lee K. Ozanne S.E. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 139: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) can specifically react with certain amino acid residues, thus affecting the functions of ion channels. CO is a biologically active molecule. A direct reaction between CO and certain amino acid residues may significantly affect the function of KCa channels. To test this hypothesis, we used chemical reagents to modify selectively certain amino acid residues of KCa channels. Subsequently, we tested the effect of CO on chemically modified KCa channels. Our results showed that histidine residues participated in channel gating of KCa channels. CO may specifically react with one histidine residue localized in the extracellular domain of KCa channels in vascular smooth muscle cells.RESULTSIn rat tail artery smooth muscle cells, a big conductance KCa channel was identified. With symmetric KCl (145 mM) on both sides of the patch membrane, single channel conductance was linearly related to membrane potentials over the range of −100 to +60 mV with no evidence of rectification. CO increased the channel activity in a concentration-dependent manner (3-30 μM) in both outside-out and inside-out patches. Although single channel conductance of KCa channels was not modified by CO (not shown), the NPo was increased significantly, and multiple channel openings were often elicited in the presence of CO.Effects of DEPC on the NPo of KCa ChannelsIn inside-out patches (n = 3), bath application of DEPC (0.5 mM) neither affected the single channel conductance and NPo of KCa channels nor modified the stimulatory effect of 30 μM CO on the NPo in the same patches (Fig. 1). In contrast, bath application of DEPC to outside-out patches (n = 3) reduced the NPo of single KCa channels without affecting the current amplitude. This inhibitory effect of DEPC, if specific for histidine residues, should be a function of pH, since DEPC reacts only with the unprotonated imidazole ring. Hence, the effects of DEPC at different pH levels on the NPo of KCa channels were further investigated (Fig. 2A). At pH 6.3, a 46% inhibition of the NPo of KCa channels by DEPC was observed. At pH 5.2, the NPo of KCa channels was only slightly decreased by DEPC treatment (6%).Fig. 2The pH-, time-, and concentration-dependent effects of DEPC on the NPo of single KCa channels recorded from outside-out membrane patches at −30 mV. Panel A, pH dependence of the 1 mM DEPC-induced inhibition of NPo. The membrane patches were treated with DEPC at different pH levels for 5 min. [Ca2+]i was 1 μM. Solid lines to the right of the current traces denote the closed state of the channels. Panel B, DEPC-induced decrease of the NPo of KCa channels as a function of time. Each data point represents the mean NPo during 1-min recording periods. Pseudo-first order rate constants (Ki) of the inhibition of NPo for a given concentration of DEPC were determined according to the equation: ln (NPo/NPo′) = −Ki× t, where NPo′ is the NPo before DEPC treatment, and NPo/NPo′ is the relative decrease in the NPo after t min of DEPC treatment. Panel C, kinetics of the inhibitory effect of DEPC on KCa channels. The kinetic analysis was applied in a form of Ki = Ki′ [DEPC]n, where Ki′ is the second order constant, and n is the kinetic order of reaction or minimal number of DEPC molecules needed to inactivate a single histidyl residue of the channel protein (28Eyzaguirre J. Eyzaguirre J. Chemical Modification of Enzyme: Active Site Studies.Ellis Horwiid. 1987; : 9-22Google Scholar). This equation was transformed further into: log(Ki) = n log([DEPC]) + log(Ki′), which allows determination of the n parameter as the slope of the double logarithmic plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetics of DEPC EffectA kinetic analysis of the effect of DEPC on KCa channels is shown in Fig. 2, B and C. The decrease in the NPo of KCa channels was eminent 1 min after the DEPC application, and a 50% decrease of NPo was observed 4 min after the DEPC treatment. The decrease in the NPo of KCa channels by DEPC was also concentration-dependent from 0.1 to 2 mM and followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The reaction order obtained from the slope of the double logarithmic plot (Fig. 2C) was 1.0, indicating that one histidyl residue/channel protein might be involved in the modifying effect of DEPC (13Levy H.M. Leber P.D. Ryan E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3654-3659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zakrzewska B. Kaminski Z.B. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).Interaction between CO and DEPCThe DEPC treatment abolished the CO-induced increase in the NPo of single KCa channels in four outside-out membrane patches (see one example in Fig. 3). In two other outside-out patches, CO was applied first. After washing out CO, the patches were exposed to DEPC followed by a reexposure to CO. The first application of CO increased the NPo of KCa channels, but the second application failed to do so (Fig. 4A). To examine further the specific interaction of DEPC and CO on histidine residues, the DEPC solution was maintained for 12 h at room temperature to inactivate DEPC spontaneously since the half-life of DEPC in an aqueous solution is less than 10 min at room temperature and pH 7 (15Lundblad R.L. Noyes C.M. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification.CRC Press. 1984; : 105-126Google Scholar). This inactivated DEPC had no effect on KCa channels, and subsequently applied CO was still capable of increasing the NPo of KCa channels in the same patch (Fig. 4B). It was extremely difficult to reverse the effect of DEPC on KCa channels, at least over the time frame of our experiments (16Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 52: 431-442Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). We have tried to apply hydroxylamine to remove DEPC from imidazoles. Since the membrane patches usually could not tolerate the high concentration of hydroxylamine (20 mM) for more than 30 min, we were unable to observe the recovery of KCa channel activity except in one outside-out patch, which lasted for more than 60 min. In that patch, the CO-induced modification of single KCa channel currents was recovered (Fig. 4C). An interaction between CO and DEPC on histidine residue was also demonstrated by the CO-induced protection of KCa channels from inhibition by DEPC. Fig. 5 shows that the presence of CO significantly inhibited the effect of DEPC on the NPo of KCa channels.Fig. 3Effect of DEPC (0.5 mM) on single KCa channels in an outside-out membrane patch at 20 mV. The DEPC treatment decreased the mean NPo of single KCa channels from 0.034 to 0.018. The effect of 30 μM CO on single KCa channels in the same patch was abolished after DEPC treatment.

Fig. 6 shows that in membrane patches isolated from photooxidized cells, the stimulatory effect of 30 μM CO on the NPo of KCa channels was abolished. However, CO still significantly increased the NPo of KCa channels in outside-out patches isolated from cells that were either preincubated with rose bengal in the absence of light (Fig. 6) or exposed to illumination in the absence of the dye for 15 min (not shown). These results rule out possible nonspecific damage of KCa channels induced by nonilluminated dye or by photoinactivation of the KCa channels.Fig. 6Photooxidation of single KCa channels by rose bengal (RG) abolished the effect of CO in outside-out patches at −30 mV (n = 3).

The big conductance KCa channels have been identified in many types of vascular smooth muscle cells (17Benham C.D. Bolton T.B. Lang R.J. Takewaki T. J. Physiol. 1986; 371: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Langton P.D. Nelson M.T. Huang Y. Standen N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H927-H934PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nelson M.T.

Hypertension. 1992; 19: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The functioning of these KCa channels controls membrane potential and affects vascular activity. The activation of KCa channels by CO may significantly affect vascular tone under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the direct effect of CO on KCa channels.The big conductance KCa channels are composed of two noncovalently linked subunits: the pore-forming α subunit and the β subunit, which influences the electrophysiological behavior of KCa channel complexes (21Munujos P. Knaus H. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10771-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences and topography of KCa channels in nonvascular smooth muscle cells have been known for years (22Knaus H.-G. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23336-23341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, knowledge of the molecular structure of KCa channels, especially the α subunit, in vascular smooth muscle cells is lacking. In the present study, we modified selectively certain amino acid residues of KCa channel protein to probe the structure-function relationship of KCa channels in rat tail artery smooth muscle cells. Since CO changed the NPo, but not the conductance, of KCa channels, we speculate that the gating mechanism is modified by CO with the permeation of ions through the channel unchanged. An extrapolation of this speculation is that amino acid residues outside the pore-forming region of KCa channel protein would be essential in mediating the effect of CO.Using the chemical reagents and protocols described in this paper, we show that the direct effect of CO on KCa channels is most likely the result of the interaction of CO and a histidine residue that is located on the external surface of KCa channels in rat tail artery smooth muscle cells. Several lines of evidence support our conclusion. First, DEPC decreased the NPo of KCa channels and abolished the effect of CO on KCa channels. The DEPC-induced modification of histidine residues involves substitution at one of the nitrogen positions on the imidazole ring. Hydroxylamine reverses DEPC effects by removing DEPC from imidazoles (16Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 52: 431-442Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). De Biasi et al. (23De Biasi M. Drewe J.A. Kirsc G.E. Brown A.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1235-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) found that the histidyl-specific DEPC produced exaggerated blockade of the mutated potassium channel compared with the wild type. Using the cell-attached single channel recording technique, Bouzat et al. (24Bouzat C.B. Lacorazza H.D. Bonino M.B.D.J. Barrantes F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that DEPC reduced the open time of an acetylcholine-activated channel in the cloned muscle cell line BC3H-1. Christensen and Hida (25Christensen B.N. Hida E. Neuron. 1990; 5: 471-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that DEPC reduced a kainate-induced current but that sulfhydryl-specific reagents were ineffective, indicating that histidine residues localized on the external membrane surface may be important in regulating channel gating. In our studies, the carbethoxylation reaction was carried out in outside-out and inside-out patches. The modification of KCa channels was observed only when the external surface of the membrane patch was exposed to DEPC. The histidine residue in question may, therefore, be situated on the external surface of the membrane, possibly near or stretched to the “pore” of channels, thus providing a functional site for the regulation of channel gating. Second, after DEPC was removed from the modified histidine residue by hydroxylamine, the stimulatory effect of CO on KCa channels was recovered. Third, the kinetics of the DEPC-induced inhibition of the NPo of KCa channels suggests the carbethoxylation of only one histidyl residue in the external surface of the cell membrane. Fourth, pH dependence for the inhibition of the NPo by DEPC is consistent with titration of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue, which has a pKa value between 6.4 and 7.5 in most proteins (26Cheng K.-C. Nowak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19666-19676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pisoni R.L. Velilla V.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). At a lower pH, protonation of the histidine makes the imidazole ring less reactive (25Christensen B.N. Hida E. Neuron. 1990; 5: 471-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, DEPC is less effective in reducing the NPo of KCa channels at pH 5.2 than at pH 6.3 or 7.4. Fifth, our photooxidation experiments provided additional proof for the specific involvement of histidine residue in the effect of CO. It is not feasible to isolate selectively the external surface of cell membrane for classical protein chemistry assay to detect the DEPC-induced changes in histidine residues. Therefore, photooxidation with rose bengal was chosen as an alternative means to modify histidine residues (28Eyzaguirre J. Eyzaguirre J. Chemical Modification of Enzyme: Active Site Studies.Ellis Horwiid. 1987; : 9-22Google Scholar, 29Medina M.A. del Castillo-Olivares A. Marquez J. de Castro I.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Bosshard H.R. Banziger J. Hasler T. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5683-5690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the cells were exposed to illuminated rose bengal, only those histidine residues located on the external surface of the cell membrane were presumably modified since rose bengal, like DEPC but with an even greater molecular mass, will not penetrate cell membranes to act on intracellular histidines (30Bosshard H.R. Banziger J. Hasler T. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5683-5690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the effect of DEPC, photooxidation abolished the stimulatory effect of CO on the NPo of KCa channels. Individually, photooxidation or DEPC treatment may not be fully specific for histidine residues. However, histidine (externally located) seems to be the only amino acid that clearly reacts with low concentrations of both DEPC and rose bengal (28Eyzaguirre J. Eyzaguirre J. Chemical Modification of Enzyme: Active Site Studies.Ellis Horwiid. 1987; : 9-22Google Scholar). Finally, we showed that the presence of CO partially protected KCa channels from inhibition by DEPC, suggesting that CO and DEPC may act on the same histidyl residue.Since CO is membrane-permeable, a direct effect of CO on KCa channels could be interpreted as the result of the modification of either membrane proteins or membrane lipids. However, membrane proteins seem much more likely to be modified than membrane lipids because the effect of CO on KCa channels was not altered unless a specific amino acid residue, histidine, was modified. It is also worth noting that there were obvious differences between the effects of CO and DEPC on KCa channels. DEPC decreased the NPo of KCa channels in a relatively irreversible manner because this reagent is involved in the covalent modification of histidine. On the other hand, CO increased the NPo in a reversible fashion probably because of a relatively weak reaction between CO and imidazole group of histidine via hydrogen bonds. A similar mechanism is believed to be important for the formation of heme-CO complex in which the distal histidine residue (His-64) in myoglobin (31Yang F. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 8: 762-774Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar) or histidine 25 in heme oxygenase (32Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is involved.Despite many efforts over decades of investigation, the ionic mechanisms involved in CO-mediated vasoactivity remain elusive. From this study, the direct interaction of CO with KCa channel proteins has been established. Given that the chemical reagents tested in this study did not diffuse readily through the cell membrane and were applied directly to the bath solutions in outside-out or inside-out patch recordings, our results provide an indication regarding the topological location of the CO-sensitive histidine residues. The modification of ion channel proteins using specific chemical reagents can be a valuable tool for identifying amino acid groups important for the functioning of the channels. However, the chemical identity and topography of the specific amino acid residues of KCa channels modified by chemical reagents, including CO, cannot be determined with certainty from our experiments and must await isolation, sequencing, and determination of the three-dimensional structure of the KCa channel protein in vascular smooth muscle cells. INTRODUCTIONThe presence of both inducible and constitutive forms of heme oxygenase, which cleave the heme ring to form carbon monoxide (CO), 1The abbreviations used are: COcarbon monoxideKCachannel, calcium-activated potassium channelNPoopen probabilityDEPCdiethyl pyrocarbonate. has been demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells (1Morita T.

Direct measurement of the endogenous production of CO from vascular smooth muscle cells has also recently been realized (2Cook M.N. Nakatsu K. Marks G.S. McLaughlin B.E. Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Brien J.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our previous study (3Wang R. Can. J. Cardiol. 1995; 11: 69PubMed Google Scholar), as well as those of others (4Furchgott R. Jothianandan D. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 52-61PubMed Google Scholar, 5Graser T. Vedernikov Y.P. Li D.S. Biomed.

Acta. 1989; 48: 595-597Google Scholar), demonstrated the regulatory function of CO in various types of vascular tissues. For example, CO relaxed precontracted rat tail artery strips in a concentration-dependent manner (3Wang R. Can. J. Cardiol. 1995; 11: 69PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of CO was mediated partially by a cGMP signaling pathway and partially by calcium-activated K (KCa) channels. Using the single channel recording patch-clamp technique, we found that CO increased the open probability (NPo) of KCa channels. 2R. Wang, L. Wu, and Z. Z. Wang, unpublished observation. This effect of CO may be caused by a direct interaction between CO and KCa channels as the activities of the cGMP pathway and G proteins are not involved in the activation of KCa channels by CO. To date, the mechanism by which CO directly affects KCa channels remains unclear.The electrical properties of KCa channels are determined by different amino acid residues that are constitutive components of the channel protein. The primary structure of KCa channels in several cell types, excluding vascular smooth muscle cells, is known, but the functional roles of various amino acids in the gating and conducting of KCa channels are still in question. Limited studies show that the modification of one or more amino acid residues may significantly change the conductance and/or NPo of KCa channels (7Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J.

Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) and hydrogen peroxide (10Lee K. Ozanne S.E. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 139: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) can specifically react with certain amino acid residues, thus affecting the functions of ion channels. CO is a biologically active molecule. A direct reaction between CO and certain amino acid residues may significantly affect the function of KCa channels. To test this hypothesis, we used chemical reagents to modify selectively certain amino acid residues of KCa channels. Subsequently, we tested the effect of CO on chemically modified KCa channels. Our results showed that histidine residues participated in channel gating of KCa channels. CO may specifically react with one histidine residue localized in the extracellular domain of KCa channels in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Members of the MAPK family include the extracellular response kinases (ERKs or p42/44MAPK), the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38/Hog 1 protein kinases. MAPKs are phosphorylated and activated by MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs), which in turn are phosphorylated and activated by MKK/MEK kinases (Raf and MKKK/MEKKs). We have isolated two cDNAs encoding splice variants of a novel MEK kinase, MEKK4. The MEKK4 mRNA is widely expressed in mouse tissues and encodes for a protein of approximately 180 kDa. The MEKK4 carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain is approximately 55% homologous to the catalytic domains of MEKKs 1, 2, and 3. The amino-terminal region of MEKK4 has little sequence homology to the previously cloned MEKK proteins. MEKK4 specifically activates the JNK pathway but not ERKs or p38, distinguishing it from MEKKs 1, 2 and 3, which are capable of activating the ERK pathway. MEKK4 is localized in a perinuclear, vesicular compartment similar to the Golgi. MEKK4 binds to Cdc42 and Rac; kinase-inactive mutants of MEKK4 block Cdc42/Rac stimulation of the JNK pathway. MEKK4 has a putative pleckstrin homology domain and a proline-rich motif, suggesting specific regulatory functions different from those of the previously characterized MEKKs.

The properties of MEKK4 differ from those of MEKKs 1, 2, and 3 in that it is highly selective for the activation of the MKK4/JNK pathway.

Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used in a PCR of 30 cycles (1 min, 94 °C; 2 min, 37 °C; 3 min, 72 °C), followed by a 10-min cycle at 72 °C. A band of approximately 300 bp was recovered from the PCR mixture, and the products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The PCR cDNA products were sequenced and compared with the MEKKs 1, 2, and 3 sequences. A unique cDNA sequence of 262 bp, having significant homology to the catalytic domains of MEKKs 1, 2, and 3, was identified and used to screen cDNA libraries from mouse brain, liver, and NIH 3T3 cells (Stratagene). The λ phage libraries were plated, and DNA from plaques were transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Corp.) followed by UV cross-linking of DNA to the filters. Filters were prehybridized for 2 h and then hybridized overnight in 0.5 M Na2H2PO4, pH 7.2, 10% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS at 68 °C. Filters were washed 2 times at 42 °C with 2 × SSC, once with 1 × SSC, and once with 0.5 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Positive hybridizing clones were purified and sequenced. To resolve GC-rich regions, cDNAs were subcloned into M13 vectors (New England Biolabs), and single strand DNA was sequenced. In all cases, both strands of DNA were sequenced. To isolate the 5′ end of the gene, we utilized the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure using the mouse brain Marathon-Ready cDNA kit (Clontech). The first PCR was performed using the Vent exo(-) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the sense anchor primer supplied with the kit in combination with the MEKK4-specific antisense primer 5′-AGTCCAACATGAATGAGCACTGTGCAT-3′. The PCR reaction involved 25 cycles (1.5 min, 99 °C; 1 min, 68 °C; 2 min, 74 °C) in a final volume of 50 μl. A second PCR was performed using 5 μl of the reaction mixture from the first PCR as template with the nested anchor primer supplied with the kit in combination with the nested MEKK4-specific antisense primer 5′-GCTCCGTTGTTCTCAGAGTTGCTCGAA-3′. The second PCR generated a 650-bp fragment that was subcloned into pGEM-T and 21 clones sequenced. The identity of the RACE product was confirmed by PCR using the sense primer 5′-AAAATCTAGACCTGCGGCGGGCTAGAGGCGGAGG-3′ that encodes the extreme 5′ end of the RACE product and the antisense primer 5′-GCTCCCGTAGTTAACTTTGAAGGTGA-3′ that is based on the cDNA encoded in the original clone that was isolated from the brain cDNA library. Vent exo(-) DNA polymerase was used in a PCR consisting of 30 cycles (1.5 min, 99 °C; 1.5 min, 66 °C; 3 min, 74 °C) in a final volume of 50 μl with first strand cDNA generated from mRNA isolated from NIH 3T3 cells as template. A second PCR was performed using 2 μl of the first reaction as a template and the nested MEKK4-specific antisense primer 5′-CTGGAATCGATTTTTTTGGCAAAGACC-3′ that is also encoded in the original brain cDNA clone. PCR conditions and the sense primer were the same as in the first PCR reaction. The resulting 645-bp PCR product was purified, cloned into pGEM-T, and five cDNAs from each of two separate PCRs were sequenced, and all confirmed the 5′ sequence of MEKK4 that was obtained through the RACE procedure. Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) from eight different mouse tissues were separated by denaturing formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a charge-modified nylon membrane by Northern blotting, and fixed by UV irradiation (mouse multiple Northern blot, Clontech). The membrane was hybridized with either a 300-bp cDNA fragment derived from the catalytic domain of MEKK4 (recognizes both splice forms of MEKK4) or a β-actin control probe. The probes were randomly primed and labeled with [γ32P]dCTP (Prime it II, Stratagene), and hybridization was performed as described for screening of cDNA libraries. All cDNAs encoding MEKK4 used in transient transfection assays were subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV5. Where indicated, ΔMEKK4 and ΔMEKK4 kin− were epitope-tagged using a PCR at their carboxyl terminus with the hemagglutinin (HA)-tag sequence YPYDVPDYA. The insertion of a carboxyl-terminal epitope tag was performed using the sense oligonucleotide 5′-TCTAAGCAGGGGCCCATAGAAGCTATC-3′, which encodes an ApaI restriction site encoded in MEKK4, and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CTCTCTAGAGGTACCTCATTAAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATACTCTTCATCTGTGCAAACCTTGAC-3′, which encoded an XbaI restriction site, two sets of termination codons, the HA-tag sequence, and the MEKK4 sequence. These primers were used in a PCR using Vent exo(-) DNA polymerase with MEKK4α or MEKK4α kin− (see below) as templates. The PCR reaction involved 30 cycles (1 min, 99 °C; 2 min, 68 °C; 3 min, 74 °C). The PCR products were purified and digested with ApaI, blunt ended, and then digested with XbaI and cloned into pCMV5. This gives a catalytic domain of MEKK4 with an initiation methionine at position 1301. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Kinase inactive variants of MEKK4 were generated by changing lysine at position 1361 to a methionine using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega) with the mutagenisis oligonucleotide 5′-ACAGGGGAGCTGATGGCCATGATGGAGATTCGATTTCAGCCTAAC-3′. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The MEKK4 catalytic domain used in polyhistidine tagged or GST-fusion proteins was generated by PCR using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTGGATCCGAATTCAGGAGAAAGAATATCATCGGCCAA-3′, which encodes EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, followed by MEKK4 sequence starting at amino acid 1302 in combination with the T7 primer encoded in pBluescript II SK−. MEKK4α in pBluescript II SK− was used as template for a PCR of 30 cycles (1 min, 92 °C; 2 min, 58 °C; 3 min, 72 °C) using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The PCR product was digested with restriction endonucleases directed toward sites encoded in the sense primer and in the multiple cloning site of pBluescript SK II and cloned into pRSET (BamHI and XhoI; New England Biolabs) or pGEX (EcoRI and XhoI; Pharmacia Biotech In.). Growth, induction, and purification was performed according to the manufacturer instructions. Wild type and kinase inactive (K1361M), non-epitope tagged, catalytic domains of MEKK4 were constructed using the same procedure as for the fusion protein constructs except that cDNAs were cloned into pCMV5. The plasmids encoding HA-tagged JNK1 (pSRα) and JNK2 (pCMV5) have been described previously (10Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. COS cells were maintained under the same conditions except that 5% bovine calf and 5% newborn calf serum was used. Cells were grown and transfected in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected using the calcium phosphate (HEK293) or DEAE-dextran (COS) methods (42Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequences of MEKK4 (CLESDPKIRWTASQLLD) and p38 (CFVPPPLDQEEMES) were conjugated to KLH and used to immunize rabbits. Antisera were characterized for specificity by immunoblotting of lysates prepared from appropriately transfected HEK293 cells. JNK activity was measured by immunoprecipitation of endogenous JNK1 and JNK2 using specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), transiently overexpressed HA-tagged JNK1 and JNK2 using a monoclonal antibody directed against the hemagglutinin epitope (the 12CA5 antibody from Berkeley Antibody Co.), or by a solid phase assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (1-79) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose-4B. Transfected cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.25 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation of JNKs. For immunoprecipitations, 400 μg of protein was mixed with the appropriate antibody (1:100 dilution for endogenous JNK1 and JNK2 antibodies and 1:250 dilution for the 12CA5 antibody) in a final volume of 400 μl of lysis buffer and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were captured by adding 15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for an additional hr and washed 2 times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM sodium vanadate). Beads were suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP and 2 μg of GST-c-Jun as substrate. For solid phase JNK assays, 400 μg of protein was mixed with 10 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GST-c-Jun-(1-79)-Sepharose (3-5 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1-79)). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and washed as described above, and kinase reactions were performed by adding 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min, and reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled, and phosphorylated proteins were resolved on SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. In vitro activation of JNK was determined essentially as described (33Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells were transfected with the expression vector pCMV5 or pCMV5 containing HA-tagged wild type or kinase inactive ΔMEKK4. Cells were lysed, and ΔMEKK4 was immunoprecipitated using the 12CA5 antibody as described for the JNK assay above. In addition, recombinant, bacterially expressed, and purified polyhistidine-tagged ΔMEKK4 was used in an in vitro reconstituted coupled kinase assay, where immunoprecipitates or recombinant ΔMEKK4 were mixed with recombinant, bacterially expressed and purified, wild type or kinase inactive (K116M) MKK4 in combination with wild type or kinase inactive (K55M) JNK in the presence of 50 μM ATP (40 μl final volume) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. GST-c-Jun-(1-79)-Sepharose beads (3-5 μg) were then added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 20 min. Beads were washed, resuspended in 40 μl JNK kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Direct phosphorylation of MKK4 was demonstrated by incubating recombinant purified GST-ΔMEKK4 and kinase inactive (K116M) MKK4 together with 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mM Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mM MnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were added to Laemmli sample buffer and boiled, proteins were resolved on SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty vector (pCMV5), the indicated MEKK4 constructs, or treated with EGF (cells starved in 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight and then activated with 30 ng/ml of EGF for 10 min) were lysed, and ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies (1:125 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above for immunoprecipitation of JNK. Kinase reactions were performed as described (43Gardner A.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using the EGF662-681 receptor peptide as a substrate. The amounts of 32P incorporated into EGF662-681 receptor peptide was quantitated by spotting samples on P81 phosphocellulose paper followed by scintillation counting. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty vector (pCMV5), the indicated MEKK4 constructs, or cells treated with sorbitol (0.4 M, 20 min) were lysed, and p38 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (400 μg) as described for the JNK assay using rabbit antiserum (1:250 dilution) raised against the COOH-terminal peptide sequence of p38 (described above). In vitro kinase assays were carried out as described for the JNK assay with the exception that recombinant ATF-2 was used as a substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2050751355,"Abstract The “long pentraxins” are an emerging family of genes that have conserved in their carboxy-terminal halves a pentraxin domain homologous to the prototypical acute phase protein pentraxins (C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component) and acquired novel amino-terminal domains. In this report, a genomic fragment of 1371 nucleotides from the human “long pentraxin” gene PTX3 is characterized as a promoter on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-1β exposure in transfected 8387 human fibroblasts by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and RNase protection assays. In the same cells, the PTX3 promoter does not respond to IL-6 stimulation. Furthermore, IL-1β and TNFα responsiveness is not seen in the Hep 3B hepatoma cell line. The minimal promoter contains one NF-κB element which is shown to be necessary for induction and able to bind p50 homodimers and p65 heterodimers but not c-Rel. Mutants in this site lose the ability to bind NF-κB proteins and to respond to TNFα and IL-1β in functional assays. Sp1- and AP-1 binding sites lying in proximity to the NF-κB site do not seem to play a major role for cytokine responsiveness. Finally, cotransfection experiments with expression vectors validate that the natural promoter contains a functional NF-κB site."

We show that these interactions require a tryptophan 6 amino acids N-terminal to the homeodomain. Binding site selection for Hoxb-9 with Pbx1a yielded ATGATGAC, containing a novel TTAC Hox-binding site adjacent to a Pbx site. In the presence of Pbx1a, Hoxb-9 and Hoxa-10 bound to targets containing either TTAC or TTAT. These data extend previous findings that interactions with Pbx define a Hox protein binding code for different DNA sequences across paralog groups 1 through 10. Members of the 11, 12, and 13 paralogs do not cooperatively bind DNA with Pbx1a, despite the presence of tryptophan residues N-terminal to the homeodomain in Hoxd-12 and Hoxd-13. Hoxa-11, Hoxd-12, or Hoxd-13, in the presence of Pbx1a, selected a TTAC Hox site but lacking a Pbx1a site.

Furthermore, Tat can inhibit the activation and activity of the kinase. Phosphorylation of Tat by PKR is dependent on the prior activation of PKR by dsRNA and occurs on serine and threonine residues adjacent to the basic region important for TAR RNA binding and Tat function. Activated PKR efficiently phosphorylates both the two-exon form of Tat (Tat-86) and the single exon form (Tat-72). Mutagenesis indicates that the interaction between PKR and Tat requires the RNA-binding region of Tat.

Northern blots verified that the mRNAs are regulated by TH and are expressed during metamorphosis. Kinetic analyses showed that most of the genes are up-regulated by TH within 4-8 h and 13 are regulated by TH only in the brain.

Although attention has been focused on rodent models for TH action in neural development, the classical vertebrate model for hormone action in development is the amphibian tadpole (6Tata J.R. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis. Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells.Academic Press, Inc. 1996; : 466-503Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone controls amphibian metamorphosis and thus plays an important role in the developmental changes in the nervous system that occur during metamorphosis. These changes involve extensive remodeling of regions of the central nervous system that underlie development of sensory and motor systems that are necessary for the shift from one life history stage (i.e. the aquatic, fish-like, herbivorous larvae) to another (i.e. the terrestrial (in many species), tetrapodal, carnivorous adult frog). Metamorphosis of the amphibian tadpole is one of the few vertebrate systems in which the effects of a hormone on neural cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis can be directly correlated with functional changes that lead to the development of adult behaviors. Recent work on tadpole metamorphosis using molecular biological approaches has provided basic mechanistic information on diverse developmental processes, such as tissue remodeling, growth and differentiation, and apoptosis (6Tata J.R.

Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells.Academic Press. 1996; : 505-538Google Scholar). The metamorphic process is controlled by thyroxine (T4), which is converted to a more active form (T3; 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine) by monodeiodinases in target tissues (T3 will be used to refer to thyroid hormone throughout this paper). The thyroid status of tadpoles can be easily altered by the addition of hormone or T3 synthesis inhibitors to water in which the animals are raised. Thyroid hormone is thought to control metamorphosis by regulating gene expression. T3 receptors are members of the steroid receptor superfamily and function as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Xenopus has two T3 receptor α (TRα) and two TRβ genes (owing to its pseudotetraploidy), each of which is expressed during metamorphosis. The T3·TR complex interacts with specific T3 response elements (TREs) present in the target gene and thus can either enhance or repress gene transcription (8Shi Y.-B. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R.

Because T3 regulates gene expression and can induce very different developmental changes in diverse tissues (e.g. degeneration of tail (i.e. apoptosis), remodeling of brain and gut, and growth and differentiation of limbs), it is predicted that the hormone induces tissue-specific genetic programs. Recent studies using a subtractive hybridization approach have isolated T3-responsive genes in various tadpole tissues (e.g. tail (12Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These analyses have shown that some of the early T3-response genes are common to all tadpole tissues, whereas others are tissue-specific (13Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A.

To provide a molecular basis for understanding T3 action on the development of the vertebrate brain, we have cloned, by subtractive hybridization, a large number of T3-responsive genes in the premetamorphic Xenopus tadpole diencephalon. We have focused on the diencephalon (preoptic/thalamic/hypothalamic area) because this region undergoes dramatic changes in response to T3 (i.e. accumulation of neurosecretory material, development of neurosecretory nerve terminals and capillaries of the median eminence; Ref. 18Denver R.J. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis. Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells.Academic Press. 1996; : 433-464Google Scholar) and because the neurosecretory neurons of the preoptic region/hypothalamus play a central role in controlling thyroid secretory activity during metamorphosis. Releasing factors produced in these neurosecretory nuclei control secretion of pituitary thyrotropin, which stimulates thyroidal secretion resulting in the increasing plasma titers of T4 and T3 throughout the prometamorphic period. The presence of an intact preoptic region/hypothalamus is essential for the progression of metamorphosis because ablation or lesioning of this brain region results in metamorphic stasis (19Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia.Academic Press. 1976; Vol. 3: 467-599Google Scholar, 20Kikuyama S. Kawamura K. Tanaka S. Yamamoto K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 145: 105-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Among the TH-regulated genes that we have isolated, several encode transcription factors that we predict are responsible for regulating a secondary wave of gene expression, the protein products of which should define the adult phenotype. Also among these genes are several cellular enzymes, one cytoskeletal protein, and two hypophysiotropic neuropeptides. The gene identities allow predictions to be made about the integrated gene regulation program underlying T3 action on development of the vertebrate brain. Tadpoles were reared in dechlorinated tap water (water temperature, 20–22 °C) and fed pulverized rabbit chow. Stage 52–54 (Nieuwkoop and Faber (21Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis Daudin.North Holland Publishers. 1956; Google Scholar)) tadpoles were treated with 3,5,3′-L-triiodothyronine (T3-sodium salt; Sigma) by adding it to the water to a final concentration of 5 nM. This dose was expected to produce a total plasma T3 concentration comparable to the 8 nM concentration observed in X. laevis tadpoles at metamorphic climax (22Leloup J. Buscaglia M. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1977; 284: 2261-2263Google Scholar), assuming complete equilibration of tadpole body fluids with the aquarium water (15Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin (Sigma), which together produce nearly complete inhibition of protein synthesis in X. laevis tadpoles (23Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were added to the aquarium water to a final concentration of 20 and 25 μg/ml, respectively. Treatment was initiated 1 h before addition of T3 and continued for a total of 13 h. The goitrogen methimazole (1 mM; Sigma) was added to the aquarium water to inhibit T3 synthesis at different stages of tadpole development. For construction of subtractive cDNA libraries, 500 stage 52–54 tadpoles were treated with T3 for 20 h before tissue collection; 500 untreated tadpoles served as controls. Tadpoles were anesthetized in 0.01% benzocaine and a portion of the brain encompassing the diencephalon was dissected. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidium thiocyanate method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63046) Google Scholar). The isolation of cDNAs that corresponded to T3-regulated mRNAs in premetamorphic X. laevis tadpole diencephalon was achieved by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based gene expression screen (subtractive hybridization) essentially as described by Wang and Brown (25Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) with modifications of Shi and Brown (15Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA isolated from neural tissue of control (−) or T3-treated (+) tadpoles. The two starting cDNA libraries were constructed using 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (− or +; Copy Kit II, InVitrogen). Five rounds of subtraction were done before the enriched (−) cDNAs (down-regulated genes) and (+) cDNAs (up-regulated genes) were cloned into the pBluescript KS− plasmid (Stratagene) at the EcoRI site in the polylinker region. During the subtraction, the extinction of abundant, unregulated cDNAs and the enrichment of T3-regulated cDNAs were followed by Southern blot analysis using random-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes for one unregulated gene (the ribosomal L8 gene; Ref. 26Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and one T3-regulated (up-regulated) gene (TRβ; Ref. 27Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). After colony hybridization (with 32P-labeled − or + subtracted cDNAs) to identify clones containing enriched cDNA inserts (25Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), 100 colonies were isolated (50 − or +), plasmids were purified, and cDNA inserts were prepared. Dot blots were prepared with purified cDNA inserts (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar) to screen for cross-hybridizing species. This analysis identified 46 non-cross-hybridizing cDNAs. Initial screening to verify that the isolated cDNAs corresponded to T3-regulated genes was done by probing Southern blots made with the starting PCR-amplified cDNA libraries; this assumes that the abundance of any fragment between the starting amplified + and − cDNAs accurately represents its relative abundance in the original mRNA preparations (25Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). T3 regulation was later confirmed for each gene by Northern blot hybridization. These analyses reduced the number of unique, non-cross-hybridizing T3-regulated genes to 34. To determine the tissue distribution of mRNAs for isolated genes, Southern blots were prepared from + or − T3 PCR-amplified starting cDNA libraries (tail (12Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hind limb (14Buckbinder L. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25786-25791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and intestine (15Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 5 μg). Southern blots were also prepared from digested, homozygous diploid X. laevis genomic DNA (29Krotoski D.M. Reinschmidt D.C. Tompkins R. J. Exp. Zool. 1985; 233: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to determine gene copy number (see Ref. 15Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNAs were electrophoretically separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Genescreen, Dupont) by capillary transfer using 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl as transfer buffer (which also served to denature the DNA during transfer; Ref. 28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was digested (5 μg/reaction) with BamHI, EcoRI, or HindIII before electrophoresis. RNA blots were prepared with total RNA extracted from tadpole diencephalic tissue to analyze the developmental and hormone-regulated expression of each of the genes isolated in the subtraction. For analysis of developmental expression, brain tissue was dissected from tadpoles at different stages of postembryonic development. For the analyses of hormone regulation, stage 52 tadpoles were treated with 5 nM T3 for various times before isolating brain tissue for analysis. Each experiment was repeated three times; the expression patterns of each of the genes were analyzed at least twice. For RNA blots, total RNA (10-15 μg) was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, hydrolyzed in 0.05 M NaOH, 0.01 M NaCl, and transferred to nylon membrane using 20 × SSC as the transfer buffer. Northern and Southern blots were prehybridized in Hybrisol I (Oncor) for 2–4 h and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C with subtracted cDNA fragments labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (Amersham Corp.). Blots were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and then with 0.25 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h before exposure to x-ray film for 1–14 days. Small cDNA fragments were sequenced either manually using Sequenase, Version 2.0 (Amersham Corp.) or by cycle sequencing (ABI Prism, Perkin-Elmer) using an automated ABI sequencer. Sequence data were analyzed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information programs FASTA and BLAST. Differential screening of the subtracted cDNA libraries identified 34 non-cross-hybridizing cDNA fragments that correspond to T3-regulated mRNAs in the premetamorphic X. laevis tadpole diencephalon (see Table I). Twenty of the cDNA fragments were from the up-regulated and fourteen from the down-regulated (see below) libraries. It is expected that several of these small cDNA fragments could be derived from the same mRNA if they hybridize to same-sized bands on a Northern blot. Comparisons of mRNA sizes and expression patterns strongly support three instances in which more than one cDNA fragment could be derived from the same mRNA (up-regulated: xh2 and xh20, xh11 and xh13; down-regulated: xh26 and xh32). Thus, 31 of the cDNAs could correspond to individual mRNAs for unique genes. Examination of full-length cDNA clones will be required to verify this estimate.TABLE I.Thyroid hormone-regulated genes, organized by developmental classGeneRNA sizeGene copyaAs determined by Southern blot of homozygous diploid genomic DNA (see text).

Wang and Brown (25Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) showed that the relative abundance of the individual cDNAs in these libraries reflects the original mRNA abundance in the tissues from which they are derived. Thirteen of the isolated cDNAs correspond to mRNAs that are regulated by T3 only in brain (this number may be 12 if xh11 and xh13 correspond to the same gene): 8 of the up-regulated and 5 of the so-called down-regulated genes (see below). One gene is expressed exclusively in the brain (xh33: neural-specific β tubulin; see below). Four of the genes are regulated by T3 only in the brain and the intestine (three if xh2 and xh20 correspond to the same gene), which could possibly reflect neuroendocrine tissue specificity. One of the genes exhibits opposite regulation in different tissues (xh30); however, this could be due to slightly different kinetics of the biphasic response in brain and intestine (see below). We determined which of the isolated cDNA fragments correspond to immediate, early response genes and which to delayed, late genes by doing time course analyses of mRNA accumulation. We analyzed brain mRNA levels for each gene at various times during 96 h of continuous exposure of tadpoles to 5 nM T3. We also determined whether gene regulation by T3 was resistant to inhibition of protein synthesis. If a gene exhibited early response kinetics (e.g. up- or down-regulation within the first 4–12 h) and its regulation was resistant to inhibition of protein synthesis, we suggest that it is a direct T3-response gene. However, to confirm direct versus indirect regulation, either nuclear run-on or transient transfection assays and/or demonstration of a TRE in the upstream sequence of the target gene will be necessary. As for the tail (12Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), intestine (15Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cultured Xenopus cells (23Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most of genes isolated from neural tissue in this study exhibit response kinetics that can be characterized as early; i.e. the up-regulated genes exhibit a 4–8-h lag time followed by accumulation of mRNA up to 72–96 h (e.g. Fig. 2; Table I). Furthermore, of the genes that could be successfully evaluated, most exhibited resistance to protein synthesis inhibition in their up- or down-regulation. Most of the genes identified in this screen have complex patterns of T3-regulated expression. They exhibit a biphasic response with immediate and late up-regulation but intermediate down-regulation (see Fig. 2; Table I). The level of mRNA for these biphasic response genes increases by 4 h, drops between 8 and 48 h, and rises again between 24 and 48 h. The length of this down-regulated period (i.e. whether the mRNA level increased by 24 or 48 h) most likely determined whether the gene was isolated as an up- or down-regulated gene (because the present screen was done after 20 h of hormone treatment). Thus, the mRNA level for the so-called down-regulated genes is only transiently reduced, with the sustained effect of the hormone being up-regulation. Although showing that the isolated genes are regulated by T3 on Northern blots suggests that they can be induced or repressed by the endogenous hormone during spontaneous metamorphosis, showing that gene expression is correlated with rising titers of plasma T3 (and, by extension, with metamorphic changes) is necessary to suggest that the gene is involved in morphogenesis. The embryonic period of Xenopus takes about 72 h, after which time the eggs hatch (stage 35–36), and the tadpole begins to feed shortly thereafter (stage 45). During the premetamorphic period (stages 46–52), the animal grows but little morphogenesis occurs, although the tadpole's tissues are competent to respond to T3 (i.e. if given exogenously) during this time (63Tata J.R. Dev. Biol. 1968; 18: 415-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The first histological evidence of thyroid gland development in X. laevis is at stage 49–50 (20Kikuyama S. Kawamura K.

https://openalex.org/W2093992870,"Microtubule-associated protein tau is a neuronal phosphoprotein that promotes microtubule assembly in vitro and has been shown to play a role in the development of axonal morphology. Tau can be phosphorylated in vitro by several kinases, some of which cause a change in the conformation and activities of tau. Here we report the consequences of converting two of the protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (positions 156 and 327), first to alanine to eliminate phosphorylation, and second to aspartate, to mimic phosphorylation. We show that a serine to aspartate mutation at position 327 results in a conformational change similar to that caused by phosphorylation of this residue. This mutation does not affect the activities of tau in microtubule assembly as compared with wild-type tau. However, an additional mutation at position 156 to aspartate drastically decreases the microtubule nucleation activity of tau but does not affect the activity of tau to promote microtubule growth. All constructs are similarly bound to microtubules and promote process formation when expressed in cytochalasin-treated PC12 cells. We conclude that serine to aspartate mutations provide a useful system for analyzing the effect of individual phosphorylation sites on the conformation and function of tau in vitro and in cells. The results provide evidence that microtubule growth and nucleation can be differentially affected by phosphorylation of individual residues in a region amino-terminally flanking the microtubule binding domain of tau.

We show that a serine to aspartate mutation at position 327 results in a conformational change similar to that caused by phosphorylation of this residue. This mutation does not affect the activities of tau in microtubule assembly as compared with wild-type tau. However, an additional mutation at position 156 to aspartate drastically decreases the microtubule nucleation activity of tau but does not affect the activity of tau to promote microtubule growth. All constructs are similarly bound to microtubules and promote process formation when expressed in cytochalasin-treated PC12 cells. We conclude that serine to aspartate mutations provide a useful system for analyzing the effect of individual phosphorylation sites on the conformation and function of tau in vitro and in cells. The results provide evidence that microtubule growth and nucleation can be differentially affected by phosphorylation of individual residues in a region amino-terminally flanking the microtubule binding domain of tau. The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau consists of a family of closely related phosphoproteins that are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification (for reviews, see Refs. 1Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Brandt R. Frontiers Biosci. 1996; 1: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tau isolated from brain is phosphorylated at several sites and is a substrate for many kinases in vitro (for review, see Ref. 3Lee G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although it was initially shown that dephosphorylation of tau isolated from brain increased its ability to promote microtubule assembly (4Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5301-5305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has since become apparent that the extent to which the activities of tau are modulated depends critically on the identity of the site phosphorylated (5Biernat J.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tau may also change its conformation, resulting in an increased “stiffness” and a decreased electrophoretic mobility (9Hagestedt T. Lichtenberg B. Wille H. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Steiner B. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Gustke N. Meyer H.E. Schmidt B. Mieskes G. Soling H.D. Drechsel D.

Phosphorylation of tau by PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase APHFpaired helical filamentwtwild-typePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. may be a useful model for studying phosphorylation-induced changes in tau structure and function because PKA phosphorylates sites in the microtubule-binding domain and the two flanking regions (11Scott C.W.

Phosphorylation at these sites induces shifts in electrophoretic mobility indicative of conformational changes and decreases microtubule binding and assembly (11Scott C.W. Spreen R.C. Herman J.L.

Phosphorylation of tau by PKA could also be of functional importance for neuronal development because PKA is present in high levels in the brain and within neurons (14Walaas S.I. Greengard P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 299-349PubMed Google Scholar). protein kinase A paired helical filament wild-type 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition to its potential role during development, phosphorylation of tau has also been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Abnormal tau phosphorylation is thought to contribute to its aggregation into paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are a major constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (15Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 480-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Tau protein isolated from Alzheimer's disease patients shows a decreased electrophoretic mobility on SDS gels (17Lee V.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 564-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is less active in promoting microtubule assembly than tau isolated from control brains (20Lu Q. Wood J.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the major phosphorylation sites characteristic of PHF-tau are clustered in two regions that flank the microtubule-binding domain of tau (21Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation events in these domains are involved in the changes in the structure and function during neurodegeneration. Previously, we have provided evidence that phosphorylation of two of the five residues that are phosphorylated by PKA in vitro are critical for the conformation of tau and its microtubule assembly activities (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two sites are located in two regions that amino-terminally (serine 156) and carboxyl-terminally (serine 327) flank the microtubule-binding domain of tau (numbering refers to the fetal specific human tau isoform containing 352 residues (22Goedert M. Wischik C.M. Crowther R.A. Walker J.E. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar)). However, because kinase reactions yield a mixture of differentially phosphorylated tau species, the function of individual phosphorylation sites is difficult to assess. In other systems, it has been shown that the effect of phosphorylation can be imitated by introducing negatively charged residues (23Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used this method to analyze the effect of individual phosphorylation sites on the structure and function of tau. A set of mutated tau isoforms was prepared where individual residues have been changed to either alanine or aspartate. Structural consequences of the mutations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Microtubule growth and nucleation assays were performed to assess the functional consequences of the mutations on the activity of tau. In addition, a cellular test system was used to assess the activity of the mutants to promote process formation in living neural cells. All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Prokaryotic expression plasmids were constructed in pET-3d as described previously using p19tau cDNA (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations at position 327 were constructed using M13 in vitro mutagenesis as described by Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The mutation at position 156 was introduced using polymerase chain reaction (vent polymerase, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), with one primer introducing a NcoI site on the amino-terminal end and the other converting the target site to either alanine or aspartate. The resulting DNA was cut with NcoI and SmaI. This piece was introduced in the NcoI and SmaI sites of pET-Tau(Ala 327) or pET-Tau(Asp 327). Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression in eukaryotic cells, inserts from wild-type tau and tau carrying alanine or aspartate double mutations were prepared from the pET constructs by polymerase chain reaction using primers introducing a ClaI site at the amino-terminal side and an ApaI site at the carboxyl side. These inserts were introduced into the ClaI and ApaI sites of the fpRC/CMV vector, a modification of pRC/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The modification resulted in the expression of proteins with the sequence MDKDDDDK (FLAG (27Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 28Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar)) fused to the amino-terminal end as an epitope tag. Constructs for prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression were verified by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from NEB, Inc. (Beverly, MA). pET-3d tau plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells for expression (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). Cells were grown, induced, and harvested as described previously (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). Tau was purified from the bacterial pellet as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but concentrated using polyethylene glycol instead of microconcentrators. Protein concentrations were determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumine as a standard. Densitometry employed a LKB Ultroscan XL Laser Densitometer. Tubulin was isolated from bovine brain by two assembly-disassembly cycles and phosphocellulose chromatography as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulin concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumine as a standard. Microtubule assembly assays were performed as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with tau constructs and incubation times as specified. After fixation, 0.1% (v/v) or 0.5% (v/v) aliquots were collected by centrifugation onto polylysine-treated coverslips and prepared for anti-tubulin immunofluorescence as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy employed a Zeiss Axioskop Neofluar × 100 lens. The number and lengths of microtubules were determined as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taxol-stabilized microtubules were prepared from purified tubulin that had been precleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g (Beckman 100.2 rotor). The precleared tubulin was brought to 50 μM and polymerized by stepwise addition of 1/100 volume of 10, 100, and 1 mM taxol with 5-min incubations at 37 °C after each addition. The incubation mixture contained in 50 μl of BRB80 (80 mM K-PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 6.8) 15 μl of taxol-stabilized microtubules (final concentration, 15 μM), 1 mM GTP, 10 μM taxol, and 5 μg of tau constructs or the control (myoglobin). The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, subsequently loaded onto 100 μl of room-temperature 30% (w/v) sucrose in BRB80 containing 1 mM GTP and 10 μM taxol, and spun for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 20 °C. For tau-containing samples, it was necessary to remove the tubulin, which would run at a similar molecular weight as tau. This was done by heat denaturation, in which the microtubule pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of boiling buffer (50 mM PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol), boiled for 10 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 35,000 × g (Beckman TLA45), thereby pelleting denatured tubulin. The supernatants were adjusted with SDS-sample buffer and separated side by side by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide. Pellets from samples containing myoglobin were directly dissolved in SDS-sample buffer after cosedimentation with the microtubules and separated by SDS-PAGE on 20% polyacrylamide. PC12 cells were grown, transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and treated with cytochalasin B as described previously (31Léger J. Brandt R. Lee G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The average transfection efficiency was 11%, with a range of 5-18%. Cells were fixed 2 days after transfection and stained with monoclonal antibody M5 against the epitope tag FLAG (Kodak, New Haven, CT) and rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) as described previously (31Léger J. Brandt R. Lee G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were mounted, photographed, and assessed for process extension as described previously (31Léger J. Brandt R. Lee G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots were performed as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Human fetal tau cDNAs were constructed in which serine residues at position 156 and 327 were mutated to an alanine or aspartate (Fig. 1A). The constructs were expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 1B shows that the proteins were more than 95% pure according to SDS-PAGE and had apparent molecular masses of between 45 and 48 kDa. Bands at molecular masses lower than the full-length proteins were due to limited proteolysis during expression, as confirmed by immunoreaction. It has been previously shown that phosphorylation of tau may result in a conformational change that is reflected by a decreased electrophoretic mobility during SDS-PAGE (4Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5301-5305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Baudier J. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17577-17583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B (left) shows that a serine to aspartate mutation at position 327 was sufficient to cause a decreased electrophoretic mobility of the protein. A similar shift in the electrophoretic mobility had been previously observed after phosphorylation with calmodulin kinase II, which phosphorylates serine 327 exclusively (10Steiner B. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Gustke N. Meyer H.E. Schmidt B. Mieskes G. Soling H.D. Drechsel D. Kirschner M.W. Goedert M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3539-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This indicates that aspartate at position 327 is capable of mimicking a phosphorylation-induced change in the conformation of tau. An additional mutation at position 156 did not cause a further shift in the electrophoretic mobility of tau, although a region containing residues 154-172, with serine 156 being the only PKA site within this sequence, was previously found to be required for a phosphorylation-induced supershift in the mobility of tau (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the decreased electrophoretic mobility was due to a different charge or to a conformational change, SDS-PAGE was performed in the presence of 6 M urea. Under these conditions wild-type tau and mutants had the same electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B, middle). This indicates that the mobility shifts were due to conformational changes that produced unfolded and SDS-resistant domains in tau protein (34Litersky J.M. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1563-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were reactive to the phosphorylation-sensitive monoclonal antibody Tau-1, indicating that a mutated position 156 is not sufficient to abolish Tau-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B, right). It has been reported previously that five sites in recombinant tau are phosphorylated in vitro by PKA with a total phosphate to tau stoichiometry of 1.5-2.6 (11Scott C.W. Spreen R.C. Herman J.L. Chow F.P. Davison M.D. Young J. Caputo C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1166-1173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates a substoichiometric phosphorylation of several sites. To determine the extent of phosphorylation at the mutated residues, wild-type tau and tau(Ala, Ala) were phosphorylated by PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion of serines 156 and 327 to alanine reduced the stoichiometry of phosphorylation by 40% (±6%; n = 3), indicating a major contribution of these sites to PKA-dependent tau phosphorylation. This decrease was significant (p < 0.05). To analyze whether serine 156 and serine 327 were required and sufficient for PKA-induced changes in the conformation of tau, wild-type and mutant tau were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation reactions. Because we had previously shown that substrate modulation affected the phosphorylation state of tau and its conformation (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), assays were performed in the presence or absence of heparin (Fig. 2). In the presence of heparin, PKA induced a dramatic shift (“supershift”) in the electrophoretic mobility of wild-type tau from a species with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa to a species of about 52 kDa. In the absence of heparin, proteins with no shift and an intermediate shift (48 kDa) were observed. Mutation of serine 327 to aspartate induced a shift similar to the intermediate shift. No intermediate shift was observed with the alanine 327 mutant. In the absence of heparin, 38-43% of each construct was phosphorylated to yield the 52-kDa species. After phosphorylation in the presence of heparin, a supershift was induced in all mutants, yielding a species of about 52 kDa. Heparin induced a complete phosphorylation to this species. The data indicate that (i) phosphorylation of serine 327 is required and sufficient to induce a shift in electrophoretic mobility from a 45-kDa species to a species with an apparent molecular weight of about 48 kDa; and (ii) phosphorylation of serine 156 is not required for and does not interfere with inducing a supershift. Taken together, the data suggest that serine to aspartate mutations are a useful system for analyzing the contribution of individual sites to phosphorylation-induced changes in tau conformation. To determine the activity of the mutants in promoting microtubule polymerization, assembly reactions were performed at conditions similar to those of previously published experiments (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, 15 μM purified tubulin was incubated with various tau concentrations in assembly buffer containing GTP. The assembly reactions were terminated by glutaraldehyde fixation after 10 min of incubation, and the polymerization products were analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy following anti-tubulin staining. It should be noted that microtubule assembly as measured in our assay reflects the behavior of a population of microtubules that is the product of both elongation and nucleation processes. Tau(Ala, Ala) and tau(Ala, Asp) promoted the assembly of microtubules similarly to wild-type tau; a significant number of microtubules were polymerized at a concentration as low as 2 μM tau (Fig. 3A). In contrast, only a few microtubules were assembled in the presence of up to 10 μM tau(Asp, Asp), indicating a much lower activity of this fragment to promote microtubule assembly. Although the absolute number of microtubules assembled by tau(Asp, Asp) was lower compared with the other constructs (at 2.2 μM tau), the kinetics of nucleation was similar to wild-type tau (Fig. 3B). No microtubules were observed in the absence of tau or in the presence of corresponding concentrations of a non microtubule-binding control (myoglobin) (not shown). To test for the activity of the constructs to promote microtubule growth, the lengths of the assembled microtubules after different incubation times were determined. Because we have previously shown that microtubule growth is suppressed under conditions of high nucleation activity (35Brandt R. Lee G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a tau:tubulin ratio was used where the number of microtubules was low (2.2 μM tau; see Fig. 3A). All constructs, including tau(Asp, Asp), promoted the assembly of a sufficient number of microtubules to allow length measurements, making it unnecessary to use centrosomes or exogeneously added microtubule fragments to seed assembly. Fig. 3C shows that all constructs effectively promoted microtubule growth. Mean microtubule growth rates, as estimated from interpolating the linear portion of the curve (0-10 min of incubation), were in the range of 1.3-2.2 μm/min for all mutants, suggesting that the low activity of tau(Asp, Asp) in promoting microtubule assembly is primarily caused by a low nucleation activity rather than a low activity to promote growth of existing microtubules. The balance between the microtubule growth and nucleation activities of tau also depends on the total amount of tubulin in the assembly reaction, with microtubule assembly requiring much less tau with increasing amounts of tubulin (35Brandt R. Lee G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test for the effect of an increased tubulin concentration, assembly reactions were performed at 30 μM tubulin. Tau(wt), tau(Ala, Ala) and tau(Ala, Asp) promoted significant microtubule assembly at tau concentrations as low as 1.5 μM (Fig. 4). Again, tau(Asp, Asp) was less active than the other constructs in promoting microtubule assembly, and only a few microtubules were assembled up to 10 μM (the highest concentration tested). Interestingly, these microtubules had the longest mean length. Thus, at the conditions of increased microtubule nucleation as induced by the high tubulin concentration, tau(Asp, Asp) was most effective in promoting microtubule growth. This is consistent with results obtained previously using a tau deletion mutant that was defective in nucleation activity (35Brandt R. Lee G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results provide evidence that phosphorylation of an individual residue can selectively suppress the microtubule nucleation activity of tau without having a major effect on its growth-promoting activity. To determine whether the tau mutants differed in the interaction with polymeric tubulin, cosedimentation assays of taxol-stabilized microtubules with the mutated tau proteins were performed. Under the conditions employed, all tau proteins almost completely (>90%) cosedimented with microtubules, whereas a control protein (myoglobin) remained in the supernatant (Fig. 5). No tau was detected in the pellet in the absence of microtubules (not shown). The results are consistent with the finding that all proteins had similar activities in promoting microtubule growth because this activity is thought to reflect the affinity of tau for microtubules. To test for interaction with dimeric tubulin, ligand blotting experiments were performed as described previously (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were capable of interacting with tubulin under the conditions employed (1 μg of immobilized tau mutants, 5 μg/ml tubulin; data not shown). Taken together, the data suggest that the changes in conformation and function induced by aspartate mutations are not reflected by a major difference in the interactions of the proteins with tubulin. It has previously been demonstrated that cytochalasin treatment of cells transfected with microtubule-associated proteins induces microtubule-dependent process formation (36Edson K. Weisshaar B. Matus A. Development. 1993; 117: 689-700PubMed Google Scholar). Using this system, we showed that specific tau sequences were required for process outgrowth in PC12 cells (31Léger J. Brandt R. Lee G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the involvement of phosphorylation in this system, pRC/CMV vectors containing epitope-tagged (FLAG) wild-type tau and constructs containing alanine and aspartate double mutations were prepared and transiently expressed in PC12 cells. All tau constructs associated with the cytoskeleton, as judged from the staining after using a combined fixation-extraction protocol indicative of cytoskeletal association (37Drubin D.G.

We did not observe an obvious difference in the transfection efficiency and the staining intensities of the constructs as judged by visual inspection of the cells, which suggests that all constructs were expressed to a similar extent. Although only few nontransfected cells established processes after cytochalasin treatment, many of the cells expressing the constructs established long and thin cellular processes. Quantitation showed that in the absence of cytochalasin, expression of tau generally did not result in process formation, whereas in the presence of cytochalasin, about 40% of cells transfected with tau(wt) or tau(Ala, Ala) established processes (Fig. 6C). When the cells were transfected with tau(Asp, Asp), this percentage was slightly lower (34%) but not significantly different (p > 0.05). The amount of cells with more than one process was similar for all constructs (59, 47, and 50% of all process bearing cells after transfection with tau(wt), tau(Ala, Ala) and tau(Asp, Asp), respectively), suggesting that there was no major effect of the particular construct on the number of processes per cell. To analyze the activity of each construct to promote process growth, the mean lengths of the extended processes were determined. Fig. 6D shows that processes from cells that had been transfected with wild-type tau or tau(Ala, Ala) were about two-thirds longer than processes in control cells. Tau(Asp, Asp) promoted the formation of processes with about a 20% longer mean length than the processes formed with wild-type tau or tau(Ala, Ala). This difference was significant for the total number of the processes from all experiments, as well as for the mean of the individual experiments (p < 0.05). Because tau(Asp, Asp) had a lower nucleation activity, this may indicate that in tau(Asp, Asp)-transfected cells, a higher ratio of tau is available for promoting microtubule growth rather than microtubule nucleation, thus resulting in the establishment of longer processes. Conformational changes, as reflected by a decreased electrophoretic mobility on SDS gels, occur after certain phosphorylation events and are characteristic of tau isolated from PHFs from patients with Alzheimer's disease (17Lee V.M. Balin B.J. Otvos L.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 18Brion J.P. Hanger D.P. Bruce M.T. Couck A.M. Flament D.J. Anderton B.H. Biochem.

Although phosphorylation of tau by PKA appears not to be directly involved in neurodegeneration, it may serve as a useful model system for studying phosphorylation-induced changes in conformation and function. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of tau by PKA induces several discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobility, which correlate with the degree of phosphorylation and differentially affect the ability of tau to promote microtubule growth and nucleation (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect evidence obtained from in vitro phosphorylation experiments using a panel of truncated tau proteins points toward two of the five phosphorylation sites (Ser-156 and Ser-327) as being of particular importance for inducing a conformational change and a change in the activity of tau. Our data show that serine to alanine mutations at these positions are neutral toward the conformation of tau and that aspartate mutations at Ser-327 introduce conformational changes similar to those induced by phosphorylation of this residue. The results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-327 is required and sufficient for one of the conformational changes induced by PKA. Previous experiments using fragments of tau have shown that the presence of residues 154-172 is required for a further shift in mobility. Such a supershift had previously been observed when tau was phosphorylated by PKA. Interestingly, introduction of an additional aspartate mutation at residue 156 did not cause a supershift in mobility on SDS gels. This indicates a complex relationship between phosphorylation events and sequence requirements modulating the conformation of tau. Mutations of Ser-156 did not change the immunoreactivity with the phosphorylation-sensitive antibody Tau-1, whose epitope has been mapped between residues 131-149 (39Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Lee G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 40Liu W.K. Moore W.T. Williams R.T. Hall F.L. Yen S.H. J. Neurosci.

Neither the alanine mutations at positions 156 and 327 nor the conformational change induced by the mutation of Ser-327 to aspartate affected the activity of tau in our microtubule assembly assays. However, when Ser-156 is mutated to aspartate, a marked decrease in the activity of tau to promote microtubule nucleation is observed. This confirms previous results where tau, phosphorylated by PKA in the presence of heparin and containing almost completely phosphorylated Ser-156, showed a decreased nucleation activity (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that dynamic instability would account for the low nucleation activity because under our conditions, microtubules exhibit net growth at both ends even in the absence of any microtubule-associated proteins (42Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the nucleation activity of tau is not correlated with its conformation as reflected by its electrophoretic mobility. The fact that Ser-156 is located in the region that has previously been found to be required for the nucleation activity of tau (residues 154-172 (13Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) confirms the importance of this domain in regulating the nucleation activity of tau. In addition, the experiments show that a shift in electrophoretic mobility is only a poor indicator for the functional activity of tau. With the exception of phosphorylation of Ser-262 (5Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), most of the phoshorylation events of tau have only moderate effects on microtubule binding. In agreement, our results show that all mutated isoforms interact with microtubules to a similar extent despite the large difference in nucleation activity of tau(Asp, Asp). This may indicate that the nucleation activity of tau has additional features beyond the simple binding of tubulin. For instance, during nucleation, tau may undergo conformational changes that bring tubulin heterodimers together. These interactions may be finely regulated by additional sequence and/or conformational requirements. This is consistent with previous results showing that the activities of tau to nucleate microtubules are mechanistically distinct and involve primary structure elements not required for microtubule binding (25Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the potential phosphorylation sites of tau, including sites that have been found to be specifically modified in PHF-tau, are localized within a region adjacent to the microtubule binding domain of tau (residues 154-197). It will be interesting to evaluate whether all phosphorylation events within this region have similar effects on the activity of tau or whether nucleation can be regulated by the phosphorylation of specific sites. Serine to aspartate or alanine mutations allow assessment of the function of certain phosphorylation events in a cellular context. We have previously shown that tau induces microtubule-dependent process formation in actin-depolymerized PC12 cells (31Léger J. Brandt R. Lee G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this system a lack of process formation was observed following transfection with a tau construct missing residues 154-173. This could be explained by a lack of nucleation activity, by a lower affinity to microtubules, or by a decreased microtubule-stabilizing activity of this construct. Because our results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-156 may modulate the nucleation activity of tau in vitro, the effect of transfections with the mutant proteins was determined. PC12 cells similarly elaborated processes whether transfected with wild-type tau or with alanine or aspartate mutations, suggesting that phosphorylation of serine 156 and serine 327 is not critical for the interaction of tau with cellular microtubules and the promotion of process outgrowth. The results suggest that the activity of the transfected constructs to nucleate microtubules is not critical for the formation of processes in this system. The low levels of endogenous tau may provide adequate nucleation activity in this assay. Taken together, our data indicate that serine to aspartate mutations are a useful system to test the effect of single phosphorylated residues on the structure and function of tau. It will be interesting to test the effect of various phosphorylation events that may be correlated with the formation of PHF-tau on the function of tau both in vitro and in cells.

The enzyme also phosphorylates anti-viral and anti-cancer nucleoside analogs. We have identified an expressed sequence tag cDNA that encoded a 27.5-kDa protein ≈30% similar to the human deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase. The protein was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and shown to have similar substrate specificity as reported for purified native human TK2. The recombinant TK2 was shown to phosphorylate the anti-cancer nucleoside analog 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine. Northern blot analysis showed two mRNA species at 2.4 and 4.0 kilobases predominantly expressed in liver, pancreas, muscle, and brain. We identified a sequence-tagged site designed from the 3′region of the TK2 cDNA. The sequence-tagged site has been mapped to 81-84 centimorgans from the top linkage group of chromosome 16, which corresponds to the 16q22 region. Our data show that deoxycytidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and TK2 belong to a family of closely related enzymes. At the time of this report all four of the known human deoxyribonucleoside kinases have been cloned.

IL-8, specifically binds the CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR1, while a second receptor, CXCR2, is shared by IL-8, MGSA/GRO, and several other CXC chemokines (1Richmond A. Shattuck R.L. Horuk R. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors.CRC Press, Inc. 1996; : 87-124Google Scholar). In human neutrophils, a 10-min treatment with IL-8 induces the internalization of greater than 90% of the CXC chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 (2Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Low MGSA/GRO concentrations (0.2 nM) down-regulated 50% of CXCR2 expressed on neutrophils, while 7–13-fold higher IL-8 concentrations are required to down-regulate 50% of CXCR1 (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of CXCR1 is 100% restored after 1.5 h, while only 40% of the initial CXCR2 expression can be detected after 3 h of incubation following ligand treatment (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated in both 3ASubE and 293 stable transfectants expressing CXCR2 that ligand binding results in the phosphorylation of CXCR2 on serine residues (4Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Within 1 min after ligand binding, MGSA/GRO stimulates the phosphorylation of CXCR2, and after prolonged treatment with MGSA/GRO ~40% of the receptors are degraded (4Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol ester treatment (100 nM for 2 h) of 3ASubE cells expressing CXCR2 also results in serine phosphorylation, down-regulation, and degradation of the receptor (5Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data suggest that phosphorylation of CXCR2 induces receptor internalization (sequestration) and degradation, as has been observed in certain adrenergic receptors (6Pitcher J. Lohse M.J.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 293 cells expressing CXCR2 exhibiting a deletion of amino acids 317–355 from the carboxyl-terminal domain do not exhibit chemotaxis in response to IL-8 (9Ben-Baruch A.

Since ligand did induce migration of 293 cells expressing CXCR2 with a deletion of residues 325–355, residues 317–324 appear to be essential for signal transduction and chemotaxis in response to IL-8 (9Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).In the present study, we show that CXCR2 mutants exhibiting a loss of residues 331–355 (331T) or 342–355 (342T) no longer undergo ligand-enhanced receptor phosphorylation or desensitization as monitored by Ca2+ mobilization in response to ligand challenge. In contrast, receptors exhibiting deletion of amino acid residues 352–355 (352T) continue to undergo phosphorylation in response to ligand. In an effort to determine which specific serine residues are phosphorylated, we mutated individual serine residues 342, 346, 347, and 348 to alanine (S342A, S346A, S347A, S348A) or groups of serine residues to alanine: 346/7/8 (3A) and 342/6/7/8 (4A). Studies with 3ASubE cells expressing these mutant receptors, as compared with 3ASubE cells expressing wild type CXCR2, revealed that serines 342, 346, 347, and 348 of CXCR2 are involved in the desensitization of the receptor to its ligand. However, when these serine residues are mutated to alanine (4A or 3A CXCR2), other serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain can be phosphorylated, and the receptor is partially desensitized in response to ligand. In 3ASubE cells, phosphorylation and desensitization of WT CXCR2 occurs within 1 min after ligand treatment, while receptor sequestration requires >30 min. The 342T CXCR2 receptor is not sequestered in response to ligand. These data demonstrate that for CXCR2, specific residues along the carboxyl-terminal domain of the receptor mediate receptor desensitization and sequestration in response to ligand.DISCUSSIONThere is now considerable evidence that ligand binding to transmembrane-spanning receptors stimulates receptor phosphorylation on the carboxyl-terminal domain of the receptor and that this event coincides with receptor desensitization, sequestration, and in some instances degradation or recycling (3Chuntharapai A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that the phosphorylation of CXCR1 is accompanied by receptor desensitization. CXCR2 expressed in CHO cells is reported to be internalized more rapidly than CXCR1, and MGSA induces this internalization more slowly than does IL-8 (12Prado G.N. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, truncation of CXCR1 eliminates ~60% of the ligand-induced internalization of the receptor (12Prado G.N. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, neutrophil CXCR1 and CXCR2 are both rapidly down-modulated by ligand (5 min), although considerably more ligand is required to down-modulate CXCR1 than CXCR2 (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). CXCR2 recycles more slowly than the CXCR1; moreover, only about 40% of the CXCR2 recycles during a 3-h culture period (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar), while CXCR1 fully recovers 1.5 h after treatment with the IL-8 ligand in neutrophils. Our studies with 3ASubE cells show that desensitization and phosphorylation of WT CXCR2 occurs within 30–0 s after ligand treatment, while sequestration occurs much more slowly, requiring 30–0 min. Thus, CXCR2 clearance in 3ASubE cells is different from that reported for CHO cells (12Prado G.N. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol.

We have also observed that after 6 h of treatment with 25 nM MGSA/GRO, 3ASubE cells expressing WT CXCR2 exhibit only ~50% reduction in the total receptor detected by Western blot, suggesting that either only a percentage of the receptors that bind ligand undergo degradation after sequestration or, alternatively, newly translated CXCR2 rapidly replenishes the receptor pool. A recent study of the N-formyl peptide receptor demonstrates a similar dynamic state of receptor sequestration, counterbalanced by the reappearance of receptors at the membrane (13Hoffman J.F. Linderman J.J. Omann G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18394-18404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).3ASubE cells expressing wild type and mutant CXCR2 exhibit only subtle differences in the time course for desensitization or receptor sequestration produced by IL-8 and MGSA/GRO. However, larger differences in IL-8- versus MGSA/GRO-induced calcium signaling in 293 cells expressing transfected CXCR2 were recently observed by Damaj et al. (21Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Neote K. Hebert C.A. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20540-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), who suggested that MGSA/GRO elicits a stronger influx of Ca2+ than does IL-8. Differences in IL-8 versus MGSA/GRO induction of sequestration of CXCR2 were observed by Prado et al. in transfected CHO cells (11Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu D. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The basis for the different results between these two studies and our study is unclear but could reflect differences in the specific activity or potency of the ligand preparations or differences in the manner in which the various cell types process the receptors. More in keeping with our own findings, Ahuja et al. (22Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) reported similar profiles of calcium mobilization for IL-8 and MGSA/GRO proteins in stably transfected 293 cells expressing CXCR2, although MGSA/GRO was unable to totally desensitize receptors to a second weaker response to IL-8.The β-adrenergic receptors are phosphorylated along the carboxyl tail by β-adrenergic receptor kinase and then assume a conformation that allows association with an arrestin (14Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A-M. Barak L.S Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). This association with arrestin is thought to be necessary for both desensitization and for sequestration. In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-326 is involved in facilitation of sequestration of this receptor (14Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A-M. Barak L.S Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). We observe no tyrosine phosphorylation of CXCR2 in response to ligand or phorbol-ester stimulation. While some investigators have reported that sequestration is not dependent upon phosphorylation, others have shown that overexpression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 can facilitate the sequestration of the M2-muscarinic receptor. Moreover, for the M2 receptor, desensitization has been shown to proceed in the absence of sequestration (15Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors show loss of both phosphorylation and sequestration when the carboxyl-terminal domain is deleted (17Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Huang Z. Chen Y. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our studies on CXCR2 phosphorylation, desensitization, and sequestration demonstrate that the loss of four specific serine residues involved in ligand-stimulated receptor phosphorylation results in markedly diminished receptor desensitization and loss of receptor sequestration but no loss of ligand-induced chemotaxis. However, we are unable to assign significance to any one specific phosphorylation site regarding a role for desensitization or sequestration. Multiple sites appear to be phosphorylated. A similar cluster of serine and threonine residues regulates CXCR1 desensitization in the RBL-2H3 leukemia cell line (11Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu D. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that desensitization does not always require receptor phosphorylation. Richardson et al. (20Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have recently shown that activation of an epitope-tagged fMLP receptor can cross-desensitize and cross-phosphorylate both the epitope-tagged C5a receptor and CXCR1. C5a and IL-8 also cross-desensitized the epitope-tagged fMLP receptor based upon Ca2+ mobilization and phosphoinositide hydrolysis, but this is not accompanied by phosphorylation of the epitope-tagged fMLP receptor. Richardson et al. (20Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) concluded that these data indicate that activation of phospholipase C, independent of receptor G protein coupling, might be involved in cross-desensitization in the absence of receptor phosphorylation (20Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).We have observed only serine phosphorylation of CXCR2 (4Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphoamino acid analysis of the mutant forms of CXCR2 studied here revealed only serine phosphorylation (data not shown). Truncation and serine mutants of CXCR2 that exhibited a loss of ligand-induced CXCR2 phosphorylation also exhibited a loss of TPA-induced CXCR2 phosphorylation. Thus, in 3ASubE cells CXCR2 is regulated very differently from CXCR1 in RBL-2H3 leukemia cells, where threonine phosphorylation may also be important, and phorbol-ester regulation of receptor phosphorylation appears to differ from that initiated by ligand (11Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu D. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Like the CXCR1, phosphorylation of CXCR2 along the carboxyl-terminal domain appears to be important in the desensitization process, and loss of amino acid residues involved in this phosphorylation results in diminution of the receptor desensitization as well as receptor sequestration in response to ligand. Moreover, these two receptors appear to exhibit differences in the time course of sequestration and recycling (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). These events are likely to be important in the regulation of the inflammatory response, where an acute response to injury is required to quickly turn on and gradually shut off in an environmental milieu where excess ligand may persist for some time.

IL-8, specifically binds the CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR1, while a second receptor, CXCR2, is shared by IL-8, MGSA/GRO, and several other CXC chemokines (1Richmond A. Shattuck R.L. Horuk R. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors.CRC Press, Inc. 1996; : 87-124Google Scholar). In human neutrophils, a 10-min treatment with IL-8 induces the internalization of greater than 90% of the CXC chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 (2Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Low MGSA/GRO concentrations (0.2 nM) down-regulated 50% of CXCR2 expressed on neutrophils, while 7–13-fold higher IL-8 concentrations are required to down-regulate 50% of CXCR1 (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of CXCR1 is 100% restored after 1.5 h, while only 40% of the initial CXCR2 expression can be detected after 3 h of incubation following ligand treatment (3Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated in both 3ASubE and 293 stable transfectants expressing CXCR2 that ligand binding results in the phosphorylation of CXCR2 on serine residues (4Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Within 1 min after ligand binding, MGSA/GRO stimulates the phosphorylation of CXCR2, and after prolonged treatment with MGSA/GRO ~40% of the receptors are degraded (4Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol ester treatment (100 nM for 2 h) of 3ASubE cells expressing CXCR2 also results in serine phosphorylation, down-regulation, and degradation of the receptor (5Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10439-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data suggest that phosphorylation of CXCR2 induces receptor internalization (sequestration) and degradation, as has been observed in certain adrenergic receptors (6Pitcher J. Lohse M.J. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 293 cells expressing CXCR2 exhibiting a deletion of amino acids 317–355 from the carboxyl-terminal domain do not exhibit chemotaxis in response to IL-8 (9Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since ligand did induce migration of 293 cells expressing CXCR2 with a deletion of residues 325–355, residues 317–324 appear to be essential for signal transduction and chemotaxis in response to IL-8 (9Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).In the present study, we show that CXCR2 mutants exhibiting a loss of residues 331–355 (331T) or 342–355 (342T) no longer undergo ligand-enhanced receptor phosphorylation or desensitization as monitored by Ca2+ mobilization in response to ligand challenge. In contrast, receptors exhibiting deletion of amino acid residues 352–355 (352T) continue to undergo phosphorylation in response to ligand. In an effort to determine which specific serine residues are phosphorylated, we mutated individual serine residues 342, 346, 347, and 348 to alanine (S342A, S346A, S347A, S348A) or groups of serine residues to alanine: 346/7/8 (3A) and 342/6/7/8 (4A). Studies with 3ASubE cells expressing these mutant receptors, as compared with 3ASubE cells expressing wild type CXCR2, revealed that serines 342, 346, 347, and 348 of CXCR2 are involved in the desensitization of the receptor to its ligand. However, when these serine residues are mutated to alanine (4A or 3A CXCR2), other serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain can be phosphorylated, and the receptor is partially desensitized in response to ligand. In 3ASubE cells, phosphorylation and desensitization of WT CXCR2 occurs within 1 min after ligand treatment, while receptor sequestration requires >30 min. The 342T CXCR2 receptor is not sequestered in response to ligand. These data demonstrate that for CXCR2, specific residues along the carboxyl-terminal domain of the receptor mediate receptor desensitization and sequestration in response to ligand."

This full-length cDNA clone of 3432 base pairs (WS9-14) was isolated from human fibroblasts on the basis of its overexpression in senescent cells. It encodes an 87-kDa polypeptide, whose protein is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family, because it contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains that are found in several secreted or cell surface proteins. The WS9-14 protein has a 48% identity with both lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase-like protein at a region corresponding to exons 2–, implying the existence of a lysyl oxidase gene family. The pattern of WS9-14 gene expression by fibroblasts parallels pro-collagen I-α1 expression. Its mRNA level is induced by transforming growth factor β-1 and indomethacin and inhibited by phorbol ester and retinoic acid. WS9-14 is abundantly expressed in all tumor cell lines examined that attach to culture dishes but not in cell lines that grow in suspension and is also up-regulated in senescent fibroblasts.

Joshi A. Willey R. Orenstein J. Jeang K.-T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Tat is produced in large quantities in HIV-1-infected cells. It is secreted and can be taken up rapidly by other cells (9Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Exogenous Tat accelerates CD95-mediated, activation-induced T cell apoptosis (10Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

It has been reported that HIV-1 Tat potentiates TNF-induced NF-B activation, which stimulates the replication of HIV-1 (11Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M.

Both NF-B activation and antigen processing require the proteasomal system (5Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

Our interest in Tat was stimulated by the fact that two ATPase subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex, MSS1 and TBP1 (14Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), directly or indirectly influence Tat action. MSS1 (mammalian suppressor of sgv1) is a modulator of Tat-mediated transactivation (15Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Goebl M. Taniguchi T. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1992; 357: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and TBP1 (Tat-binding protein 1) was identified by direct protein-protein interaction with Tat (16Nelbock P. Dillion P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and hence could be a potential Tat-binding subunit of the 26 S proteasome. We reasoned that HIV-1 Tat could have an effect on the proteasomal system and performed experiments to test this hypothesis. The components of the proteasomal system, the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes and the 11 S regulator, were purified from human erythrocytes as described (17Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

SucLLVY-AMC cleavage assays were conducted with the electrophoretically homogenous protein complexes in a final volume of 100 μl. Final concentrations of the substrate, HIV-1 Tat, and the proteasomal complexes are indicated in the figures. Fluorescence was measured at 37 °C with a microtiter plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Labsystems) at 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission after a 5-min lag time over a 60-min period in 5-min intervals. During this time period the reactions were linear. The degradation of Ub-[125I]lysozyme conjugates was measured in the absence and in the presence of ATP. After 30 min of incubation in the presence of 50 μl of Ub-[125I]lysozyme conjugates (~4 × 103 cpm), the reaction was stopped, and the percentage of degradation was determined as described (19Hough R.

Rechsteiner) detects the 26 S proteasome as well as the 19 S regulatory complex. To show Tat binding to the protein complexes, blots were incubated with a Tat solution (0.1 μg/ml) for 60 min. Subsequently the blots were washed with PBS and developed with an polyclonal anti-Tat antibody. The antibody against Tat was made with synthesized protein in rabbits using standard techniques. The two-exon Tat used in most of the experiments was synthesized as described previously (21Kraft M. Westendorp M.O. Krammer P.H. Schuckert O. Bayer P. Rösch P. Frank R.W. Maia H.L.S. Peptides.

As an initial experiment we investigated whether HIV-1 Tat could affect peptide hydrolysis by the 20 S proteasome. To our surprise the degradation of a fluorogenic peptide, sucLLVY-AMC, by the 20 S proteasome was inhibited by Tat with an average 50% inhibition value (Ki50) of 5 × 10−8 M (Fig. 1A). The inhibition is almost complete with a remaining 5–10% activity that differs slightly between preparations. Because the Ki50 values were independent of substrate concentrations (see Fig. 1A), Tat does not compete with the fluorogenic peptide for binding to the active centers in the lumen of the 20 S proteasome. This is in accordance with earlier results showing that a folded protein cannot penetrate into the inner compartment of the 20 S proteasome (22Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To prove whether the effect was restricted to synthesized Tat, we tested a Tat protein expressed in and isolated from Escherichia coli that also caused 20 S proteasome inhibition (data not shown). Tat decreases antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (12Viscidi R.P. Mayur K. Lederman H.M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), possibly because antigens are not processed and thus not presented. Therefore, it was intriguing to test its effect on the 20 S proteasome-11 S regulator complex, which is involved in the processing of antigens presented by MHC class I (6Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.-M. Nature. 1996; 381: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The kinetic data shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate that Tat competes with the 11 S regulator for binding sites on the 20 S proteasome. There is a linear increase of the Ki50 values at increasing 11 S regulator amounts (see Fig. 1B, inset). Sigmoidal kinetics indicate that Tat must displace the 11 S regulator from both of its binding sites, the two α-rings of the 20 S proteasome (23Koster A.J. Walz J. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), to exert inhibition. The same kinetic profile, although as an activation, was obtained when the 20 S proteasome was incubated with Tat protein prior to the addition of different 11 S regulator amounts (data not shown). Moreover, Western blot analysis demonstrates that the 11 S regulator displaces Tat from its proteasomal binding sites (Fig. 3B). Next we examined the effect of Tat on the 26 S proteasome. In the presence of ATP, the cleavage of sucLLVY-AMC is activated by Tat about 3–5-fold with an average 50% activation value (Ka50) of approximately 5 × 10−7 M (Fig. 1C). In experiments with disassembled 26 S proteasome, Tat activation was observed only after 30 min in the presence of ATP (data not shown). This time period corresponds with the ATP-dependent assembly process of the 26 S proteasome from the 19 S regulatory complex and the 20 S proteasome. It is likely that the 19 S regulatory complex displaces Tat from the 20 S proteasome, because it likewise displaces the 11 S regulator (17Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16890-16895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably Tat binds to TBP1 and perhaps other ATPases of the 19 S regulatory complex, which leads to this moderate activation of the 26 S proteasome. We tested the effect of Tat on a more physiologically relevant function of the 26 S proteasome, the degradation of Ub conjugates (Fig. 2). Tat activated ATP-dependent conjugate degradation to the same extent as it stimulated peptide cleavage activity of the 26 S proteasome. In samples without exogenous ATP (Fig. 2, −MgATP) we observed a slight stimulation of proteolysis in the presence of Tat, probably due to residual ATP in the preparation (18Seeger M. Gordon C. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the kinetic data argue strongly that Tat binds to components of the proteasomal system, it is demonstrated directly in Fig. 3. The 26 S proteasome was separated by nondenaturing electrophoresis and localized by substrate overlay and specific antibodies, which also identified the 19 S and the 20 S complexes (Fig. 3A). The occurrence of all three complexes reflects partial dissociation of the 26 S proteasome during electrophoresis. As expected on the basis of our kinetic studies, the lane labeled Tat in Fig. 3A shows binding of Tat to the 26 S proteasome and the 19 S regulatory complex as well as to the 20 S proteasome. Binding to the 19 S complex supports our conclusion of Tat binding site(s) on the 26 S proteasome, independent of that on the 20 S proteasome. Preliminary experiments using immunological probing of streptavidin precipitated biotin-Tat peptide indicate that Tat does not bind the 11 S regulator (data not shown). To illustrate the competition between Tat and the 11 S regulator for the proteasomal binding sites, isolated 11 S regulator was used to displace Tat bound to immobilized 20 S proteasome (Fig. 3B). The specific Tat-binding subunits of the 20 S proteasome are currently unknown. However, because the 20 S proteasome subunit C2 is involved in 11 S regulator binding (24Kania M.A. DeMartino G.N. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it could also participate in the interaction with Tat. It is not unique that a protein such as Tat interacts with the proteasomal system. Two other viral proteins, Hbx (25Fischer M. Runkel L. Schaller H. Virus Genes. 1995; 10: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Tax (26Rousset R. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Nature. 1996; 381: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), also bind to the 20 S proteasome. The consequences of these interactions for the 20 S and 26 S enzymes activities, however, remain speculations. While inhibiting the 20 S proteasome, Tat stimulates the 26 S proteasome needed for cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation (1Murray A. Cell. 1995; 81: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In this context it is interesting to note that the 26 S enzyme activates NF-B (13Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). It has been shown with different cell lines that Tat enhances tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of NF-B, which leads to a stimulation of HIV-1 replication (11Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Dröge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The cartoon in Fig. 4 summarizes Tat effects on the proteasomal system based on the data shown in this paper. The in vivo consequence of 11 S regulator replacement and 20 S proteasome inhibition by Tat should be a decrease in antigen processing and subsequently, a reduced MHC class I presentation by infected and perhaps noninfected cells. The role of the 26 S proteasome in antigen processing is unclear. It has been shown that ubiquitination supports the presentation of antigens derived from ovalbumin (5Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar), and the initial degradation of antigens by the 26 S proteasome can be assumed. Whether the enzyme itself produces peptides that can be presented by MHC class I molecules or whether it makes intermediates that are further processed by the free 20 S proteasome and/or the 20 S proteasome-11 S regulator complex is not yet known. The latter pathway could be inhibited by Tat. Although the highly basic Tat protein has been reported to bind to a number of different proteins, the cellular data demonstrating the effects of exogenous Tat are consistent with our in vitro effects upon the proteasomal system. The immunosuppressive activity of Tat has been demonstrated with lymphocytes. Tetanus toxoid-induced lymphocyte proliferation was inhibited by exogenous Tat with the same Ki50 value (12Viscidi R.P. Mayur K. Lederman H.M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) of 50 nM as obtained in our studies for 20 S proteasome inhibition. In concert with its effects on CD4+ T cells (10Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), Tat inhibition of antigen processing may at least partially contribute to the profound immunodeficiency in AIDS patients.

https://openalex.org/W1973216887,"A mutant α3β3γ complex of F1-ATPase from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 was generated in which noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites lost their ability to bind nucleotides. It hydrolyzed ATP at an initial rate with cooperative kinetics (Km(1), 4 μM; Km(2), 135 μM) similar to the wild-type complex. However, the initial rate decayed rapidly to an inactivated form. Since the inactivated mutant complex contained 1.5 mol of ADP/mol of complex, this inactivation seemed to be caused by entrapping inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site. Indeed, the mutant complex was nearly completely inactivated by a 10 min prior incubation with equimolar MgADP. Analysis of the progress of inactivation after initiation of ATP hydrolysis as a function of ATP concentration indicated that the inactivation was optimal at ATP concentrations in the range of Km(1). In the presence of ATP, the wild-type complex dissociated the inhibitory [3H]ADP preloaded onto a catalytic site whereas the mutant complex did not. Lauryl dimethylamineoxide promoted release of preloaded inhibitory [3H]ADP in an ATP-dependent manner and partly restored the activity of the inactivated mutant complex. Addition of ATP promoted single-site hydrolysis of 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP preloaded at a single catalytic site of the mutant complex.

INTRODUCTIONF1-ATPase is the extrinsic membrane sector of H+-ATP synthase and comprises five different subunits in a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1β1β1 (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

(2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), the α and β subunits are arranged alternately to a form hexagonal α3β3. The six nucleotide binding sites are located at different interfaces between the α and β subunits. The three catalytic sites are mainly on the β subunits, whereas the three other sites called noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites are mainly on the α subunits. The overall structural topologies of the catalytic and noncatalytic sites are very similar to each other and both sites contain the two sequences known as the Walker motif A and B, which are commonly found in many nucleotide-binding proteins (3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). Motif A, which is also called as P-loop, has the consensus sequence, GXXXXGK(T/S), and motif B consists of a stretch of four consecutive hydrophobic residues followed by Asp.The function of the noncatalytic site is obscure. However, recent studies suggest that the F1-ATPase is prone to develop turnover-dependent inactivation and the noncatalytic sites play a role in relieving the inactivation (4Jault J.-M. Allison W.S.

When nucleotide-depleted MF1 or F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1) hydrolyzes relatively low concentration of ATP, three kinetic phases are often observed in the presence of an ATP regenerating system. An initial burst rapidly decelerates to an intermediate rate that, in turn, gradually accelerates to a final steady-state rate. It has been postulated that transition from the initial phase to the intermediate phase is caused by turnover-dependent entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site (6Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these kinetic features are observed with the α3β3γ complex of TF1 (18Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The α3β3γ complex of TF1 containing α subunits with a mutation in the Walker motif B, α-D261N, dissociates inhibitory MgADP only slowly even in the presence of ATP and the transition from the intermediate phase to the final phase almost disappeared, exhibiting a low final rate of ATP hydrolysis, about 30% of that of the wild-type complex (18Jault J.M.

Conversely, the α3β3γ complex of TF1 containing β subunits with a mutation in the Walker motif A, β-T165S, efficiently dissociates inhibitory MgADP and exhibits a severalfold higher final rate of ATP hydrolysis than that of the wild-type complex (19Jault J.-M.

These results suggest that F1-ATPase in the inactivated state with inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site is reactivated by ATP binding to noncatalytic sites. However, important unanswered questions remain. For instance, does enzyme containing inhibitory MgADP in a single catalytic site have weak residual ATPase activity or is it completely inactive? Is release of inhibitory MgADP totally dependent on ATP binding to noncatalytic sites or is there slow release of inhibitory MgADP that is independent of ATP binding to noncatalytic sites?The role of noncatalytic site in the cooperative kinetics of F1-ATPase also remains to be clarified. F1-ATPase exhibits negative cooperativity characterized with two or three apparent Km values which are 1–30 μM, 100–300 μM, and above 400 μM (20Ebel R.E. Lardy H.A. J. Biol.

Sasayama T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This apparent negative cooperativity is observed also for the membrane-bound enzyme (25Matsuda C. Muneyuki E. Endo H. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and proton translocation (26Muneyuki E. Hirata H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites can explain apparent negative cooperativity at relatively high concentration of ATP represented by the highest Km value (4Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Weber et al. reported a single Km value for the mutant F1-ATPase from Escherichia coli (EF1) with mutations α-D261N/α-R365W in which nucleotide binding to noncatalytic sites was greatly diminished (27Weber J. Bowman C. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21045-21049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). They stated that the kinetics of this mutant showed no deviation from simple monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, they assayed ATPase activity by measuring Pi release, which is not suitable to monitor fluctuation in rate during assay. Therefore, as stated in their paper, they did not scrutinize the kinetic behavior at very low substrate concentrations, which is necessary to detect a Km at 1–30 μM. Similarly, Yohda et al. reported that α(D261N)3β3γ complex of TF1 did not exhibit cooperativity, but again they examined kinetics only above 20 μM ATP (28Yohda M. Ohta S. Hisabori T. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of noncatalytic sites on cooperative kinetics of F1-ATPase remains unsettled.Since the covalent modification of the noncatalytic sites with 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine inactivates ATPase activity completely (29Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5722-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is even possible to argue that noncatalytic sites are essential for the activity of F1-ATPase, although their participation in catalysis is indirect. The mutants reported so far whose noncatalytic sites are impaired, namely EF1(α-D261N/α-R365W) and α(D261N)3β3γ complex of TF1, have considerable ATPase activity (18Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M.

Acta. 1988; 933: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Especially, the EF1 mutant showed ATPase activity even under the condition where noncatalytic sites were supposed to be empty and Weber et al. concluded that occupancy of the noncatalytic sites by adenine nucleotides was not required for catalysis. However, ambiguity remains because both EF1(α-D261N/α-R365W) and α(D261N)3β3γ complex of TF1 have the ability to bind nucleotide to the noncatalytic sites even though the affinity is decreased.To obtain more discriminating data on the role of noncatalytic sites, it is necessary to characterize a mutant F1-ATPase that completely lacks the ability to bind nucleotides to noncatalytic sites. To generate such a mutant, we have replaced four amino acid residues in Walker motif A and B sequences of the TF1-α subunit by Ala residues, and analyzed nucleotide binding properties and ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the α3β3γ complex containing the mutated α subunits under a wide range of ATP concentration. Comparison of this mutant α3β3γ (βNC) complex and the wild-type α3β3γ complex has revealed the essential role of noncatalytic sites in steady-state catalytic turnover of F1-ATPases.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Paik S.R. Jault J.M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When nucleotide-depleted MF1 or F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1) hydrolyzes relatively low concentration of ATP, three kinetic phases are often observed in the presence of an ATP regenerating system. An initial burst rapidly decelerates to an intermediate rate that, in turn, gradually accelerates to a final steady-state rate. It has been postulated that transition from the initial phase to the intermediate phase is caused by turnover-dependent entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site (6Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem.

The observation that the binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites stimulates ATPase activity was also reported (13Milgrom Y.M. Ehler L.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol.

Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The α3β3γ complex of TF1 containing α subunits with a mutation in the Walker motif B, α-D261N, dissociates inhibitory MgADP only slowly even in the presence of ATP and the transition from the intermediate phase to the final phase almost disappeared, exhibiting a low final rate of ATP hydrolysis, about 30% of that of the wild-type complex (18Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Conversely, the α3β3γ complex of TF1 containing β subunits with a mutation in the Walker motif A, β-T165S, efficiently dissociates inhibitory MgADP and exhibits a severalfold higher final rate of ATP hydrolysis than that of the wild-type complex (19Jault J.-M.

These results suggest that F1-ATPase in the inactivated state with inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site is reactivated by ATP binding to noncatalytic sites. However, important unanswered questions remain. For instance, does enzyme containing inhibitory MgADP in a single catalytic site have weak residual ATPase activity or is it completely inactive? Is release of inhibitory MgADP totally dependent on ATP binding to noncatalytic sites or is there slow release of inhibitory MgADP that is independent of ATP binding to noncatalytic sites?The role of noncatalytic site in the cooperative kinetics of F1-ATPase also remains to be clarified. F1-ATPase exhibits negative cooperativity characterized with two or three apparent Km values which are 1–30 μM, 100–300 μM, and above 400 μM (20Ebel R.E. Lardy H.A. J. Biol.

Sasayama T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This apparent negative cooperativity is observed also for the membrane-bound enzyme (25Matsuda C. Muneyuki E. Endo H. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and proton translocation (26Muneyuki E. Hirata H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites can explain apparent negative cooperativity at relatively high concentration of ATP represented by the highest Km value (4Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Weber et al. reported a single Km value for the mutant F1-ATPase from Escherichia coli (EF1) with mutations α-D261N/α-R365W in which nucleotide binding to noncatalytic sites was greatly diminished (27Weber J. Bowman C. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21045-21049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). They stated that the kinetics of this mutant showed no deviation from simple monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, they assayed ATPase activity by measuring Pi release, which is not suitable to monitor fluctuation in rate during assay. Therefore, as stated in their paper, they did not scrutinize the kinetic behavior at very low substrate concentrations, which is necessary to detect a Km at 1–30 μM. Similarly, Yohda et al. reported that α(D261N)3β3γ complex of TF1 did not exhibit cooperativity, but again they examined kinetics only above 20 μM ATP (28Yohda M. Ohta S. Hisabori T. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of noncatalytic sites on cooperative kinetics of F1-ATPase remains unsettled.Since the covalent modification of the noncatalytic sites with 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine inactivates ATPase activity completely (29Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5722-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is even possible to argue that noncatalytic sites are essential for the activity of F1-ATPase, although their participation in catalysis is indirect. The mutants reported so far whose noncatalytic sites are impaired, namely EF1(α-D261N/α-R365W) and α(D261N)3β3γ complex of TF1, have considerable ATPase activity (18Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M.

Acta. 1988; 933: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Especially, the EF1 mutant showed ATPase activity even under the condition where noncatalytic sites were supposed to be empty and Weber et al. concluded that occupancy of the noncatalytic sites by adenine nucleotides was not required for catalysis. However, ambiguity remains because both EF1(α-D261N/α-R365W) and α(D261N)3β3γ complex of TF1 have the ability to bind nucleotide to the noncatalytic sites even though the affinity is decreased.To obtain more discriminating data on the role of noncatalytic sites, it is necessary to characterize a mutant F1-ATPase that completely lacks the ability to bind nucleotides to noncatalytic sites. To generate such a mutant, we have replaced four amino acid residues in Walker motif A and B sequences of the TF1-α subunit by Ala residues, and analyzed nucleotide binding properties and ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the α3β3γ complex containing the mutated α subunits under a wide range of ATP concentration. Comparison of this mutant α3β3γ (βNC) complex and the wild-type α3β3γ complex has revealed the essential role of noncatalytic sites in steady-state catalytic turnover of F1-ATPases."

Collagen IV, fibronectin, and tenascin stimulated macrophages' MMP-9 expression. In contrast, laminin stimulated both uPA and MMP-9 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increase in macrophage uPA activity was preceded by an increase in their steady state levels of uPA mRNA. Laminin-induced uPA expression was most pronounced in RAW264.7 macrophages followed by THP-1 monocytes, J774A.1 macrophages, and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Neither laminin nor matrix induced alterations in THP-1 monocyte expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 or TIMP-2. Synthetic laminin peptides were utilized to identify the laminin domain(s) responsible for induction of uPA expression. Peptides derived from the beta1 chain of laminin had no effect on macrophage uPA expression, whereas SIKVAV, derived from alpha1 chain, stimulated uPA expression 20-fold. Preincubation of THP-1 monocytes with a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha6 subunit of the alpha6beta1 laminin receptor blocked matrix induction of uPA without affecting the induction of MMP-9. These results demonstrate that macrophage binding to laminin plays an important role in the regulation of their degradative phenotype via the up-regulation of uPA and MMP-9."

https://openalex.org/W1983823652,"Interaction between erythropoietin (EPO) and its membrane receptor induces the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors. EPO has been shown to activate the JAK2-STAT5 pathway in various hematopoietic cell lines, although the physiological role of this pathway is unclear. We have previously shown that epidermal growth factor activates a chimeric receptor bearing the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor, resulting in proliferation of interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic cells and erythroid differentiation (globin synthesis) of EPO-responsive erythroleukemia cells. In the present study, we introduced various deletion and tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution in the cytoplasmic domain of the chimeric receptor and expressed these mutant chimeras in an EPO-responsive erythroleukemia cell line, ELM-I-1. Mutant chimeric receptors retaining either Tyr343 or Tyr401 could activate STAT5, judged by tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT5 and induction of CIS, a target gene of STAT5. These mutants were able to induce erythroid differentiation. However, a chimeric receptor containing both Y343F and Y401F mutations could not activate STAT5 nor induce erythroid differentiation. Thus, Tyr343 or Tyr401 of the EPO receptor are independently necessary for erythroid differentiation as well as STAT5 activation. Moreover, exogenous expression of dominant-negative STAT5 suppressed EPO-dependent erythroid differentiation. These findings suggest that STAT5 plays an important role in erythroid differentiation through the EPO receptor cytoplasmic domain."

Hypotonic solutions caused an increase in the number of amperometric spikes evoked by brief exposure to 5 mM Ba2+. Under moderate hypertonic conditions (630 mosM), individual vesicular events were decreased in frequency, and lower amounts were secreted per event. Furthermore, the events were temporally broadened relative to those observed during release in isotonic conditions. At 970 mosM, exposure to 5 mM Ba2+ evoked even smaller secretory events that resemble the prespike feature that has been attributed to the initial opening of the fusion pore. The lack of large spikes is not due to failure of Ba2+ entry because fura-2 fluorescence reveals an increase in intracellular divalent ions. After exposure to Ba2+ in hypertonic solution, spikes could be induced with isotonic solution transiently directed onto the cell, but this process was not accompanied by a change in the concentration of intracellular divalent ions.

Secretory vesicles in chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla sequester a remarkably high concentration of molecules. The major component, catecholamines, is present at a concentration of 550 mM, but the other vesicular constituents such as ATP (122 mM), Ca2+ (17-30 mM), Mg2+ (5 mM), ascorbate (22 mM), and the acidic protein chromogranin A are also present at high concentrations (1Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the total soluble concentration of intravesicular components is more than 750 mM, it has long been of interest how these vesicles are able to form stable entities that are isotonic with 300 mosM solutions. It seems from nuclear magnetic resonance studies of intact vesicles that the contents form a dynamic viscous solution that is stabilized by ternary complex formation (2Daniels A.J. Williams R.J.P. Wright P.E. Neuroscience. 1978; 3: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Solution studies have revealed that catecholamines and ATP associate, resulting in a lowered osmotic pressure (3Kopell W.N. Westhead E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5707-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, chromogranin A may play an important role in lowering osmolarity through interactions with Ca2+ and catecholamines (4Helle K.B. Reed R.K. Pihl K.E. Serck-Hanssen G. Acta Physiol.

Whereas intravesicular association stabilizes vesicular storage, upon exocytosis the vesicular contents must dissociate to be extruded from the cell in their soluble form.

Neuroscience. 1984; 12: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as reviewed by Holz (1Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of release in hypertonic media seems to be due to a direct effect on the exocytotic process because Ca2+ entry is not inhibited (10Hampton R.Y. Holz R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of altered osmolarity are reversible, implying that cell function is not greatly perturbed. Such observations led to the chemiosmotic hypothesis for exocytosis, which proposed that swelling of the secretory vesicles provides the driving force for the fusion of the vesicular and cellular membranes (15Baker P.F. Knight D.E. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has been rejected because simultaneous optical and whole-cell capacitance measurements at mast cells revealed that fusion with the cell membrane actually precedes vesicular swelling (16Zimmerberg J. Curran M. Cohen F.S. Brodwick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Alterations in the amounts of catecholamine released from populations of cells or intact glands by extracellular solutions of different osmolarities could be due either to an alteration in exocytotic efficiency, i.e. an altered exocytotic frequency, or to an alteration of the amount secreted per exocytotic event. Indeed, an increased osmotic gradient between the cell interior and exterior promotes Ca2+ entry (17Wakade A.R. Malhotra R.K. Sharma T.R. Wakade T.D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), promoting increased frequency of exocytotic events (18Moser T. Chow R.H. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 431: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate the other possibility, we have examined the effects of osmotic pressure on catecholamine secretion at bovine adrenal medullary cells with amperometry with carbon fiber microelectrodes, a technique that allows individual exocytotic events to be observed (19Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Lesczyszyn D.J. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Near J.A. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Recent observations of individual vesicle extrusion events made with this approach with a high osmotic gradient have already shown that the degree of association of vesicle contents affects their release (20Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here, we test the hypothesis that extrusion of the vesicular contents can be inhibited by removal of the osmotic gradient. Normally, individual secretory events have a duration of several milliseconds (21Wightman R.M. Schroeder T.J. Finnegan J.M. Ciolkowski E.L. Pihel K. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Walker A. Glavinovic M.I. Trifaro J.-M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Factors such as external pH (23Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Monck J.R.

Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have been shown to alter the time course of release. The results presented here show that decreasing the osmotic gradient not only alters the frequency of exocytotic events but also alters the quantity and time course of release during each event. Furthermore, our results show that elevation of intracellular divalent ions, the major trigger for exocytosis, can be temporally dissociated from the extrusion of the vesicular contents in very hypertonic media. Bovine adrenal medullary cells, enriched in epinephrine using a single-step Renografin gradient (27Moro M.A. López M.G. Gandía L. Michelena P. García A.G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), were prepared from fresh tissue as described previously (28Leszczyszyn D.J. Jankowski J.A. Viveros O.H. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Near J.A. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14736-14737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 12-mm-diameter glass coverslips (Carolina Biological Supply, Burlington, NC) contained in 35-mm-diameter culture dishes (Falcon 3001; Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density of 6 × 105 cells/plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5+ CO2 environment and used at room temperature between 2 and 5 days of culture. Carbon fiber microelectrodes for the detection of catecholamine release were prepared as described by Kawagoe et al. (29Kawagoe K.T. Zimmerman J.B. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) using 5-μm-radius carbon fibers (Thornel P-55; Amoco Corp., Greenville, SC). A commercial patch-clamp instrument (Axopatch 200B; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for amperometry. The instrument was operated in voltage clamp mode in the whole-cell (β = 1) configuration with a command potential of +0.650 V applied versus a locally constructed sodium-saturated calomel reference electrode. Electrodes were backfilled with 4 M NaCl and connected to the headstage input using a patch pipette holder with chlorided silver wire. The noise of this system is one-twentieth of that used in all of our prior work (30Cahill P.S. Walker Q.D. Finnegan J.M. Mickelson G.E. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3180-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Electrodes were calibrated with a flow-injection apparatus using 50 μM epinephrine. Glass coverslips with adhering adrenal medullary cells were washed in isotonic (315 mosM) Krebs buffer (see Table I). To obtain rapid changes in the osmolarity of the media bathing the cells, the coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 35; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Buffer was perfused at 2–5 ml/min, and new solutions were introduced with a valve placed close to the chamber. Amperometric measurements were performed with the carbon fiber microelectrode gently touching the cell membrane. Cells were stimulated to release by pressure ejection (Picospritzer; General Valve Corp., Fairfield, NJ) of 5 mM Ba2+ for 5 s from a micropipette placed 25–30 μm away from the cell. Barium was used as a secretagogue because it does not require receptor activation or membrane depolarization, processes that can be affected by osmotic changes (31Rüden L.V. García A.G. López M.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Table IComposition and osmolarities of experimental solutions in which the amount of NaCl or sucrose was alteredExtracellular solutionCompositionaOsmolarityIsotonic150 NaCl, 5KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES315Hypotonic86 NaCl, 5KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES200Hypertonic I332 NaCl, 5KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES630Hypertonic II386 NaCl, 5KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES750Hypertonic III522 NaCl, 5KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES970Hypertonic IV435 sucrose, 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES850 Open table in a new tab Amperometric signals were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz (4-pole Bessel filter on Axopatch 200B) and recorded on 0.5-inch videotape (PCM-2 A/D VCR Adapter; Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY). During analysis, current records were replayed through a 400-Hz low-pass filter and digitized to an IBM compatible personal computer at 1 ms/point (Cyberamp 320 and Axotape; Axon). Exocytotic events were located with locally written software, and the areas of individual current spikes (Q), their amplitudes (imax), and their widths at half-height (t1/2) 1The abbreviation used is:t1/2width at half-height. were determined as described previously (32Schroeder T.J. Jankowski J.A. Kawagoe K.T. Wightman R.M. Lefrou C. Amatore C. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 3077-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For evaluation of Q changes the quantity Q1/3, which has a Gaussian distribution, was computed for each spike (33Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Cahill P.S. Huang L. Zerby S.E. Ewing A.G. Kennedy R.T. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). width at half-height. The fluorescent probe fura-2 was used as described elsewhere (34Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5353-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar–35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, adrenal medullary cells were incubated in Krebs buffer containing 1 μM fura-2/AM (stock solution dissolved in 20+ Pluronic F-127 in Me2SO) and 0.1+ bovine serum albumin for 30–40 min at room temperature. After loading, the cell plates were rinsed twice and refilled with the desired Krebs-Ringer buffer. The specimens were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm through a 40× oil-immersion objective (Zeiss). The results were corrected for electrode autofluorescence and reflectance (34Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5353-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ratio of corrected fluorescence values (F340/F380) provided an estimate of concentration changes of intracellular divalent ions. This estimate can be due to changes in Ba2+ or Ca2+, and no attempts were made to distinguish between these two species. The culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium, was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Collagenase (Type I) for digestion of gland tissue was obtained from Worthington Biochemical. Renografin-60 was obtained from Squibb Diagnostics. Fura-2/AM, fura-2-free acid, and Pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, and reagent-grade salts were dissolved with doubly distilled water to make solutions. Isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions were prepared as described in Table I. With all bath and pipette solutions, the pH was adjusted to 7.40 with concentrated NaOH. Hypertonic solutions were made by addition of NaCl or sucrose to achieve the desired osmolarity. Solution osmolarities were checked with a freezing point depression osmometer (Osmette A; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, MA). For solutions with no Ca2+, CaCl2 was omitted with no MgCl2 or calcium chelators added. The phase-contrast micrographs in Fig. 1 show the effect of different osmotic pressures on adrenal medullary cells. These experiments were conducted in a manner similar to the method used for vesicular release studies: cells were incubated in isotonic solution for 10 min, the perfusion buffer was changed to the osmotic solution of interest for another 10 min, and finally, isotonic conditions were restored. The micrographs shown were taken 2 min after solution changes. Low osmotic strength (200 mosM), obtained by NaCl reduction (hypotonic, Table I), caused a rapid increase in cell volume. This change was immediately reversed upon return to isotonic conditions. In contrast, increased osmolarity (450-1000 mosM) caused cell shrinkage to occur. The changes seemed to be reversible except at 1000 mosM, at which some cells exhibited permanent alterations in their cytoplasmic appearance upon return to isotonic conditions. Fig. 2 shows the effect of decreased and increased osmotic pressure on catecholamine release. In isotonic buffer before a solution change, secretion lasting several minutes was elicited by pressure ejection for 5 s of a 5 mM Ba2+ solution. This result was obtained in Ca2+-free solutions (Fig. 2, A and D) and also in solutions containing Ca2+, as we have previously reported (26Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The current spikes observed correspond to the exocytotic release of catecholamines from individual vesicles (19Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Lesczyszyn D.J. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Near J.A. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). When the osmolarity of the bathing media was decreased to 200 mosM (hypotonic, Table I), reexposure to Ba2+ in the absence of Ca2+ caused secretory spikes that were more frequent and of increased amplitude (Fig. 2B). When Ca2+ was present, low osmotic pressure caused spontaneous release (data not shown), as previously observed (18Moser T. Chow R.H. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 431: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When the cell was returned to isotonic medium, Ba2+-induced spikes were similar (but not identical; Ref. 20Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to those obtained before exposure to the decreased osmolarity (Fig. 2C). In contrast, Ba2+-induced secretion decreased in frequency and amplitude as the osmolarity was increased. Results from a single cell in Ca2+-free media are shown in Fig. 2D-F, in which a cell originally in an isotonic medium was placed in a 750 mosM solution (hypertonic II, Table I). Similar effects were obtained when the osmolarity was elevated by adding sucrose instead of NaCl (Fig. 3) or with high-osmolarity media containing Ca2+ (data not shown). Upon a return to isotonic conditions (Figs. 2F and 3C), every cell secreted similarly as before the osmotic change. The effects of increased osmolarity were studied in detail at 630 mosM (hypertonic I, Table I). Each observed spike was characterized with respect to its average charge (Q), t1/2, and maximal amplitude (imax). The mean characteristics from a single cell are summarized in Table II and show a significant increase in t1/2 and a significant decrease in imax. A histogram of t1/2 values (Fig. 4A) reveals a broader distribution and a greater proportion of wider spikes under hypertonic conditions. In addition, the data show a small but significant decrease in Q (Fig. 4B) for secretion in the medium of higher osmolarity. In each of four cells examined in this way, t1/2 increased significantly, and imax decreased significantly in response to the change from 315 to 630 mosM. In three of the four cells, a statistically significant decrease in Q was observed.Table II.Mean spike characteristics measured at a single adrenal medullary cell in isotonic (315 mosM) and moderately hypertonic (630 mosM) extracellular solutionsOsmolarity (mosM)Q (pC)t1/2 (ms)Imax (pA)Spike frequency (Hz)3152.26 ± 0.1416.4 ± 0.8170 ± 102.10a504 current spikes over 240 s.6301.62 ± 0.15bMeans are significantly different (p ≦ 0.01).46.8 ± 4.4bMeans are significantly different (p ≦ 0.01).77 ± 11bMeans are significantly different (p ≦ 0.01).0.48c218 current spikes over 450 s.a 504 current spikes over 240 s.b Means are significantly different (p ≦ 0.01).c 218 current spikes over 450 s. Open table in a new tab Spikes were initially induced with Ba2+ in isotonic medium, and then the cells were exposed to solutions with an osmolarity of 970 mosM (Fig. 5A; hypertonic III, Table I). Spikes evoked by Ba2+ were virtually abolished in both the absence (Fig. 5A) and presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6A). However, in both cases exposure to Ba2+ evoked small current fluctuations (Fig. 5B, upper; Fig. 6B, upper) of similar amplitude to the prespike features or feet that precede some secretory events in isotonic media (21Wightman R.M. Schroeder T.J. Finnegan J.M. Ciolkowski E.L. Pihel K. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Chow R.H. von Rüden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Such an event is shown in expanded form in Fig. 5A (lower inset). Because the amplifier noise in the measurements reported here is lower than that in our previous work, we were also able to observe similar amperometric fluctuations among the spikes that occurred during evoked secretion in isotonic media (Fig. 5A, upper inset). Such events have been described as flickering feet that lack accompanying spikes (37Zhou Z. Misler S. Chow R.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1543-1552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similar small changes in amperometric current after exposure to Ba2+ were also observed in hypertonic media prepared with sucrose as the primary osmolyte (hypertonic IV, Table I).Fig. 6Role of Ca2+ in isotonically induced secretion under hypertonic conditions. A, isotonic-induced release after Ba2+ stimulation under hypertonic (970 mosM) conditions in the presence of 2 mM external Ca2+.

Ratios were collected at 240 ms/point, and a three-point moving average was applied.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the cells were returned to an isotonic medium that was Ca2+-free, the base line remained unchanged. However, a change from hypertonic medium with Ca2+ to isotonic medium with Ca2+ induced massive secretion that began about 1 min after the medium change and continued for many minutes (data not shown). Consistent with results obtained by Wakade et al. (17Wakade A.R. Malhotra R.K. Sharma T.R. Wakade T.D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with perfused adrenal glands, this phenomenon was only found to occur in the presence of external Ca2+. Both with and without Ca2+, subsequent exposure to Ba2+ induced secretion in every case, but occasionally release was of lower frequency than before exposure to the very hypertonic medium. Although cells exposed to Ba2+ showed few spikes in very hypertonic media, it was found that a 15-s pressure ejection of isotonic solution onto the cells could evoke frequent spikes (Fig. 5B). In these experiments, a three-barrel ejection pipette was used containing isotonic buffer, 5 mM BaCl2 in isotonic buffer, and 5 mM BaCl2 in hypertonic buffer. Catecholamine release from single cells was first measured in isotonic solution, in which exposure to 5 mM isotonic Ba2+ induced release for several minutes. As expected, pressure ejection of isotonic buffer onto cells bathed in isotonic buffer did not cause amperometric current fluctuations. After exposure of the same cell to Ba2+ in a medium of 970 mosM and observation of the small current events, the cell was exposed to isotonic buffer. During the pressure ejection the spikes increased in frequency and reached a maximum at the end of the pressure ejection period (n = 15 cells). Similar results were obtained in the presence and absence of external Ca2+. Interestingly, spikes obtained from isotonic application in Ca2+-free hypertonic buffer were somewhat smaller in amplitude (Fig. 6, A and B; note the difference in the current scales). The role of intracellular divalent ions in these processes in hypertonic solutions (n = 6 cells) was examined with the fluorescent probe fura-2 (35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). During application of Ba2+ in hypertonic media (970 mosM), fura-2 ratio measurements indicated an influx of divalent cations (note that fura-2 complexes both Ba2+ and Ca2+). Similar to previous results under isotonic conditions (26Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Rüden L.V. García A.G. López M.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this response was obtained in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6, C and D, respectively). The increase was immediate and sustained for several minutes and occurred during the time interval in which the small current features were observed in the amperometric recordings. The subsequent pressure ejection of isotonic buffer onto these cells was not accompanied by a significant change in the fluorescent ratio. In some cells (i.e. Fig. 6C) small changes in the ratio were observed. However, inspection of the fluorescent recordings at the individual wavelengths showed that this was due to small differences that occurred in the decrease in fluorescence at both wavelengths. The decrease is due to a transient dye dilution as a result of cell expansion during exposure to the isotonic solution followed by its subsequent contraction. Adrenal medullary cells respond as osmometers (10Hampton R.Y. Holz R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that swell in hypotonic solutions and shrink in hypertonic media (Fig. 1). Despite the changes in cell volume, cells continue to secrete over a broad range of osmotic strengths. Prior results have demonstrated that under extreme hypertonic conditions, catecholamine secretion from adrenal medullary cells can be inhibited (9Knight D.E. Baker P.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 68: 107-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 10Hampton R.Y. Holz R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Pollard H.B. Pazoles C.J.

The results of the present study with amperometry support these findings and provide new insight into the origin by examining this effect at the level of individual vesicular events. The results show that the external osmolarity can have a dramatic effect on the time course of extrusion of the vesicular contents: in hypotonic solutions extrusion from the vesicles is more rapid than in isotonic medium (20Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas hypertonic solutions slow the extrusion process until it virtually ceases at very high osmolarity. It has long been recognized that the high concentration of catecholamines and other intravesicular components in adrenal medullary cells requires some form of internal association to reduce osmotic forces (3Kopell W.N. Westhead E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5707-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Winkler H. Smith A.D. Blaschko A. Sayers G. Smith A.D. Handbook of Physiology, Endocrinology VI. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1975: 321-339Google Scholar). Experiments with amperometric detection of catecholamine secretion from individual vesicles show that the extrusion process is temporally prolonged even in isotonic medium (19Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Lesczyszyn D.J. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Near J.A. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 64: 3077-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), consistent with a finite time required for dissociation of the intravesicular components (21Wightman R.M. Schroeder T.J. Finnegan J.M. Ciolkowski E.L. Pihel K. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Even at 37 °C the mean half-width of secretory events exceeds 4 ms (25Pihel K. Travis E.R. Borges R. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1633-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The secretory spikes are found to change in shape with the pH and ionic composition of the extracellular media. Acidification of the external media to a pH of 5.5 makes extrusion of the vesicle contents more difficult (23Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas spikes induced by Ba2+ are broader and shorter in the absence of external Ca2+ (26Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Exposure of adrenal medullary cells to extracellular Zn2+, an ion that can further cross-link the vesicle contents, lowers the quantity of catecholamine released during secretory events (25Pihel K.

The findings reported here, that a lowered osmotic gradient between the vesicle contents and the extracellular fluid also increases the time course of vesicular dissociation, are consistent with prior conclusions that the mechanism of storage of the vesicle contents is manifested in the kinetics of individual secretory events. Thus, the osmotic gradient present in isotonic medium immediately after cell-vesicle fusion promotes water entry through the fusion pore into the vesicular matrix, where it elicits the dissolution of the intravesicular contents (39Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because secretion characteristics can vary from cell to cell, we minimized this effect by allowing each cell to serve as its own control. With the exception of the most hypertonic solutions, the osmotic changes did not permanently alter the cells because secretion was similar before and after osmotic stress. Furthermore, the observed changes are a direct consequence of solution osmolarity because similar results were obtained with NaCl and sucrose media. We used Ba2+ as a secretagogue rather than one that interacts with cell receptors to avoid possible altered affinities of receptor states. In solutions of intermediate hyperosmolarity (630 mosM) the spike frequency is reduced as well as the amount released in each spike. It is likely that the decreased amounts of secretion seen from populations of cells (1Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are due to the lower spike frequency because it is decreased to a greater degree. However, at osmolarities comparable to the osmolarity calculated for the unassociated contents of the vesicles, spikes are virtually eliminated. Because occurrence of spikes only provides information on the last stage of exocytosis, the extrusion of the vesicle contents, we can only conclude that secretion has been arrested but cannot evaluate whether it is arrested at this stage or at a prior one. However, it seems that the extrusion process is the stage in a single exocytotic event that is the most sensitive to external solution osmolarity because cell-vesicle fusion is not inhibited by high osmolarity (16Zimmerberg J. Curran M. Cohen F.S. Brodwick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most vesicular expansion seems to occur only after granule fusion (40Terakawa S. Manivannan S. Kumakura K. J. Physiol. 1993; 87: 209-213Google Scholar), although a small enlargement may occur before fusion (41Ornberg R.L. Furuya S. Goping G. Kuijpers G.A.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 279: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, capacitance measurements in mast cells show that the time course of vesicle-cell fusion is little affected by the external solution osmolarity, even though the vesicular size is a function of external osmolarity (42Brodwick M.S. Curran M. Edwards C. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In sufficiently hypertonic solutions, amperometric spikes are rarely observed upon exposure to Ba2+, but small secretory events that resemble the prespike feature can be observed. The prespike feature, found before many secretory spikes in isotonic solution, has been attributed to catecholamine flux through the fusion pore formed in the initial stages of adrenal medullary cell-vesicle fusion (20Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36Chow R.H. von Rüden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). As recently reported, these states can be observed without spikes and often flicker as would be expected for flux through a pore of fluctuating diameter (37Zhou Z. Misler S. Chow R.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1543-1552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In very hypertonic medium, in which fura-2 measurements show that Ba2+ entry into the cell still occurs, these features persist without spikes, suggesting that cell-vesicle fusion has occurred without subsequent extrusion of the cell contents. In other words, the absence of an osmotic gradient seems to have frozen the exocytotic process in a transient state that prevents secretion. This transient state has been observed in mast cells (24Monck J.R. Oberhauser A.F. Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernández J.M. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 39-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and it appears under conditions in which partial secretory events (43Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernández-Chacón R. Fernández J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) can be observed. Thus, by analogy, the intermediate state consists of a docked vesicle with a fusion pore open to the external media that releases a small portion of its contents without full dissolution of the entire contents from the granule matrix. To test this hypothesis, we transiently exposed cells containing internal Ba2+ in hypertonic solution to isotonic solution to restore the normal osmotic gradient between the vesicle contents and the solution. Transient restoration of an osmotic gradient caused a series of secretory spikes that are consistent with the hypothesis that fused vesicles with their contents intact are present at the cell surface. This effect was obtained with or without Ca2+ in solution, and in both cases the occurrence of spikes was not accompanied by a change in the internal concentration of divalent ions. However, the data suggest that ionic effects as well as osmotic effects are important for complete extrusion of the vesicle contents. This is evidenced by the fact that the presence of Ca2+ in the external medium leads to spikes induced by isotonic solution that are of increased amplitude. This result is entirely consistent with our previous finding in isotonic medium that Ba2+-induced spikes are of greater amplitude in Ca2+-containing solutions (26Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It seems that hydrated Ca2+ can promote more rapid dissolution of the vesicle contents. Catecholamine release upon complete restoration of isotonic conditions after hypertonic treatment from hypertonic to isotonic conditions causes an increase in the rate of opening of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (17Wakade A.R. Malhotra R.K. Sharma T.R. Wakade T.D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Moser T. Chow R.H. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 431: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our results with transient isotonic exposure differ in that secretion is not accompanied by an increase in internal Ca2+ or Ba2+. Indeed, these results represent the first time that entry of divalent cations and exocytotic secretion have been separated on a time scale of several minutes. Taken together with previous findings, the results of this study clearly show that the associated state of the vesicle contents manifests itself during the extrusion of the vesicle contents after vesicle-cell fusion in adrenal medullary cells. In mast cells, in which the intravesicular association has significant ionic character (44Uvnäs B. Åborg C.-H. News Physiol. Sci. 1989; 4: 68-71Google Scholar), this has been quite clearly demonstrated because the vesicles are large enough for visual observation. Swelling of mast cell matrices increases ionic conductivity and allows the contents to be released (45Nanavati C. Fernandez J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 963-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our findings in this work show that an osmotic gradient that could swell the vesicle contents is required to obtain fully developed secretory spikes at adrenal medullary cells. Although pH and ionic gradients clearly must also play a role in dissociating the vesicle contents, the ease of manipulating osmolarity, coupled to the fact that it does not inhibit vesicle-cell fusion, makes this a particularly useful parameter to separate the individual stages during an exocytotic event. In addition, experiments with sucrose as the primary osmolyte clearly demonstrate that an ionic gradient is not sufficient to cause dissociation of the vesicle contents. The temporal separation of entry of divalent cations and secretion provides the opportunity to further investigate the individual steps in the complex phenomenon of exocytosis. The aid of Timothy J. Schroeder and Jennifer M. Finnegan in this work is gratefully acknowledged."

Analysis of the patterns of nonspecific alcoholysis obtained from chimeras between HIV-1 and visna virus integrases also implicates the core region in selecting target sites (33Katzman M. Sudol M. J.

In the present study, we prepared chimeric proteins between HIV-1 and FIV integrase to identify domains responsible for target site selection. FIV is a lentivirus with a complex genomic organization resembling that of primate lentiviruses (35Talbott R.L. Sparger E.E. Lovelace K.M. Fitch W.M. Pedersen N.C. Luciw P.A. Elder J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5743-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of FIV integrase is 37% identical to that of HIV integrase, and mutational analysis of FIV integrase showed that its enzymatic activities and domain organization are similar to that of HIV-1 integrase (Fig. 1).2 Since the integrases of HIV-1 and FIV produce different integration patterns and thus may possess different target site determinants,2 analysis of integration patterns of chimeras between HIV-1 and FIV integrases represents a useful strategy of mapping integrase domains involved in target site selection. Comparison of the patterns of 3′-end joining of the various chimeras indicates that the central core domains of both HIV-1 and FIV integrases contain the determinants for target site selection. The C terminus, although it binds DNA nonspecifically, is not involved in target site selection. Wild-type and deletion mutants of HIV-1 and FIV integrases were purified as described previously (34Goulaouic H. Chow S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 A rabbit antipeptide antiserum to FIV integrase was obtained from Dr. John H. Elder at the Scripps Research Institute. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs; AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer; modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0) and exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Deoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]TTP were obtained from Amersham at a specific activity of 6,000 Ci/mmol. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc., and were purified by electrophoresis through a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel before use. HIV/FIV chimeric integrases were prepared by constructing plasmids encoding the chimeric integrase genes. The chimeras H/H/F and F/F/H, which contained a swap at the C terminus, were prepared by exchanging the AvaII-HindIII DNA fragment between pT7-7/H-IN, which encodes HIV-1 integrase, and pT7-7/F-IN, which encodes FIV integrase (34Goulaouic H. Chow S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 The chimeras containing a swap at the N terminus, H/F/F and F/H/H, were prepared by performing two sequential polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). For H/F/F, in the first PCR, pT7-7/H-IN was used as the template. The 5′-primer was H5′N (5′-GAAGGAGATATATTTTTAGATGGA-3′) that contains an NdeI site (underlined) and anneals to the N terminus of HIV-1 integrase. The 3′-primer was H48F (5′-TTCAATTGTCCTCCCACTTGTTCCCCTTTTAGCTGACATT-3′), and it contains DNA sequences derived from HIV-1 (roman type) and FIV (italic type) integrases. The PCR product was purified by a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen) and was used as the 5′-primer in a second PCR, which included pT7-7/F-IN as the template and F3′B (5′-GGTCACTTACTCATCCCCTTCAGG-3′) as the 3′-primer. F3′B contains a BamHI site (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface type), and it anneals to the C terminus of FIV integrase. A similar strategy was used to prepare the chimera F/H/H using F5′N (5′-CCAGTGTCCTCTTGGGTTGACAGA-3′) and F51H (5′-TCTACTTGTCCATGCATGGCTTCTCCTATGATTCTGCATA-3′) as the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, in the first PCR. The 3′-primer for the second PCR was H3′H (5′-GCTAGATTAATCCTCATCCTGTCTACT-3′), containing a HindIII site (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface type). The chimeras containing a swap of the central core domain, H/F/H and F/H/F, were also prepared using the method of two sequential PCRs. The first PCRs were identical to those described previously for H/F/F and F/H/H. For H/F/H, the template and the 3′-primer for the second PCR were the F/F/H DNA and H3′H, respectively. For F/H/F, the template and the 3′-primer for the second PCR were the H/H/F DNA and F3′B, respectively. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI or NdeI and HindIII, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated to pT7-7(His) plasmid DNA, previously cut with NdeI and BamHI or NdeI and HindIII. The plasmid pT7-7(His) is derived from pT7-7, a T7 RNA polymerase promoter system (36Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting plasmids were cleaved with NdeI, and a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TATCGTTCCGCGTGGATC-3′ and 5′-TAGATCCACGCGGAACGA-3′) encoding a peptide with a thrombin cleavage site was inserted. These manipulations resulted in the attachment of 15 amino acid residues (MHHHHHHHIVPRGSM) at the N terminus of the integrase coding sequence. The sequences of all of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments were verified by restriction analysis and the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Sequencing reactions were carried out with a modified T7 DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's specification. The DNA constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The cells were grown at 35 °C in 4 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg of ampicillin/ml. At an optical density of 0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 0.3 mM for expression induction, and the culture was grown for an additional 5 h. After harvesting, the cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C. The frozen bacterial pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant, after dialysis against buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), was incubated on ice for 2 h with 2.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed five times with 10 ml of buffer A plus 50 mM imidazole and then packed in a column. The protein was eluted in a total volume of 20 or 30 ml with a linear gradient from buffer A plus 50 mM imidazole to buffer A plus 500 mM imidazole. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10 mM CHAPS. To remove the His tag, the isolated protein was incubated in buffer C with bovine thrombin (Sigma; 25 National Institutes of Health units/mg of integrase) at 30 °C for 4 h. The sample (1 mg) was then diluted with 10 volumes of buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, and 10 mM CHAPS) before loading onto a column containing 2 ml of SP-Sepharose (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer D plus 60 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted in a total volume of 40 ml with a linear gradient from buffer D plus 60 mM NaCl to buffer D plus 800 mM NaCl. The fractions containing the desired protein were pooled, concentrated on a Centricon-10 column (Amicon), and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, and 10 mM CHAPS). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The 3′-end processing, 3′-end joining, and disintegration activities of the chimeric proteins were assayed as described previously (37Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides (Operon Technologies, Inc.) were used as DNA substrates (boldface letters denote the invariant CA/TG dinucleotide pair): H-U5V1-2, 5′-ATGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA; H-U5V2, 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAT; H-U5V1L-2, 5′-CCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA; H-U5V2L; 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAGG; H-V1/T2, 5′-ATGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGGCTGCAGGTCGAC; F-U5V1-2, 5′-CCGGGCCGAGAACTTCGCA; F-U5V2; 5′-ACTGCGAAGTTCTCGGCCCGG; F-V1/T2, 5′-CCGGGCCGAGAACTTCGCAGGCTGCAGGTCGAC; T1, 5′-CAGCAACGCAAGCTTG; T3, 5′-GTCGACCTGCAGCCCAAGCTTGCGTTGCTG; T5, 5′-CGACGCGTGCTAGGCCTG; T6, 5′-ACAGGCCTAGCACGCGTCG. The oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis through a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The substrates used to assay the 3′-end processing activity of wild-type and chimeric integrases were double-stranded oligonucleotides containing sequences derived from the U5 end of the HIV-1 (H-U5V1-2/H-U5V2) or FIV (F-U5V1-2/F-U5V2) long terminal repeat terminus. The substrate was prepared by annealing the H- and F-U5V1-2 strands with their complementary oligonucleotides H- and F-U5V2, respectively. The substrate was singly labeled at the 3′-end of the H- and F-U5V1-2 strands using exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, dGTP and [α-32P]TTP (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 3′-end joining activity was measured using a modified assay that uses separate oligonucleotides as the donor and target substrates (38Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Leavitt A.D. Rose R.B. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2359-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The donor substrate, prepared by annealing H-U5V1-2 strand with H-U5V2 strand or annealing F-U5V1-2 with F-U5V2, resembles the viral U5 end after 3′-end processing. The target DNA was prepared by annealing T5 and T6 and was singly labeled at the 3′-end of the T5 strand using exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]TTP. The HIV-1 disintegration substrate (Y-oligomer) was prepared by annealing the labeled T1 strand with oligonucleotides T3, H-V1/T2, and H-U5V2 (8Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), whereas the FIV Y-oligomer was prepared by annealing the labeled T1 strand with oligonucleotides T3, F-V1/T2, and F-U5V2. The T1 strand was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The annealed Y-oligomers were purified on a 15% native polyacrylamide gel. The substrate for nonspecific alcoholysis, prepared by annealing T5 and T6 strands, was identical to the labeled target DNA described earlier in the 3′-end joining assay. In all assays, unless indicated otherwise, 0.1 pmol of the labeled DNA was incubated with integrase for 60 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2, 30 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.01 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM CHAPS, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The reaction volume was typically 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.0 μl of 0.2 M EDTA, pH 8.0. The reaction products were mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and heated at 90 °C for 3 min before analysis by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels with 7 M urea in Tris-taurine-EDTA buffer. Alternatively, the reaction products were precipitated and washed with ethanol and resuspended in formamide loading buffer before analysis by electrophoresis on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Quantitation of the products was carried out with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The distribution and frequency of integration at individual DNA sites were measured by a PCR-based assay performed as described previously (29Kitamura Y. Lee Y.M.H. Coffin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5532-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Pryciak P.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 34Goulaouic H. Chow S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The donor DNA substrate was the preprocessed U5 DNA substrate (F-U5V1-2 annealed with F-U5V2, or H-U5V1L-2 annealed with H-U5V2L). The target DNA was the plasmid pBluescript KSII+ (Stratagene). One microgram of plasmid DNA was incubated with the protein on ice for 5 min in the standard reaction buffer plus 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The integration reaction was started by adding 15 nM of preprocessed U5 DNA and incubating the sample at 37 °C. After 60 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 mM EDTA. The sample was extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 10 μg of tRNA, and washed with 70% ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. A 5-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was amplified for 25 or 30 cycles of PCR: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. For analysis of the integration events occurring in the plus strand of the plasmid DNA, the PCR primers used were 0.2 μM unlabeled H-U5V1-2, 0.05 μM 5′-end-labeled H-U5V1-2, and 0.25 μM BS+ (5′-CATTAATGCAGCTGGCACGA-3′; nucleotides 988–969), which is complementary to the plus strand of the plasmid DNA. For analysis of the integration events occurring in the minus strand, the BS+ primer was replaced by the primer BS− (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, nucleotides 625–644), which is complementary to the minus strand of the plasmid DNA. The PCR reaction was performed in a buffer containing a final concentration of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) in a final volume of 20 μl. The labeled PCR products were analyzed on a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Since the patterns of preferred target sites (determined by frequency and distribution of integration events) are different between HIV-1 and FIV integrases (see Fig. 4, Fig. 5),2 one approach to identify the integrase domain responsible for target site selection is through analysis of HIV/FIV chimeric proteins. If the selection of target sites by the wild-type integrase is mediated by a discrete domain, then exchanging that domain between a pair of chimeric proteins should produce a corresponding exchange of integration patterns. We chose to form chimeras between HIV-1 and FIV integrases because the two proteins are related by sequence and size, and they share similar reaction conditions for optimal activities in vitro (35Talbott R.L. Sparger E.E. Lovelace K.M. Fitch W.M. Pedersen N.C. Luciw P.A. Elder J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5743-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 37Vincent K.A. Ellison V.

Swapping these domains between the two integrases produced a total of six chimeric proteins (Fig. 2A). Each chimeric protein is identified by a three-letter code, wherein the first, second, and third letters represent the N-terminal, core, and C-terminal domains, respectively. The source of the domain is indicated by letters F and H, representing FIV and HIV-1 integrases, respectively. The wild-type HIV-1 and FIV integrases and the chimeras were expressed with a short extension at the N terminus that includes seven histidine residues (His tag) and a thrombin cleavage site. Purification by nickel-chelating affinity chromatography and the subsequent removal of the His tag by cleavage with thrombin produce proteins containing at their N termini three extra residues: glycine, serine, and methionine. Removal of the His tag is critical because, as shown previously, the tag alters the pattern of target site usage.2 The apparent molecular masses of wild-type and chimeric integrases determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were consistent with those predicted by the amino acid sequences (Fig. 2B). Wild-type FIV integrase and several chimeric proteins that contained the core region of FIV integrase, such as H/F/H, F/F/H, and H/F/H, showed prominent products of about 68 kDa in size (Fig. 2B) that reacted positively with an antipeptide antiserum to FIV integrase by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Based on their sizes and reactivity to anti-integrase antibody, the slowly migrating products were presumably dimers of the respective proteins. The activities of all six chimeric proteins were analyzed in vitro using oligonucleotide-based assays (Fig. 3), and the results are summarized in Table I. All chimeric proteins could mediate disintegration, indicating that their catalytic sites were functional. The ability of the proteins to carry out 3′-end processing and 3′-end joining was less than that of the wild-type HIV or FIV integrase. No processing or joining activity was detected with H/H/F or F/H/F using the oligonucleotide-based assay. A weak 3′-end joining activity for both chimeric proteins could be detected using the more sensitive PCR-based assay when a preprocessed viral DNA end was the donor DNA (see Fig. 5).Table ICatalytic activities of chimeric HIV-1/FIV integrases and deletion derivatives of FIV integraseIntegrase derivative3′-End processing3′-End joiningDisintegrationH-IN wild type++++++++F-IN wild type++++++++F/H/H+/−+/−+H/H/F−−+F/H/F−−+/−H/F/F+/−+/−+++F/F/H+++++H/F/H+/−+/−+++F-IN53-281+/−−+++F-IN1-235++/−++F-IN53-235−−+ Open table in a new tab Previous studies have shown that selection of target sites by HIV-1 integrase is dependent on the target DNA and independent of the donor DNA (30Pryciak P.M.

The human alkyltransferase is inactivated by the free base O6-benzylguanine, raising the possibility that substantially larger alkyl groups could also be accepted as substrates. However, the Escherichia coli alkyltransferase, Ada-C, is not inactivated by O6-benzylguanine. The Ada-C protein was rendered capable of reaction by the incorporation of two site-directed mutations converting Ala316 to a proline (A316P) and Trp336 to alanine (W336A) or glycine (W336G). These changes increase the space at the active site of the protein where Cys321 is buried and thus permit access of the O6-benzylguanine inhibitor. Reaction of the mutant A316P/W336A-Ada-C with O6-benzylguanine was greatly stimulated by the presence of DNA, providing strong support for the concept that binding of DNA to the Ada-C protein activates the protein. The Ada-C protein was able to repair O6-benzylguanine in a 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide. However, the rate of repair was very slow, whereas the E. coli Ogt, the human alkyltransferase, and the mutant A316P/W336A-Ada-C alkyltransferases reacted very rapidly with this 16-mer substrate and preferentially repaired it when incubated with a mixture of the methylated and benzylated 16-mers. These results show that benzyl groups are better substrates than methyl groups for alkyltransferases provided that steric factors do not prevent binding of the substrate in the correct orientation for alkyl group transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2063690518,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E2 protein (hE2) binds to four sites present upstream of the P97 promoter and regulates transcription of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes. We have determined the relative binding constants for the interaction of the full-length hE2 protein with these sites. Our results show that hE2 binds tightly to site 4, less tightly to sites 1 and 2, and weakly to site 3. Similar results have previously been obtained using a C-terminal fragment of the hE2 protein suggesting that the C-terminal domain is the sole determinant of DNA binding affinity and specificity. Using circular permutation assays we show that binding of the hE2 protein induces the formation of a significant DNA bend and that the hE2-induced DNA bend angle is the same at both tight and weak hE2-binding sites. An alignment of the four hE2-binding sites from the HPV 16 genome suggests that this protein recognizes an extended binding site when compared with the bovine papillomavirus E2 protein. Here we show that the hE2 protein binds tightly to sites containing an A:T or a G:C base pair at position 7 of its binding site but weakly to sites containing either C:G or T:A at this position.

The recognition of specific DNA sequences by transcription factors is often the first step in the regulation of gene expression. An understanding of how these proteins recognize their target sequences, and the effect that this has on DNA conformation, is central to the question of how genes are controlled. We are studying the human papillomavirus E2 protein, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of viral gene expression and DNA replication. Papillomaviruses infect epithelial cells and induce the formation of benign hyperproliferative lesions or warts. Over 70 distinct types of human papillomavirus (HPV) 1The abbreviations used are: HPVhuman papillomavirusBPVbovine papillomavirusPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferase. have been described. Some of these viral types produce lesions that have the potential to undergo malignant transformation. HPV 16 and HPV 18, for example, are thought to play a primary role in the development of cervical cancer (for a review, see Ref. 1zur Hausen H. Virology. 1991; 184: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The products of the viral E6 and E7 genes form complexes with the cellular tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, respectively. These interactions bring about a change in cell growth rate and promote cell immortalization (reviewed in Ref. 2Mansur C.P. Androphy E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 323-345PubMed Google Scholar). In HPV 16, transcription of the E6 and E7 genes is under the control of a single promoter (P97) that lies immediately upstream of the E6 gene (3Smotkin D. Wettstein F.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The activity of the P97 promoter is regulated by a variety of cellular transcription factors and by the viral E2 protein (4Cripe T.P. Haugen T.H. Turk J.P. Tabatabai F. Schimd P.G. Dürst M.

Much early work concentrated on the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E2 protein. The BPV E2 protein (bE2) binds as a dimer to 12 inverted repeats (consensus sequence 5′-ACCGN4CGGT-3′) present upstream of the BPV early genes and activates transcription (7Spalholz B.A. Yang Y.-C.

A. 1991; 88: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The bE2 protein contains an N-terminal transcription activation domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain separated by a flexible hinge (12McBride A.A. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The structure of the bE2 C-terminal domain bound to a specific DNA sequence has been determined by x-ray crystallography (13Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The two subunits of the bE2 dimer each form half of a β-barrel over which the DNA is bent, allowing the interaction of two α-helices with the exposed edges of the base pairs in two successive major grooves of the DNA. The HPV 16 E2 protein (hE2) and the BPV E2 protein share a high degree of sequence similarity at the protein level. The amino acids involved in the recognition of specific DNA sequences, for example, are conserved between bE2 and hE2; the single exception being a bE2 phenylalanine (Phe-343) that is replaced by a tyrosine in the hE2 protein (Tyr-303). The hE2 protein binds to four sites present upstream of the HPV 16 P97 promoter (14Chong T. Chan W.K. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The precise function of the hE2 protein in the regulation of this promoter is the subject of some controversy. Over-expression of the hE2 protein has been shown to repress the activity of some P97 promoter fragments linked to reporter genes (15Romanczuk H. Thierry F. Howley P.M. J.

This confusion over the role of the hE2 protein is probably brought about by differences in the contribution of each of the four hE2-binding sites toward P97 promoter activity. The organization of the P97 promoter is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. Two hE2-binding sites (separated by only 3 base pairs) are located immediately upstream of the P97 TATA box and are flanked on the 5′ side by a binding site for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. The binding of hE2 (or bE2) to these sites has been shown to block the binding of Sp1 and TBP (the TATA box binding factor) and to repress the promoter activity of DNA fragments carrying these sequences (16Tan S.-H. Gloss B. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Dostatni N. Lambert P.P. Sousa R. Ham J. Howley P.M. Yaniv M.

The two remaining hE2-binding sites are located around 150 and 550 base pairs upstream of the P97 transcription start point. The binding of hE2 to sites in this “enhancer configuration” has been shown to activate transcription from artificial promoter constructs (21Ham J. Steger G. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Ushikai M. Lace M.J. Yamakawa Y. Kono M. Anson J. Ishiji T. Parkkinen S. Wicker N. Valentine M.-E. Davidson I. Turek L.P. Haugen T.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the role of the hE2 protein in the regulation of the P97 promoter it is important to know the relative affinities of the hE2-binding sites present within this promoter and to characterize fully the DNA binding activity of this protein. To this end we have purified the full-length hE2 as a GST fusion protein and determined the relative binding constants of the four hE2-binding sites present in the HPV 16 genome. Using gel retardation assays we show that the DNA bend angle induced by the binding of hE2 is the same at both tight- and weak-binding sites. We also demonstrate that unlike bE2, the hE2 protein binds preferentially to an extended recognition sequence that contains a purine at the −7 position and we use site-directed mutagenesis to show that this specific interaction is mediated by arginine 304 in the hE2 DNA-binding domain. The HPV 16 E2 gene was amplified by PCR from HPV 16 DNA using the oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GACTGGATCCATGGAGACTCTTTGCCAACG-3′ and 5′-GACTGAATTCCATCATATAGACATAAATCCAG-3′. These primers placed BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the hE2 coding sequence, respectively. The PCR product was cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia), creating an in-frame GST-hE2 fusion (pGEX-hE2). The R304A mutation of hE2 was made by PCR. The primers 5′-GCTTTTTAAATATATCTTAAAC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGCAAGCCACGTTTGG-3′ bind to hE2 and pGEX sequences, respectively, and were used to amplify the 5′ end of the hE2 gene. In a separate reaction, the primers 5′-GTTTAAGATATATTTAAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCACGGTACGGCCG-3′, which also bind to hE2 and pGEX sequences, respectively, were used to amplify the 3′ end of the hE2 gene. The underlined bases mismatch the hE2 sequence and introduce the R304A mutation. The 5′ end and 3′ end PCR products were purified from agarose gels, mixed, and re-amplified using the pGEX-specific primers. This generated a full-length hE2 gene containing the R304A mutation. This PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into pGEX-2T as described above. The resulting pGEX-hE2 and pGEX-hE2 R304A plasmids were sequenced using a panel of E2-specific sequencing primers to check for the occurrence of any point mutations generated by the Taq polymerase. Escherichia coli XL-1 blue cells containing either pGEX-hE2 or pGEX-hE2 R304A were grown at 37 °C in Terrific broth supplemented with 0.01% ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.5. Fusion protein expression was then induced by the addition of 0.15 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and the cells were grown at 28 °C overnight. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated at 4 °C. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) then incubated with 0.1% DNase I for 30 min at 4 °C. After re-centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and then equilibrated in buffer 1 (50 mM triethanolamine buffer, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5). The column was then washed with 20 column volumes of 5 mM ATP in buffer 1 to remove co-purifying GroEL (Cpn 60). After re-equilibration in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, the fusion proteins were eluted using 50 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C, then stored in 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl at −70 °C. Circular dichroism spectra of the wild type GST-E2 and R304A GST-E2 proteins (0.2 mg/ml in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.9) were obtained using a JY CD6 CD spectrometer with 2-mm path length cells. Spectra were collected at 1-nm increments, using a 20-s integration time. Single stranded oligonucleotides (100 ng) were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. After annealing to the complementary oligonucleotide, free label was removed using Sephadex G-50 columns (Stratagene). Labeled oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm) were incubated with purified proteins (in the quantities indicated in the Figures) in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg μl−1 bovine serum albumin, 80 ng μl−1 poly[d(I·C)]. After 20 min at 20 °C the complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run in 0.5 × TBE, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Nonspecific competitor DNA was omitted from gel retardation assays involving the GST-hE2 R304A protein. The oligonucleotides shown below carry hE2-binding sites 3 and 4, respectively, and were cloned into pBend3 (26Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) between the XbaI and SalI restriction sites. Recombinant clones were digested with the restriction enzymes BglII, XhoI, SmaI, KpnI, and BamHI to generate a series of fragments in which the position of the E2-binding site varies evenly from one end of the fragment to the other (shown in Fig. 4a). These fragments were dephosphorylated using calf alkaline phosphatase then 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated label was removed using Sephadex G-50 columns (Stratagene) and the labeled oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm) were incubated with purified GST-hE2 in the binding buffer described above. Free and bound DNA was resolved and visualized as described in the previous section. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and the DNA bend angle (α) was calculated using the empirical relationship, where μm equals the mobility of the complex with hE2 bound in the middle of the fragment, and μe equals the mobility of the complex with hE2 bound near the end of the fragment (22Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 20: 9687-9705Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The full-length hE2 protein is poorly expressed in bacteria, shows low solubility, and is unstable (data not shown). To avoid these problems we cloned the HPV 16 E2 gene into the GST expression vector pGEX-2T and used a modification of the standard GST fusion purification procedure (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 167: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5043) Google Scholar) to obtain pure GST-hE2. The use of a GST-hE2 fusion improves expression, solubility, and stability of hE2 and also allows rapid purification. However, GST-hE2 was found to co-purify with a bacterial protein of around 60 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). N-terminal peptide sequencing showed that the co-purifying protein was GroEL; also known as Cpn 60 (data not shown). The GroEL chaperonin is overexpressed by bacteria on cell stress and frequently co-purifies with recombinant fusion proteins. The binding of ATP to GroEL has been shown to induce a conformational change from a tight-binding form of the protein to a weak-binding form (24Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9195-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To remove the co-purifying GroEL we included an ATP washing step in the purification procedure (25Thain A. Gaston K. Jenkins O. Clarke A.R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 209-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GST-hE2/GroEL, bound to a glutathione-Sepharose column, was washed with 5 mM ATP in column buffer. GST-hE2 free of GroEL could then be eluted from column using reduced glutathione (Fig. 2, lane 3). We used gel retardation assays to study the binding of hE2 to the four hE2-binding sites found in the HPV 16 genome. Increasing amounts of purified GST-hE2 were added to labeled oligonucleotides carrying hE2 sites 1–4 (shown in Fig. 3a). Free and bound oligonucleotides were then separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Binding to hE2 site 1 was repeated on each gel as an internal control. Fig. 3b shows the results of a typical experiment; in this case, the binding of GST-hE2 to hE2 site 1 (Fig. 3b, lanes 1–7) was compared with the binding GST-hE2 to hE2 site 2 (Fig. 3b, lanes 8–14). The binding of GST-hE2 results in the formation of two retarded bands (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3) probably as a consequence of the dimerization of GST. The quantity of free and bound DNA (both complexes) was determined using a PhosphorImager and these values are shown graphically in Fig. 3c. The resulting weak binding curves ([DNA] < Kd) were used to calculate the relative dissociation constant and the change in βG (or ββG) for each of the hE2-binding sites (Table I). These data indicate that, compared with hE2 site 1, hE2 binds more tightly to site 4, marginally more tightly to site 2, and more weakly to hE2 site 3.Table I.Binding of hE2 to the HPV 16 hE2 sitesE2 siteApparent dissociation constantaThe apparent dissociation constant (Kd(apparent)) was obtained using the equation: [boundDNA] = [maximum boundDNA] [protein]/[protein] + Kd(apparent).

Open table in a new tab In the x-ray crystallography-derived structure of the bE2 DNA-binding domain-DNA complex, the DNA is bent around the protein through an angle of around 50° (13Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As the HPV 16 P97 promoter contains four hE2-binding sites, any DNA bending caused by the binding of hE2 would be expected to have consequences for promoter architecture. We used gel retardation assays to investigate the DNA bending properties of the full-length hE2 protein at both tight and weak hE2-binding sites. hE2 sites 3 and 4, the weakest and tightest of the HPV 16 hE2 sites, respectively, were cloned into the DNA-bending vector pBend3 (26Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Restriction digestion of the resulting pBend3-hE2(3) and pBend3-hE2(4) plasmids generated a set of circularly permuted fragments in which the position of the E2-binding site is varied (see Fig. 4a). Fig. 4, b and c, show the results of gel retardation assays performed using this set of fragments carrying E2 site 3 and E2 site 4, respectively. In each case the retarded bands show different relative mobility depending on the position of the E2-binding site within the DNA fragment. These differences in mobility indicate that the binding of hE2 induces a significant bend in the DNA. Each gel retardation assay was repeated at least three times and the angle of the induced bend calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding of hE2 to site 3 (the weak-binding site) and site 4 (the tight-binding site) induced DNA bends of 61.4°± 3.0° and 61.2°± 1.8°, respectively. Thus, hE2 induces very similar, if not identical, DNA bends at both weak- and tight-binding sites. It is interesting to note that the experimentally determined hE2-induced DNA bend angle is in close agreement with the bE2-induced DNA bend angle (50°) measured from the crystal structure of the bE2-DNA complex (13Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). An alignment of the four hE2-binding sites present within the HPV 16 P97 promoter produces a consensus sequence that differs from that obtained when the bE2-binding sites are aligned (Fig. 5a). While the consensus bE2 site shows no base pair preference at the −7 position, or the symmetrically related +7 position, the HPV 16 hE2 sites all contain an adenine at −7 and a thymine at +7. To investigate the significance of this difference we assayed the binding of hE2 to a series of otherwise identical oligonucleotides containing A:T, T:A, G:C, C:G, or A:U at the −7/+7 position (shown in Fig. 5b). The binding of hE2 to each of these sites was assayed exactly as described in Fig. 3 and is shown graphically in Fig. 5c. The effect of different bases at the −7/+7 position on the relative dissociation constant is shown in Table II. These data show that changing the −7/+7 position from A:T to either T:A or C:G significantly reduces the binding of hE2 (8-fold and 4-fold reductions in binding, respectively). In contrast, changing the −7/+7 position from A:T to G:C has little or no effect. Given that the structure of the bE2-DNA complex derived by x-ray crystallography indicates that the bE2 protein makes specific contacts with base pairs in the major groove, these data suggest that hE2 contacts the N-7 atoms of adenine and guanine when either A:T or G:C are at the −7/+7 position of the hE2-binding site. Changing the −7/+7 position from A:T to A:U resulted in only a slight reduction in the binding of hE2. This would also seem to indicate that the hE2 protein makes specific contact with the purine at −7/+7. Taken together these data suggest that the hE2 protein forms a specific contact with a purine at the −7/+7 position and that this contact stabilizes the binding of hE2 to the HPV 16 E2 sites.Table IIBinding of hE2 to oligonucleotides with altered bases at the +/−7 positionsPosition 7 base pairRelative dissociation constantββGkJmol−1A :T1G :C1.1+0.17 ± 0.34T :A8.3+5.25 ± 0.25C :G3.6+3.10 ± 0.40A :U1.7+1.35 ± 0.45 Open table in a new tab Although the structure of the bE2-DNA complex has been determined by x-ray crystallography, no structural information is available on the hE2-DNA interaction. The bE2 protein makes no direct contacts with the G:C base pair at the −7/+7 position of the bE2-binding site. However, Arg-344 in bE2 appears to form a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the guanine at this position as well as side chain hydrogen bonds to the phosphate groups of the −7 and −8 base pairs (13Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Since the amino acids involved in sequence-recognition appear to be conserved between bE2 and hE2, we reasoned that Arg-304 of hE2 (the equivalent of Arg-344 in bE2) might be responsible for the recognition of a purine at the −7/+7 position of the hE2-binding site. Using site-directed mutagenesis we changed Arg-304 of hE2 to alanine. hE2 R304A was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein and purified exactly as described for the wild-type protein. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to test whether the presence of the R304A mutation altered the folding or dimerization of hE2. The CD spectra for the wild-type and mutant proteins (shown in Fig. 6a) are very similar, suggesting that this mutation has little or no effect on these properties. The R304A protein did show reduced affinity for DNA compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown) and consequently, binding to the position 7 variants was assayed in the absence of competitor DNA. Fig. 6b shows the results of a gel retardation assay in which increasing amounts of hE2 R304A were added to labeled oligonucleotides carrying E2-binding sites with either A:T or T:A at position −7/+7. As can be seen from the Figure, hE2 R304A binds equally well to both sites indicating that this mutant has lost the ability to discriminate between A:T and T:A at this position. These data imply that arginine 304 of the hE2 protein makes a specific contact with the N-7 of purine bases at the −7/+7 position of the hE2-binding site. The DNA-binding domain of the bE2 protein is almost identical in structure to the core domain of the Epstein-Barr virus origin binding protein, EBNA1 (27Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Furey W.J. Edwards A.M. Frappier L.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, unlike the bE2 C-terminal domain which forms multiple contacts with the base pairs in the E2-binding site, the core domain of the EBNA1 protein makes no direct interactions with the DNA (28Bochkarev A. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific contacts between EBNA1 and its binding site appear to be formed by two “flanking domains” that lie outside the E2 homology region. Each flanking domain consists of an α-helix and an extended polypeptide chain that form major and minor groove contacts with the DNA (28Bochkarev A. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Sanders and Maitland (29Sanders C.M. Maitland N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have assayed the binding of the isolated hE2 C terminus to the four hE2-binding sites present within the HPV 16 P97 promoter (29Sanders C.M. Maitland N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As amino acids outside this C-terminal region could form important contacts with the DNA we have used the full-length protein to determine relative dissociation constants for the interaction of hE2 with these sites. The values obtained for the full-length protein are similar to those which have previously been obtained using the isolated C-terminal domain (29Sanders C.M. Maitland N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that, unlike the EBNA1 core domain, the hE2 C-terminal domain is the sole determinant of DNA binding affinity and specificity. The data obtained using both the full-length hE2 protein, and the isolated C-terminal domain, indicate that hE2 binds most tightly to E2 site 4, then sites 1 and 2, and most weakly to site 3. The weak binding to site 3 is unsurprising given that unlike sites 1, 2, and 4, this site is not a perfect match to the “consensus” binding site (see Fig. 5a). The tight binding of hE2 to site 4 suggests that at low E2 concentrations this site would be occupied first. E2 site 4 is located around 550 base pairs upstream of the P97 promoter in an “enhancer configuration.” As the binding of hE2 to sites in this configuration has been shown to activate transcription from downstream promoters (21Ham J. Steger G. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Ushikai M. Lace M.J. Yamakawa Y. Kono M. Anson J. Ishiji T. Parkkinen S. Wicker N. Valentine M.-E. Davidson I. Turek L.P. Haugen T.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of hE2 to E2 site 4 would be expected to activate transcription from the P97 promoter. At higher E2 concentrations E2 sites 1 and 2 would become occupied, possibly displacing Sp1 and the TATA box-binding protein (20Tan S.-H. Leong L.E.-C. Walker P.A. Bernard H.-U. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6411-6420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of hE2 to these promoter proximal sites would thus be expected to result in transcriptional repression. The P97 promoter directs transcription of the viral early genes, including E2. Our binding data suggest that the hE2 protein might positively and negatively regulate transcription of its own gene at low and high E2 concentrations, respectively. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of previous studies which have shown that although hE2 activates transcription from the P97 promoter, increased expression of the hE2 protein results in transcriptional repression (18Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Similar concentration-dependent effects of HPV 8 E2 have been observed at the HPV 8 late gene promoter (30Stubenrauch F. Leigh I.M. Pfister H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 119-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of many transcription factors has been shown to induce DNA bending and, in some cases, these protein-induced DNA bends have important consequences for the regulation of gene expression. The DNA bend induced by E2F, for example, is important for the transcriptional activity of the E2F1 promoter (31Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of the bE2 protein has previously been shown to induce DNA bending in an enhancer fragment containing three bE2-binding sites (32Moskaluk C. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1826-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that binding of the full-length hE2 protein introduces a significant bend in the hE2-binding site (around 60°). As the P97 promoter contains four binding sites for hE2, the binding of this protein probably has dramatic effects on the architecture of this DNA. This conformational change might be of importance in the regulation of P97 promoter activity and, as hE2 interacts with the HPV origin recognition protein E1 (33Frattini M.G. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12398-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the regulation of viral DNA replication. Interestingly, the degree of DNA bending induced by the binding of the hE2 protein is the same at both tight and weak hE2-binding sites. In this respect hE2 appears to be similar to the 434 repressor protein which has also been shown to induce identical DNA bends at both tight- and weak-binding sites (34Koudelka G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4115-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the degree of DNA bending induced by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP or CAP) has been shown depend on the strength of the protein-DNA interaction (35DalmaWeiszhausz D.D. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An alignment of the four E2-binding sites present in the HPV 16 P97 promoter produces a consensus sequence which differs from that obtained when the E2-binding sites from the BPV genome are aligned. All four E2-binding sites from HPV 16 contain an A:T base pair at the −7 position and a T:A base pair at the symmetrically related +7 position (shown in Fig. 5a). We have shown that mutations at these positions can significantly reduce the binding of hE2. These results confirm and extend the previous observation that a change from A:T to C:G at this position weakens the binding of the hE2 C-terminal domain (29Sanders C.M. Maitland N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, the consensus bE2-binding site shows no preference for A:T at position 7 and a change from A:T to C:G at this position has been shown to result in a slight increase in the binding of bE2 (8Li R. Knight J. Bream G. Stenlund A. Botchan M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 510-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Having shown that the hE2 protein discriminates between base pairs at position 7 of its binding site, we set out to determine the amino acid responsible for this effect. Inspection of the bE2-DNA complex showed that arginine 344 (equivalent to arginine 304 in hE2) makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the N-7 and O-6 of the guanine base at the −7 position of the bE2-binding site used in the co-crystal (13Hegde R.S.

We reasoned that arginine 304 in hE2 might make a contact (either direct or water-mediated) with the N-7 of adenine or guanine present at the position 7 of the hE2-binding site. To test this hypothesis we mutated arginine 304 of hE2 to alanine (R304A) and assayed the binding of the mutant protein to sites containing either an A:T or a T:A at position 7. Unlike the wild-type protein, which showed an 8-fold preference for A:T over T:A at this position, the E2 R304A protein bound equally to both sites, albeit with reduced affinity. This loss of specificity suggests that arginine 304 of hE2 makes a specific contact with position 7 of the hE2-binding site. Given the flexibility of surface arginine residues it would seem possible that bE2 R344 could make direct contact with a purine at position 7 of the bE2-binding site. However, the lack of sequence-specificity at position 7 of the bE2 site suggests that this contact does not occur. The recognition of the base pair at position 7 of the hE2-binding site might not be solely attributable to the Arg-304 side chain but might also involve other contacts that are disrupted when this amino acid is changed to alanine. The lack of a preferred base pair at position 7 of the bE2 consensus site would also seem to indicate that the water-mediated contact between bE2 Arg-344 and the bE2 site makes little contribution to the specificity of the bE2-DNA interaction, however, the interactions with backbone phosphates made by this residue might make an important contribution toward the affinity of bE2 for DNA. There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that the bE2 and hE2 proteins have significantly different biological properties. For example, the hE2 protein has been shown to activate transcription from the HPV 16 P97 promoter whereas, under exactly the same conditions, the bE2 protein has been shown to repress P97 promoter activity (18Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our results highlight a further difference between these proteins; in comparison to bE2, the hE2 protein recognizes an extended binding site. These functional differences between bE2 and hE2 suggest that caution must be exercised when extrapolating from one system to the other.

INTRODUCTIONKDR/flk-1 is a membrane-bound receptor of the tyrosine kinase family with expression restricted predominantly to endothelial cells (1Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R.

Both receptors are expressed early in murine development, with KDR/flk-1 appearing a full day earlier (day 7.0-7.5 of the developing mouse embryo) than flt-1 (4Dumont D.J. Fong G.H. Puri M.C.

Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two, KDR/flk-1 has a wider pattern of expression among endothelial cell populations than does flt-1 (6Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Persico M.G. Terman B.I. Alitalo K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, only KDR/flk-1 has been shown to autophosphorylate in the presence of VEGF (1Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), and signal transduction mechanisms downstream of the two receptors differ (7Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences in expression and signaling suggest that the two receptors mediate different physiologic functions of VEGF in endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis.Recent studies in which the genes for the two VEGF receptors were deleted in mice by homologous recombination have provided critical data about KDR/flk-1 function (8Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M. Schuh A. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar, 9Fong G. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). In mice with homozygous deletions of flt-1, endothelial cells develop normally, but vessel formation is impaired, and lethality occurs at the midsomitic stages of development. In contrast, homozygous deletion of KDR/flk-1 also results in early embryo death (at day 8.5-9.5), but histologic examination reveals that embryonic endothelial cells are completely absent. Thus, KDR/flk-1 appears to be upstream of flt-1 in the cascade of vascular development; moreover, the presence of KDR/flk-1 is absolutely required for the development of endothelial cells from hemangioblastic precursors.In addition to its important developmental role, KDR/flk-1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases with significant angiogenic components. For example, expression of both KDR/flk-1 and its ligand VEGF are up-regulated in neoplastic processes (10Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takahashi Y. Kitadai Y. Bucana C. Cleary K. Ellis L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3964-3968PubMed Google Scholar), and administration of a dominant-negative form of KDR/flk-1 inhibits angiogenesis and experimental tumor growth (12Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Likewise, a critical role for KDR/flk-1 has been established in angiogenesis associated with proliferative retinopathies (13Aiello L. Pierce E. Foley E. Takagi H. Chen H. Riddle L. Ferrara N. King G. Smith L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10457-10461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar).In view of the importance of KDR/flk-1 in endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis, and to address the mechanisms of endothelial cell type-specific gene regulation, we have cloned and begun to analyze the regulatory elements of the human KDR/flk-1 gene (14Patterson C. Perrella M. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated in transient transfection assays that maximal promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region resides within a fragment from −225 to +127 relative to the transcription initiation site, and that deletions from −95 to −37 result in complete loss of promoter activity, defining this segment as the core promoter for human KDR/flk-1.Because putative binding sites for AP-2, NFκB, and Sp1 are found within the KDR/flk-1 core promoter, we have now examined which factors interact with the proximal promoter region in vitro and in vivo and how nonspecifically expressed trans-acting factors might function to regulate an endothelial cell type-specific gene. We demonstrate by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and in vitro DNase I footprinting experiments that a large nucleoprotein complex forms over the human KDR/flk-1 core promoter, and that purified Sp1 alone is sufficient to recapitulate this binding pattern. Nuclear extracts from endothelial and nonendothelial cells produce the same binding pattern over the core promoter, as would be expected, since Sp1 is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells (15Briggs M. Kadonanga J. Bell S. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, we show by in vivo dimethylsulfate (DMS) and DNase I footprinting experiments using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) that Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins bind to the human KDR/flk-1 core promoter in endothelial cells but not in fibroblasts or HeLa cells in vivo, despite the presence of Sp1 in fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the exclusion of Sp1 from the KDR/flk-1 core promoter in nonendothelial cells is associated with changes in chromatin structure. Our data support a model whereby proximal promoter elements are regulated by chromatin structure to provide access to or to exclude ubiquitous trans-acting factors for the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression.DISCUSSIONUsing complementary methods of EMSA, in vitro DNase I footprinting, and in vivo DMS and DNase I footprinting, we have defined the DNA-protein interactions within the proximal promoter of human KDR/flk-1. We have demonstrated that the important Sp1 sites are bound in vivo in endothelial cells but not in nonendothelial cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that the lack of Sp1 binding to this promoter in nonendothelial cells is associated with changes in chromatin structure.The results of in vivo DMS and DNase I footprinting in HUVECs demonstrate that four Sp1 motifs (Sp1 I-IV) within the KDR/flk-1 promoter are occupied in vivo, and that contacts are made predominantly with the G-rich strand of each motif. Our in vivo results correspond closely to in vitro binding of purified Sp1 to the SV40 promoter (26Gidoni D. Dynan W. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 410-413Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar), in which DMS protection is also restricted to the G-rich strand of Sp1 elements. In addition, although the crystal structure of Sp1 binding to DNA has not yet been solved, the coordinates for binding of Egr-1, a related zinc finger protein, to DNA have been resolved and are also restricted to G residues on one strand (29Pavletich N. Pabo C. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding to the G-rich strand is the mechanism of DNA interaction for three-zinc finger nuclear proteins. Our results are therefore entirely consistent with Sp1 binding to the KDR/flk-1 promoter in endothelial cells in vivo.On the basis of our results, the human KDR/flk-1 promoter bears strong similarities to the SV40 promoter (26Gidoni D. Dynan W. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 410-413Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The SV40 promoter contains repeated Sp1 elements, and Sp1 binds cooperatively to these elements to induce bending toward the minor groove of the DNA helix; this bending may bring distant regulatory elements in proximity to the core transcriptional apparatus (30Sun D. Hurley L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9578-9587Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is thought that cooperative binding of Sp1 on the SV40 promoter involves alignment of protected residues along a single face of the DNA helix (26Gidoni D. Dynan W. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 410-413Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The periodicity between the axes of protected residues in the Sp1 I-III sites in the KDR/flk-1 promoter is approximately 14 bp (Fig. 9), suggesting that if similar cooperative alignment occurs in this promoter, the helix may be slightly unwound, perhaps due to steric or sequence-related considerations. Alignment may also explain why the Sp1 IV site has a greater periodicity between the axis of its protected residues and those of Sp1 III; since Sp1 IV is G-rich and therefore protected on the opposite strand from the other three Sp1 sites, an additional half turn of the helix would be necessary to bring it into alignment. In the SV40 promoter, all Sp1 sites are located on the same strand; whether the orientation of Sp1 IV on the opposite strand from the other Sp1 sites in the KDR/flk-1 promoter has any functional significance remains to be determined.Although Sp1 has primarily been considered a transcription factor for housekeeping genes, convincing evidence suggests that Sp1 is functionally regulated (31Saffer J. Jackson S. Thurston S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Persengiev S. Raval P. Rabinovitch S. Millette C. Kilpatrick D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and participates in cell type-specific gene expression (33Baker D. Dave V. Reed T. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34D'Angelo D. Oliver B. Davis M. McCluskey T. Dorn G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19696-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Noti J. Reinemann B. Petrus M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sp1 is regulated during development (36Saffer J. Jackson S. Annarella M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), is important for the expression of ρ-globin in differentiating erythroid cells (37Minie M. Kimura T. Felsenfeld G. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 1149-1164PubMed Google Scholar), and is highly expressed in areas of vasculogenesis such as the developing hearts of mouse embryos (36Saffer J. Jackson S. Annarella M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It is plausible, then, that Sp1 may participate not only in constitutive expression of KDR/flk-1 in human endothelial cells, but also in the developmental expression of this gene as endothelial cells differentiate from hemangioblastic precursors. If this is the case, it is likely to interact functionally with other, more cell type-specific transcription factors, as is true for developmentally regulated erythroid genes (38Merika M. Orkin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar).With the exception of areas of Sp1-induced protection, the pattern of in vivo DNase I sensitivity of the human KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking sequence in endothelial cells is essentially identical to that of genomic HUVEC DNA exposed to DNase I in vitro, suggesting that the active promoter is not bound by nucleosomes (39Hornstra I. Yang T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 10-11-bp helical repeating pattern of in vivo DNase sensitivity in conjunction with the lack of protection from DMS modification in vivo indicates that the promoter is likely to be associated with positioned nucleosomes in nonexpressing cells. Indeed, helical periodicity determined by in vivo DNase I footprinting is a defining feature of nucleosomes present in the 5′-flanking regions of a number of genes (21Pfeifer G. Riggs A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 40Dang Q. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28667-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Future studies will be necessary to determine the exact rotational and/or translational positioning of nucleosomes throughout the KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking sequence in nonendothelial cells and how such nucleosomal positioning is regulated.The general effect of nucleosomal positioning on Sp1 binding and trans-activation remains unclear. Although other nuclear factors may require Sp1 for efficient nucleosomal disruption and transcription initiation (41Pazin M. Sheridan P. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J. Kadonanga J. Jones K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that Sp1 itself is responsible for nucleosomal disruption, since Sp1 is ubiquitous in mammalian cells (15Briggs M. Kadonanga J. Bell S. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), and Sp1 alone does not disrupt preformed nucleosomes in vitro (42Li B. Adams C. Workman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7756-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also has not been demonstrated that Sp1 can interact with binding sites that are bound by nucleosomes in vivo. Sp1 interacts with nucleosomal DNA in vitro, but its affinity for nucleosomal DNA is reduced by greater than 1 order of magnitude compared with its affinity for naked DNA (42Li B. Adams C. Workman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7756-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transcription initiation by Sp1 from preformed nucleosomes is strongly impaired or prevented (43Sheridan P. Sheline C. Cannon K. Voz M. Pazin M. Kadonaga J. Jones K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2090-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Conversely, nucleoplasmin-induced disruption of nucleosomal cores has been shown to enhance Sp1 binding in vitro (44Chen H. Li B. Workman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Our data indicate that Sp1 is specifically excluded from binding the KDR/flk-1 promoter in nonendothelial cells that do not express this gene, and we have evidence that this exclusion is associated with changes in chromatin structure. A direct association between the two is difficult to prove in vivo, however. In this regard, results of transgenic experiments in mice using a 4.0 kilobase KDR/flk-1 promoter:LacZ fusion gene are informative. All progeny containing this transgene fail to express LacZ in all cell types examined including endothelial cells, although KDR/flk-1 mRNA is easily detectable in endothelial cells of these mice. 2C. Patterson, unpublished data. This would suggest that the proximal 4 kilobases of 5′-flanking sequence alone, although potent transcriptionally in transient assays of gene expression (14Patterson C. Perrella M. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is transcriptionally silent in a chromosomal context, and that sequences outside this region are required for normal expression of KDR/flk-1. A plausible model, therefore, is that distant sequences regulate KDR/flk-1, either by disrupting chromatin structure to allow Sp1 to bind the core promoter, or by allowing Sp1 to bind before chromatin structure is established. In either event, an open structure for the gene is preserved in endothelial but not in nonendothelial cells.ALthough a number of genes are expressed with varying degrees of specificity in endothelial cells, we know of no transcription factors that function exclusively in endothelial cells. We postulate that novel factors, or a precise dosage of more general factors, initiate KDR/flk-1 expression in angioblastic precursors early in development in the course of their commitment to the endothelial cell lineage, thus rendering this population of cells sensitive to the mitogenic and vasculogenic effects of VEGF. In our model, changes in chromatin structure within the core promoter, presumably regulated by elements at a distance from the transcription initiation site, are associated with cell type-specific regulation of this gene. A similar model, based on regulation via a locus control region, is used to explain gene expression within the β-globin locus in the developmentally related erythroid lineage (45Martin D. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 46Ellis J. Tan-Un K. Harper A. Michalovich D. Yannoutsos N. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). If, as our results suggest, KDR/flk-1 is indeed regulated by a mechanism similar to that of the globin locus, then methods used to characterize regulatory elements within the globin locus, such as DNase I hypersensitivity assays and heterologous and homologous transgenic promoter analysis, may be particularly useful in elucidating the lineage-restricting mechanisms governing KDR/flk-1 as well. In addition, the results of our experiments indicate that one or more functional elements should regulate chromatin structure such that the KDR/flk-1 gene is accessible and expressed specifically in endothelial cells. Delineation of these, presumably promoter-distal, elements is of paramount importance to understand the mechanisms of lineage-specific expression of the human KDR/flk-1 gene. INTRODUCTIONKDR/flk-1 is a membrane-bound receptor of the tyrosine kinase family with expression restricted predominantly to endothelial cells (1Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R.

These differences in expression and signaling suggest that the two receptors mediate different physiologic functions of VEGF in endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis.Recent studies in which the genes for the two VEGF receptors were deleted in mice by homologous recombination have provided critical data about KDR/flk-1 function (8Shalaby F.

We have previously demonstrated in transient transfection assays that maximal promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region resides within a fragment from −225 to +127 relative to the transcription initiation site, and that deletions from −95 to −37 result in complete loss of promoter activity, defining this segment as the core promoter for human KDR/flk-1.Because putative binding sites for AP-2, NFκB, and Sp1 are found within the KDR/flk-1 core promoter, we have now examined which factors interact with the proximal promoter region in vitro and in vivo and how nonspecifically expressed trans-acting factors might function to regulate an endothelial cell type-specific gene. We demonstrate by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and in vitro DNase I footprinting experiments that a large nucleoprotein complex forms over the human KDR/flk-1 core promoter, and that purified Sp1 alone is sufficient to recapitulate this binding pattern. Nuclear extracts from endothelial and nonendothelial cells produce the same binding pattern over the core promoter, as would be expected, since Sp1 is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells (15Briggs M. Kadonanga J. Bell S. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, we show by in vivo dimethylsulfate (DMS) and DNase I footprinting experiments using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) that Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins bind to the human KDR/flk-1 core promoter in endothelial cells but not in fibroblasts or HeLa cells in vivo, despite the presence of Sp1 in fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the exclusion of Sp1 from the KDR/flk-1 core promoter in nonendothelial cells is associated with changes in chromatin structure. Our data support a model whereby proximal promoter elements are regulated by chromatin structure to provide access to or to exclude ubiquitous trans-acting factors for the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression. KDR/flk-1 is a membrane-bound receptor of the tyrosine kinase family with expression restricted predominantly to endothelial cells (1Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R.

These monkeys harbor high circulating concentrations of the prohormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the active vitamin D hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Previous work from this laboratory indicated that resistance is associated with the overexpression of a 60-65-kDa intracellular protein that binds vitamin D metabolites competitively. In the current studies 25-[3H]hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3) was used as a competitive ligand to investigate the ability of a number of small lipid molecules to interact with this intracellular vitamin D-binding protein (IDBP) in post-nuclear extracts of a prototypical lymphoblast cell line from the common marmoset, a vitamin D-resistant New World primate. Only those vitamin D metabolites with a hydroxyl moiety in the C-25 position were bound by IDBP. Disruption of the C-25 hydroxyl obviated binding, whereas more proximal alterations in the vitamin D side chain did not.

https://openalex.org/W2076497055,"The thermoacidophilic archaeon <i>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</i> expresses a very unusual quinol oxidase, which contains four heme a redox centers and one copper atom. The enzyme was solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and purified to homogeneity by a combination of hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange chromatography. The oxidase complex consists of four polypeptide subunits with apparent molecular masses of 64, 39, 27, and 14 kDa that are encoded by the <i>soxABCD</i> operon (Lübben, M., Kolmerer, B., and Saraste, M. (1992) <i>EMBO J.</i> 11, 805-812). The optical spectra and redox potentials of the SoxABCD complex have been characterized, and the absorption coefficients of the contributing cytochromes <i>a</i><sub>587</sub> and <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> were determined. The EPR spectra indicate the presence of three low spin and one high spin heme species, the latter associated with the binuclear heme Cu<sub>B</sub> site. Standard midpoint potentials of the cytochrome <i>a</i><sub>587</sub> heme centers were determined as +210 and +270 mV, respectively. The maximum turnover of the complex (1300 s<sup>−1</sup> at 65 °C) was found to be about three times greater than that of the previously studied isolated cytochrome <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> subunit alone (Gleissner, M., Elferink, M. G., Driessen, A. J., Konings, W. N., Anemüller, S., and Schäfer, G. (1994) <i>Eur. J. Biochem.</i> 224, 983-990). With <i>N,N,N′,N′</i>-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine as a reductant, the SoxABCD complex reconstituted into liposomes generates a proton motive force. A new method is described by co-reconstitution of SoxABCD with a <i>Sulfolobus</i> Rieske FeS-protein (SoxL), allowing energization by cytochrome <i>c</i>. It is based on the finding that this Rieske protein can equilibrate electrons between cytochrome <i>c</i> and quinones reversibly (Schmidt, C. L., Anemüller, S., Teixeira, M., and Schäfer, G. (1995) <i>FEBS Lett.</i> 359, 239-243). With this system, generating no scalar protons, the stoichiometry of proton translocation could be determined. A net H<sup>+</sup>/<i>e</i><sup>−</sup> ratio >1 was determined, identifying the SoxABCD complex as a proton-pumping quinol oxidase. According to structural analysis, the cytochrome <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> moiety of the complex does not contain the signature of a H<sup>+</sup> pumping channel as identified in <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> or <i>Paracoccus denitrificans</i>. Therefore, for H<sup>+</sup> translocation, a mechanism different from that in typical heme-copper oxidases of the <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> or <i>bo</i><sub>3</sub> type is discussed."

Bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein likewise inhibits T7 gene 4 protein-mediated strand transfer, whereas Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein does not. The 63-kDa gene 4 protein of phage T7 is also a DNA primase in that it catalyzes the synthesis of oligonucleotides at specific sequences during translocation on single-stranded DNA.

(1995) Cell 82, 111-119). We find that gene 32 protein alone forms joint molecules between partially single-stranded homologous DNA partners and that subsequent branch migration requires this single-stranded DNA-binding protein in addition to the gene 41 helicase and the gene 59 helicase assembly protein.

To identify amino acids that participate in the transesterification reaction, we introduced alanine substitutions at 39 positions within a conserved 57amino acid segment upstream of the active-site tyrosine. Purified wild type and mutant proteins were compared with respect to their activities in relaxing supercoiled DNA. The majority of mutant proteins displayed wild type topoisomerase activity. Mutant enzymes that relaxed DNA at reduced rates were subjected to kinetic analysis of the strand cleavage and religation steps under single-turnover and equilibrium conditions. For the wild type topoisomerase, the observed single-turnover cleavage rate constant (kcl) was 0.29 s−1 and the cleavage-religation equilibrium constant (Kcl) was 0.22. The most dramatic mutational effects were seen with R223A; removal of the basic side chain reduced the rates of cleavage and religation by factors of 10−4.3 and 10−5.0, respectively, and shifted the cleavage-religation equilibrium in favor of the covalently bound state (Kcl = 1). Introduction of lysine at position 223 restored the rate of cleavage to 1/10 that of the wild type enzyme. We conclude that a basic residue is essential for covalent catalysis and suggest that Arg-223 is a constituent of the active site. Modest mutational effects were observed at two other positions (Lys-220 and Asn-228), at which alanine substitutions slowed the rates of strand cleavage by 1 order of magnitude and shifted the equilibrium toward the noncovalently bound state.

The eukaryotic type I DNA topoisomerase family includes the nuclear type I enzymes and the topoisomerases encoded by vaccinia and other poxviruses. These proteins relax supercoiled DNA via a common reaction mechanism, which involves noncovalent binding of the topoisomerase to duplex DNA, cleavage of one DNA strand with concomitant formation of a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-protein intermediate, strand passage, and strand religation (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A shared structural basis for transesterification and strand passage is inferred from the considerable amino acid sequence conservation between the cellular and virus-encoded enzymes (2Gupta M.

The 314-amino acid vaccinia virus topoisomerase enzyme is the smallest topoisomerase known and likely constitutes the minimal functional unit of a type I enzyme (4Shuman S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7478-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). (The cellular type I enzymes vary in size from 765 to 1019 amino acids.) Our aim is to construct a comprehensive structure-function map of the vaccinia topoisomerase by mutagenesis. After performing initial studies via random mutagenesis (5Morham S.G. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we adopted the alanine-scanning approach to define the amino acid side chains important for covalent catalysis (8Petersen B.Ø. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The advantage of this scanning technique is that elimination of an amino acid side chain beyond the β-carbon immediately addresses the essentialness of that particular residue. We previously mutagenized a continuous 41-amino acid segment of the vaccinia topoisomerase extending from residue 126 to residue 167. Fifty-six different mutations were generated, with at least one substitution at each position. Four residues (Arg-130, Gly-132, Tyr-136, and Lys-167) were defined as essential, i.e. substitution by alanine (or in the case of Gly-132, by Ser) either eliminated or severely reduced (by 2 orders of magnitude) activity in DNA relaxation and the formation of the covalent DNA-protein intermediate (5Morham S.G. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Arg-130, Gly-132, and Lys-167 are strictly conserved in every member of the eukaryotic type I enzyme family. Tyr-136 is conserved among the four known poxvirus-encoded topoisomerases. All other amino acids in the targeted region, including many conserved residues, were nonessential. (We regard as nonessential those residues at which side-chain removal has less than 1 order of magnitude effect on catalysis.) In the present study, we extend the analysis into a conserved downstream region from residue 213 to residue 269. Thirty-nine of the 57 positions were substituted individually by alanine. After expressing and purifying the mutant proteins, we assessed mutational effects on DNA relaxation and transesterification. Most of the mutations studied had little impact on enzyme activity. Mutations at Lys-220, Arg-223, and Asn-228 elicited significant effects on the rate of DNA cleavage and on the cleavage-religation equilibrium. Replacement of Arg-223 by alanine reduced the rates of cleavage and religation by more than 4 orders of magnitude. Mutations were introduced into the vaccinia virus topoisomerase gene by using the two-stage PCR-based overlap extension method (10Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Plasmid pA9topo (11Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the template for the first stage PCR reaction. Gene fragments with overlapping ends obtained from the first-stage reactions were paired and used as templates in the second-stage amplification. Products containing the entire topoisomerase gene were cloned into the T7-based expression vector pET3c as described (7Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. pET-based plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Topoisomerase expression was induced by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (11Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant topoisomerases were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by phosphocellulose column chromatography (5Morham S.G. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the phosphocellulose preparations were determined by using the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. An 18-mer CCCTT-containing DNA oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then gel-purified and hybridized to complementary 30-mer strand (present at 4-fold molar excess). Cleavage reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 pmol of 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. Covalent complexes were denatured by addition of SDS to 1%. The samples were electrophoresed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the bromphenol blue dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The extent of covalent adduct formation (expressed as the percent of the input 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide that was transferred to protein) was quantitated by scanning the dried gel using a FUJIX BAS1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. A plot of the percent of input DNA cleaved versus time established end point values for cleavage. The data were normalized to the end point values, and kobs was determined by fitting the data to the equation (100 −%Clnorm) = 100e−kt. A 60-mer oligonucleotide containing a centrally placed CCCTT element was 5′ end-labeled, gel purified, and annealed to an unlabeled complementary 60-mer strand. Cleavage reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 pmol of 60-mer DNA duplex, and topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. Covalent complexes were denatured by the addition of SDS to 0.2%. The samples were digested for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K. The volume was adjusted to 100 μl, and the digests were then extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. DNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. The pelleted material was resuspended in formamide, and the samples were electrophoresed through a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea in TBE (90 mM Tris borate, 2.5 mM EDTA). The cleavage product, a 32P-labeled 30-mer bound to a short peptide, was well-resolved from the input 60-mer substrate. The extent of strand cleavage was quantitated by scanning the wet gel with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer. The 314-amino acid vaccinia topoisomerase consists of three protease-resistant structural domains demarcated by two protease-sensitive segments referred to as the bridge and the hinge (Fig. 1) (12Sekiguchi J.

The 9-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–80) is implicated in recognizing the 5′-CCCTT⇓ target sequence at which vaccinia topoisomerase cleaves duplex DNA (14Sekiguchi J. Shuman S.

The region of vaccinia topoisomerase from position 213 to position 240 is one of the more highly conserved segments of the protein vis à vis three poxvirus-encoded homologues (19 of 28 residues conserved). (The sequence of this region is highlighted in the shaded box at the left in Fig. 1.) Moreover, the subsegment G(I/L)XXKXXRTY is conserved in all cellular type I topoisomerases (2Gupta M. Fujimori A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas alterations of conserved residues Gly-216 (to Lys) and Ile-217 (to Pro) had little or no effect (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to systematically assess the role of individual amino acid side chains within this region by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Twenty-one of the 28 positions were substituted singly by alanine. We eschewed mutating Gly-216 and Ile-217 because these had already been found to be nonessential (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also demurred on mutating Ile-219, Leu-222, Val-227, Leu-232, and Val-239 because it was felt that aliphatic side-chains were less likely to participate directly in transesterification chemistry. In addition, we replaced Arg-223 with lysine. The 22 mutant alleles of vaccinia topoisomerase were expressed in E. coli. The wild type and mutant proteins were purified from soluble bacterial extracts by phosphocellulose column chromatography. The topoisomerase polypeptide constituted the major species in the protein preparations, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the extents of purification were essentially equivalent (Fig. 2). To assess the impact of these mutations, all proteins were tested for their ability to relax supercoiled plasmid DNA in vitro. Screening assays were performed in the absence of magnesium. The rate-limiting step under these conditions is the dissociation of topoisomerase from the relaxed plasmid product (17Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Activity was assayed initially by end point dilution. Then, the rates of relaxation were determined at a fixed level of input protein. 2.7 ng of wild type topoisomerase relaxed 0.3 μg of supercoiled pUC19 DNA to completion within 2 min (Fig. 3). We observed that the relaxation rate of 17 of the mutant proteins was equivalent to that of the wild type enzyme. These were K213A, Q214A, F215A, R218A, T224A, Y225A, G226A, Y229A, T230A, F231A, Y233A, N234A, F235A, W236A, T237A, N238A, and K240A. (The results for F215A are shown in Fig. 3; other data are not shown.) In contrast, the R223A mutant catalyzed no detectable relaxation in 15 min (Fig. 3). Conservative substitution of Arg-223 by Lys elicited a milder effect. R223K relaxed DNA at about one-tenth the wild type rate (Fig. 3). Modest rate reductions were also observed for D221A, K220A, and N228A (Fig. 3). Relatively few reaction products of intermediate superhelicity were observed with the wild type topoisomerase, suggesting that the enzyme relaxed individual DNA molecules to completion before dissociating and engaging a new DNA. The same distribution of products was observed for mutants R223K and K220A, which relaxed at reduced rates. However, intermediate topoisomers were prominent during relaxation by D221A and N228A (Fig. 3). This situation could arise if the rate of supercoil release on plasmid DNA were slowed or if the mutant enzyme became more distributive in its action, i.e. dissociating to a new substrate molecule before relaxing to completion. The DNA relaxation assays were also performed in the presence of 5 mM magnesium. (Magnesium enhances product off-rate without affecting the rate of DNA cleavage (17Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).) Magnesium stimulated the activity of the wild type enzyme such that 2.7 ng of enzyme relaxed all supercoils within 15 s (Fig. 3). None of the mutant proteins shown in Fig. 3 were stimulated by magnesium, suggesting that a step other than product release was rate-limiting. To determine which component step(s) of the topoisomerase reaction was affected by the engineered mutations, we subjected the K220A, D221A, R223K, R223A, and N228A proteins to a detailed biochemical characterization as described below. The wild type and F215A proteins were analyzed in parallel. A “suicide” substrate containing a single CCCTT⇓ cleavage site for vaccinia topoisomerase (18Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to examine the transesterification reaction under single-turnover conditions. The substrate consisted of an 18-mer scissile strand annealed to a 30-mer complementary strand (Fig. 4). Upon formation of the covalent protein-DNA adduct, the distal cleavage product 5′-ATTCCC is released and the topoisomerase becomes covalently trapped on the DNA. The extent of cleavage by the wild type topoisomerase during a 5-min reaction was proportional to added enzyme; >90% of the input DNA became covalently bound at saturation (Fig. 4, left panel). The concentration dependence of the F215A, K220A, D221A, R223K, and N228A activity profiles was similar to that of the wild type, with 80–90% of the input substrate becoming covalently bound in 5 min. In contrast, the R223A mutant catalyzed no detectable DNA cleavage in 5 min. Suicide cleavage by the wild type topoisomerase was nearly complete within 10 s at 37 °C (Fig. 4, right panel). The extent of cleavage by wild type enzyme at 5 s was 77% of the end point value. We used this datum to estimate a wild type rate constant of 0.29 s−1. Relatively mild effects on the rate of cleavage were seen for F215A (kobs = 0.09 s−1) and D221A (kobs = 0.08 s−1). In contrast, K220A (kobs = 0.02 s−1), R223K (kobs = 0.02 s−1), and N228A (kobs = 0.02 s−1) cleaved the DNA 1 order of magnitude slower than did the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4, right panel). Kinetic analysis of the R223A mutant revealed that this seemingly inactive protein was actually capable of cleaving DNA and that the extent of cleavage increased steadily over 48 h and leveled off at 96–144 h, at which time 38% of the input substrate was covalently bound (Fig. 5A). The observed cleavage rate constant was 1.2 × 10−5 s−1. Hence, the R223A mutation caused a 10−4.4 reduction in the rate of single-turnover cleavage. The religation reaction of R223A was studied by assaying the ability of a preformed topoisomerase-DNA complex to transfer the covalently held 5′32P-labeled strand to a heterologous acceptor strand (20Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 5B, R223A protein was incubated with the suicide cleavage substrate for 72 h in order to achieve formation of the covalent intermediate. We then added a 50-fold molar excess of a 5′ hydroxyl-terminated 18-mer acceptor strand complementary to the 5′ tail of the covalent donor complex while simultaneously increasing the ionic strength to 0.3 M NaCl. (Addition of NaCl during the religation phase promotes dissociation of the topoisomerase after strand closure and prevents recleavage of the strand transfer product.) Religation to the 18-mer yielded a 32P-labeled 30-mer. The strand transfer product was resolved from the input 32P-labeled 18-mer strand by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Religation by R223A was extremely slow; 30% of the input CCCTT-containing strand was transferred to the exogenous acceptor over 72 h (Fig. 5B). The observed religation rate constant (krel) was 1.4 × 10−5 s−1. The extent of religation by wild type topoisomerase at the earliest time point analyzed (10 s) was >95% of the end point value (data not shown). Thus, the R223A mutation slowed the rate of religation by nearly 5 orders of magnitude relative to the wild type religation rate. We used a 60-bp DNA duplex containing a centrally placed cleavage site with 30 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream of the scissile bond to study topoisomerase cleavage under equilibrium conditions. The wild type topoisomerase cleaved 18% of the 60-mer duplex at saturating levels of input enzyme (Fig. 6). The cleavage equilibrium constant (Kcl = covalent complex/noncovalent complex = kcl/krel) was 0.22. Covalent complex formation by R223K was 24% at saturation; hence, Kcl (0.31) was slightly higher than that of the wild type topoisomerase. Given that the rate of single-turnover cleavage was reduced at least 10-fold by the R223K mutation, we can conclude from the observed Kcl that the rate of religation was reduced to at least an equivalent extent. All other mutants tested achieved a lower than wild type level of cleavage at saturation. (Increasing the amount of input protein to 370 ng, twice the highest value shown in Fig. 6, did not result in a further increase in the extents of cleavage.) F215A cleaved 10% of the input 60-mer (Kcl = 0.11). K220A achieved 6% cleavage of the 60-mer (Kcl = 0.06); D221A cleaved 5% (Kcl = 0.05); N228A cleaved 3% (Kcl = 0.03). Kinetic analysis of 60-mer cleavage by 93 ng of each protein confirmed that all reactions had achieved equilibrium within 5 min. These effects on the equilibrium constants can be largely accounted for by the mutational effects on the single-turnover cleavage rates. The R223A mutant displayed a slow approach to equilibrium over 48 h (Fig. 7A). Remarkably, 50% of the input 60-mer was covalently bound at equilibrium. Hence, the observed equilibrium constant (Kcl = 1) was four times higher than that of the wild type enzyme. The rate constant kobs for approach to equilibrium by R223A was 3.2 × 10−5 s−1. Knowing that Kcl = 1 and that kobs = kcl+ krel, we calculated that kcl = 1.6 × 10−5 s−1 and krel = 1.6 × 10−5 s−1. Because neither the extent of cleavage at equilibrium nor the observed rate constant for approach to equilibrium was affected significantly by a 2-fold variation of the amount of input protein (data not shown), we surmise that the mutation did not affect precleavage binding. (This will be confirmed by additional experiments below.) We measured single-turnover religation on the 60-mer substrate by allowing the cleavage reaction to reach equilibrium and then adjusting the reaction mixtures to 0.5 M NaCl. This concentration of salt blocks both equilibrium cleavage and single-turnover cleavage by interfering with DNA binding (Refs. 16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Topoisomerase prebound to an equilibrium cleavage substrate at low ionic strength is dissociated when the salt concentration is raised to >0.25 M (18Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, topoisomerase molecules that have catalyzed strand closure on the 60-mer DNA will be dissociated from the DNA by salt and will be unable to rebind and recleave. The decrease in covalent complex as a function of time after addition of NaCl is plotted in Fig. 7B. R223A covalent complex declined slowly over 72 h (krel = 1.3 × 10−5 s−1). Note that the observed rate constant for R223A in single-turnover religation on the 60-mer agreed with the value calculated from the rate of approach to equilibrium on the 60-mer (1.6 × 10−5 s−1) and with the observed rate constant for single-turnover religation on the 18-mer/30-mer suicide substrate (1.4 × 10−5 s−1). Gross defects in covalent adduct formation caused by protein mutation either may result from a primary failure to transesterify or may be secondary to an inability to bind DNA noncovalently. A native gel mobility shift assay (6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 5360-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the DNA binding properties of the R223 mutant proteins. The 32P-labeled DNA ligand was a 24-bp CCCTT-containing duplex (Fig. 8). Binding of wild type topoisomerase to the 24-bp DNA resulted in the formation of two discrete protein-DNA complexes of retarded electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 8). The more rapidly migrating species contained topoisomerase bound to the 24-mer duplex, whereas the upper complex contained topoisomerase bound covalently to a 5′ tailed DNA cleavage product (6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upper complex arises via dissociation of the 3′ segment of the scissile strand. Mutated versions of topoisomerase that bind noncovalently to DNA but are defective in strand cleavage characteristically form a single protein-DNA complex in the native gel shift assay (6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this was found to be the case for R223A (Fig. 8). The apparent affinity of R223A for the 24-mer was similar to that of the wild type topoisomerase. The R223K mutant also displayed wild type affinity for the 24-mer CCCTT-containing DNA (Fig. 8). The motif, Ser-(Lys/Arg)-X-X-Tyr, is conserved at the active sites of the eukaryotic type I topoisomerases (2Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected, replacement of the active-site tyrosine by phenylalanine inactivates the viral and cellular enzymes (15Shuman S. Kane E.M. Morham S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9793-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Eng W. Pandit S.D. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13373-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Ser and Lys residues of this motif are dispensable for topoisomerase activity, insofar as alanine substitutions at Ser-270 and Lys-271 of the vaccinia enzyme are well tolerated (7Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, alanine replaces serine naturally within the protein encoded by molluscum contagiosum virus (Fig. 1). The region of vaccinia topoisomerase immediately upstream of the active-site motif (positions 249–269) is conserved among the poxvirus proteins (15 of 21 residues). The sequence of this region is highlighted in the shaded box at the right in Fig. 1. It was shown recently that substitution of residue His-265 with alanine reduced the rate of catalysis by 2 orders of magnitude (9Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This histidine is strictly conserved in all cellular type I topoisomerases (3Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To explore the roles of flanking residues, we introduced alanine substitutions at the remaining 18 positions. (Ala-253 and Ala-260 were exempted from the analysis.) The mutant alleles (K249A, K250A, L251A, I252A, L254A, T255A, I256A, K257A, Q258A, T259A, E261A, V262A, V263A, G264A, T266A, P267A, S268A, and I269A) were expressed in E. coli and mutant proteins were purified from soluble extracts by phosphocellulose column chromatography. The topoisomerase polypeptide constituted the major species in the protein preparations, and the extents of purification were essentially equivalent (not shown). All 18 proteins were as active as wild type topoisomerase in relaxing supercoiled plasmid DNA in the absence of magnesium (not shown). Seventeen of the mutants exhibited a typical stimulation of relaxation rate by 5 mM magnesium; the lone exception was I252A, which was not stimulated by divalent cation (not shown). We conclude that none of the amino acid side chains in this region (exclusive of His-265) is important for catalysis. In continuing our mutational analysis of the vaccinia DNA topoisomerase, we focused on a 25-amino acid protein segment that is well conserved with the cellular enzymes and an adjacent 21-amino acid segment that is highly conserved among the poxvirus enzymes. The remarkable finding was that only one residue (Arg-223) was essential for catalysis. An essential amino acid side chain was defined as one whose removal, e.g. by alanine replacement, results in complete or drastic (100-fold) loss of function. Arg-223 is conserved in every known eukaryotic type I topoisomerase (Fig. 1); hence, we consider it likely that this residue plays an identical essential role in the chemistry of strand cleavage and religation by other eukaryotic type I topoisomerases. Two other residues, Lys-220 and Asn-228, were identified as important for covalent catalysis, albeit not essential by the above criterion. Alanine substitutions at these positions slowed the rate of strand cleavage by more than a factor of 10. Lys-220 is strictly conserved in all cellular type I topoisomerases, whereas Asn-228 is conserved among the poxvirus enzymes. Prior mutational studies had suggested an essential role for Arg-223 in strand cleavage (6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but provided no quantitative assessment of the contribution of this residue to the estimated 109-fold enhancement by enzyme of the rate of transesterification (17Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This was because only the extents of cleavage by mutant proteins were measured and the reaction times were too short to detect extremely slow rates. In this study, we subjected the wild type and mutant proteins to kinetic analysis of the strand cleavage and religation steps under single-turnover and equilibrium conditions. For the wild type topoisomerase, we observed a single-turnover cleavage rate constant of 0.29 s−1 and a cleavage-religation equilibrium constant of 0.22. From these values we calculated a religation rate constant of 1.3 s−1. (Note that the rate of single-turnover religation by wild type topoisomerase on the suicide substrate was too rapid for us to measure manually, as was the rate of approach to equilibrium on the 60-mer DNA.) Our values were slightly higher than those reported by Stivers et al. (17Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (kcl = 0.07, krel = 0.66, and Kcl = 0.12) for single-turnover strand cleavage and religation at 20 °C. We suspect that the faster cleavage rate and consequently higher equilibrium cleavage value is attributable to our use of a different set of CCCTT-containing substrates and/or the fact that our reactions were performed at 37 °C rather than 20 °C. The observed rate constant for single-turnover cleavage by R223A on the suicide substrate was 1.2 × 10−5 s−1. The observed rate constant for single-turnover religation by the R223A suicide cleavage complex was 1.4 × 10−5 s−1. The values for kcl and krel determined from the approach to equilibrium cleavage on the 60-mer DNA were 1.6 × 10−5 and 1.6 × 10−5 s−1, respectively. The rate constant for single-turnover religation on the 60-mer DNA was 1.3 × 10−5 s−1. Thus, there was good agreement between the mutational rate effects gauged under single-turnover and equilibrium reaction conditions using different CCCTT-containing DNAs. Taken together, the results show that removal of the side chain at position 223 resulted in a ~10−4.3 effect on strand cleavage and a ~10−5 effect on religation. An imbalance in the relative mutational effects on the two chemical steps caused a shift in the cleavage-religation equilibrium in favor of the covalently bound state. The effects of the R223K mutation were benign compared with R223A. The cleavage rate constant was reduced by 1 order of magnitude. Our finding that the R223K caused only a slight increase in Kcl suggests that lysine substitution exerted comparable effects on the rates of cleavage and religation. These results show that a positive charge at position 223 is critical for transesterification reaction chemistry, while underscoring that arginine per se is important for optimal catalysis. The deleterious effects of the R223A mutation cannot be attributed to nonspecific loss of side chain bulk, because the topoisomerase is also inactivated when Arg-223 is substituted by glutamine (6Morham S.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of topoisomerase by replacement of Arg-223 with glutamic acid (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is less instructive because this entails charge inversion. Of the six conserved residues within the Gly-(Ile/Leu)-X-X-Lys-X-X-Arg-Thr-Tyr motif found in all eukaryotic type I topoisomerases, only Arg-223 is essential. Prior mutational analysis of this segment showed that Gly-216 of the vaccinia enzyme could be changed to lysine or glutamate with little effect on topoisomerase activity or DNA cleavage (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Ile-217 tolerated substitution by proline (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, these residues, although conserved, are noncontributory to catalysis. Earlier studies left unsettled the role of Lys-220. Substitution of Lys-220 by aspartic acid lowered DNA relaxation activity by more than 2 orders of magnitude, yet replacement by asparagine or isoleucine caused only a moderate reduction to 10–20% of the wild type level (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that side chain removal causes a decrement of 1 order of magnitude in the cleavage rate constant. The K220A mutation shifted the equilibrium toward the noncovalently bound state, implying that effect on cleavage rate was ~3-fold more severe than the effect on religation. Cumulatively, these findings suggest that conserved Lys-220 plays a role in catalysis, but its contribution is modest compared with that of Arg-223. Alanine substitutions at residues Thr-224 and Tyr-225 had no apparent effect on topoisomerase activity; hence, these conserved side chains are not critical for reaction chemistry. Elimination of the side chain at Asn-228 reduced activity in DNA relaxation and slowed the cleavage step by 1 order of magnitude. A similar reduction in Kcl suggested that this mutation had little impact on the religation step. Asn-228 is situated three residues downstream of the invariant RTY triplet and is found in all poxvirus enzymes. The cellular type I enzymes diverge from the vaccinia sequence immediately following RTY. However, conservation of Asn-228 can be invoked by aligning the vaccinia sequence GVY with an interrupted version of the cellular sequence—A (conserved positions underlined) (16Klemperer N. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15887-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that alanine substitution at the putative spacer residue Gly-226 had little impact on topoisomerase activity. It had been reported by Gupta et al. (25Gupta M. Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 573-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that replacement of Gly-226 with asparagine (a more drastic change in steric terms) reduced topoisomerase activity to 5–10% of the wild type level. However, the benign effects of the G226A mutation argue against a direct role for this residue in catalysis. With respect to Asn-228, ours is the first demonstration that this residue contributes to topoisomerase activity. Interestingly, N228A generated intermediate topoisomers during the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Conceivably, the altered cleavage-religation equilibrium might reduce the number of supercoils released per cleavage-religation cycle, thus leading to the appearance of intermediate topoisomers. At present it is not known for any eukaryotic type I topoisomerase exactly how many supercoils are released per each cycle of strand breakage and reunion. Kinetic analysis of DNA relaxation under conditions of saturating enzyme is clearly needed to compare the rate constant for supercoil release to those of the component chemical steps. Intermediate topoisomers were also noted during relaxation by D221A. This mutation (like N228A) elicited a reduction in single-turnover cleavage and a corresponding decrease in Kcl. Gupta et al. (26Gupta M. Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24177-24180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that replacement of vaccinia Asp-221 by valine (the residue found at this position in the cellular type I enzymes) resulted in a more drastic (25-fold) reduction in topoisomerase activity. The yield of covalent adduct formed by D221V on a suicide substrate was much lower than that of wild type enzyme; reaction rates and equilibrium parameters were not reported. We suspect the apparently more severe effects of valine versus alanine substitution for Asp-221 are caused by steric constraints imposed by the bulkier valine side chain. In summary, we have assessed the effects of alanine substitutions at 39 positions in vaccinia DNA topoisomerase. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive targeted mutational analysis of any topoisomerase reported to date. The results confirm the trend established earlier (7Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Petersen B.Ø. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that most residues of the vaccinia protein, even conserved ones, are not essential for catalysis. For those residues that were deemed essential or important for activity, kinetic studies using defined DNA substrates illuminated their contributions to the rate enhancements of DNA cleavage and ligation. Mutational effects ranged from drastic (R223A) to modest (K220A and N228A). We predict that Arg-223 is a constituent of the topoisomerase active site and suggest that this is also the case for the cellular enzymes. Precise knowledge of the disposition of catalytically important side chains awaits a crystal structure of the enzyme bound covalently to DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2071412881,"Molting in insects is regulated by molting hormones (ecdysteroids). The major active hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, is formed by ecdysone 20-monooxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation of ecdysone. During times of decreasing hormone titers, inactivation occurs by several routes including (i) 26-hydroxylation and further oxidation to the 26-oic acid, (ii) formation of various conjugates (e.g. phosphates), and (iii) in Lepidoptera in particular, ecdysone oxidase-catalyzed formation of 3-dehydroecdysteroid, which is reduced to 3-epiecdysteroid, followed by phosphotransferase-catalyzed formation of phosphate conjugates. Administration of the nonsteroidal ecdysteroid agonist RH-5849 (1,2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine), but not 20-hydroxyecdysone, to tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) resulted in induction of midgut cytosolic ecdysone oxidase and ecdysteroid phosphotransferase activities. In addition, both 20-hydroxyecdysone and RH-5849 caused induction of ecdysteroid 26-hydroxylase activity in midgut mitochondria and microsomes, whereas 20-hydroxylase was induced to a lesser extent by 20-hydroxyecdysone in mitochondria and by either RH-5849 or 20-hydroxyecdysone in microsomes.

INTRODUCTIONMolting hormones (ecdysteroids) regulate molting in immature stages of insects (1Koolman J. Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989Google Scholar). Conversion of ecdysone into the major active hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone occurs in certain peripheral tissues and is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (2Smith S.L. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 295-341Google Scholar, 3Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme undergoes developmental change, exhibiting a distinct peak during the final larval instar in several species (2Smith S.L. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 295-341Google Scholar, 4Chen J.-H. Hara T. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Inactivation of ecdysteroids occurs by various reactions including conversion of ecdysteroid via the 26-hydroxy derivative into the 26-oic acid, formation of various conjugates (e.g. phosphates), and conversion into 3-epi(3α-hydroxy)-ecdysteroids (5Rees H.H. Isaac R.E. Hoffmann J. Porchet M. Biosynthesis, Metabolism and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 181-195Crossref Google Scholar, 6Lafont R. Connat J.-L. Koolman J. Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 167-173Google Scholar). 3-Epiecdysteroid formation is prominent in lepidopteran midgut cytosol and involves ecdysone oxidase-catalyzed formation of 3-dehydroecdysteroid followed by NAD(P)H-dependent irreversible reduction to 3-epiecdysteroid, which may also be phosphorylated. The 3-dehydroecdysteroid may also undergo NAD(P)H-dependent reduction back to 3β-hydroxy ecdysteroid (for reviews, see Refs. 3Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar and 7Weirich G.F. Koolman J. Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 174-180Google Scholar). These enzymatic activities in the midgut cytosol (Fig. 1) also exhibit developmental changes (8Weirich G.F. Feldlaufer M.F. Svoboda J.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 23: 199-211Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), the subject of this investigation, midgut ecdysone 20-monooxygenase is localized in both mitochondrial and microsomal fractions (10Weirich G.F. Svoboda J.A. Thompson M.J. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 2: 385-396Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During development of the fifth instar, the midgut 20-monooxygenase undergoes a 50-fold increase in activity, temporally coincident with the onset of wandering (11Smith S.L. Bollenbacher W.E. Gilbert L.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 31: 227-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This occurs within a day of the commitment peak in hemolymph ecdysteroid titer, which causes reprogramming of the larval tissues for pupal development (12Bollenbacher W.E. Smith S.L. Goodman W. Gilbert L.I. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1981; 44: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and the nonsteroidal ecdysteroid agonist RH-5849 1The abbreviations used are: RH-58491,2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazineHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidRtretention time.

Commun. 1991; 176: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).We report here that RH-5849 causes pronounced induction of ecdysone oxidase and ecdysteroid phosphotransferase activities in M. sexta midgut cytosol. Furthermore, 20-hydroxyecdysone and RH-5849 cause much greater induction of ecdysone 26-hydroxylase than 20-monooxygenase in both mitochondrial and microsomal fractions. [3H]Ecdysone rather than 20-hydroxyecdysone has been used as substrate in this work, since it allows simultaneous investigation of ecdysone 20-monooxygenase and the ecdysteroid inactivation reactions, which are similar for both ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone (5Rees H.H.

Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 167-173Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsM. sexta were reared on an artificial diet at 25.5 °C and 60% relative humidity under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod (16Bell R.A. Joachim F.G. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1976; 69: 365-373Crossref Google Scholar). Last instar larvae were used in this study, the instar lasting 11 days under these conditions. Synchronous batches of gate II newly molted fifth instar larvae, which had undergone head capsule slippage during the dark period, were collected. The beginning of that dark period is designated as 0 h and the following day is day 0 (17Riddiford L.M. Curtis A.T. Kiguchi K. Tissue Culture Association Manual. 1979; 5: 975-985Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar); under our conditions of rearing, wandering occurred by the end of the dark period (152 h) on day 6.Ecdysteroids and Agonist20-Hydroxyecdysone was kindly provided by Dr. G. B. Russell (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Palmerston North, New Zealand). 26-Hydroxyecdysone and 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone were from Dr. M. Feldlaufer (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Beltsville, MD). Several ecdysteroid phosphates were previously isolated from locusts in this laboratory (5Rees H.H. Isaac R.E. Hoffmann J. Porchet M. Biosynthesis, Metabolism and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 181-195Crossref Google Scholar). 3-Epiecdysone 2-phosphate was synthesized from ecdysone 2-phosphate using ecdysone oxidase and 3-dehydroecdysone 3α-reductase enzymes purified from Spodoptera littoralis midgut (18Chen J.-H. Powls R. Rees H.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 436SCrossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 3-Epi-20-hydroxyecdysone 3-phosphate isolated from Pieris brassicae (19Beydon P. Girault J.P. Lafont R. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 4: 139-149Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Prof. R. Lafont (Ecole Normale Supérieure, Department de Biologie, Paris, France). RH-5849 was provided by Dr. G. R. Carlson (Rohm and Haas Co., Spring House, PA).Insect Ligation and InjectionHead ligations were carried out 88 h into the fifth instar (day 3) between the head and prothoracic segments using waxed dental floss. At this stage, larvae weighed approximately 8-10 g. Injections were made via abdominal segments, and the injection sites were sealed with low melting point wax. For routine assay of enzymatic activities on day 5, RH-5849 and 20-hydroxyecdysone were administered to the larvae in methanol as triple injections (4-10 μl/injection) at 88 h (day 3; 5 μg/g of larva), 112 h (day 4; 5 μg/g of larva), and 129 h (day 5; 10 μg/g of larva). Methanol-injected larvae served as controls. In the case of day-6 assays, all injections of ecdysteroid or agonist were given 24 h later than for day-5 assays. Day-2 assays (61 h) of ecdysone oxidase were carried out following administration of RH-5849 as a double injection (4-10 μl/injection) at 40 h (day 1; 5 μg/g of larva) and 57 h (day 2; 10 μg/g of larva).For each experimental regime, two or three independent experiments were carried out, with groups of five to eight insects being used for each treatment and enzyme assays carried out in duplicate for the pooled insects.Actinomycin D (25 μg in 5 μl of 50% (v/v) methanol in water/injection/larva) was injected alone at 108 h and, subsequently, together with RH-5849 (5 μg/g of larva) in methanol at 112 h and with RH-5849 (10 μg/g of larva) at 129 h. Cycloheximide (25 μg in 0.5 μl of 50% (v/v) methanol in water/injection/g of larva) was administered under the same scheme as for actinomycin D. Cycloheximide or actinomycin D were co-injected with RH-5849 when injection times coincided, and volumes did not exceed 15 μl (total) at each time. To limit the number of successive injections in the inhibitor experiments, RH-5849 was only administered twice. Enzyme assays were carried out 4 h after the final injection (133 h, day 5).Subcellular FractionsFour hours after the final injection, midguts of larvae were excised, cleaned, and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in ice-cold isotonic Hepes buffer (0.037 M, containing 0.3 M sucrose, 0.1 M KF), pH 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was removed, the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and recentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction, and the original supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a microsomal pellet and cytosolic supernatant. Mitochondria and microsomes were used immediately for enzyme assay, but cytosol was either stored at −20 °C for future use or dialyzed against 100 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 4 °C with a single change of buffer to remove endogenous cofactors.Enzyme AssaysEcdysone 20-Monooxygenase and Ecdysteroid 26-Hydroxylase AssaysThe mitochondrial and microsomal pellets were resuspended in a hypotonic Hepes buffer (0.037 M, containing 0.05 M sucrose, 0.1 M KF), pH 7.5 (20Chen J.-H. Kabbouh M. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), to give typically 2-4 mg of protein/ml and used for ecdysone hydroxylation assays. Enzyme preparation (50-100 μl containing 100-250 μg of protein) was added to [23,24-3H2]ecdysone (0.12 μCi, 0.42 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) dissolved in the foregoing Hepes buffer and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before addition of cofactors in buffer (0.2 mM NADPH and an NADPH regenerating system consisting of 2 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 0.2 units of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) to yield a total volume of 300 μl. Duplicate incubations were for 30 min at 37 °C and were terminated by addition of cold methanol (300 μl). The mixture was then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and an aliquot of the supernatant was used for HPLC analysis. Total ecdysteroid 20-hydroxylase activity was obtained from the sum of 20-hydroxyecdysone and 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone produced. Similarly, the 26-hydroxylase activity was derived from the sum of the 26-hydroxyecdysone and 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone.The inhibitory effects of cholesterol and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) on 26-hydroxylation of ecdysone were examined by addition of cholesterol or vitamin D3 (0.001-1 mM) dissolved in acetone (1% final concentration) to the standard enzyme assay. Similarly, the effect of RH-5849 (0.001-1 mM added in methanol; 1% final concentration) on mitochondrial and microsomal ecdysone 20-monooxygenase and ecdysteroid 26-hydroxylase was investigated in vitro. Details of prior induction of the enzymes used in these in vitro inhibition experiments are described under “Results.”The cytosolic supernatant fraction was used for assay of enzymes catalyzing ecdysone epimerization and phosphorylation. In some cases, the supernatant fraction was used without further processing, whereas for assay of individual enzymes, the supernatant fraction was first dialyzed. Assays were performed essentially as described for the hydroxylation assays, except that different labeled substrates ([23,24-3H2]3-dehydroecdysone, 0.12 μCi, 0.42 Ci/mmol; [23,24-3H2]3-epiecdysone, 0.12 μCi, 0.42 Ci/mmol; both prepared from [3H]ecdysone using purified enzyme preparations from S. littoralis midgut) or cofactors (2 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2; or 0.5 mM NADH; or 0.2 mM NADPH plus regenerating system as above) were used as appropriate.Ecdysone Oxidase AssayDialyzed cytosol was incubated with [3H]ecdysone in the absence of cofactors to prevent reduction of 3-dehydroecdysone product.3-Dehydroecdysone 3α-Reductase and 3β-Reductase AssaysDialyzed cytosol was incubated with [3H]3-dehydroecdysone in the presence of NADPH (incorporating a regenerating system) or NADH as appropriate. Assays were executed anaerobically under N2 to prevent any conversion of ecdysone product back to 3-dehydroecdysone by ecdysone oxidase activity.3-Epiecdysone Phosphotransferase AssayDialyzed cytosol was incubated with [3H]3-epiecdysone in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. Enzymatic products were analyzed by HPLC.Protein AssayProtein was determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard.Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Ecdysteroid ConjugatesPutative polar ecdysteroid conjugates were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 M MES buffer, pH 5.5. A crude hydrolase preparation (250 units) from Helix pomatia (so-called “arylsulfatase”; Sigma) was added, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the reaction was terminated by addition of methanol (4 ml). The protein precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation, and the ecdysteroids were extracted three times with methanol (4 ml); subsequently the extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness. The hydrolyzed ecdysteroids were applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Associates, Watford, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) in 10% (v/v) methanol/water (2 ml); any unhydrolyzed polar ecdysteroids eluted with 25% (v/v) methanol/water (4 ml), and the free ecdysteroids released from conjugates eluted with 60% (v/v) methanol/water (6 ml).High-Performance Liquid Chromatographic AnalysesHPLC analyses of free ecdysteroids were carried out on a Nova-Pak C18 cartridge (10 cm × 8 mm; particle size, 4 μm; Waters Associates) employing a linear gradient over 1 h of 35-60% (v/v) methanol/water at 1 ml/min (system 1) or isocratic elution with 22% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water at 1 ml/min (system 2). Radioactivity was detected with an on-line radioactivity monitor (Radiomatic).Adsorption HPLC was carried out using an aminopropyl silicone-Hypersil column (25 cm × 4.6 mm; particle size, 5 μm; Shandon Southern Products, Runcorn, Cheshire, United Kingdom) eluted isocratically with 8% (v/v) methanol in 1,2-dichloroethane at 2 ml/min (system 3a) or with 6% (v/v) methanol in 1,2-dichloroethane at 2 ml/min (system 3b). In this case, fractions collected at 1-min intervals were evaporated to dryness and assayed by liquid scintillation counting.Polar ecdysteroid conjugates were identified by reversed-phase HPLC on the same Nova-Pak C18 cartridge using two linear 30-min gradient elution systems at 1 ml/min: (i) 20-70% (v/v) methanol in 20 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.5 (system 4); and (ii) 8-40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 20 mM Tris-perchlorate buffer, pH 7.5 (system 5).DISCUSSIONThe results demonstrate that enzymes responsible for inactivation of ecdysteroids and ecdysone 20-monooxygenase can be induced in M. sexta by 20-hydroxyecdysone and the ecdysteroid agonist RH-5849. Changes in cytochrome P450-mediated enzyme activities are generally accompanied by concomitant changes in cytochrome P450 levels, and there is evidence that this is the case for fat body mitochondrial ecdysone 20-monooxygenase in S. littoralis (4Chen J.-H. Hara T. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the M. sexta midgut mitochondrial ecdysone 26-hydroxylase activity by carbon monoxide and ketoconazole (23Krämer W. Haug G. Hoffmann H. Sterol Biosynthesis Inhibitors and Anti-feeding Compounds. SpringerVerlag, Berlin1986: 25-64Google Scholar) indicates that this enzyme is cytochrome P450-dependent.2 Thus, the RNA- and protein synthesis-dependent induction of ecdysteroid 20- and 26-hydroxylases in M. sexta might be expected to result at least in part from alterations in transcription and synthesis of cytochrome P450 species. The observation that RH-5849 also induced ecdysone 20-monooxygenase in microsomes but not in mitochondria is unlikely to be due to the presence of sufficiently high levels of lipophilic RH-5849 in the mitochondria to inhibit the 20-monooxygenase assay, since inhibition in vitro was only apparent at RH-5849 concentrations above 100 μM. A somewhat analogous situation exists in larvae of the housefly (Musca domestica), in which ecdysone induces the 20-monooxygenase activity in mitochondria but not in microsomes (24Srivatsan J. Kuwahara T. Agosin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).RH-5849 also induced ecdysteroid 26-hydroxylase activity in both mitochondria and microsomes from M. sexta fat body.2 Induction of 26-hydroxylase activity in M. sexta by RH-5849 and 20-hydroxyecdysone is consistent with observations in S. littoralis, although in the latter case there was no significant induction of ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity in fat body or midgut (20Chen J.-H. Kabbouh M. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that ecdysteroids and RH-5849 induce ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity in midgut mitochondria of ligated M. sexta, but induction of the 26-hydroxylase activity was not discerned in that case (14Keogh D.P. Johnson R.F. Smith S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Keogh D.P. Smith S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Although substantially less active than 20-hydroxyecdysone in various in vitro systems, RH-5849 is far more active and persistent in various in vivo assays, presumably owing to the analog's superior transport properties and metabolic stability (13Wing K.D. Slawecki R.A. Carlson G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 25Oberlander H. Silhacek D.L. Porcheron P. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 7: 145-155Google Scholar). In fact, RH-5849 has been observed to have greater potency to induce ecdysone hydroxylating activities than 20-hydroxyecdysone and ecdysone (15Keogh D.P. Smith S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Chen J.-H. Kabbouh M. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). That this was less marked in the current work could possibly be explained if the dose of 20-hydroxyecdysone used were sufficiently high not to be unduly affected by such factors.A mixture of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone at concentrations occurring near peak ecdysteroid titer in fifth instar M. sexta led to considerable induction of 26-hydroxylase activity and a smaller induction of 20-monooxygenase activity (Table I, iv). This indicates that induction of 26-hydroxylation, followed by oxidation to the 26-oic acid, may at least partly contribute to the sharp decline in hormone titer at the end of the instar. Interestingly, it has not been possible in various species to demonstrate 26-hydroxylation in homogenates or subcellular fractions of tissues that otherwise effect the reaction (26Lafont R. Koolman J. Hoffmann J. Porchet M. Biosynthesis, Metabolism and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 196-226Crossref Google Scholar). In final instar larvae of S. littoralis, appreciable ecdysteroid 26-oic acids are formed in vivo at the time of declining ecdysteroid titer. 3I. Davies and H. H. Rees, unpublished results. It is noteworthy that concentrations of ecdysone or RH-5849 intended to simulate the commitment peak of ecdysteroid prior to wandering led only to low induction of ecdysone 20-monooxygenase in the microsomal fraction (Table I, iv). Although this would not account for the large in vivo 50-fold increase in 20-monooxygenase purported to be triggered by the commitment peak of ecdysteroid, it is likely that exogenous ecdysteroid is less effective than endogenous hormone, possibly owing to more rapid inactivation/clearance (14Keogh D.P. Johnson R.F. Smith S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).RH-5849 also induces a second ecdysteroid inactivation route, viz. the cytosolic conversion of ecdysone via 3-dehydroecdysone into 3-epiecdysone and the phosphorylation of the latter compound. The observation that “control” phosphotransferase activity was enhanced when 3-epiecdysone was used as substrate compared with ecdysone2 indicates that the former is the preferred substrate. Within this pathway, RH-5849 induced ecdysone oxidase and ecdysteroid phosphotransferase activities (Fig. 1, Table III), since RNA and protein synthesis are required for increased activity (Table II). The formation of 3-dehydroecdysone in the RH-5849-induced system resulted in some 3-epiecdysone being formed by constitutive 3-dehydroecdysone 3α-reductase.Induction of ecdysteroid-metabolizing enzymes in M. sexta by 20-hydroxyecdysone and RH-5849 is not merely a nonspecific effect, since phenobarbital, a known inducer of several forms of cytochrome P450 (27Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), was ineffective. This is in agreement with other reports on ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (14Keogh D.P. Johnson R.F. Smith S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Srivatsan J. Kuwahara T. Agosin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although induction by phenobarbital and various allelochemicals has been observed for the midgut microsomal enzyme from Spodoptera frugiperda (28Yu S.J. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 28: 365-375Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Induction of these ecdysteroid-metabolizing enzymes by RH-5849 is not likely to be a nonspecific response to an exogenous metabolite, since in the case of ecdysteroid 26-hydroxylase induction, the enzyme can also be induced to the same extent by 20-hydroxyecdysone. Furthermore, the ecdysteroid 26-hydroxylase seems not to be a general sterol/steroid 26-hydroxylase, since a 100-fold excess of cholesterol or vitamin D3 over the ecdysone substrate is required to exhibit any inhibition. In contrast, in the case of porcine mitochondria, 26-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and cholesterol is apparently catalyzed by the same species of cytochrome P450 (29Bergman T. Postlind H. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is possible that RH-5849 mimics high ecdysteroid levels and that the insect responds by induction of several ecdysteroid-metabolizing enzymes.Induction of ecdysteroid inactivation pathways by 20-hydroxyecdysone and RH-5849 is reminiscent of the regulation of vitamin D inactivation in vertebrates, in which 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulates its own degradation by inducing vitamin D mitochondrial 24-hydroxylase activity via a vitamin D response element to initiate degradation to excretory metabolites (30Kumar R.

We cannot discount the possibility that at least some of the observed induction events we now report may be indirect, for example, affecting regulatory proteins involved in transcription of enzyme-encoding genes (33Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar) or post-translational processes (34Hoggard N. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 10: 241-253Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is also always conceivable that tissues may not be fully primed for premature developmental induction or that the induction process may also require other unknown development-specific factors. INTRODUCTIONMolting hormones (ecdysteroids) regulate molting in immature stages of insects (1Koolman J. Ecdysone. Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989Google Scholar). Conversion of ecdysone into the major active hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone occurs in certain peripheral tissues and is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (2Smith S.L. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 295-341Google Scholar, 3Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme undergoes developmental change, exhibiting a distinct peak during the final larval instar in several species (2Smith S.L. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 295-341Google Scholar, 4Chen J.-H. Hara T. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Inactivation of ecdysteroids occurs by various reactions including conversion of ecdysteroid via the 26-hydroxy derivative into the 26-oic acid, formation of various conjugates (e.g. phosphates), and conversion into 3-epi(3α-hydroxy)-ecdysteroids (5Rees H.H.

Ecdysone.

In this report, we identified the α subunit of the cell adhesion receptor for pp-vWF as α4. Human leukemia cell lines that express α4β1 integrin (very late antigen-4, VLA-4), but not cell lines which lack VLA-4, attached well to pp-vWF substrate and these adhesions were completely inhibited by anti-α4 integrin monoclonal antibody HP2/1. Adhesion of mouse melanoma expressing α4 integrin was also inhibited by anti-mouse α4 mAb PS/2. Furthermore, transfection of human α4 cDNA into α4− Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in an acquisition of adhesive activity to pp-vWF, indicating that pp-vWF is a ligand for VLA-4 integrin. Using a recombinant fragment of pp-vWF, the cell attachment site was shown to be located within amino acid residues 376-455 of pp-vWF. A series of synthetic peptides covering this region were tested for the ability to promote cell attachment and a 15-residue peptide designated T2-15 (DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ, residues numbered 395-409) promoted VLA-4 dependent cell adhesion. The peptide was also capable of inhibiting cell adhesion to pp-vWF, suggesting that this sequence represents the cell attachment site. By affinity chromatography using peptide T2-15-Sepharose, it was found that α4β1 integrin complex from extracts of surface iodinated B16 cells specifically bound to the peptide.

Levin E.G. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is processed from a large precursor of vWF (prepro-vWF) during biosynthesis and stored in the granule of both endothelial cells and platelets independent from mature vWF (3Verweij C.L.

We have been investigating the biological functions of pp-vWF and found that pp-vWF bound to collagen and inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation in contrast to the mature vWF (5Takagi J. Kasahara K. Sekiya F. Inada Y. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10425-10430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Takagi J. Sekiya F. Kasahara K. Inada Y. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6017-6020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that pp-vWF serves as a substrate for transglutaminase and is specifically cross-linked to laminin (7Usui T. Takagi J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12311-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possibility that it acts as transient matrix protein upon secretion from platelets and endothelial cells at the site of vascular injury. In a previous paper (8Takagi J. Sudo Y. Saito T. Saito Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we reported that pp-vWF promoted the attachment and spreading of melanoma cells. The receptor responsible for this adhesion was the β1 class of integrin but the corresponding α subunit could not be identified.Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins consisting of α and β subunits and mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins as well as cell-cell interactions (9Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar–12Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date more than 15 α subunits and 8 β subunits have been identified and combination of α and β subunits determines the ligand specificity of individual integrins. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays crucial roles in regulating the morphology, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cells. Ligands for integrins are quite diverse and include many extracellular matrix proteins as well as cell surface molecules. VLA-4 (α4β1) is an integrin complex that recognizes both alternatively spliced segment III (CS1) of fibronectin (13Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (14Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is primarily mediated by interaction of lymphocyte VLA-4 with VCAM-1 expressed on cytokine-activated endothelial cells and this pathway is thought to be central to the lymphocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation (15Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5829) Google Scholar). Moreover, interactions of VLA-4 and its counter-receptors have also been implicated in a number of physiologic and pathogenic processes including CD3-dependent T cell activation (16Nojima Y.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3233-3236PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, VLA-4 is attracting broad attention from those who are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlining these processes.In the present paper, we found that pp-vWF is the novel ligand for the VLA-4. Furthermore, we identified the cell attachment site as a 15-residue linear sequence present in the midregion of pp-vWF molecule. A synthetic peptide with this sequence could promote cell attachment in an α4β1 integrin-dependent manner and directly bound to VLA-4 complex.DISCUSSIONWe report herein that the receptor responsible for cell adhesion to pp-vWF is VLA-4 (α4β1 integrin). At first we tested more than 20 cell lines, which grow on culture dishes, for their ability to adhere to pp-vWF and found that only the cultured tumor cell lines with melanoma origin, including mouse melanoma B16, human melanoma G-361 and MeWo, and hamster melanoma RPMI 1846, adhered on pp-vWF substrate (data not shown). We then thought that the receptor for pp-vWF might be a melanoma-specific molecule. When we tested cells of hematopoietic origin, however, most of those floating cells attached well to pp-vWF. It became clear that the receptor responsible for adhesion to pp-vWF was rather widely distributed among hematopoietic cells but its expression on adherent cells was limited to several melanoma cells. In a previous paper (8Takagi J. Sudo Y. Saito T. Saito Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we reported that the cell adhesion to pp-vWF was mediated by the β1 class of integrin using a function-blocking anti-β1 mAb, but could not identify the corresponding α subunit. Today 10 α subunits (α1-9 and αv) are known to be associated with β1 integrin. Among those, α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) is known as a rather common antigen on hematopoietic cells (32Hemler M.E. Huang C. Takada Y. Schwarz L. Strominger J.L. Clabby M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11478-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and it is also known that several melanoma cells express high levels of VLA-4 (33Martin-Padura I. Mortarini R. Lauri D. Bernasconi S. Sanchez-Madrid F. Parmiani G. Mantovani A. Anichini A. Dejana E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2239-2241PubMed Google Scholar). As the expression of α4 but not other α subunits correlated with the adhesive activity of hematopoietic cells to pp-vWF, we tested the effect of anti-α4 mAbs on the cell adhesion to pp-vWF and found they completely inhibited adhesion. This strongly indicates that VLA-4 is the receptor for pp-vWF. Other mAbs with function blocking ability, including anti-α2(6F1), α3(P1B5), α5(BIIG2), α6(GoH3), and αv(LM609), did not affect adhesion (data not shown), ruling out these subunits as receptor candidates. Finally, transfection of α4 integrin cDNA into CHO cells resulted in acquisition of adhesion activity toward pp-vWF as well as other well known ligands; CS1 and VCAM-1. It is concluded at this point that the cell adhesion receptor to pp-vWF is α4β1 integrin.VLA-4 is an integrin complex that recognizes both CS1 region in fibronectin and VCAM-1. Lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is primarily mediated by interaction of lymphocyte VLA-4 with VCAM-1 expressed on cytokine-activated endothelial cells and this pathway is thought to be central to the lymphocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation (34Osborn L. Cell. 1990; 62: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 35Postigo A.A. Teixido J. Sanchez-Madrid F. Res. Immunol. 1993; 144: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, VLA-4/VCAM-1 interaction is involved in lymphocyte homing to high endothelial venule in peripheral lymph nodes where VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed (36May M.J. Entwistle G. Humphries M.J. Ager A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 109-119PubMed Google Scholar). Leukocyte extravasation at the site of inflammation as well as the vascular wall injury is also thought to be mediated by leukocyte integrins, including VLA-4 although other adhesion receptors such as selectins play some part (10Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). These adhesions need to occur immediately at the right place, which means the adhesive ligands must be distributed spatially and timely. Fibronectin is a molecule abundantly found in almost all tissues and its distribution is hard to be controlled by immediate inflammatory response. VCAM-1 is an inducible cell surface molecule on endothelial cells and is a desirable docking molecule for leukocyte recruitment. However, VCAM-1 must be newly synthesized before expression on the cells and it is only detected after 2 h treatment of cultured endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-α (37Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Schiffer S.B. Goff D. Moy P. Chi-Rosso G. Luhowskyj S. Lobb R. Osborn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This means that VCAM-1 cannot mediate leukocyte adhesion in the very early steps in the inflammation. VCAM-1/VLA-4 pathway also cannot work when the endothelial cells are seriously injured or removed from the vascular wall. If there is another molecule that can mediate leukocyte adhesion in the very early step of inflammatory response, the whole system would be more effective. Vonderheide and Springer (38Vonderheide R.H. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have suggested that there is an unknown ligand for VLA-4 on endothelium because VLA-4-dependent adhesion of lymphoid cells to cultured endothelial cells is not completely inhibited by antibodies against VCAM-1 and fibronectin. Hahne et al. (39Hahne M. Jager U. Isenmann S. Hallmann R. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have also suggested that there is an unknown leukocyte adhesion mechanism on mouse endothelioma cells that is not mediated by VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, or P-selectin. Our results that VLA-4 also recognizes pp-vWF as an adhesion substrate may suggest that the adhesion to pp-vWF functions as a physiologically important pathway of leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory/vascular injury sites. Biosynthesis of vWF precursor is limited in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells (4Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only platelets and endothelial cells are places that pp-vWF protein exists in the whole body and pp-vWF is immediately released from these cells upon activation by agonists such as thrombin (40Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1981; 58: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As pp-vWF has the ability to bind to both collagen and laminin (5Takagi J. Kasahara K. Sekiya F. Inada Y. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10425-10430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Usui T. Takagi J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12311-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be deposited at the exposed subendothelial matrix, thus presenting an adhesion site for VLA-4-bearing leukocytes. In preliminary experiments, we have observed that pp-vWF rapidly accumulates at injured sites of glomerular vasculature during the experimental glomerulonephritis while mature vWF does not. 2F. Shimizu and J. Takagi, unpublished observations. It is possible that pp-vWF functions as an emergency tag for leukocytes/lymphocytes targeting and mediates successful recruitment and infiltration of these inflammatory cells together with VCAM-1.We found that an amino acid sequence, DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ, derived from the midregion of human pp-vWF, was a novel ligand sequence of VLA-4. A peptide with this sequence by itself could promote cell adhesion in an α4β1 integrin-dependent manner, and, moreover, direct binding of the VLA-4 integrin complex to this peptide is observed. Although the shorter version of the peptide, T2-10 (DCQDHSFSIV), also had cell adhesion activity, the inhibitory activity of this peptide on cell adhesion to pp-vWF was significantly lower than that of T2-15. It suggests that the 10-residue portion is essential for the recognition by VLA-4, but the C-terminal extension increases the affinity and/or stabilizes the favorable conformation of the peptide. CS1 and T2-15 peptide both can inhibit the cell adhesion to pp-vWF as well as to CS1-bovine serum albumin, although these peptides share no homologous motif in their sequences. It is possible that both peptides can bind to the ligand binding pocket of VLA-4 in a similar way, thus inhibiting the interaction of each other. Although the tertiary structure for the pp-vWF protein has not been resolved, a computer-aided prediction of secondary structure of the region containing this sequence by using the algorithm of Robson (41Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar) suggests that the segment Asp395-Phe401 form a β-turn structure (data not shown). It is possible that this segment forms loop structures facing outward and is thus available to interact with the cell surface. As this sequence contains neither the essential VLA-4-recognition motif identified in CS1 (EILDV) (42Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15075-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) nor that in VCAM-1 (QIDSPL) (43Vonderheide R.H. Tedder T.F. Springer T.A. Staunton D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it seems that this sequence represents a novel integrin-binding motif. However, it contains a sequence, VIET, which is similar to the sequence around the essential glutamate residue (Glu34) in ICAM-1 (GIET) (44Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). As these sequences all contain some oxygenated residues (Asp, Glu, Thr, or Ser) as well as isoleucine residue, these different but rather similar sequences might be utilized as general integrin binding motifs in each molecule together with other structures that define the specificity. Determination of minimum essential residues for the binding to the integrin within the T2-15 sequence is underway.In conclusion, our finding that pp-vWF serves as a ligand for VLA-4 integrin provides new insights on the physiological significance of this vWF gene product which was originally thought as a mere propeptide without any particular functions. Furthermore, elucidation of mechanisms of the cell adhesion to pp-vWF will help in our understanding of mechanisms underlying the melanoma metastasis as well as vascular inflammation.

VLA-4 (α4β1) is an integrin complex that recognizes both alternatively spliced segment III (CS1) of fibronectin (13Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R.

Lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is primarily mediated by interaction of lymphocyte VLA-4 with VCAM-1 expressed on cytokine-activated endothelial cells and this pathway is thought to be central to the lymphocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation (15Springer T.A.

Moreover, interactions of VLA-4 and its counter-receptors have also been implicated in a number of physiologic and pathogenic processes including CD3-dependent T cell activation (16Nojima Y.

Therefore, VLA-4 is attracting broad attention from those who are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlining these processes.In the present paper, we found that pp-vWF is the novel ligand for the VLA-4. Furthermore, we identified the cell attachment site as a 15-residue linear sequence present in the midregion of pp-vWF molecule. A synthetic peptide with this sequence could promote cell attachment in an α4β1 integrin-dependent manner and directly bound to VLA-4 complex.

It is processed from a large precursor of vWF (prepro-vWF) during biosynthesis and stored in the granule of both endothelial cells and platelets independent from mature vWF (3Verweij C.L.

We have been investigating the biological functions of pp-vWF and found that pp-vWF bound to collagen and inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation in contrast to the mature vWF (5Takagi J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6017-6020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that pp-vWF serves as a substrate for transglutaminase and is specifically cross-linked to laminin (7Usui T. Takagi J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12311-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possibility that it acts as transient matrix protein upon secretion from platelets and endothelial cells at the site of vascular injury. In a previous paper (8Takagi J. Sudo Y. Saito T. Saito Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we reported that pp-vWF promoted the attachment and spreading of melanoma cells.

Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins consisting of α and β subunits and mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins as well as cell-cell interactions (9Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar–12Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date more than 15 α subunits and 8 β subunits have been identified and combination of α and β subunits determines the ligand specificity of individual integrins. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays crucial roles in regulating the morphology, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cells. Ligands for integrins are quite diverse and include many extracellular matrix proteins as well as cell surface molecules. VLA-4 (α4β1) is an integrin complex that recognizes both alternatively spliced segment III (CS1) of fibronectin (13Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R.

In the present paper, we found that pp-vWF is the novel ligand for the VLA-4. Furthermore, we identified the cell attachment site as a 15-residue linear sequence present in the midregion of pp-vWF molecule. A synthetic peptide with this sequence could promote cell attachment in an α4β1 integrin-dependent manner and directly bound to VLA-4 complex. DISCUSSIONWe report herein that the receptor responsible for cell adhesion to pp-vWF is VLA-4 (α4β1 integrin). At first we tested more than 20 cell lines, which grow on culture dishes, for their ability to adhere to pp-vWF and found that only the cultured tumor cell lines with melanoma origin, including mouse melanoma B16, human melanoma G-361 and MeWo, and hamster melanoma RPMI 1846, adhered on pp-vWF substrate (data not shown). We then thought that the receptor for pp-vWF might be a melanoma-specific molecule. When we tested cells of hematopoietic origin, however, most of those floating cells attached well to pp-vWF. It became clear that the receptor responsible for adhesion to pp-vWF was rather widely distributed among hematopoietic cells but its expression on adherent cells was limited to several melanoma cells. In a previous paper (8Takagi J. Sudo Y. Saito T. Saito Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we reported that the cell adhesion to pp-vWF was mediated by the β1 class of integrin using a function-blocking anti-β1 mAb, but could not identify the corresponding α subunit. Today 10 α subunits (α1-9 and αv) are known to be associated with β1 integrin. Among those, α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) is known as a rather common antigen on hematopoietic cells (32Hemler M.E. Huang C. Takada Y. Schwarz L. Strominger J.L. Clabby M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11478-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and it is also known that several melanoma cells express high levels of VLA-4 (33Martin-Padura I. Mortarini R. Lauri D. Bernasconi S. Sanchez-Madrid F. Parmiani G. Mantovani A. Anichini A. Dejana E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2239-2241PubMed Google Scholar). As the expression of α4 but not other α subunits correlated with the adhesive activity of hematopoietic cells to pp-vWF, we tested the effect of anti-α4 mAbs on the cell adhesion to pp-vWF and found they completely inhibited adhesion. This strongly indicates that VLA-4 is the receptor for pp-vWF. Other mAbs with function blocking ability, including anti-α2(6F1), α3(P1B5), α5(BIIG2), α6(GoH3), and αv(LM609), did not affect adhesion (data not shown), ruling out these subunits as receptor candidates. Finally, transfection of α4 integrin cDNA into CHO cells resulted in acquisition of adhesion activity toward pp-vWF as well as other well known ligands; CS1 and VCAM-1. It is concluded at this point that the cell adhesion receptor to pp-vWF is α4β1 integrin.VLA-4 is an integrin complex that recognizes both CS1 region in fibronectin and VCAM-1. Lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is primarily mediated by interaction of lymphocyte VLA-4 with VCAM-1 expressed on cytokine-activated endothelial cells and this pathway is thought to be central to the lymphocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation (34Osborn L. Cell. 1990; 62: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 35Postigo A.A. Teixido J. Sanchez-Madrid F. Res. Immunol. 1993; 144: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, VLA-4/VCAM-1 interaction is involved in lymphocyte homing to high endothelial venule in peripheral lymph nodes where VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed (36May M.J. Entwistle G. Humphries M.J. Ager A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 109-119PubMed Google Scholar). Leukocyte extravasation at the site of inflammation as well as the vascular wall injury is also thought to be mediated by leukocyte integrins, including VLA-4 although other adhesion receptors such as selectins play some part (10Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). These adhesions need to occur immediately at the right place, which means the adhesive ligands must be distributed spatially and timely. Fibronectin is a molecule abundantly found in almost all tissues and its distribution is hard to be controlled by immediate inflammatory response. VCAM-1 is an inducible cell surface molecule on endothelial cells and is a desirable docking molecule for leukocyte recruitment. However, VCAM-1 must be newly synthesized before expression on the cells and it is only detected after 2 h treatment of cultured endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-α (37Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Schiffer S.B. Goff D. Moy P. Chi-Rosso G. Luhowskyj S. Lobb R. Osborn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This means that VCAM-1 cannot mediate leukocyte adhesion in the very early steps in the inflammation. VCAM-1/VLA-4 pathway also cannot work when the endothelial cells are seriously injured or removed from the vascular wall. If there is another molecule that can mediate leukocyte adhesion in the very early step of inflammatory response, the whole system would be more effective. Vonderheide and Springer (38Vonderheide R.H. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have suggested that there is an unknown ligand for VLA-4 on endothelium because VLA-4-dependent adhesion of lymphoid cells to cultured endothelial cells is not completely inhibited by antibodies against VCAM-1 and fibronectin. Hahne et al. (39Hahne M. Jager U. Isenmann S. Hallmann R. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have also suggested that there is an unknown leukocyte adhesion mechanism on mouse endothelioma cells that is not mediated by VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, or P-selectin. Our results that VLA-4 also recognizes pp-vWF as an adhesion substrate may suggest that the adhesion to pp-vWF functions as a physiologically important pathway of leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory/vascular injury sites. Biosynthesis of vWF precursor is limited in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells (4Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only platelets and endothelial cells are places that pp-vWF protein exists in the whole body and pp-vWF is immediately released from these cells upon activation by agonists such as thrombin (40Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1981; 58: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As pp-vWF has the ability to bind to both collagen and laminin (5Takagi J. Kasahara K. Sekiya F. Inada Y. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10425-10430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Usui T. Takagi J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12311-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be deposited at the exposed subendothelial matrix, thus presenting an adhesion site for VLA-4-bearing leukocytes. In preliminary experiments, we have observed that pp-vWF rapidly accumulates at injured sites of glomerular vasculature during the experimental glomerulonephritis while mature vWF does not. 2F. Shimizu and J. Takagi, unpublished observations. It is possible that pp-vWF functions as an emergency tag for leukocytes/lymphocytes targeting and mediates successful recruitment and infiltration of these inflammatory cells together with VCAM-1.We found that an amino acid sequence, DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ, derived from the midregion of human pp-vWF, was a novel ligand sequence of VLA-4. A peptide with this sequence by itself could promote cell adhesion in an α4β1 integrin-dependent manner, and, moreover, direct binding of the VLA-4 integrin complex to this peptide is observed. Although the shorter version of the peptide, T2-10 (DCQDHSFSIV), also had cell adhesion activity, the inhibitory activity of this peptide on cell adhesion to pp-vWF was significantly lower than that of T2-15. It suggests that the 10-residue portion is essential for the recognition by VLA-4, but the C-terminal extension increases the affinity and/or stabilizes the favorable conformation of the peptide. CS1 and T2-15 peptide both can inhibit the cell adhesion to pp-vWF as well as to CS1-bovine serum albumin, although these peptides share no homologous motif in their sequences. It is possible that both peptides can bind to the ligand binding pocket of VLA-4 in a similar way, thus inhibiting the interaction of each other. Although the tertiary structure for the pp-vWF protein has not been resolved, a computer-aided prediction of secondary structure of the region containing this sequence by using the algorithm of Robson (41Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar) suggests that the segment Asp395-Phe401 form a β-turn structure (data not shown). It is possible that this segment forms loop structures facing outward and is thus available to interact with the cell surface. As this sequence contains neither the essential VLA-4-recognition motif identified in CS1 (EILDV) (42Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15075-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) nor that in VCAM-1 (QIDSPL) (43Vonderheide R.H. Tedder T.F. Springer T.A. Staunton D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it seems that this sequence represents a novel integrin-binding motif. However, it contains a sequence, VIET, which is similar to the sequence around the essential glutamate residue (Glu34) in ICAM-1 (GIET) (44Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). As these sequences all contain some oxygenated residues (Asp, Glu, Thr, or Ser) as well as isoleucine residue, these different but rather similar sequences might be utilized as general integrin binding motifs in each molecule together with other structures that define the specificity. Determination of minimum essential residues for the binding to the integrin within the T2-15 sequence is underway.In conclusion, our finding that pp-vWF serves as a ligand for VLA-4 integrin provides new insights on the physiological significance of this vWF gene product which was originally thought as a mere propeptide without any particular functions. Furthermore, elucidation of mechanisms of the cell adhesion to pp-vWF will help in our understanding of mechanisms underlying the melanoma metastasis as well as vascular inflammation. We report herein that the receptor responsible for cell adhesion to pp-vWF is VLA-4 (α4β1 integrin).

However, it contains a sequence, VIET, which is similar to the sequence around the essential glutamate residue (Glu34) in ICAM-1 (GIET) (44Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). As these sequences all contain some oxygenated residues (Asp, Glu, Thr, or Ser) as well as isoleucine residue, these different but rather similar sequences might be utilized as general integrin binding motifs in each molecule together with other structures that define the specificity. Determination of minimum essential residues for the binding to the integrin within the T2-15 sequence is underway. In conclusion, our finding that pp-vWF serves as a ligand for VLA-4 integrin provides new insights on the physiological significance of this vWF gene product which was originally thought as a mere propeptide without any particular functions. Furthermore, elucidation of mechanisms of the cell adhesion to pp-vWF will help in our understanding of mechanisms underlying the melanoma metastasis as well as vascular inflammation. We thank Drs.

INTRODUCTIONCellular receptor structure and function relationships have become the focus of an increasing amount of research, relevant for biological understanding as well as for possible pharmaceutical applications. The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-IRIGF-I receptorHBSHepes-buffered salineIGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor-IIGF-IIinsulin-like growth factor-IIZsynthetic IgG binding domain from Staphylococcal protein AsIGF-IR-Zsoluble variant of IGF-IR-Z fusioninsRinsulin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered saline. is a transmembrane glycoprotein and belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes, among others, the insulin (insR), epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (1Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a major regulator of both cellular growth and metabolism (2Siddle K. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 301-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The components of the IGF hormone signaling system are tightly regulated, both in tissue-specific and developmentally specific manners. The IGF molecular system contains three known peptide ligands (IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin), three types of cellular receptors (IGF-IR, insR, and IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate), and six known subtypes of circulating IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6). The molecular components of the IGF signaling system have been the subject of several recent review articles (3Rechler M.M. Vit. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which insulin and IGF molecules interact with their respective receptor to mediate signaling is still not understood in great detail at the molecular level. The ligand-induced receptor activation has been suggested to involve a conformational switch in the quaternary structure upon ligand binding, with movements of the extracellular α parts and a congregation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase regions to enable activation (5McDonald N.Q. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). However, the complexity of IGF-I signaling remains rather elusive almost 10 years after the molecular cloning of the human IGF-I receptor gene (7Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar).IGF-IR is active as a preformed heterotetrameric receptor containing two extracellular α-domains with ligand binding sites and two transmembrane-spanning β-domains, also harboring the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 1A). The chains are disulfide-linked in a β-α-α-β arrangement with possibly three disulfide linkages between the α chains and one disulfide bond between each α-β chain pair (8Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The gene is transcribed and translated as a single α-β polypeptide chain and post-translationally processed and assembled into a mature receptor. It has been shown for the homologous insulin receptor that receptor maturation is achieved through proteolytic processing, oligosaccharide attachment, and disulfidelinked homodimerization during the transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and further to the cell surface (9Yamada K. Goncalves E. Carpentier J.L. Kahn C.R. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In this paper, the ligand binding properties of a purified extracellular portion of the IGF-IR have been characterized using BIAcore™ biosensor analysis. From the BIAcore data, molecular association and disassociation rates as well as binding equilibrium constants were calculated. Binding properties of the soluble IGF-IR receptor variant were analyzed for the ligands IGF-I, des(1-3)-IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin, respectively. Near- and far-UV circular dichroism measurements were performed to establish an estimation of possible secondary structure changes upon ligand association.Microcalorimetric titration binding experiments of IGF-I to the heterotetrameric IGF-IR-Z were performed at three different temperatures, from which enthalpies, βH0, Gibbs free energies, βG0, entropies, βS0, and heat capacity, βCp0, of the binding process could be calculated. In this work, we have used the model proposed by Freire et al. (10Freire E. Haynie D.T. Xie D. Proteins. 1993; 17: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Freire E. Murphy K.P.

Proteins. 1994; 19: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) to analyze microcalorimetric titration data of the binding of IGF-I to the heterotetrameric IGF-IR-Z. From this analysis, the change in hydration-accessible polar and nonpolar surface areas were calculated, as well as the entropic contribution to changes in conformational degree of freedom upon binding.This is to our knowledge the first combined study, using both BIAcore and titration calorimetry analyses of ligand binding, of a growth factor receptor from the insulin-like growth factor family of tyrosine kinase receptors.RESULTSThe extracellular portion of the receptor was produced as a soluble secreted molecule with an affinity handle fused to the C-terminal end. The use of the Z affinity tail has been successfully implemented in the production of a large variety of proteins in various prokaryotic production systems (38Nilsson B. Abrahmsén L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 144-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and is in this report used in a eucaryotic host system.Cloning/SequencingThe receptor was cloned and sequenced in the production vector pKGE 978, and the sequence was found to be fully in agreement with the published sequence (7Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar).Cell GrowthHuman primary kidney 293 cells were transfected for transient expression of the IGF-I receptor. In addition, 293 clones expressing the receptor were selected for establishment of stable cell lines. The selected 293 cell line yielded high and stable expression combined with a minimum of proteolytic degradation.Protein CharacterizationThe small scale cell growth used in the initial experiments, up to 50-ml flasks, gave a production yield ranging from 1 to 5 mg of IgG-purified sIGF-IR-Z/liter of conditioned media. The purity of the receptor was determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3A). Detection of the Z affinity handle using peroxidase anti-peroxidase staining (Fig. 3B) reveals a single band in the unreduced sample (lane B2) corresponding in size to full-length soluble receptor. In the reduced sample (lane B1), a band corresponding to the size of the β-Z-chain is stained. No additional bands, and therefore no detectable degradation products, containing the Z tail were found. The determined amino acid composition corresponds to what is expected from theoretical values (data not shown). Five cycles of N-terminal sequencing revealed two different sequences corresponding to a correctly processed α-chain N terminus after signal peptide removal and a postcleavage β-chain N terminus, respectively.Fig. 3A, representation of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of IGF-IR-Z.

This analysis is based on the fact that the α-α interchain (class I) disulfides are more susceptible to reduction than intrachain (class II) disulfides (20Sweet L.J. Morrison B.D. Wilden P.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16730-16738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limited reduction results in the appearance of α-β′-Z in addition to the parent (α-β′-Z)2 receptor. The gel in Fig. 3A shows the presence of one species in the unreduced sample (lane A2), corresponding approximately to the size of (α-β′-Z)2 receptor. The totally reduced sample (lane A1) exhibits two bands of approximately 134 and 70 kDa, corresponding to α- and β′-Z chains, respectively. The partially reduced sample (lane A3) shows the presence of two bands corresponding to nonreduced receptor and a band of intermediate molecular mass, 180 kDa, which may correspond to the α-β′-Z half receptor. The molecular masses determined may deviate from theoretical values due to changes in gel mobility originating from glycosylation and different levels of intrachain reduction in the samples as well as possible charge differences originating from the alkylating agent.Glycosylation analysis of the receptor reveals a sugar content of 26.1% by mass. The composition of associated sugars is as follows: fucose, 2.2.%; mannose, 7.7%; galactose, 4.6%; and glucosamine, 9.6%. The sialic acid component was found to be 2%. Total molecular mass based on the theoretical molecular mass, derived from amino acid composition plus sugar content, is 280 kDa for the (α-β′-Z)2 receptor. Attempts to determine the molecular mass of the complete receptor assembly using mass spectrometry did not succeed using either laser desorption or electrospray methodology.Laser light-scattering analysis of both free and ligand-complexed receptor indicates an apparent hydrodynamic radius slightly larger than expected from theoretical calculations. The calculated molecular mass of free receptor at 25 °C was approximately 370 kDa, and the mass of the complex was 410 kDa. The determined value may differ up to 20% from the actual value in this analysis. From the light scattering data the receptor was found to be monodisperse, indicating a homogenous receptor population. The difference in size between free and complexed receptor is much larger than the actual size of the ligand (7.5 kDa) and may reflect different deviations from the theoretical globular shape assumed in the calculation of molecular mass.Circular DichroismCD spectroscopy was used to detect possible changes in secondary structure content upon ligand binding. The far-UV spectra of free and ligated receptor are shown in Fig. 4A. The spectrum of the free IGF-I ligand is subtracted from the complexed receptor spectrum. Calculations of the secondary structure components using VARSLC1 variable selection suggest a structure content for the free receptor of 13%α-helical, 26% anti-parallel β-sheet, 9% parallel β-sheet, 18% turn, and 35% unstructured. Spectra of IGF-IR-Z complexed with an excess of ligand (IGF-I) (spectra of the ligand subtracted) reveal small but reproducible differences over the wavelength range suggesting that these differences observed are a direct consequence of binding IGF-I to its receptor. There is a decrease in negative ellipticity for the complex over the entire range. The calculated structural element content of complexed receptor is 14%α-helical, 28% antiparallel β-sheet, 7% parallel β-sheet, 20% turn, and 31% unstructured. The absolute values of secondary structure may contain added uncertainties due to contribution to negative ellipticity from associated oligosaccharides below 210 nm.Fig. 4A, superposition of the far-UV CD spectra of free (dotted line) and ligand-complexed (solid line) receptor. The signal of free IGF-I is subtracted from the ligated spectra to show the signal of receptor only.

In contrast to the far-UV spectra, there is an increase in negative ellipticity upon ligand binding in the near-UV spectra. The negative ellipticity at 217 nm is decreased by 9%, and at 286 nm it is increased by 57%. The near-UV spectra is sensitive to aromatic side chain positions and cysteine bridge conformations.Ligand Binding AssayThe binding displacement of radiolabeled IGF-I to purified IGF-IR-Z, using IGF-I as a tracer, is shown in Fig. 5. The half-maximal inhibiting concentration (IC50) value calculated from the binding curve is 0.5 nM.Fig. 5Competition binding curve of 125I-IGF-I binding to IGF-IR-Z, using IGF-I as a tracer. The IC50 value is estimated to approximately 0.5 nM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biosensor AnalysisBIAcore kinetic measurements were performed for a series of known ligands to the IGF-IR: IGF-I, IGF-II, des(1-3)-IGF-I, and insulin. IGF-IR-Z was immobilized, and sensorgrams for the different ligand interactions are shown in Fig. 6. A summary of the calculated rate and equilibrium constants is found in Table I. IGF-I affinity was determined in three separate runs using duplicate injections of each concentration, and affinity for the other ligands was determined in one run, also using duplicate injections. The cumulative error in the determined association constants from all runs was estimated to be less than 12%, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the errors in amino acid analysis, pipetting, and data fitting. Determined kinetic parameters (Table I) indicate that differences in both association rates and disassociation rates underlie the observed differences in calculated association equilibrium constants for the tested ligands. The des(1-3)-IGF-I variant has an association rate that is about 1.5 times faster than that of native IGF-I, while the association rate for IGF-II is about 2.8-fold slower than IGF-I. IGF-I and des(1-3)-IGF-I have similar disassociation rates, while that of IGF-II is 2 times faster than that of IGF-I. The insulin association was too slow to be determined, using BIAcore technology at the conditions used. Ligand association was analyzed for insulin at concentrations up to 500 times higher (0.17 mM) than those used for IGF-I. The differences in disassociation rate between the ligands are less pronounced, insulin excluded, than the association rates. The data for insulin disassociation is best fitted to a two-site model in contrast to the other ligands. Out of the two distinct disassociation rates, one is 100 times faster than that of IGF-I, 180 (s−1·10−3) and the other is 10 times faster, 18 (s−1·10−3). The calculated association equilibrium constants for IGF-IR-Z are thus about 2-fold higher for des(1-3)-IGF-I than for native IGF-I, while the value for IGF-II is about 5-fold less, accounted for both by slower association and faster release from the receptor.Fig. 6Biosensor analysis of ligand binding to immobilized IGF-IR-Z. The sensorgrams showing the relative response in resonance units after background subtraction versus time in seconds are recorded for the following ligands: IGF-I (A), des(1-3)-IGF-I (B), IGF-II (C), and insulin (D).

Open table in a new tab Titration Microcalorimetry for IGF-I Binding to IGF-IR-ZThe measured heats of binding were at all temperatures exothermic. The largest heat was obtained at the first injection at each titration series and ranged from 30 to 65 μJ (Fig. 7). At 15 and 25 °C, the measured heat values in the PBS buffer were below the limit of accurate determination of equilibrium constants. However, due to the larger enthalpy at 37 °C in PBS and at 25 °C in HBS, data could be fitted to a 1:1 binding model with acceptable statistical output (Fig. 8). Other thermodynamic binding models, e.g. models including a complex with stoichiometry of 1:2 or 2:1 (IGF-1:IGF-IR-Z), were also tested to establish the most probable thermodynamic model for the binding process. These other models could be disregarded based on statistical analysis. At 15 and 25 °C in PBS buffer, the enthalpies of binding were calculated from total integral heats. The results from the titration calorimetric experiments are summarized in Table II. The results from the analysis of the thermodynamic data are listed in Table III. The thermodynamic properties are dominated by the large negative heat capacity. This is typical for protein-protein interactions in which the hydration of nonpolar residues is reduced. Due to the large heat capacity change, the enthalpy and the entropy are strongly temperature-dependent. As outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” the large negative heat capacity change can be explained by dehydration of large hydrophobic surface areas. The large and negative enthalpy also implies a strong temperature dependence of the affinity constant, which indeed can be observed by the difference in affinities at 25 and 37 °C. The number of linked protons in the reaction was determined to be −(1)3.1 at pH 7.4. Important contributions to the entropy change upon binding comes from the solvent, βShyd, stemming from the burial of hydrophobic groups in the binding process and due to a decrease in the conformational degree of freedom in the IGF-I and IGF-IR-Z molecules. This contribution was calculated to be −(1)131 cal K−1 mol−1 in total, at 25 °C. For the IGF-I·sIGF-IR-Z system, there is no detailed structural information at hand. Thus, it is not possible to account for any specific ion interactions due to deprotonation of amino acids. Additional structural information can to some extent revise the sizes of the contributions to the different thermodynamic properties. However, since the major contributions to enthalpy and heat capacity stems from changes in hydration of the two proteins, the general features of the contributions to the thermodynamic properties can be judged to be valid within the experimental uncertainties.Fig. 7Power-time curve for 25 injections of 64 μM IGF-I, each of 3.5 μl, into the microcalorimetric vessel containing 900 μl of 4.3 μM IGF-IR-Z in HBS at pH 7.4 and 25 °C.

Apart from the binding surface areas of IGF-I and IGF-IR-Z, the large change in total accessible surface area can have its origin in changes in hydration of the proteins due to conformational changes. The accessible surface area for free IGF-I is 4070 å2, based on the NMR minimum average structure (39Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Cambell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the Lee and Richards algorithm (40Lee B. Richards R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar) implemented in the program INSIGHT (Biosym).DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have described the ligand binding properties of recombinant sIGF-IR. The detailed characterization of the IGF-IR ectodomain in terms of ligand binding kinetic properties, secondary structure analysis, and thermodynamic properties, with the finding of specific proton release and receptor conformational changes, as well as the 1:1 receptor:ligand stoichiometry, are important contributions to the understanding of the IGF-I molecule signaling mechanism and specificity.The titration microcalorimetry-derived thermodynamic parameters, and in particular the large entropy loss upon ligand binding, are consistent with a conformational stabilization induced by ligand binding. Part of this stabilization could be induced by a conformational change. The titration microcalorimetry data presented here suggest that some 4700 å2 get depleted of water when IGF-I binds to IGF-IRZ. This can be either through the burial of binding surfaces on both the ligand and the receptor or from structural changes leading to a reduction of solvent exposed surface in either of the molecules. Assuming rigid molecules, this would mean that more than half ((4675/2)/4070 = 0.57) of IGF-I gets buried upon binding. This is an unlikely large portion of the molecule, supporting the hypothesis that a conformational change does occur in the receptor. The CD analysis of the IGF-I receptor ectodomain suggests that the secondary structure of the receptor changes upon ligand binding. The far-UV CD spectra of free and IGF-I-ligated IGF-IR-Z show small changes in negative ellipticity (Fig. 4), and the near-UV spectral changes are somewhat larger, but in both ranges the changes are reproducible and significant. The difference in the spectra between the complex and the sum of the signals of free receptor and free ligand indicates that changes in position of aromatic side chains and, possibly, cysteine bridge dihedral angels occur in the receptor ectodomains upon ligand association. These changes could be due to secondary structural changes, quaternary structural changes, or both (41Cooper C.M. Woody W.W. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain has been determined using protein crystallography (6Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the activation of the tyrosine kinase involves intradomain transphosphorylation made possible by induced close contact of the domains and structural rearrangements in the protein kinase active site region. Thus, it seems possible that signal transduction across the membrane is the result of a ligand-induced quaternary structural change. The nature of this change may, for instance, involve a scissors-like movement of the receptor chains, a twist of the chains, or a combination of these movements. Binding of ligand to both IGF-I and insulin receptors is proposed to involve negative cooperativity (42De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The mechanism has been suggested to involve the presence of both high and low affinity binding sites on each α subunit. A ligand might bind to a high affinity site on one subunit inducing conformational changes enabling the ligand to bridge the two subunits by also binding to the low affinity site on the second subunit. Our studies on IGF-IR-Z give a stoichiometry of 1:1 (IGF-I:(α-β′-Z)2) with high affinity, which coul"
https://openalex.org/W2062178963,"We have studied the role of autocrine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling on antiestrogen-mediated growth inhibition of hormone-dependent T47D and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. Tamoxifen treatment increased the secretion of TGF-β activity into serum-free cell medium and the cellular content of affinity cross-linked type I and III TGF-β receptors in both cell lines. Anti-pan-TGF-β antibodies did not block anti-estrogen-induced recruitment in G<sub>1</sub> and inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of both cell lines. Early passage MCF-7 cells, which exhibit detectable type II TGF-β receptors at the cell surface and exquisite sensitivity to exogenous TGF-β1, were transfected with a tetracycline-controllable dominant-negative TGF-βRII (ΔRII) construct. Although the TGF-β1 response was blocked by removal of tetracycline in MCF-7/ΔRII cells, tamoxifen-mediated suppression of Rb phosphorylation, recruitment in G<sub>1</sub>, and inhibition of cell proliferation were identical in the presence and absence of tetracycline. TGF-β1 treatment up-regulated the Cdk inhibitor p21 and induced its association with Cdk2 in MCF-7 cells; these responses were blocked by the ΔRII transgene product. In MCF-7 cells with a functional TGF-β signaling pathway, tamoxifen did not up-regulate p21 nor did it induce association of p21 with Cdk2, suggesting alternative mechanisms for antiestrogen-mediated cytostasis. Finally, transfection of late-passage, TGF-β1 unresponsive MCF-7 cells with high levels of TGF-βRII restored TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition but did not enhance tamoxifen response in culture. Taken together these data strongly argue against any role for TGF-β signaling on tamoxifen-mediated growth inhibition of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells."

These single fingers are most similar to the second zinc fingers of vertebrate GATA factors, and accordingly, the latter have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for most of the DNA binding specificity of vertebrate GATA factors (11Martin D.I.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 12Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell.

For example, GATA-1/2/3 are all expressed (albeit not exclusively) in hematopoietic cells, whereas GATA-4/5/6 are all expressed (albeit not exclusively) in the heart. Insights into the biological relevance of GATA factor expression have recently been obtained using a variety of approaches, including gene disruption assays in transgenic mice. In particular, mice that fail to express GATA-1 or GATA-2 exhibit lethal hematopoietic defects (13Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.-F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F.

Similarly, it has been determined that GATA-4 expression is required for embryonal stem cells to differentiate either into cardiac myocytes or into primitive endoderm in cell culture (16Grépin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Soudais C. Bielinska M. Heikinheimo M. MacArthur C.A. Narita N. Saffitz J.E. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Wilson D.B. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar).As noted above, the gata-4/5/6 genes have overlapping, but not identical, expression patterns. Whereas all three of these genes are expressed in myocardial and endocardial cells, the gata-5/6 genes are also robustly expressed in gut epithelial cells, and the gata-6 gene is additionally expressed in the liver, lung, and ovary (6Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a initial step toward determining the molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression of GATA-5 in the heart and gut, we cloned and characterized the chicken gata-5 gene. Somewhat surprisingly, the structure of this gene was found to differ markedly from the otherwise conserved gata-1/2/3 genes, which serves to highlight yet another distinction between these two subgroups of vertebrate GATA factors.Even more surprising, we found that the chicken gata-5 gene is differentially expressed from two alternative first exons. Moreover, the respective transcripts yield mRNAs for two distinct isoforms of GATA-5. One of these isoforms is novel for a vertebrate GATA factor in that it has a DNA-binding domain composed of a single zinc finger. The functional properties of this novel GATA-5 isoform were assayed in some detail and are compared with the properties of the major isoform of GATA-5 that we previously described (6Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe six GATA factors that have been identified from vertebrate species can be grouped into two distinct subfamilies (i.e. GATA-1/2/3 and GATA-4/5/6) on the basis of cDNA sequence comparisons as well as expression profile comparisons. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising to find that a member of the GATA-4/5/6 subfamily has a gene structure that is distinct from the conserved gata-1/2/3 gene structure. On the other hand, the extent to which these gene structures differ is rather remarkable. Indeed, only two features are conserved across these two subfamilies, i.e. noncoding first exons and comparable second zinc finger exons (Fig. 10). Assuming that the two GATA subfamilies were founded by the duplication of an ancestral gene, the fact that the gata-4/5/6 gene structures are similar to each other 2C. Z. He and C. MacNeill, unpublished result. but distinct from the gata-1/2/3 gene structures implies that a total of three introns must have been lost or gained from the gata-1/2/3 ancestral gene and/or from the gata-4/5/6 ancestral gene prior to the expansions of the respective subfamilies. Thus, the ancestral gata-1/2/3 and/or gata-4/5/6 genes presumably existed for a long period of evolution before each spawned multiple progeny.Two of the introns that are unique to the gata-4/5/6 gene subfamily (introns 5 and 6; see Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10) appear to coincide with the boundaries of functional domains. For example, based on structural studies carried out with GATA-1 (28Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we infer that intron 5 maps precisely to the carboxyl-terminal end of the minimal DNA-binding domain of the second zinc finger of GATA-5. It is also interesting that introns 5 and 6 delimit a domain that is rich in PEST residues (66% of the residues in exon 6 are Pro, Glu, Ser, Thr, or Asp), which suggests that this domain may be a determinant of GATA-5 instability (29Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). In support of this conjecture, we note that the PEST-rich amino acid composition (but not primary sequence) for this exon is conserved within the GATA-4/5/6 subfamily.As noted above, noncoding first exons are a common feature of vertebrate gata genes. Moreover, alternative first exons have been identified for both the mouse gata-1 gene (23Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and the chicken gata-5 gene (this report). The gata-1 gene first exons are differentially transcribed in erythroid cells and in the testis. Since these alternative noncoding exons are each spliced to a common second exon, the same GATA-1 protein is encoded in both cell types. In the case of the gata-5 gene, however, transcripts that include the distal first exon are preferentially spliced to the third exon, which results in an mRNA that encodes a novel single-zinc finger isoform of GATA-5. So far as we are aware, this is the first evidence of a single-zinc finger GATA factor being encoded in a vertebrate species. On the other hand, a novel (albeit two-zinc finger) GATA-1 isoform has been reported to result from the use of an internal translational initiation site (30Calligaris R. Bottardi S. Cogoi S. Apezteguia I. Santoro C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Since mutational studies have revealed that the second zinc fingers of other vertebrate GATA factors are necessary and sufficient for binding to consensus GATA sites (12Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Yang Z. Gu L. Romeo P.-H. Bories D. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Engel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2201-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the truncated isoform of GATA-5 can also bind to these sites. However, since the DNA binding specificities of normal and mutant (single-zinc finger) GATA factors are not identical, we presume that the two naturally occurring GATA-5 isoforms will similarly be found to have somewhat distinct binding specificities. We are in the process of using a site selection protocol to test this prediction.Based on the results of cotransfection assays (Fig. 9) and an in situ assay of epitope-tagged GATA-5 isoforms (data not shown), we infer that the truncated isoform has a nuclear localization signal. Whereas GATA-1 and GATA-3 appear to have multiple nuclear localization signals (12Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Yang Z. Gu L. Romeo P.-H. Bories D. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Engel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2201-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Visvader J.E. Crossley M. Hill J. Orkin S.H. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the short stretches of basic amino acids that resemble consensus nuclear localization signals are not conserved between these GATA factors and GATA-4/5/6. For example, the RPKKR and KGKKK motifs that flank the second zinc finger of GATA-3 are replaced by KPQKR and KGKTS, respectively, in GATA-5. Conversely, a presumptive nuclear localization signal for GATA-5 (RKRKPK; located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the second zinc finger) is not conserved for GATA-1/2/3. Furthermore, based on structural studies (28Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we infer that this RKRKPK motif probably also functions as an essential determinant for binding to consensus WGATAR sites.We have shown that the single-zinc finger isoform of GATA-5 is compromised with respect to its ability to transactivate a simple reporter construct. Whereas single-zinc finger mutants of GATA-1 are also compromised with respect to their ability to transactivate simple target genes in cotransfection assays, these mutant factors can still cause early myeloid cells to differentiate into megakaryocytes in cell culture (32Visvader J.E. Crossley M. Hill J. Orkin S.H. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a single-zinc finger GATA factor from Aspergillus nidulans can rescue erythroid differentiation in GATA-1-deficient embryonic stem cells (33Blobel G.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we presume that the single-zinc finger GATA-5 isoform can regulate critical subsets of GATA target genes in the tissues in which it is expressed.Finally, it may be noteworthy that the mRNAs for both isoforms of GATA-5 contain short open reading frames in their 5′-untranslated regions (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Based on the ribosome scanning model (27Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar), these short open reading frames would be expected to impair the efficiency of translation initiation at the downstream (GATA-5) open reading frames. This may allow yet another level of regulation for differentially expressing these GATA-5 isoforms (34Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 35Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Reynolds K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, since these upstream open reading frames were included in the respective GATA-5 expression vectors (Fig. 8, Fig. 9), it is clear that these open reading frames do not preclude expression of these isoforms.

Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells.

A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88-(Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 ~ 20–40 μM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83–88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope.

Expression of an Ihh mutant demonstrated that the internal translation initiation site was sufficient to produce the mature forms of Ihh. Ihh post-translational processing proceeded in a fashion similar to Sonic and Drosophila hedgehog; the unprocessed form underwent signal peptide cleavage as well as internal proteolytic processing to form a 19-kDa amino-terminal peptide and a 26-kDa carboxyl-terminal peptide. This processing required His313 present in a conserved serine protease motif.

To further investigate the DNA binding specificity of α2 in complex with Mcm1, symmetric substitutions at each position in the α2 half-sites of AMSC were constructed and assayed for their effect on repression in vivo and DNA binding affinity in vitro. As expected, substitutions at positions in which there are base-specific contacts decrease the level of repression. Interestingly, substitutions at other positions, in which there are no apparent base-specific contacts made by the protein in the α2-DNA co-crystal structure, also significantly decrease repression. As an alternative method to examining the DNA binding specificity of α2, we performed in vitro α2 binding site selection experiments in the presence and absence of Mcm1. In the presence of Mcm1, the consensus sequences obtained were extended and more closely related to the natural α2 sites than the consensus sequence obtained in the absence of Mcm1.

INTRODUCTIONScorpion venoms consist of complex mixtures of several toxins that exhibit various pharmacological activities including selective actions at sodium and potassium channels, which are the major molecular targets of scorpion toxins (1Mebs D. Hucho F. Shier W.T. Mebs D. Handbook of Toxinology. Marcel Dekker, New York1990: 493-600Google Scholar). The scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch is widely distributed in China (2Song D.X. Lu X.X. Shang J.W. Bulletin of Biology (China). 1982; 1: 22-25Google Scholar), but relatively few reports have been published on the biological properties of its venom (MKV) 1The abbreviations used are:MKVButhus martensi Karsch venomMkTx Imakatoxin IACManococcygeus muscleL-NAMENω-nitro-L-arginine methyl esterNOnitric oxideFSfield stimulation. or toxins. Electrophysiological studies indicate that MKV contains some neurotoxic compounds that possibly act on the Na1+ channels in the excitable membrane of nerve and muscle (3Shih Y.L. Xu Y.Z. Xu K. Acta Physiol. Sin. 1982; 34: 428-433Google Scholar), cultured mouse cardiomyocyte (4Qi H. Zhong G.G. Chen L. Jiang Y. Wei J.J. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 1993; 14: 361-364Google Scholar), and rat anterior pituitary cells (5Bauer C.K. Krylov B. Zhou P.A. Schwarz J.R. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).In a preliminary study we observed that MKV produced relaxant responses of the rat precontracted anococcygeus muscle (ACM), suggesting that some constituent toxin(s) present in MKV could mimic the effects of nitrergic transmission involving the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO). 2J. P. Gong, M. C. E. Gwee, and P. Gopalakrishnakone, unpublished observation. Therefore, we were interested in isolating and purifying the bioactive component(s) present in the venom as well as identifying and characterizing the pure toxin(s) mediating the relaxant responses of the rat ACM. In this communication we report the isolation, purification, and complete amino acid sequence of a novel toxin, MkTx I, isolated from the venom of B. martensi Karsch and provide the first documentation of some novel nitrergic actions mediated by a scorpion toxin.DISCUSSIONMkTx I is structurally homologous to other scorpion toxins so far described: (a) it consists of one single chain of 64 residues cross-linked by 4 disulfide bridges; and (b) it lacks methionine, phenylalanine, and histidine. MkTx I belongs to the α-type scorpion toxin group; it has a short J-loop (from Cys-16 to Cys-22) and a long B-loop (From Cys-36 to Cys-46) (14Simard J.M. Watt D.D. Polis G.A. The Biology of Scorpions. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA1990: 414-444Google Scholar). Furthermore, it displayed a very high similarity with toxins of group 3 (Fig. 4B) according to the classification of Rochat et al. (15Rochat H. Bernard P. Couraud F. Adv. Cytopharmacol. 1979; 3: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). In this group, MkTx I has highest homology with Bot II from North African scorpion B. occitanus tunetanus venom. However, it differed significantly from those of β-type neurotoxins isolated from the venoms of North American and South American scorpions. For example, Css II showed only 25% similarity with MkTx I. Moreover, MkTx I has 5 aspartic acid and 5 asparagine residues with 1 glutamic acid and 1 glutamine residue, in contrast to β-type scorpion toxins that contain more glutamic acid and glutamine residues than aspartic acid and asparagine residues (16Mcintosh M.E. Watt D.D. De Vries A. Kochva E. Toxins of Animal and Plant Origin. Gordon and Breach, New York1973: 529-544Google Scholar, 17Possani D.L. Fletcher L.P. Alagon B.C.A. Alagon A.C. Julia Z.J. Toxicon. 1980; 18: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The marked relaxant responses of the carbachol-precontracted ACM to MkTx I, like the nitrergic (relaxant) responses to FS, were effectively blocked by 50 μM L-NAME, a stereoselective inhibitor of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase involved in the synthesis of NO from L-arginine and oxygen (18Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 19Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). The relaxant responses of the ACM produced by MkTx I are therefore also likely to be NO-mediated because there is now strong evidence that implicates NO as the inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in nitrergic transmission (20Li C.G. Rand M.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1989; 16: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and, consequently, in mediating the relaxant responses of the ACM (21Martin W. Gillespie J.S. Bell C. Novel Peripheral Neurotransmitters. Pergamon, New York1991: 65-79Google Scholar, 22Rand M.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmac. Physiol. 1992; 19: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Unlike the relaxant responses of the ACM to FS and MkTx I, the relaxant responses of the ACM to sodium nitroprusside, an agent that directly releases its NO via metabolism (23Kowaluk E.A. Seth P. Fung H.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 916-922PubMed Google Scholar), were not blocked by L-NAME. This provides further evidence for the involvement of endogenous NO released prejunctionally in mediating the relaxant responses of the ACM to MkTx I.In conclusion, a novel toxin MkTx I with nitrergic actions has been purified from the venom of the scorpion B. martensi Karsch, and the novel nitrergic actions of MKV in the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle can be attributed, at least in part, to the actions of the pure toxin MkTx I present in the venom.

Immunoblot analysis showed that the mature Rml2p is a 37-kDa polypeptide component of the mitochondrial 54 S large ribosomal subunit. Null mutants of <i>RML2</i> are respiration-deficient and convert to [<i>rho</i><sup>−</sup>] or [rho°] cytoplasmic petites, indicating that Rml2p is essential for mitochondrial translation. <i>RML2</i> is regulated transcriptionally in response to carbon source and the accumulation of Rml2p is dependent on the presence of the 21 S large rRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that a highly conserved 7-amino acid sequence (Val<sup>336</sup> to Asp<sup>342</sup>) of Rml2p is essential for function. Substitution of Gln for His-343, the most highly conserved histidine in the L2 protein family, caused cold-sensitive respiratory growth but did not affect the assembly of 54 S ribosomal subunits. Mitochondrial protein synthesis was normal in the His<sup>343</sup> to Gln (H343Q) mutant grown at the permissive temperature (30 °C) and was severely impaired after growth at the nonpermissive temperature (18 °C). His<sup>343</sup> corresponds to His<sup>229</sup> in <i>Escherichia coli</i> L2, which has been implicated in a direct involvement in peptidyl transferase activity. The conditional phenotype of the H343Q mutant indicates that His<sup>343</sup> is not essential for peptidyl transferase activity in yeast mitochondria."
