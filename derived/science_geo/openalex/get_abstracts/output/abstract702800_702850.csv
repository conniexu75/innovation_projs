https://openalex.org/W4306902108,"Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa. In May 2022, dozens of non-endemic countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases, most with no epidemiological link to Africa. We identified two lineages of monkeypox virus (MPXV) among two 2021 and seven 2022 US monkeypox cases: the major 2022 outbreak variant called B.1 and a minor contemporaneously sampled variant called A.2. Analyses of mutations among these two variants revealed an extreme preference for GA-to-AA mutations indicative of human APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity among Clade IIb MPXV (previously West African, Nigeria) sampled since 2017. Such mutations were not enriched within other MPXV clades. These findings suggest that APOBEC3 editing may be a recurrent and a dominant driver of MPXV evolution within the current outbreak."

We show that hybrid immunity or vaccine boosters elicit plasma-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5, and that breakthrough infections, but not vaccination alone, induce neutralizing antibodies in the nasal mucosa. Consistent with immunological imprinting, most antibodies derived from memory B cells or plasma cells of Omicron breakthrough cases cross-react with the Wuhan-Hu-1, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 receptor-binding domains, whereas Omicron primary infections elicit B cells of narrow specificity up to 6 months after infection. Although most clinical antibodies have reduced neutralization of Omicron, we identified an ultrapotent pan-variant–neutralizing antibody that is a strong candidate for clinical development."

Highly sensitive spectral measurement using a single detector allows the footprints of such spectrometers to be scaled down while achieving spectral resolution approaching that of benchtop systems. We report a high-performance computational spectrometer based on a single van der Waals junction with an electrically tunable transport-mediated spectral response. We achieve high peak wavelength accuracy (∼0.36 nanometers), high spectral resolution (∼3 nanometers), broad operation bandwidth (from ∼405 to 845 nanometers), and proof-of-concept spectral imaging. Our approach provides a route toward ultraminiaturization and offers unprecedented performance in accuracy, resolution, and operation bandwidth for single-detector computational spectrometers."
https://openalex.org/W4306902074,"High-performance pervaporation membranes have potential in industrial separation applications, but overcoming the permeability-selectivity trade-off is a challenge. We report a strategy to create highly flexible metal-organic framework nanosheet (MOF-NS) membranes with a faveolate structure on polymer substrates for alcohol-water separation. The controlled growth followed by a surface-coating method effectively produced flexible and defect-free superhydrophobic MOF-NS membranes. The reversible deformation of the flexible MOF-NS and the vertical interlamellar pathways were captured with electron microscopy. Molecular simulations confirmed the structure and revealed transport mechanism. The ultrafast transport channels in MOF-NS exhibited an ultrahigh flux and a separation factor of 8.9 in the pervaporation of 5 weight % ethanol-water at 40°C, which can be used for biofuel recovery. MOF-NS and polydimethylsiloxane synergistically contribute to the separation performance."
https://openalex.org/W4306895280,"Misalignment of feeding rhythms with the light-dark cycle leads to disrupted peripheral circadian clocks and obesity. Conversely, restricting feeding to the active period mitigates metabolic syndrome through mechanisms that remain unknown. We found that genetic enhancement of adipocyte thermogenesis through ablation of the zinc finger protein 423 (ZFP423) attenuated obesity caused by consumption of a high-fat diet during the inactive (light) period by increasing futile creatine cycling in mice. Circadian control of adipocyte creatine metabolism underlies the timing of diet-induced thermogenesis, and enhancement of adipocyte circadian rhythms through overexpression of the clock activator brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) ameliorated metabolic complications during diet-induced obesity. These findings uncover rhythmic creatine-mediated thermogenesis as an essential mechanism that drives metabolic benefits during time-restricted feeding."
https://openalex.org/W4306902103,"In the mitochondrial outer membrane, α-helical transmembrane proteins play critical roles in cytoplasmic-mitochondrial communication. Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we identified mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), and its paralog MTCH1, and showed that it is required for insertion of biophysically diverse tail-anchored (TA), signal-anchored, and multipass proteins, but not outer membrane β-barrel proteins. Purified MTCH2 was sufficient to mediate insertion into reconstituted proteoliposomes. Functional and mutational studies suggested that MTCH2 has evolved from a solute carrier transporter. MTCH2 uses membrane-embedded hydrophilic residues to function as a gatekeeper for the outer membrane, controlling mislocalization of TAs into the endoplasmic reticulum and modulating the sensitivity of leukemia cells to apoptosis. Our identification of MTCH2 as an insertase provides a mechanistic explanation for the diverse phenotypes and disease states associated with MTCH2 dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4306895629,"The predominant mutation causing cystic fibrosis, a deletion of phenylalanine 508 (Δ508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leads to severe defects in CFTR biogenesis and function. The advanced therapy Trikafta combines the folding corrector tezacaftor (VX-661), the channel potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770), and the dual-function modulator elexacaftor (VX-445). However, it is unclear how elexacaftor exerts its effects, in part because the structure of Δ508 CFTR is unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of Δ508 CFTR in the absence and presence of CFTR modulators. When used alone, elexacaftor partially rectified interdomain assembly defects in Δ508 CFTR, but when combined with a type I corrector, did so fully. These data illustrate how the different modulators in Trikafta synergistically rescue Δ508 CFTR structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W4306895317,"Full-grown oocytes are transcriptionally silent and must stably maintain the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) needed for oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic development. However, where and how mammalian oocytes store maternal mRNAs is unclear. Here, we report that mammalian oocytes accumulate mRNAs in a mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain (MARDO). MARDO assembly around mitochondria was promoted by the RNA-binding protein ZAR1 and directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth. MARDO foci coalesced into hydrogel-like matrices that clustered mitochondria. Maternal mRNAs stored in the MARDO were translationally repressed. Loss of ZAR1 disrupted the MARDO, dispersed mitochondria, and caused a premature loss of MARDO-localized mRNAs. Thus, a mitochondria-associated membraneless compartment controls mitochondrial distribution and regulates maternal mRNA storage, translation, and decay to ensure fertility in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4306902080,"Advanced machine learning models are currently impossible to run on edge devices such as smart sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles owing to constraints on power, processing, and memory. We introduce an approach to machine learning inference based on delocalized analog processing across networks. In this approach, named Netcast, cloud-based “smart transceivers” stream weight data to edge devices, enabling ultraefficient photonic inference. We demonstrate image recognition at ultralow optical energy of 40 attojoules per multiply (&lt;1 photon per multiply) at 98.8% (93%) classification accuracy. We reproduce this performance in a Boston-area field trial over 86 kilometers of deployed optical fiber, wavelength multiplexed over 3 terahertz of optical bandwidth. Netcast allows milliwatt-class edge devices with minimal memory and processing to compute at teraFLOPS rates reserved for high-power (&gt;100 watts) cloud computers."

The HCV envelope E1 and E2 glycoproteins are essential for viral entry and comprise the primary antigenic target for neutralizing antibody responses. The molecular mechanisms of E1E2 assembly, as well as how the E1E2 heterodimer binds broadly neutralizing antibodies, remain elusive. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the membrane-extracted full-length E1E2 heterodimer in complex with three broadly neutralizing antibodies—AR4A, AT1209, and IGH505—at ~3.5-angstrom resolution. We resolve the interface between the E1 and E2 ectodomains and deliver a blueprint for the rational design of vaccine immunogens and antiviral drugs."

We test for evidence of spillover benefits accruing from the world's largest fully protected MPA, Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Using species-specific data collected by independent fishery observers, we examine changes in catch rates for individual vessels near to and far from the MPA before and after its expansion in 2016. We find evidence of spillover benefits for yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus)."

https://openalex.org/W4306902093,"The near-universal genetic code defines the correspondence between codons in genes and amino acids in proteins. We refactored the structure of the genetic code in Escherichia coli and created orthogonal genetic codes that restrict the escape of synthetic genetic information into natural life. We developed orthogonal and mutually orthogonal horizontal gene transfer systems, which permit the transfer of genetic information between organisms that use the same genetic code but restrict the transfer of genetic information between organisms that use different genetic codes. Moreover, we showed that locking refactored codes into synthetic organisms completely blocks invasion by mobile genetic elements, including viruses, which carry their own translation factors and successfully invade organisms with canonical and compressed genetic codes."

https://openalex.org/W4306902090,"Adaptations to infectious and dietary pressures shape mammalian physiology and disease risk. How such adaptations affect sex-biased diseases remains insufficiently studied. In this study, we show that sex-dependent hepatic gene programs confer a robust (~300%) survival advantage for male mice during lethal bacterial infection. The transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), which masculinizes hepatic gene expression at puberty, is essential for this advantage. However, protection by BCL6 protein comes at a cost during conditions of dietary excess, which result in overt fatty liver and glucose intolerance in males. Deleting hepatic BCL6 reverses these phenotypes but markedly lowers male survival during infection, thus establishing a sex-dependent trade-off between host defense and metabolic systems. Our findings offer strong evidence that some current sex-biased diseases are rooted in ancient evolutionary trade-offs between immunity and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4306895300,"Butterfly wing patterns derive from a deeply conserved developmental ground plan yet are diverse and evolve rapidly. It is poorly understood how gene regulatory architectures can accommodate both deep homology and adaptive change. To address this, we characterized the cis-regulatory evolution of the color pattern gene WntA in nymphalid butterflies. Comparative assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and in vivo deletions spanning 46 cis-regulatory elements across five species revealed deep homology of ground plan-determining sequences, except in monarch butterflies. Furthermore, noncoding deletions displayed both positive and negative regulatory effects that were often broad in nature. Our results provide little support for models predicting rapid enhancer turnover and suggest that deeply ancestral, multifunctional noncoding elements can underlie rapidly evolving trait systems."

The cline in frequency of black-coated wolves ( Canis lupus ) across North America is hypothesized to result from a relationship with canine distemper virus (CDV) outbreaks. We tested this hypothesis using cross-sectional data from wolf populations across North America that vary in the prevalence of CDV and the allele that makes coats black, longitudinal data from Yellowstone National Park, and modeling. We found that the frequency of CDV outbreaks generates fluctuating selection that results in heterozygote advantage that in turn affects the frequency of the black allele, optimal mating behavior, and black wolf cline across the continent."

https://openalex.org/W4306898502,"Asthma is a life-threatening and chronic inflammatory lung disease that is posing a true global health challenge. The genetic basis of the disease is fairly well examined. However, the molecular crosstalk between microRNAs (miRNAs), target genes, and transcription factors (TFs) networks and their contribution to disease pathogenesis and progression is not well explored. Therefore, this study was aimed at dissecting the molecular network between mRNAs, miRNAs, and TFs using robust computational biology approaches. The transcriptomic data of bronchial epithelial cells of severe asthma patients and healthy controls was studied by different systems biology approaches like differentially expressed gene detection, functional enrichment, miRNA-target gene pairing, and mRNA-miRNA-TF molecular networking. We detected the differential expression of 1703 (673 up-and 1030 down-regulated) genes and 71 (41 up-and 30 down-regulated) miRNAs in the bronchial epithelial cells of asthma patients. The DEGs were found to be enriched in key pathways like IL-17 signaling (KEGG: 04657), Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation (KEGG: 04658), and the Th17 cell differentiation (KEGG: 04659) (p-values = 0.001). The results from miRNAs-target gene pairs-transcription factors (TFs) have detected the key roles of 3 miRs (miR-181a-2-3p; miR-203a-3p; miR-335-5p), 6 TFs (TFAM, FOXO1, GFI1, IRF2, SOX9, and HLF) and 32 miRNA target genes in eliciting autoimmune reactions in bronchial epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Through systemic implementation of comprehensive system biology tools, this study has identified key miRNAs, TFs, and miRNA target gene pairs as potential tissue-based asthma biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4306898506,"An effective method for evaluating the efficiency of peer decision-making units (DMUs) is data envelope analysis (DEA). In engineering sciences and real-world management problems, uncertainty in input and output data always exists. To achieve reliable results, uncertainties must be taken into account. In this research, a General Fuzzy (GF) approach is designed to cope with uncertainty in the presence of fuzzy observations for categorizing and specifying stability radius and alterations ranges of efficient and inefficient DMUs, which is applicable to real-world decision-making problems. For this purpose, a DEA sensitivity analysis model is presented, which will be modeled by fuzzy sets. Then, by applying the General Fuzzy (GF) approach, the fuzzy DEA sensitivity analysis model is transformed into the equivalent crisp form of fuzzy chance constraints according to specific confidence levels. Finally, a numerical example and a case study of branches of the social security organization are presented to illustrate sensitivity and stability analysis in the presence of fuzzy data. The obtained results provide the input and output changes of the evaluated units according to the attitude and preference of the decision maker with different confidence levels so that the data changes in the fuzzy environment do not change the units' classification from efficient to inefficient and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W4306901551,"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the rise of remote work with consequences for the global division of work. Remote work could connect labour markets, but it could also increase spatial polarisation. However, our understanding of the geographies of remote work is limited. Specifically, does remote work bring jobs to rural areas or is it concentrating in large cities, and how do skill requirements affect competition for jobs and wages? We use data from a fully remote labour market - an online labour platform - to show that remote work is polarised along three dimensions. First, countries are globally divided: North American, European, and South Asian remote workers attract most jobs, while many Global South countries participate only marginally. Secondly, remote jobs are pulled to urban regions; rural areas fall behind. Thirdly, remote work is polarised along the skill axis: workers with in-demand skills attract profitable jobs, while others face intense competition and obtain low wages. The findings suggest that remote work is shaped by agglomerative forces, which are deepening the gap between urban and rural areas. To make remote work an effective tool for rural development, it needs to be embedded in local skill-building and labour market programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4306901565,"Background Stakeholder engagement is important from the management point of view to capture knowledge, increase ownership, reduce conflict, encourage partnership, as well as to develop an ethical perspective that facilitates inclusive decision making and promotes equity. However, there is dearth of literature in the process of stakeholder engagement. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process of increasing stakeholder engagement and highlight the lessons learnt on stakeholder engagement while designing, implementing, and monitoring a study on diabetes and hypertension prevention in workplace settings in Nepal. Methodology We identified the stakeholders based on the 7P framework: Patients and public (clients), providers, payers, policy makers, product makers, principal investigators, and purchasers. The identified stakeholders were engaged in prioritization of the research questions, planning data collection, designing, implementing, and monitoring the intervention. Stakeholders were engaged through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, participatory workshops, individual consultation, information sessions and representation in study team and implementation committees. Results The views of the stakeholders were synthesized in each step of the research process, from designing to interpreting the results. Stakeholder engagement helped to shape the methods and plan, and process for participant’s recruitment and data collection. In addition, it enhanced adherence to intervention, mutual learning, and smooth intervention adoption. The major challenges were the time-consuming nature of the process, language barriers, and the differences in health and food beliefs between researchers and stakeholders. Conclusion It was possible to engage and benefit from stakeholder’s engagement on the design, implementation and monitoring of a workplace-based hypertension and diabetes management research program in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W4306810139,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) promotes cell survival and instigates breast tumor formation, and in the normal breast it also drives alveolar differentiation and lactogenesis. However, whether STAT5 drives a differentiated phenotype in breast tumorigenesis and therefore impacts cancer spread and metastasis is unclear. We found in two genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer that constitutively activated Stat5a (Stat5aca) caused precancerous mammary epithelial cells to become lactogenic and evolve into tumors with diminished potential to metastasize. We also showed that STAT5aca reduced the migratory and invasive ability of human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT5aca overexpression in human breast cancer cells lowered their metastatic burden in xenografted mice. Moreover, RPPA, Western blotting, and studies of ChIPseq data identified several EMT drivers regulated by STAT5. In addition, bioinformatic studies detected a correlation between STAT5 activity and better prognosis of breast cancer patients. Together, we conclude that STAT5 activation during mammary tumorigenesis specifies a tumor phenotype of lactogenic differentiation, suppresses EMT, and diminishes potential for subsequent metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4306898477,"To determine if the electrical heart axis in different types of congenital heart defects (CHD) differs from that of a healthy cohort at mid-gestation.Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-fECG) was performed in singleton pregnancies with suspected CHD between 16 and 30 weeks of gestation. The mean electrical heart axis (MEHA) was determined from the fetal vectorcardiogram after correction for fetal orientation. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the MEHA with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) in the frontal plane of all fetuses with CHD and the following subgroups: conotruncal anomalies (CTA), atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) and hypoplastic right heart syndrome (HRHS). The MEHA of the CHD fetuses as well as the subgroups was compared to the healthy control group using a spherically projected multivariate linear regression analysis. Discriminant analysis was applied to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the electrical heart axis for CHD detection.The MEHA was determined in 127 fetuses. The MEHA was 83.0° (95% CI: 6.7°; 159.3°) in the total CHD group, and not significantly different from the control group (122.7° (95% CI: 101.7°; 143.6°). The MEHA was 105.6° (95% CI: 46.8°; 164.4°) in the CTA group (n = 54), -27.4° (95% CI: -118.6°; 63.9°) in the AVSD group (n = 9) and 26.0° (95% CI: -34.1°; 86.1°) in the HRHS group (n = 5). The MEHA of the AVSD and the HRHS subgroups were significantly different from the control group (resp. p = 0.04 and p = 0.02). The sensitivity and specificity of the MEHA for the diagnosis of CHD was 50.6% (95% CI 47.5% - 53.7%) and 60.1% (95% CI 57.1% - 63.1%) respectively.The MEHA alone does not discriminate between healthy fetuses and fetuses with CHD. However, the left-oriented electrical heart axis in fetuses with AVSD and HRHS was significantly different from the control group suggesting altered cardiac conduction along with the structural defect.Clinical trial registration number: NL48535.015.14."

However, the long exposure to both the disease and ART has caused undesirable effects that compromise the physiological functioning and the quality of life of the subjects.To determine the body composition, physical fitness and habitual physical activity of children and adolescents living with HIV on ART.A total of 79 subjects of both genders aged 8-14 years, living with HIV in ART, selected by convenience participated in the study. The subjects underwent anthropometric assessment, physical fitness assessment and physical activity assessment.Relative to reference norms, the values of the anthropometric indicators fell below 50th percentile (height/age = 92.4%; BMI/age 72.2%; sum of skinfolds = 51.9%; arm circumference = 63.3%). The prevalence of ""low height/age"" and ""low weight/age"" was 34.9% and 9.3%, respectively for boys, and 27.9% and 11.1%, respectively for girls. With the exception of trunk flexibility (12.3%), most subjects were considered unfit in the physical fitness tests (abdominal resistance = 76.4%; handgrip strength = 75.4%; lower limb power = 66.4%). The percentage of subjects with insufficient physical activity was 45.5% for boys and 77.8% for girls. The values for all variables were consistently and significantly lower when compared with studies done in Mozambicans boys and girls without HIV+ from both urban and rural areas.The subjects participants in the study living with HIV and undergoing ART had impaired growth, low physical fitness and low levels of habitual physical activity in relation to the reference values of their peers without HIV, which compromised their physiological functioning and their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4306901524,"A Stock market collapse occurs when stock prices drop by more than 10% across all main indexes. Predicting a stock market crisis is difficult because of the increased volatility in the stock market. Stock price drops can be triggered by a variety of factors, including corporate results, geopolitical tensions, financial crises, and pandemic events. For scholars and investors, predicting a crisis is a difficult endeavor. We developed a model for the prediction of stock crisis using Hybridized Feature Selection (HFS) approach. Firstly, we went for the suggestion of the HFS method for the removal of stock's unnecessary financial attributes. The Naïve Bayes approach, on the other hand, is used for the classification of strong fundamental stocks. In the third step, Stochastic Relative Strength Index (StochRSI) is employed to identify a stock price bubble. In the fourth step, we identified the stock market crisis point in stock prices through moving average statistics. The fifth is the prediction of stock crises by using deep learning algorithms such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are implemented for assessing the performance of the models. The HFS-based GRU technique outperformed the HFS-based LSTM method to anticipate the stock crisis. To complete the task, the experiments used Pakistan datasets. The researchers can look at additional technical factors to forecast when a crisis would occur in the future. With a new optimizer, the GRU approach may be improved and fine-tuned even more."

Specifically, based on a graph structure suitable for electroencephalography as input, the proposed model can accurately represent the distribution of electroencephalography electrodes in non-Euclidean space and fully consider the spatial correlation between electrodes. In addition, the spatial-spectral-temporal multi-dimensional feature information was extracted from the spatial-temporal graph representation and spatial-spectral graph representation transformed from the original electroencephalography signal using the dual branch architecture. Finally, the attention mechanism and global feature aggregation module were designed and combined with graph convolution to adaptively capture the dynamic correlation intensity and effective feature of electroencephalography signals in various dimensions. A series of contrast experiments and ablation experiments on several different public brain-computer interface datasets demonstrated that the excellence of proposed method. It is worth mentioning that, the proposed model is a general framework for the classification of electroencephalography signals, which is suitable for emotion recognition, sleep staging and other fields based on electroencephalography research. Moreover, the model has the potential to be applied in the medical field of motion imagination rehabilitation in real life."
https://openalex.org/W4306901531,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated remarkable results in science and applied work. However, present AI models, developed to be run on computers but used in human-driven applications, create a visible disconnect between AI forms of processing and human ways of discovering and using knowledge. In this work, we introduce a new concept of ""Human Knowledge Models"" (HKMs), designed to reproduce human computational abilities. Departing from a vast body of cognitive research, we formalized the definition of HKMs into a new form of machine learning. Then, by training the models with human processing capabilities, we learned human-like knowledge, that humans can not only understand, but also compute, modify, and apply. We used several datasets from different applied fields to demonstrate the advantages of HKMs, including their high predictive power and resistance to noise and overfitting. Our results proved that HKMs can efficiently mine knowledge directly from the data and can compete with complex AI models in explaining the main data patterns. As a result, our study reveals the great potential of HKMs, particularly in the decision-making applications where ""black box"" models cannot be accepted. Moreover, this improves our understanding of how well human decision-making, modeled by HKMs, can approach the ideal solutions in real-life problems."

https://openalex.org/W4306901548,"Background Social media addiction, a recently emerged term in medical science, has attracted the attention of researchers because of its significant physical and psychological effects on its users. The issue has attracted more attention during the COVID era because negative emotions (e.g., anxiety and fear) generated from the COVID pandemic may have increased social media addiction. Therefore, the present study investigates the role of negative emotions and social media addiction (SMA) on health problems during and after the COVID lockdown. Methods A survey was conducted with 2926 participants aged between 25 and 45 years from all eight divisions of Bangladesh. The data collection period was between 2 nd September– 13 th October, 2020. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was conducted for data analysis by controlling the respondents’ working time, leisure time, gender, education, and age. Results Our study showed that social media addiction and time spent on social media impact health. Interestingly, while anxiety about COVID increased social media addition, fear about COIVD reduced social media addition. Among all considered factors, long working hours contributed most to people’s health issues, and its impact on social media addiction and hours was much higher than negative emotions. Furthermore, females were less addicted to social media and faced less health challenges than males. Conclusion The impacts of negative emotions generated by the COVID disaster on social media addiction and health issues should be reconsidered. Government and employers control people’s working time, and stress should be a priority to solve people’s social media addiction-related issues."
https://openalex.org/W4306901650,"Background The key for successful stroke upper-limb rehabilitation includes the personalization of therapeutic interventions based on patients’ functional ability and performance level. However, therapists often encounter challenges in supporting personalized rehabilitation due to the lack of information about how stroke survivors use their stroke-affected arm outside the clinic. Wearable technologies have been considered as an effective, objective solution to monitor patients’ arm use patterns in their naturalistic environments. However, these technologies have remained a proof of concept and have not been adopted as mainstream therapeutic products, and we lack understanding of how key stakeholders perceive the use of wearable technologies in their practice. Objective We aim to understand how stroke survivors and therapists perceive and envision the use of wearable sensors and arm activity data in practical settings and how we could design a wearable-based performance monitoring system to better support the needs of the stakeholders. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with four stroke survivors and 15 occupational therapists (OTs) based on real-world arm use data that we collected for contextualization. To situate our participants, we leveraged a pair of finger-worn accelerometers to collect stroke survivors’ arm use data in real-world settings, which we used to create study probes for stroke survivors and OTs, respectively. The interview data was analyzed using the thematic approach. Results Our study unveiled a detailed account of (1) the receptiveness of stroke survivors and OTs for using wearable sensors in clinical practice, (2) OTs’ envisioned strategies to utilize patient-generated sensor data in the light of providing patients with personalized therapy programs, and (3) practical challenges and design considerations to address for the accelerated integration of wearable systems into their practice. Conclusions These findings offer promising directions for the design of a wearable solution that supports OTs to develop individually-tailored therapy programs for stroke survivors to improve their affected arm use."

Additionally, the &lt;63 μm, 63–125 μm and 125–250 μm fractions of the fluvial sands from the different Balan River reaches having a same source, were analyzed to valuate the impact of the river transport-sedimentation process on the heavy mineral composition. The results show that the NESL shows moderate similarities in the heavy mineral composition, with ilmenite, epidote, zircon and amphibole as the primary minerals. In the source-to-sink system in the NESL, limited by sedimentary differentiation, post-deposition alteration and similar source material composition, the heavy mineral composition of the loess and that of sandy-land sources does not well correlate, indicating single heavy mineral method is incapable of unequivocally detecting loess sources when not considering the physical geographical conditions. The sediments in the different Balan River reaches show clear diversities and grain-size dependency in heavy minerals composition, indicating the river transport-deposition processes exert a clear control on the heavy-mineral composition in the sediment downstream. Both a wide grain-size window and more numbers of samples are needed to obtain a complete heavy-mineral picture in the source area."
https://openalex.org/W4306898458,"This study determined the association between respiratory symptoms and death from cardiovascular (CV) diseases during 45 years in a pooled sample of four cohorts of random samples of the Norwegian population with 95,704 participants. Respiratory symptoms were assessed using a modification of the MRC questionnaire on chronic bronchitis. We analyzed the association between respiratory symptoms and specific cardiovascular deaths by using Cox regression analysis with age as the time variable, accounting for cluster-specific random effects using shared frailty for study cohort. Hazard ratios (HR) for death were adjusted for sex, highest attained education, smoking habits, occupational air pollution, and birth cohort. Overall, 12,491 (13%) of participants died from CV diseases: 4,123 (33%) acute myocardial infarction, 2,326 (18%) other ischemic heart disease, 2,246 (18%) other heart diseases, 2,553 (20%) cerebrovascular diseases, and 1,120 (9%) other vascular diseases. The adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) for CV deaths was 1.9 (1.7-2.1) in men and 1.5 (1.2-1.9) in women for ""yes"" to the question ""Are you breathless when you walk on level ground at an ordinary pace?"". The same item response showed an adjusted HR for death from acute myocardial infarction of 1.8 (1.5-2.1), other ischemic heart disease 2.2 (1.8-2.7), other heart diseases 1.5 (1.1-1.9), cerebrovascular disease 1.8 (1.5-2.3), and other circulatory diseases 1.7 (1.2-2.4). The adjusted HR for CV death was 1.3 (1.2-1.4) when answering positive to the question"" Are you more breathless than people of your own age when walking uphill?"". However, positive answers to questions on cough, phlegm, wheezing and attacks of breathlessness were after adjustments not associated with early CV deaths. The associations between CV deaths and breathlessness were also present in never smokers. Self-reported breathlessness was associated with CV deaths and could be an early marker of CV deaths."
https://openalex.org/W4306898461,"Although placing a vent hole on the occlusal surface of the implant crown can reduce cervical marginal cement extrusion, it has disadvantages. Transferring the hole to the buccal or lingual surface of the posterior implant crown could therefore be an alternative solution. This study investigated the effect of transferring the vent hole to the lateral side of the implant posterior crown on the hydrodynamics of excess cement extrusion and the crown’s retention ability. Specially fabricated posterior implant crowns were divided into five groups: crowns with an occlusal hole (OH), occlusal lateral hole (OLH), middle lateral hole (MLH), cervical lateral hole (CLH), and no hole (NH). Each set of implant analog-abutment-crown specimens was wrapped in a polymethylacrylate base. The base of the implant crown was divided into four 90-degree quadrants along the diagonal of the square base with a pen mark. Cement was used to bond the crowns and the abutments, and the weight of cement extrusions at the vent holes and the abutment cervical margins were calculated. The distribution of cement extrusion at the margin was photographed in each quadrant, and the areas of surface coverage of cement extrusion were compared with ImageJ software. Retentive strength was measured as the dislocation force using a universal testing machine. One-way analysis of variance was used for result analysis. The cervical marginal cement extrusions of crowns with lateral holes (OLH, MLH, and CLH) were significantly less than that of NH crowns (P&lt;0.05), but more than that of OH crowns (P&lt;0.05). Subgroup analysis among the lateral hole groups indicated that the higher the position of the lateral hole, the lower the weight of the cement extrusion, and the smaller the total distribution area of cement extrusion. The cement extrusion distribution area was larger in the quadrant with the hole than in those opposite and next to the hole. Retention strength comparison indicated no significant difference between crowns with NH, OH, or lateral holes. Transferring the vent hole of the posterior implant crown to the lateral side could reduce cement extrusion at the cervical margin while reducing retention strength deterioration and the esthetic drawbacks caused by occlusal hole opening."
https://openalex.org/W4306898479,"Comparison and classification of ball trajectories can provide insight to support coaches and players in analysing their plays or opposition plays. This is challenging due to the innate variability and uncertainty of ball trajectories in space and time. We propose a framework based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to cluster, compare and characterise trajectories in relation to play outcomes. Seventy-two international women's basketball games were analysed, where features such as ball trajectory, possession time and possession outcome were recorded. DTW was used to quantify the alignment-adjusted distance between three dimensional (two spatial, one temporal) trajectories. This distance, along with final location for the play (usually the shot), was then used to cluster trajectories. These clusters supported the conventional wisdom of higher scoring rates for fast breaks, but also identified other contextual factors affecting scoring rate, including bias towards one side of the court. In addition, some high scoring rate clusters were associated with greater mean change in the direction of ball movement, supporting the notion of entropy affecting effectiveness. Coaches and other end users could use such a framework to help make better use of their time by honing in on groups of effective or problematic plays for manual video analysis, for both their team and when scouting opponent teams and suggests new predictors for machine learning to analyse and predict trajectory-based sports."
https://openalex.org/W4306898501,"The poultry sector is the most vibrant segment of the agriculture system plays a vital role in the supply of healthy meat products. Broiler production effectiveness is greatly associated with feed formulation. Although, broiler exhibits a relatively fast growth rate, the nutritional profile of its meat has been criticized under conventional human dietary regimes. In the current study, the dietary inclusion of quinoa was assessed to improve broiler growth performance, carcass quality, and health by analyzing different growth, hematological and biochemical, immunological parameters. In the present study, the chicken was fed with 50 g/kg, 100 g/kg, and 200 g/kg quinoa enriched diets in two different experimental groups during the growth phase or finisher phase while chicken fed with diet without quinoa were as control. The 50 g/kg quinoa supplemented chicken group revealed a substantial difference in growth performance in comparison with the control group. In addition, the examination of quinoa dietary supplementation on carcass quality exhibited variable behavior. Further, all the study groups fed with quinoa during the growth phase revealed no remarkable difference in the hematological profile in contrast to the control group except for the chicken group fed (50 g/Kg) during the finisher phase for hemoglobin levels. Likewise, all the quinoa enriched diet given chicken groups showed no significant difference in serum biochemical profile in contrast to the control group except for the 50 g/Kg quinoa fed chicken group during the finisher phase for total globulin levels. In addition, the examination of quinoa dietary supplementation on the broiler serum lipid profile was also assessed and birds exhibited variable behavior as the result of quinoa dietary supplementation. Evaluation of short-term immune response after quinoa supplementation assessed and birds exhibited no marked significance on expression outcomes of interleukin/cytokines (IL 1 beta, IL-6, IL-10) assessed by qRT-PCR analysis. In conclusion, the dietary supplementation of broiler fed with quinoa seeds can enhance the growth performance and the carcass quality of broiler."
https://openalex.org/W4306898516,"People perform pro-environmental behaviors not only out of intrinsic motivation, but also due to external factors such as expected social approval or financial gain. To the extent that people use their own motivations to infer the motivation of others, people may view descriptive norms favoring pro-environmental behavior as extrinsically motivated. This may in turn decrease the normative influence of the norm, as conformity can be negatively affected by perceptions that others are conforming mindlessly. While descriptive norms generally promote pro-environmental behavior change, the influential power of descriptive norms varies between studies. One possible explanation for these inconclusive findings is that people interpret others' behavior as either intrinsically- or extrinsically motivated. We propose that pro-environmental descriptive norms will be more influential when attributing others' pro-environmental behavior as intrinsically (e.g., pleasure of contributing to the environment) rather than extrinsically, motivated (e.g., fear of social disapproval). In two experiments (N = 1326), we compared participants' intention to purchase pro-environmental products between four conditions: control condition vs intrinsic norm vs extrinsic norm (Exp. 1) vs injunctive norm (Exp. 2). Results consistently found a significant increase in pro-environmental purchase intention in the intrinsic norm condition compared to both extrinsic norm condition (Exp. 2) and no-information control condition (Exp. 1 & 2). These studies highlight that attribution of behavior is vital for the adoption of pro-environmental norms."
https://openalex.org/W4306901518,"Within the national innovation system literature, the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) eligible for the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) support, are rarely part of empirical discourses on growth, development, and innovation. One major issue hindering empirical analyses in LMICs is the lack of complete data availability. This work offers a new full panel dataset with no missing values for IDA-eligible LMICs. I use a standard, widely respected multiple imputation method (specifically, Predictive Mean Matching) developed by Rubin in the 1980s, which conforms to the structure of multivariate continuous panel data at the country level. The incomplete input data consisting of many variables come from publicly available established sources. These variables, in turn, capture six crucial country-level capacities: technological capacity, financial capacity, human capital capacity, infrastructural capacity, public policy capacity, and social capacity. Such capacities are part and parcel of the National Absorptive Capacity Systems (NACS). The dataset (MSK dataset) thus produced contains data on 47 variables for 82 LMICs between 2005 and 2019. The dataset has passed a quality and reliability check and can therefore be used for comparative analyses of national absorptive capacities and development, transition, and convergence among LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W4306901538,"Background Despite the effort to increase access to routine immunization, majority of children in low-resource countries including Ethiopia are still either unvaccinated or under-vaccinated. In Ethiopia for the past four decades, the completion rate of routine childhood immunization remains low particularly in a rural area. In this study setting, evidence regarding the socio-economic, maternal continuum care, and caregiver characteristics effect on child immunization is limited. Hence, this study aimed to identify the determinants of incomplete vaccination among children aged 12–23 months in Dabat district, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based unmatched case-control study design was employed among 132 cases and 262 controls. Multi-stage sampling method was used to recruit eligible study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinants to children’s incomplete vaccination. Results Caregivers’ attitude towards vaccine (AOR: 6.1, 95% CI 3.4 to 11.1), knowledge on the schedule of vaccination (AOR: 4, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.1), Place of delivery (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.5), and marital status (AOR: 2.36, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.56) were statistically significant association with incomplete childhood vaccination. Conclusion Home delivery, caregivers’ poor knowledge on the schedule of vaccination, caregivers’ negative perception towards vaccine and unmarried marital status were predictors to incomplete vaccination. Therefore, to enhance full vaccination coverage, immunization health education program needs to address vaccine related safety enquiries in a meaningful method to caregivers, in order to improve the perception of caregivers towards vaccine. Moreover, improving maternal continuum care coverage is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W4306901545,"Microalgae are autotrophs and CO 2 fixers with great potential to produce biofuels in a sustainable way, however the high cost of biomass production is a challenge. Mixotrophic growth of microalgae has been presented as a great alternative to achieve economic sustainability. Thus, the present work reports the energetic characterization of S . platensis biomasses cultivated under autotrophic (A) and mixotrophic conditions using cheese whey waste at different concentrations, 2.5 (M2.5), 5.0 (M5) and 10.0% (M10), in order to analyze the potential production of valuable chemicals and bio-oil by TGA/DTG and Py-GC/MS. The biochemical compositions of the studied biomasses were different due to the influence of different culture mediums. As the whey concentration increased, there was an increase in the carbohydrate content and a decrease in the protein content, which influenced the elemental composition, calorific value, TGA and volatile compounds evaluated by Py-GC/MS at 450°C, 550°C and 650°C. Sample M10 had lower protein content and formed a smaller amount of nitrogenates compounds by pyrolysis at all temperatures evaluated. There was a reduction of 43.8% (450º), 45.6% (550ºC) and 23.8% (650ºC) in the formation of nitrogenates compounds in relation to sample A. Moreover, the temperature also showed a considerable effect in the formation of volatile compounds. The highest yields of nitrogenates compounds, phenols and aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons were observed at 650ºC. The oxygenated, and N and O containing compounds decreased as the temperature increased. Hydrocarbons such as toluene, heptadecane and heneicosane were produced by S . platensis pyrolysis, which makes this biomass attractive for production of high quality bio-oil and valuable chemicals. Therefore, the results showed that it is possible to decrease the formation of nitrogen compounds via manipulation of growth conditions and temperature."
https://openalex.org/W4306901566,"Women's empowerment is considered to play a crucial role in food and nutrition security. We aimed to explore the relationship between women's empowerment and food and nutrition security, in rural Pakistan.To estimate women's empowerment, we developed a Rural Women Composite Empowerment Index incorporating nine domains. For indicators of food and nutritional data we used data of 1879 rural households from Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey (PRHPS). Food insecurity was measured through a caloric intake approach; nutrition insecurity was measured through recommended nutrient intake (RNI). Using the Rural Women's Composite Empowerment Index (RWCEI), we employed multi-level mixed-effect regression analysis.The domains of traveling safely (21%), time allocated to tasks (20%), and (lack of) domestic violence (19%) were the most significant domains in defining empowerment of rural woman. The prevalence of food and nutrition insecurity were 33% and 50% respectively. Regression analysis found a positive and significant relationship between women's empowerment and food and nutrition security-the proportion of household who were food and nutritionally secure in empowered households was 70% and 98% respectively.Developing programmes and policies to improve the range of domains of women's empowerment requires a focussed policy agenda, bringing together policy makers from a number of different sectors including education, economy, communications, technology and agriculture. Women's empowerment has the potential to make positive changes not only in food and nutrition security, but in all aspects of family health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W4306901612,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be classified into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) according to genomic aberrations and gene expression profiles. CMS is expected to be useful in predicting prognosis and selecting chemotherapy regimens. However, there are still no reports on the relationship between the morphology and CMS. Methods This retrospective study included 55 subjects with T2 CRC undergoing surgical resection, of whom 30 had the depressed type and 25 the protruded type. In the classification of the CMS, we first defined cases with deficient mismatch repair as CMS1. And then, CMS2/3 and CMS4 were classified using an online classifier developed by Trinh et al. The staining intensity of CDX2, HTR2B, FRMD6, ZEB1, and KER and the percentage contents of CDX2, FRMD6, and KER are input into the classifier to obtain automatic output classifying the specimen as CMS2/3 or CMS4. Results According to the results yielded by the online classifier, of the 30 depressed-type cases, 15 (50%) were classified as CMS2/3 and 15 (50%) as CMS4. Of the 25 protruded-type cases, 3 (12%) were classified as CMS1 and 22 (88%) as CMS2/3. All of the T2 CRCs classified as CMS4 were depressed CRCs. More malignant pathological findings such as lymphatic invasion were associated with the depressed rather than protruded T2 CRC cases. Conclusions Depressed-type T2 CRC had a significant association with CMS4, showing more malignant pathological findings such as lymphatic invasion than the protruded-type, which could explain the reported association between CMS4 CRC and poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4306901701,"Based on the theory of sway frame column, the equation of the effective length factor was derived in this paper. Combined with the characteristics of semi-rigid joints, the linear stiffness correction factor of horizontal bar was introduced, and the equation of effective length correction factor was obtained. By using MATLAB programming method, the three-dimensional relationship between the effective length correction factor and the influencing factors was obtained, and the entire process of the stability bearing capacity of the disc-buckle type high support system was described in detail, which improves the stability calculation theory of the high support system. The influence of setting parameters, joint bending stiffness, geometrical size, and material properties on the effective length correction factor is studied. Simultaneously, the joint bending stiffness of semi-rigid joints is determined. The area of the effective length correction factor is analyzed to optimize the design of the setting scheme using horizontal bars and vertical poles of different sizes. The results show that the lift height significantly affects the effective length correction factor during the load bearing process; the factor decreases with increasing lift height. Large transverse and longitudinal distances influence this rule during the initial load bearing. When the joint bending stiffness is less than 100 (kN·m)/rad, the effective length correction factor decreases rapidly with an increase in joint bending stiffness. When the joint bending stiffness is greater than 100 (kN·m)/rad, the effective length correction factor is unaffected by the joint bending stiffness. When the joint bending stiffness is large at initiation of loading, the effective length correction factor decreases with an increase in the outer diameter of the horizontal bar. When the joint bending stiffness is small, the effective length correction factor increases with an increase in the section size of the vertical pole. Therefore, the outer diameter of the horizontal bar significantly affects the effective length correction factor, and a larger diameter is more conducive to the overall stability. Furthermore, the elastic modulus effects the effective length correction factor for the unstable support system."
