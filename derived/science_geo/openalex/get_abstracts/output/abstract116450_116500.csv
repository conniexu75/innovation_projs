https://openalex.org/W2009032298,"Mammalian mitochondria possess an inner membrane channel, the permeability transition pore (MTP), which can be inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of cyclosporin (CS) A. The molecular basis for MTP inhibition by CSA remains unclear. Mitochondria also possess a matrix cyclophilin (CyP) with a unique N-terminal sequence (CyP-M). To test the hypothesis that it interacts with the MTP, we have studied the interactions of CyP-M with rat liver mitochondria by Western blotting with a specific antibody against its unique N terminus. Although sonication in isotonic sucrose at pH 7.4 releases a large proportion of CyP-M, a sizeable CyP-M fraction sediments with submitochondrial particles at 150,000 × g. We show that the interactions of this CyP-M pool with submitochondrial particles are disrupted (i) by the addition of CSA, which inhibits the pore, but not of CSH, which does not, and (ii) by acidic pH condition, which also leads to selective inhibition of the MTP; furthermore, we show that the effect of acidic pH on CyP-M binding is prevented by diethylpyrocarbonate, which fully prevents the inhibitory effect of H+ on the MTP (Nicolli, A., Petronilli, V., and Bernardi, P.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 4461-4465). These data suggest that CyP-M binding is involved in opening of the MTP and that pore inhibition by CSA and protons may be due to unbinding of CyP-M from its putative binding site on the MTP. A role for CyP-M in MTP regulation is also supported by a study with a series of CSA derivatives with graded affinity for CyP. We show that with each derivative the potency at inhibition of the peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of CyP-M purified to homogeneity is similar to that displayed at inhibition of MTP opening, relative to that displayed by CSA. Decreased binding to CyP-M (but not CyP-A) and decreased efficiency at MTP inhibition is obtained by substitutions in position 8 while a 4-substituted, nonimmunosuppressive derivative is as effective as the native CSA molecule, indicating that calcineurin is not involved in MTP inhibition by CSA.

Pore opening is dependent on both the transmembrane potential difference (1.Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Google Scholar) and on matrix pH (2.Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Google Scholar) and is modulated by a variety of effectors acting at multiple sites (for recent reviews, see (3.Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Google Scholar) and (4.Zoratti M. Szabó I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Google Scholar)). Among pore inhibitors, CSA stands out for its potency (apparent I50 is in the submicromolar range) and for its selectivity (no other mitochondrial functions appear to be affected by this drug) ((3.Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Google Scholar) and (4.Zoratti M. Szabó I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Google Scholar) and references therein). In fact, it is because of inhibition by CSA (5.Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360Google Scholar, 6.Broekemeier K.M. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7826-7830Google Scholar, 7.Szabó I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3376-3379Google Scholar) that the nature of the “permeability transition” (a Ca2+-dependent increase of inner membrane permeability to solutes with molecular mass ≤ 1500 Da) was recently recognized as being due to opening of a channel(8.Szabó I. Zoratti M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 111-117Google Scholar, 9.Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabó I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Google Scholar, 10.Szabó I. Bernardi P. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2940-2946Google Scholar), as first proposed by Hunter and Haworth in 1979(11.Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Google Scholar, 12.Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Google Scholar), rather than to a permeability change of the membrane lipid phase (for review, see (13.Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Google Scholar)).Inappropriate MTP opening is becoming increasingly recognized as a causative event in cell injury by a variety of conditions, including ischemia(14.Duchen M.R. McGuinness O. Brown L. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Google Scholar, 15.Rosser G.R. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 252-275Google Scholar, 16.Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. Thomas A.P. Wang X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 93-102Google Scholar). On the other hand, and although a role of the pore in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis appears likely(17.Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Sidash S.S. Mazat J.-P. Holmuhamedov E.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 211-215Google Scholar, 18.Evtodienko Yu. V. Teplova V.V. Khawaja J. Saris N.-E. L. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 143-152Google Scholar, 19.Bernardi, P., Petronilli, V. (1996) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr., in pressGoogle Scholar), most questions regarding its physiological function, regulation, and molecular structure await an answer.A soluble mitochondrial extract displays PPiase activity, which can be inhibited by CSA and CSG but not by CSH or FK506(20.Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Google Scholar). Since this pattern is shared by the permeability transition, it has been suggested that a mitochondrial CyP mediates CSA inhibition of the pore(20.Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Google Scholar). Although a 20-kDa CyP isoform (CyP-M) with a unique N-terminal sequence has later been isolated from mitochondria(21.Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Google Scholar), its role in the permeability transition is unclear.A study of radiolabeled CSA binding to mitochondria defined two classes of high affinity CSA-binding sites, suggesting the possible existence of further CS-binding proteins besides CyP-M(22.McGuinness O.M. Yafei N. Costi A. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 194: 671-679Google Scholar). In keeping with this hypothesis, a 10-kDa protein could be labeled with a photoactive CSA derivative in a membrane-associated fraction obtained after sonication of mitochondria, and it was suggested that the labeled protein was part of the membrane CSA receptor on the pore(23.Andreeva L. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 261-268Google Scholar).The question of whether CSA interacts directly with the pore, or rather whether its inhibitory effects on the pore are mediated by CyP-M is a fundamental one. Besides the intrinsic importance for the mechanistic aspects of MTP function, assessing this point has a specific relevance for any strategy aimed at pore isolation. Indeed, if CyP-M is required for pore opening, any protocol designed for its reconstitution must include this protein.In this study, we have isolated CSA-binding proteins from a subcellular fraction enriched in mitochondria by affinity chromatography on immobilized CSA. We show that CyP-M is the main and probably the only mitochondrial receptor for CSA and address the question of its role in MTP function with two approaches. In the first, we have studied the interactions of CyP-M with intact rat liver mitochondria by Western blotting with a specific antibody against its unique N terminus. We show that CyP-M is a matrix protein that is engaged in interactions with the mitochondrial inner membrane, and that these interactions are partially retained by SMP. Interactions of CyP-M with SMP are disrupted by the addition of CSA and by mildly acidic pH values, conditions that also lead to selective inhibition of the MTP. On the other hand, CyP-M interactions with the inner membrane are unaffected by CSH, which does not inhibit the MTP, while the effects of acidic pH can be prevented by DPC, which also prevents MTP block by H+(2.Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Google Scholar). These observations have been exploited to devise a novel protocol for CyP-M purification to homogeneity. In the second approach, we have then studied a series of CSA derivatives with graded affinity for CyP-A for their inhibition of CyP-M and of MTP. We find that with each derivative the potency at inhibition of the PPiase activity of purified CyP-M, relative to that of CSA, is similar to that displayed at inhibition of MTP opening. Structure-function analysis of CS derivatives reveals that decreased binding to CyP-M (but not CyP-A) and decreased efficiency at MTP inhibition is obtained by substitutions in position 8, while a 4-substituted, nonimmunosuppressive derivative, which does not bind calcineurin, is as effective as the native molecule at inhibition of the MTP and of CyP-M. Taken together, these data (i) suggest that CyP-M binding is involved in MTP function and that pore inhibition by CSA and H+ may be due to unbinding of CyP-M from its putative binding site on the MTP and (ii) show that inhibition of calcineurin activity is not required for the inhibitory effects of CSA on MTP.RESULTSIn order to identify mitochondrial CSA-binding proteins, a Triton X-100 extract of a subcellular fraction enriched in mitochondria was subjected to affinity chromatography on a D-Ala-(3-amino)-8-CSA Affi-Gel 10 affinity matrix. CSA specifically and reproducibly eluted three major proteins with apparent molecular weights of 18, 20, and 22 kDa (lanes 2-7, arrows). The minor component of about 50 kDa could not always be observed in repeats of this experiment. Elution with 6 M urea reproducibly released two proteins of 30 and 32 kDa, and occasionally higher molecular weight proteins (lanes 9-13).The major CSA-eluted proteins were identified by amino-terminal sequencing. The 18-kDa species had sequence VNPTVFFDI, which is identical to the amino-terminal sequence of cytosolic rat brain CyP-A. The 20-kDa species had the sequence ASDGGARGANSSSQNPLV, which matches that obtained by Connern and Halestrap (21.Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Google Scholar) on a matrix PPiase isolated by ion exchange chromatography. The 22-kDa species had sequence NDKKKGPKVTVKVYFDF, which is identical to residues 26-42 of rat kidney CyP-B (for a review on CyPs, see (35.Galat A. Metcalfe S.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 67-118Google Scholar)). Thus, as suggested earlier (25.Petronilli V. Nicolli A. Costantini P. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Google Scholar), only the 20-kDa species can be considered a selective mitochondrial CyP (termed CyP-M in this paper), while the 18- and 22-kDa species, which can be purified from endoplasmic reticular fractions(25.Petronilli V. Nicolli A. Costantini P. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Google Scholar), are most likely localized in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum.The urea-eluted proteins of 30 and 32 kDa revealed a blocked N terminus. The 32-kDa species was identified as porin (experiments not shown) by Western blotting with a specific antibody against the rat liver protein (a generous gift of Professor Vito De Pinto, University of Catania, Italy), while the identity of the 30-kDa species remains unknown. Since under no circumstances could these proteins be eluted with CSA, the nature of their binding to the affinity matrix remains unclear, and was not investigated further in this paper.Identical affinity purification protocols were carried out in the presence of Ca2+ (which promotes opening of the MTP) or of ADP and Mg2+ (which inhibit it synergistically with CSA, (36.Novgorodov S. Gudz T. Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 33-38Google Scholar) and (37.Novgorodov S. Gudz T. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16274-16282Google Scholar)), and no major differences emerged relative to the results presented in Fig. 1(not shown). We then focused on CyP-M, the only obvious candidate as a mitochondrial CSA receptor and therefore as the target for MTP inhibition by CSA.In order to study the interactions of CyP-M with mitochondria, we prepared rabbit antisera against a synthetic peptide modelled on the unique rat CyP-M N-terminal sequence. The experiments depicted in Fig. 2 document the properties of one such antiserum. It can be seen that a single 20 kDa band was recognized in Western blots of total mitochondrial proteins (lanes 1) and in the CSA eluate of the D-Ala-(3-amino)-8-CSA affinity matrix (lanes 3). The reaction was specific, in that it was not detected with an identical dilution of preimmune serum (lanes 2), and it was selective for the N terminus of CyP-M in that (i) no reactivity was detected with either CyP-A or CyP-B (lanes 1 and 3, compare panels A and B) and (ii) antibody binding could be prevented by the synthetic N-terminal-like peptide ASDGGARGANSSSQC (lanes 4) but not by an irrelevant KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK peptide (lanes 5). Thus, this antibody is a useful tool to probe interactions of CyP-M with mitochondria.In the experiments reported in Fig. 3, we have studied the distribution of CyP-M between a membrane and a soluble fraction obtained by ultracentrifugation of a suspension of sonicated mitochondria in a sucrose-based medium (panels A and B). CyP-M was clearly detectable both in the membrane-associated (lanes 3) and in the soluble fractions (lanes 4), showing that a subpopulation of CyP-M molecules interacts with the mitochondrial inner membrane, and that this interaction is retained after sonication and despite the large dilution of the matrix following disruption of mitochondria.The nature of these interactions was investigated further by exposing this SMP preparation to a variety of conditions (Fig. 3, panel C). CyP-M could be released by isotonic NaCl (lanes 2, compare with lanes 1), suggesting that CyP-M membrane interactions are influenced by the ionic strength and demonstrating that all CyP-M is bound to the outer surface of our SMP preparation and accessible to the external milieu. Importantly, a large fraction of CyP-M could be released by CSA, which inhibits the pore, but not by CSH, which does not (lanes 3 and 4, respectively, compare with lanes 1), providing a first indication that CyP-M (un)binding to the inner membrane may be instrumental in MTP operation.Release of CyP-M could also be detected after exposure of the SMP preparation to an acidic medium (lanes 5, compare with lanes 7), and this effect could be prevented by treatment of SMP with DPC prior to acidification (lanes 6, compare with lanes 7). We have previously shown that matrix acidification is accompanied by MTP closure, due to reversible protonation of histidyl residues, and that the inhibitory effects of matrix H+ on the MTP can be prevented by carbethoxylation of critical histidyl residues with DPC(2.Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Google Scholar). Thus, these experiments further support our hypothesis on MTP•CyP-M interactions. It should be noted that a small proportion of CyP-M could be detected in the soluble fraction of the controls (SMP resedimented in sucrose medium at pH 7.4, panel C, lanes 1 and 7), most likely a dilution effect. With no exception, however, exposure to CSA, acidic pH, or isotonic NaCl resulted in an increase of the CyP-M released in the soluble fraction relative to the controls.To investigate the role of CyP-M interactions in MTP regulation directly, we tried to detect MTP activity in SMP by a variety of methods. These included (i) a study of the permeability properties of liposomes reconstituted with SMP proteins (30.Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Google Scholar) (these liposomes were permeable to sucrose and raffinose as are intact mitochondria after MTP opening; however, sucrose permeation was insensitive to CSA and was unaffected by Ca2+ or EGTA, and therefore could not be unequivocally related to MTP (not shown)) and (ii) measurements of SMP membrane potential with the probe oxonol-VI (31.Petronilli V. Persson B. Zoratti M. Rydström J. Azzone G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 297-303Google Scholar) under a variety of conditions that should promote or inhibit MTP opening. We detected a decrease of membrane potential after treatment with Ca2+ and phenylarsine oxide (two powerful MTP agonists), but again this depolarization was insensitive to CSA (experiments not shown). Thus, from these experiments we could not obtain clear evidence for MTP operation in SMP. As a result, we could not assess a role for CyP-M associations in MTP regulation directly. While our efforts in this direction are continuing, we decided to further probe the potential role of CyP-M in MTP modulation with an independent approach.Besides giving clues about the interactions of CyP-M with mitochondria, the experiments of Fig. 3 allowed us to devise an efficient protocol for purification of CyP-M in enzymatically active form, which is illustrated in Fig. 4. SMP were prepared from isolated mitochondria in sucrose medium and sedimented by ultracentrifugation. Resuspension of SMP in acidic medium released CyP-M and relatively few other proteins (lanes 1), resulting in a substantial one-step CyP-M enrichment. This soluble fraction was adjusted to pH 8.2, sequentially passed through an anion- and a cation-exchange matrix (lanes 2 and 3, respectively), and eluted from the latter with 0.1 M NaCl (lanes 4). After dialysis, CyP-M was purified with one passage on a HPLC cation-exchange column, wherefrom it eluted at about 0.1 M NaCl (lanes 5). CyP-M purity was further checked by silver staining of the HPLC eluate, which confirmed the absence of any other proteins (not shown).CyP-M purified with this protocol exhibits PPiase activity, which could be inhibited by CSA but not by CSH (see the following paragraphs). We therefore decided to study the inhibitory profile of CyP-M PPiase activity and of MTP opening with a panel of CSA derivatives possessing different affinities for CyP-A. Besides giving information on the properties of CyP-M itself, a correlation between the relative potencies at inhibition of CyP-M and of MTP would be a good indication that a functional link between them indeed exists. The CSA derivatives we studied and their structural modifications relative to the native CSA molecule are illustrated in Table 1.Fig. 5 shows typical experiments where the concentration dependence of inhibition of the MTP (panels A and B), of PPiase activity of purified CyP-M (panels C and D), and of PPiase activity of human recombinant CyP-A (panels E and F) was studied, allowing accurate determinations of the apparent I50 for the tested inhibitor. In these representative experiments, the inhibitory compounds were CSA (panels A, C, and E) and MeVal-4-CS (panels B, D, and F). The results of a series of experiments carried out with identical protocols with all derivatives are summarized in Table 2, where the indicated I50 values for PPiase and MTP inhibition were obtained from triplicates of full titration curves. In the case of MTP inhibition, it can be seen that modification of residue 3 was without effect, while a small decrease of affinity followed modification of residues 4, 1, and 2. The most relevant change, with a clear decrease in affinity, was displayed by the CSA derivative modified in position 8. In the case of inhibition of PPiase activity with both CyP-M and CyP-A, the relative affinity was increased for the three (cf. (38.Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Wenger R. Altschuh D. J. Chromatogr. B. 1994; 662: 301-306Google Scholar)) and four substitutions. Interestingly, the least efficient inhibitor of CyP-M was the 8-substituted derivative, which was nearly as effective at inhibiting CyP-A as CSA itself. On the other hand, CSH was ineffective in all cases.Tabled 1The absolute I50 values of the CSA derivatives for MTP inhibition cannot be directly compared with those obtained for inhibition of PPiase activity, because the former values were derived from studies on whole mitochondria and may therefore be influenced by membrane partitioning. It is more instructive to compare the potency of the inhibitor under study relative to that of CSA. Table 3 illustrates the results of this analysis, where the IC50 of all CSA derivatives has been divided by that displayed by CSA. The data have been arranged so that the series reflects decreased affinity for inhibition of the MTP. It can be appreciated that within each group the derivatives appear in the same order for inhibition of PPiase activity, both with CyP-M and CyP-A. The only exception is for substitution in positions 1 and 2, where the difference is, however, negligible. When the absolute value of the ratios is considered, on the other hand, a striking difference emerges for the CSA derivative substituted in position 8. Indeed, the affinity is decreased over 10-fold for MTP, over 5-fold for CyP-M, and less than 2-fold for CyP-A. In other words, for this derivative the fit is extremely good between inhibition of MTP and CyP-M but not of CyP-A.Tabled 1DISCUSSIONIn this paper we have (i) characterized CSA-binding proteins associated with isolated mitochondria, showing that the 20-kDa CyP-M is the main and possibly the only specific mitochondrial CSA binding protein; (ii) studied the interactions of CyP-M with SMP and their modulation by potent inhibitors of the MTP, a CSA-sensitive mitochondrial channel; (iii) devised a new protocol for CyP-M purification; and (iv) studied the inhibitor profile of highly purified CyP-M and of MTP with a series of CSA derivatives with graded affinity for CyP-A. Our results support the idea that CyP-M association with the MTP is essential for channel opening, suggest that MTP inhibition by CSA and protons may be due to CyP-M unbinding from its putative site on the MTP, and show that calcineurin inhibition is not involved in MTP inhibition by CSA.How Many CSA-binding Mitochondrial Proteins?The first relevant result of this paper is reported in Fig. 1. Although three CSA-binding proteins of molecular masses 18, 20, and 22 kDa can be purified by affinity chromatography from a conventional mitochondrial preparation isolated by differential centrifugation, only the 20-kDa species is selectively localized to mitochondria, while the 18- and 22-kDa species, which are both present in a postmitochondrial 150,000 × g particulate fraction(25.Petronilli V. Nicolli A. Costantini P. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Google Scholar), are most likely derived from endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, which are associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. A second point of interest is that no other proteins could be specifically eluted from the CSA affinity matrix (Fig. 1), even after previous removal of CyPs (results not shown). These data suggest that CyP-M is the main and possibly the only mitochondrial receptor for CSA, which makes it the most likely candidate for MTP inhibition by CSA.Recently, Andreeva and Crompton (23.Andreeva L. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 261-268Google Scholar) have exploited the synergistic effects of ADP and CSA at MTP inhibition (36.Novgorodov S. Gudz T. Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 33-38Google Scholar, 37.Novgorodov S. Gudz T. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16274-16282Google Scholar) to identify a 10-kDa protein in a rat liver mitochondrial fraction that could be photolabeled with a tritiated, 8-substituted CSA derivative in the presence of ADP after soluble components had been removed by sonication at pH 8.1 and centrifugation(23.Andreeva L. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 261-268Google Scholar). It was proposed that the 10-kDa species is an integral membrane protein, and that it most likely represents the target for CSA on the pore(23.Andreeva L. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 261-268Google Scholar). Subsequently, the same group has reported photolabeling also of a 22-kDa protein possessing CSA-sensitive PPiase activity (Ki for CSA 5 nM) from rat heart mitochondria, and of a 18-kDa protein from rat liver mitochondria (39.Andreeva L. Tanveer A. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1125-1132Google Scholar) and suggested that the 10-kDa liver species may in fact be a proteolytic product of the 18-kDa protein rather than the CSA membrane receptor(39.Andreeva L. Tanveer A. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1125-1132Google Scholar). In the absence of structural information on these proteins, it is hard to make predictions about their possible relationships with CyP-M, and with the MTP regulatory mechanism proposed here. However, we note that (i) due to the tight association of the endoplasmic reticulum with mitochondria, both the 22-kDa CyP-B and the 18-kDa CyP-A copurify with the 20-kDa CyP-M in CSA affinity-based protocols (Fig. 1); (ii) the protocol used for membrane preparation by Andreeva and co-workers (sonication at pH 8.1; (23.Andreeva L. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 261-268Google Scholar) and (39.Andreeva L. Tanveer A. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1125-1132Google Scholar)) is expected to remove a large fraction of CyP-M (Fig. 3); (iii) the endoplasmic reticulum is expected to retain its integrity in sonication protocols designed for disruption of mitochondria and thus to represent a major component of the vesicular fraction sedimented by ultracentrifugation after sonication; and (iv) the ion-exchange chromatography protocol used by Andreeva et al.(39.Andreeva L. Tanveer A. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1125-1132Google Scholar) for partial purification of the 22-kDa PPiase is virtually identical to that used to purify several CyP isoforms (e.g.(21.Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Google Scholar) and Fig. 3). Based on these considerations, on their apparent molecular weights, and on their physico-chemical properties, we suspect that the larger proteins labeled by Andreeva et al.(39.Andreeva L. Tanveer A.

Extracellular accumulation of this peptide results in damage to insulin-producing β cell membranes and cell death. We report here that at cytotoxic concentrations, amylin forms voltage-dependent, relatively nonselective, ion-permeable channels in planar phospholipid bilayer membranes. Channel formation is dependent upon lipid membrane composition, ionic strength, and membrane potential. At 1-10 μM, cytotoxic human amylin dramatically increases the conductance of lipid bilayer membranes, while noncytotoxic rat amylin does not.

Amylin is a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin from the β cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas(1.Westermark P. Grimelius L. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scan.

Ohsawa G.T. Tokuyama Y. Yamaguchi T. Yoshida S. Adachi M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 199-201Google Scholar). It is postulated that amylin has a regulatory function that opposes the action of insulin(4.Leighton B. Cooper G. Nature. 1988; 335: 632-635Google Scholar, 5.Young A.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55S: 12-18Google Scholar). The pathology of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus is characterized by an extracellular accumulation of fibrillar amyloid, which consists largely of amylin(6.Schneider H.M. Storkel S. Will W. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 1980; 105: 1143-1147Google Scholar, 7.Clark A. Lewis C.E. Willis A.C. Cooper G.J.C. Morris J.F. Reid K.B.M. Lancet. 1987; ii: 231-234Google Scholar, 8.de Konig E.J.P.

The amount of amylin deposited is proportional to the insulin requirements of the patient and thus to the clinical severity of the disease(6.Schneider H.M. Storkel S. Will W. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 1980; 105: 1143-1147Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that human amylin is toxic to islet β cells(9.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Google Scholar). Although it is not clear why amylin forms amyloid deposits, the mechanism of amylin cytotoxicity is believed to be the interaction of amyloid with β cell membranes(10.Westermark P. Virchows Arch. 1973; 359: 1-18Google Scholar, 11.Johnson K.H. Stevens J.B. Diabetes. 1973; 22: 81-90Google Scholar, 12.Westermark P. Wilander E. Diabetologia. 1978; 15: 417-421Google Scholar). In addition to humans, only a few other mammals, such as primates (13.Howard Jr., C.F. Diabetes. 1978; 27: 357-364Google Scholar) and cats (14.Yano B.L. Hayden D.W. Johnson K.H. Vet. Pathol. 1981; 18: 621-627Google Scholar) are known to form amyloid deposits and develop type II diabetes. Rats are among the organisms that do not form amyloid and do not develop type II diabetes(15.Betsholtz C. Christmanson L. Engstrom U. Rorsman F. Svensson V. Johnson K.H. Westermark P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 261-265Google Scholar, 16.Johnson K.H. O'Brien T.D. Betsholtz C. Westermark P. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 522-535Google Scholar). It has been shown in vitro that amyloidogenic human amylin is more toxic than nonamyloidogenic rat amylin(9.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Google Scholar). Amylin has been shown to interact with phosphatidylcholine liposomes resulting in drastic changes in its secondary structure. The peptide was transformed from a combination of α-helical and β-sheet structures to a largely β-sheet structure(17.McLean L.R. Balasubramaniam A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 317-320Google Scholar). The structure of noncytotoxic rat amylin, which is mainly disordered in aqueous solution, was not affected by liposomes. Based on the above evidence, we supposed that the mechanism of amylin toxicity might be an increase in β cell membrane permeability to ions. We therefore investigated the interaction of amylin with planar lipid bilayer membranes. Human amylin (HPLC 1The abbreviation used is: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. grade, >99% purity) was purchased from Bachem California, Torrance, CA, and rat amylin (HPLC grade, >98% purity) was from Bachem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA. 1,2-Diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, L-α-phosphatidylcholine (plant), L-α-phosphatidylserine (brain, sodium salt), azolectin (soybean phosphatide extract, granulated, 45% phosphocholine content), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid were purchased form Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Birmingham, AL. Tolbutamide and chlorpropamide were from Sigma, and glybenzcyclamide was from Aldrich. Lyophilized amylin was dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, distributed into 25-μl aliquots, and stored at −20°C. The peptide was thawed before addition to the lipid bilayer membranes and never frozen again. high performance liquid chromatography. Planar lipid bilayer membranes were formed as described previously (18.Mirzabekov T.A. Ballarin C. Nicolini M. Zatta P. Sorgato M.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 129-143Google Scholar) from 15 mg/ml solution of lipids in n-heptane at the end of Teflon tubing 250 or 500 μm in diameter. The construction of the chamber allowed substitution of the solution in one compartment (cis, to which peptides were added) within several seconds. After the membrane had turned black, the solution in the cis-side was replaced with amylin-containing solution. Usually, after the initial incorporation of amylin, free peptide in the aqueous solution was washed out. Membranes used in experiments were stable and had conductances of less than 10 picosiemens up to voltages of ± 100 mV for a period of at least 10 min prior to amylin addition. Voltage clamp conditions were employed, and contact with the aqueous phases was made using Ag/AgCl electrodes with agar salt bridges. Electrode asymmetry was always less than 1 mV. Membrane formation was verified by monitoring membrane capacitance and resistance. Data were digitized and stored on VHS tape and played back for later analysis. An Axopatch 1C amplifier with headstage CV-3B was used for measuring membrane current. For data acquisition, a digital tape recorder and video cassette recorder allowed recording of large amounts of data. A storage oscilloscope was used for monitoring membrane capacitance and single-channel recordings. The cis-solution was taken as the virtual ground and the sign of the membrane voltage corresponded to the trans side of the membrane. Human amylin peptide at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μM dramatically increased the conductance of pure planar lipid bilayer membranes (Fig. 1). At identical concentrations, nonamyloidogenic and noncytotoxic rat amylin produced no change in membrane conductance. The amylin-induced conductance showed steady-state voltage-dependent behavior (Fig. 2). At negative voltages, the conductance remained stable. At positive voltages, it turned off during the first 3-5 min after a stepwise increase in voltage from 0 to values greater than +10-20 mV. The percentage of decrease in conductance was dependent on the amplitude of applied positive voltage. At +60-70 mV, membrane conductance decreased to 20-30% of its initial level. Although greater increases in the voltage applied result in greater decreases in membrane conductance, a complete conductance turn off has never been observed. This voltage-dependent inactivation of membrane current was reversible. Amylin was also able to insert into membranes at positive voltages (Fig. 3). When human amylin was added to the membrane at +50 mV, the current increased to a plateau in approximately 5 min. This steady-state current was increased 3-5-fold by reversing the voltage polarity (−50 mV). Switching back to positive voltage (+50 mV) effectively reduced the membrane current close to its previous level. If the voltage polarity is again reversed (−50 mV), the channels fail to reopen immediately, but they reopen over several minutes (data not shown). Extensive washing out of the amylin-containing aqueous phase with amylin-free aqueous solution of the same salt composition (20 volumes) did not reduce or eliminate the amylin-induced conductance (data not shown), suggesting that association of amylin with the membrane is irreversible. The conductance induced by human amylin is due to the formation of ion-permeable channels (Fig. 4A). These channels exhibited a single channel conductance of approximately 7-8 picosiemens in 10 mM KCl (Fig. 4B). The single channel current jumps were quite uniform in size. At least four distinct levels can be discerned in this tracing. The conductance of the open state channel was ohmic (Fig. 4C). This suggests that the voltage dependence observed in macroscopic currents reflects a voltage-dependent probability of channel inactivation rather than a change in single channel conductance as a function of voltage. Although amylin clearly induces voltage-dependent conductance in 100 mM KCl, clean single channel recordings were difficult to obtain in this solution, possibly due to the very rapid rate of channel opening and closing in 100 mM KCl, or to the tendency of amylin to aggregate rapidly in higher salt. The ionic selectivity of amylin channels was relatively poor. The channels exhibited a reversal potential of 14 mV (cation selective) in an 8-fold gradient of NaCl. Other selectivity experiments indicated that the channel is permeable to Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl−. The dependence of membrane conductance on the concentration of amylin in the aqueous solution was linear (Fig. 5). This dependence suggests that a monomer or an amylin polymer, preexisting in the aqueous phase, interacts with the membrane and forms the channel. Amylin increased the lipid bilayer conductance in potassium chloride or sodium chloride at salt concentrations ranging from 10 mM to 1 M and at pH values ranging from 4.0 to 9.0. Whereas amylin channel-forming activity (number of channels incorporated into the membrane at a given peptide concentration and time) was not dependent on pH, it was dependent on salt concentrations. Higher salt concentrations caused a decrease in channel-forming activity. As shown in Fig. 6A, the channel-forming activity of amylin in salt solutions composed of 10 mM KCl was more than 100 times higher than that in 1 M KCl. Lipid composition of bilayer membrane was also found to play a role in the channel-forming activity of the peptide (Fig. 6B). Amylin exhibited the highest activity in membranes composed of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/phosphatidic acid, 3:1:1 (w/w/w). These membranes contained approximately 40% negatively charged lipids and therefore carried a high net negative surface charge. Thus, these membranes were approximately 6 times more sensitive to amylin than membranes of pure soybean phospholipids (azolectin), which are composed of approximately 20% negatively charged lipids. Membranes composed of azolectin with cholesterol (cholesterol makes membranes more rigid) as well as those composed of diphytanoylphosphocholine (lipid head group net charge is zero) were only slightly sensitive to amylin. In experiments directed toward possible modulators of amylin membrane activity, compounds related to Type II diabetes such as glucose (30 mM), tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, and glybenzcyclamide (2 mM) were studied. No modulation of amylin channel-forming activity nor change in amylin-induced ion currents was found after exposure to these compounds. Our results demonstrate that human amylin interacts with membranes and is capable of ionic channel formation in lipid bilayers. The highly homologous rat amylin, which differs from human amylin at only 6 amino acid residues, did not form channels in planar lipid bilayers at comparable concentrations, indicating that it is unlikely that proteins of this general length and sequence form channels. The concentrations of human amylin used to obtain channel activity are quite comparable with the concentrations of other cytotoxic peptides, such as defensins (19.Kagan B.L. Selsted M.E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 210-214Google Scholar), Aβ(20.Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Google Scholar), Aβ 25-35(21.Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M. Yuan W. Marshall P. Carman M. Tomaselli K. Lieberburg I. Kagan B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1142-1148Google Scholar), magainins(22.Cruciani R.A. Barker J.L. Durell S.R. Raghunathan G. Guy H.R. Zasloff M. Stanley E.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 226: 287-296Google Scholar), cecropins(23.Duclohier H. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 175-188Google Scholar), and sarcotoxins(24.Nakajima Y. Qu X. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1665-1669Google Scholar), needed to form channels in bilayer membranes. The facts that amylin channels can form in different lipid mixtures, are quite stable, are irreversibly associated with the membrane, and are all uniform in size argue strongly that they are not the result of nonspecific membrane disruption or peptide-induced defects in bilayer structure. The total net charge of human amylin peptide is +5. Therefore it is not surprising that amylin had a higher channel forming activity on bilayers composed of negatively charged phospholipids and that increasing net lipid surface charge from 20 to 40% caused a significant increase in activity. Decreased channel formation at high salt concentrations can be explained by the screening of the membrane surface negative charge at high ionic strength solutions. The voltage dependence of amylin induced ion currents is consistent with the fact that amylin has a net positive charge. In this case, the opposite negative voltage can help “drive” amylin across the membrane, transforming amylin into the ion conducting transmembrane conformation. However, since channels can insert into the membrane in a “closed” (low conductance) state at “closed” voltages (Fig. 3), the insertion process must be driven by nonelectrostatic forces. Several lines of evidence suggest that channel formation may explain the cytotoxicity of amylin. 1) Channel formation occurs at concentrations comparable with those required for cytotoxicity(9.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Google Scholar). 2) The relatively poor selectivity of amylin channels would tend to lead to disruptions of ionic homeostasis, including influxes of Ca2+ and Na+ and effluxes of K+ and other vital cellular constituents. Prolonged elevations of intracellular Ca2+ levels, for example, may lead to cellular damage and even death (apoptosis)(25.Farthrop D.J. Boobis A.R. Davies D.S. Arch. Toxicol. 1991; 65: 437-444Google Scholar, 26.Orrenius S. McCabe Jr., M.J. Nicotera P. Toxicol. Lett. 1992; 64: 357-364Google Scholar). In addition to the potentially serious effects of these ionic changes, the cell would face increased energy demands as various pumps and exchangers attempted to compensate for these ionic disturbances. 3) Amylin channels exhibit voltage dependence, which would tend to keep channels in the open state at typical cellular transmembrane voltages. 4) The fact that human amylin forms channels and rat amylin does not is highly suggestive, since human amylin is toxic and amyloidogenic and rat amylin possesses neither property(9.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Google Scholar). 5) Amylin not only kills β cells but is able to kill other cell types. This relative nonspecificity is reflected in the fact that amylin can form channels in a planar lipid bilayer lacking any proteinaceous receptor. 6) It has been shown that human amylin interacts with phosphatidylcholine membranes and adopts β-structure (17.McLean L.R. Balasubramaniam A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 317-320Google Scholar). In contrast with human amylin, rat amylin did not change conformation upon addition to phosphatidylcholine membranes. The β-pleated sheet structure adopted by human amylin upon interaction with membranes is consistent with the β-structure found in the neurotoxic and channel-forming peptide Aβ25-35 (27.Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1345-1350Google Scholar) and is consistent with the β-structure seen in the bacterial porin (28.Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Google Scholar) and mitochondrial outer membrane channel VDAC(29.Mannella C. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 7-19Google Scholar). (7.Clark A. Lewis C.E. Willis A.C. Cooper G.J.C. Morris J.F. Reid K.B.M. Lancet. 1987; ii: 231-234Google Scholar) The amount of amyloid found in pancreatic islets is proportional to the amount of β cell destruction and to the insulin requirements of the patient(6.Schneider H.M. Storkel S. Will W. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 1980; 105: 1143-1147Google Scholar, 30.Clark A. de Koning E.J.P. Morris J.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 169-703Google Scholar). Thus increased amylin deposition may lead to increased channel formation and β cell destruction, thereby increasing the insulin requirement of the patient. We did not observe the requirement of actual contact between the membrane and amylin fibrils that was reported by Lorenzo et al.(9.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Google Scholar). This may reflect a requirement in the cellular system for a very large membrane leak in order to obtain cytotoxicity, due to the fact that β cells do not have a very tight membrane (membrane resistance, 108 ohms(31.Atwater F. Ribalet B. Rojas E. J. Physiol. 1978; 278: 117-139Google Scholar)). Since the channels we have observed have a conductance of 7.5 picosiemens in 10 mM KCl, it would take approximately 100 channels to make a significant (doubling the conductance) leak in these membranes (assuming a single channel conductance of approximately 100 picosiemens in physiologic solution). Thus, it may be that islet cell dysfunction and destruction in vivo is a very slow, gradual process that builds up over considerable lengths of time. Blockers and inhibitors of channel activity may have potential therapeutic value in type II diabetes. Whole cell patch clamp recording from β cells has demonstrated that the addition of amylin induces hyperpolarization of the cell membrane and increases membrane current(32.Wagoner P.K. Chen C. Worley J.F. Dukes I.D. Oxford G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9145-9149Google Scholar). Our present results predict a depolarizing effect on β cells. Since the patch clamp results were obtained at lower amylin concentratious (1-500 nM), they may represent a specific amylin interaction with an ion channel already present in the β cell membrane. Several cytotoxic, amyloid- forming peptides have now been demonstrated to form ion-permeable channels(20.Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Google Scholar, 21.Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M. Yuan W. Marshall P. Carman M. Tomaselli K. Lieberburg I. Kagan B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 383Google Scholar). While this may be coincidental, a more interesting view is that the structural properties of peptides that form β-sheet and aggregate into fibrils suit these peptides for membrane insertion and channel formation."

https://openalex.org/W1976216710,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP) has attracted much attention as a possible second messenger controlling cell proliferation and motility and as an intracellular Ca2+-releasing agent. Here, we present evidence that SPP activates a G protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane of various cells, leading to increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and opening of G protein-regulated potassium channels. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, SPP potently (EC50, 2 nM) and rapidly increased [Ca2+]i in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Pertussis toxin-sensitive increase in [Ca2+]i was also observed with sphingosylphosphorylcholine (EC50, 460 nM), whereas other sphingolipids, including ceramide-1-phosphate, N-palmitoyl-sphingosine, psychosine, and D-erythro-sphingosine at micromolar concentrations did not or only marginally increased [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, SPP inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK cells and increased binding of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate to HEK cell membranes. Rapid [Ca2+]i responses were also observed in human transitional bladder carcinoma (J82) cells, monkey COS-1 cells, mouse NIH 3T3 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells, and rat C6 glioma cells, whereas human HL-60 leukemia cells and human erythroleukemia cells failed to respond to SPP. In guinea pig atrial myocytes, SPP activated Gi protein-regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Activation of these channels occurred strictly when SPP was applied at the extracellular face of atrial myocyte plasma membrane as measured in cell-attached and inside-out patch clamp current recordings. We conclude that SPP, in addition to its proposed direct action on intracellular Ca2+ stores, interacts with a high affinity Gi protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane of apparently many different cell types."

We thus propose that the selective transcription of stationary-specific genes by Eσ38 holoenzyme requires either a specific reaction condition(s) or a specific factor(s) such as template DNA with low superhelical density. The functional specificity was compared between two σ factors, σ70 (the major σ at exponentially growing phase) and σ38 (the essential σ at stationary growth phase), of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The core enzyme binding affinity of σ38 was less than half the level of σ70 as measured by gel filtration column chromatography or by titrating the concentration of σ required for the maximum transcription in the presence of a fixed amount of core enzyme. In addition, the holoenzyme concentration required for the maximum transcription of a fixed amount of templates was higher for Eσ38 than Eσ70. The transcription by Eσ38 was, however, enhanced with the use of templates with low superhelical density, in good agreement with the decrease in DNA superhelicity in the stationary growth phase. We thus propose that the selective transcription of stationary-specific genes by Eσ38 holoenzyme requires either a specific reaction condition(s) or a specific factor(s) such as template DNA with low superhelical density. In Escherichia coli, the total number of RNA polymerase core enzyme is fixed at a level characteristic of the rate of cell growth, which ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 molecules per genome equivalent of DNA(1.Ishihama A. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 282-286Google Scholar, 2.Ishihama A. Ishihama A. Yoshikawa H. Control of Cell Growth and Division. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 121-140Google Scholar). On the other hand, the total number of genes on the E. coli genome is estimated to be about 4,000, which is in good agreement with the number estimated from the DNA sequence (up to now, more than 60% has been sequenced). These considerations raise a possibility that competition must take place between promoters for binding a small number of RNA polymerase molecules. Among about 4,000 genes on the E. coli genome, about 1,000 genes are expressed at various levels in exponentially growing cells under laboratory culture conditions, i.e. at 37°C and with aeration(2.Ishihama A. Ishihama A. Yoshikawa H. Control of Cell Growth and Division. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 121-140Google Scholar, 3.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Google Scholar). The rest of the genes are considered to be expressed under various stress conditions that E. coli meets in nature (4.Magasanik B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1982; 16: 135-168Google Scholar, 5.Neidhardt F.C. Van Bogelen R.A. Vaughn V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 295-329Google Scholar, 6.Kolter R. Siegele D.A. Tormo A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 855-874Google Scholar, 7.Hengge-Aronis R. Cell. 1993; 72: 165-168Google Scholar). For instance, a set of stress-response genes is expressed when cells stop growing at stationary phase(6.Kolter R. Siegele D.A. Tormo A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 855-874Google Scholar, 7.Hengge-Aronis R. Cell. 1993; 72: 165-168Google Scholar). Transcription of at least some of these stationary phase-specific genes is catalyzed by RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing σ38 (the rpoS gene product)(8.Mulvey M.R. Loewen P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9979-9991Google Scholar, 9.Lange R.N. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Google Scholar, 10.Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Google Scholar, 11.Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Thompson N.E. Gentry D.R. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11112-11117Google Scholar). In addition, the modification of core enzyme is considered to be involved in stationary-specific transcription regulation(12.Ozaki M. Wada A. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 17-23Google Scholar, 13.Ozaki M. Fujita N. Wada A. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 257-261Google Scholar). Promoters from the stationary-specific genes, however, do not have a single consensus sequence(10.Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Google Scholar, 11.Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Thompson N.E. Gentry D.R. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11112-11117Google Scholar, 14.Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Google Scholar, 15.Tanaka K. Kusano S. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 827-834Google Scholar). The lack of a consensus could indicate the involvement of a regulatory cascade, in which some genes are directly transcribed by Eσ38 but others are under the control of these gene products. However, we found that the osmo-regulated genes, osmB and osmY, are transcribed preferentially by Eσ38 only in the presence of high concentrations of potassium glutamate (or acetate) (16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar). This finding raises a possibility that each stationary-specific promoter carries a specific sequence that is recognized by Eσ38 under a specific reaction condition and suggests that the promoter sequences recognized by Eσ38 differ between gene groups with different requirements. Our effort has since been focused to identify specific conditions or factors required for transcription of each stationary-specific gene by Eσ38 holoenzyme. Along this line, we analyzed in this study the effect of DNA superhelicity on the promoter recognition by Eσ38 holoenzyme. DNA superhelicity is known to change depending on the cell growth conditions. For instance, nutrient downshift and stationary growth phase cause a decrease in the DNA superhelical density(17.Balke V. Gralla J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4499-4506Google Scholar, 18.Jaworski A. Higgins N.P. Wells R.D. Zacharias W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2576-2581Google Scholar), while high osmolarity leads to an increase in the superhelicity(19.Higgins C.F. Dorman C.J. Stirling D.A. Waddell L. Booth I.R. May G. Bremer E. Cell. 1988; 52: 569-584Google Scholar, 20.Hsieh L.S. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Drlica K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3914-3917Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the comparison of two σ factors, σ70 and σ38, in the following activities: (i) the core binding activity, (ii) the promoter recognition activity, and (iii) the effect of DNA conformation on the promoter recognition patterns. The results show that the selectivity for stationary phase-specific promoters by Eσ38 increases concomitantly with the decrease in DNA superhelicity and that the effects of decreased DNA superhelicity and high potassium glutamate concentrations are additive in enhancing the selectivity for Eσ38. The truncated lacUV5 template, 205 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)DTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. EcoRI-EcoRI fragment, was prepared as described previously(21.Kajitani M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 671-686Google Scholar), while the 156-bp HindIII-EcoRI katE and 796-bp PstI-EcoRI fic fragments were prepared as described by Ding et al.(16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar) and Tanaka et al.(10.Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Google Scholar), respectively. The BamHI-KpnI fragment of 287 bp in length carrying alaS promoter was prepared as described by Nomura et al.(22.Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6857-6870Google Scholar). These truncated DNA templates produced in vitro transcripts of 63, 69, 53, 257, and 169 nucleotides in length, respectively. base pair(s) dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography. Plasmids pBSOY containing osmY promoter and pBSLU containing lacUV5 promoter were constructed as follows. Plasmid pBluescript II (Stratagene) was linearized with SacI and blunt-ended using Klenow DNA polymerase; a 783-bp HincII-digested fragment containing rrnB terminator, purified from pKK223-3 (Pharmacia), was ligated into pBluescript II at the blunt-ended SacI site to yield plasmid pBST. A 261-bp HincII-EcoRV fragment containing osmY promoter, isolated from pDY.1.4(23.Yim H.H. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3637-3644Google Scholar), was inserted into pBST between HincII and EcoRV to yield pBSOY. On the other hand, pBSLU was constructed after insertion of the 205-bp lacUV5 fragment from pKB252 (21.Kajitani M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 671-686Google Scholar) into pBST between HincII and EcoRI. These circular DNA templates produced in vitro transcripts of 357 (lacUV5 promoter), 346 (osmY promoter), and 108 (primer RNA for ColE1) nucleotides, respectively, in length. These template plasmids were prepared from transformed DH5α cells using QIAGEN plasmid kit (QIAGEN). RNA polymerase core enzyme was purified by passing RNA polymerase at least three times through phosphocellulose columns (the repeated chromatography is essential for complete removal of minor σ factors from core enzyme). σ70 (the rpoD gene product) was overexpressed using pGEMD and purified by the method of Igarashi and Ishihama(24.Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Google Scholar), while σ38 was overexpressed using pETF and purified as described by Tanaka et al.(10.Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Google Scholar). Single-round mixed transcription by holoenzyme was carried out under the standard conditions described previously(28.Kubori, T., Shimamoto, N. (1995) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In brief, a mixture of template DNA and RNA polymerase reconstituted from purified core enzyme and either purified σ70 or σ38 was pre-incubated for 30 min at 37°C to allow open complex formation in the standard reaction mixture, which contained (in 35 μl) 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 37°C), 3 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. A 15-μl mixture of substrate and heparin was then added to make the final concentrations of 160 μM each of ATP, GTP, and CTP; 50 μM UTP; 2 μCi of [α-32P]UTP; and 200 μg/ml heparin. After 5 min of incubation at 37°C, transcripts were precipitated with ethanol and subjected to PAGE in the presence of 8 M urea. Gels were dried and exposed to imaging plates. The exposed plates were analyzed with a BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fuji). Covalently closed plasmids (5 μg each) were treated with 6 units of calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I (Takara Shuzo) in 100 μl of a reaction mixture, which contained 35 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 72 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM spermidine, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37°C for 5 h in the presence of various concentrations of ethidium bromide (0-40 μM). After the incubation, plasmids were purified by two cycles of phenol-chloroform treatment, followed by ethanol precipitation. The average linking number (ΔLk) of each DNA molecule was measured by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels containing appropriate concentrations of ethidium bromide, according to the method of Keller(25.Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4876-4880Google Scholar). The mean superhelical density (σ) was calculated by the equation σ = 10ΔLk/N, where N represents the number of the base pairs of plasmid DNA. Both σ70 and σ38 were overproduced in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the proteins separated by PAGE. On the other hand, core enzyme was purified from exponentially growing E. coli cells by repeated chromatography on phosphocellulose. The affinity of the two species of σ subunit to core enzyme was examined by measuring two parameters, i.e. the saturation level of σ subunit required for the maximum level of holoenzyme formation from a fixed amount of core enzyme and the saturation level of σ subunit to achieve the maximum level of in vitro transcription by a fixed amount of core enzyme. First, the affinity of the two σ subunits to core enzyme was compared by directly measuring the holoenzyme formation. For this purpose, we mixed a fixed amount of core enzyme and various amounts of either σ70 or σ38 at 30°C, and the mixtures were fractionated by gel filtration-HPLC on a Superose 6 column. The σ to core enzyme ratio was measured for the peak fraction of RNA polymerase (Fig. 1). The core enzyme was saturated with σ70 at the input molar ratio between 2 and 3, while the saturation of the same amount of core enzyme with σ38 required at least 2-fold more σ38 protein than σ70. The observed difference might be due to a difference in the activity of purified σ subunits. To test this possibility, the second-cycle assay was performed using the unassembled σ subunits recovered after the first cycle of binding assay. The core binding patterns of both σ subunits were essentially the same with those of the first cycle experiments (data not shown). The level of σ subunit required for maximum transcription by a fixed amount of core enzyme was also compared between the two σ subunits. For this purpose, single-round transcription was carried out using a fixed amount of core enzyme and various amounts of σ subunits. The core enzyme was saturated by adding only 2-fold molar excess of σ70 subunit, i.e. 2 pmol of σ70 per pmol core as measured using alaS promoter (Fig. 2), and this level was observed for all the σ70-dependent promoters analyzed (data not shown). The molar concentration of σ38 required for the maximum transcription of fic, katE, and lacUV5 was 10, 8, and 4 pmol, respectively, per pmol of core enzyme (Fig. 2). Since the difference in core enzyme binding activity between the two σ subunits is about 2-fold (see above), the transcription assay indicates that the promoter recognition activity is also weaker for σ38 than σ70. The promoter recognition activity of σ38 is, however, variable depending on the promoter. For instance, only less than 2 molar excess of σ38 was needed for maximum transcription of the osmo-regulated promoters, osmB and osmY, in the presence of 0.3-0.5 M potassium glutamate (or acetate)(16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar). Since both the core enzyme binding and the promoter recognition activities under our standard assay conditions for in vitro transcription were lower for Eσ38 than Eσ70, the promoter selection pattern was analyzed with use of the increased concentration of RNA polymerase. Fig. 3 summarizes the effect of enzyme/promoter ratio on the relative transcription level by two holoenzymes. At low enzyme concentrations, lacUV5 was transcribed preferentially by Eσ70, but Eσ38 started to transcribe lacUV5 at high enzyme concentrations. Likewise, fic was transcribed by both Eσ70 and Eσ38 at low enzyme concentrations, but Eσ38 transcribed better than Eσ70 at high enzyme concentrations. These observations altogether lead to the recognition that the classification of promoters with respect to σ selectivity varies depending on the concentrations of individual holoenzyme species. The katE promoter was always transcribed better with Eσ38 than Eσ70, but the Eσ38/Eσ70 activity ratio increased from 1.3 at 0.5 pmol (per 0.1 pmol promoter; promoter/enzyme ratio of 5) to about 4 at the holoenzyme concentration higher than 1 pmol. For all the promoters examined, the transcription activity by Eσ38 increased at high protein concentrations, supporting the notion that either the affinity of σ38 to core enzyme is weaker than that of σ70 or the affinity of Eσ38 to promoters is weaker than that of Eσ70. σ38 plays a major role in transcription of a set of genes essential for survival in stationary phase and/or nutrient starvation(7.Hengge-Aronis R. Cell. 1993; 72: 165-168Google Scholar). Under such starved growth conditions, the superhelicity of chromosomal DNA in bacterial cells is known to decrease(17.Balke V. Gralla J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4499-4506Google Scholar, 18.Jaworski A. Higgins N.P. Wells R.D. Zacharias W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2576-2581Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of DNA superhelicity on transcription in vitro by two RNA polymerase holoenzymes, Eσ70 and Eσ38. For this purpose, the DNA fragments containing the test promoters were inserted into a single and the same vector plasmid containing rrnB transcription termination sequence so as to produce in vitro transcripts of defined sizes (for construction see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting plasmids were treated with calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I in the presence of various concentrations of ethidium bromide. The superhelicity of each template thus obtained was measured by gel electrophoresis (see “Materials and Methods”). Using these circular template DNAs with different degrees of superhelicity, an in vitro transcription assay was carried out under the standard conditions. The gel patterns, shown in Fig. 4, indicated that the effect of DNA superhelicity on transcription was different between Eσ38 and Eσ70. The quantitative analysis data, shown in Fig. 5, indicated that the optimum superhelical density for maximum transcription by Eσ38 was low for all the promoters (lacUV5, osmY, and RNA-I) tested, i.e. the superhelical density of around 0-0.03. In general, Eσ38 required lower levels of DNA superhelicity for maximum transcription than Eσ70. In particular, the activity of Eσ38 is enhanced with the decrease in DNA superhelicity in transcription of stationary-specific promoters.Figure 5:Effect of the superhelical density of template DNA on transcription. The in vitro transcription reaction was carried out as described in Fig. 4. Transcripts, lacUV5 RNA derived from pBSLU (A), osmY RNA derived from pBSOY (B), and RNA-I derived from the ColE1 origin promoter from both plasmids (C) were measured with a BAS-2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji). The maximum level of transcription for each template was set as 100% value. These data represent the averages of three independent experiments for lacUV5 and osmY and six independent experiments for RNA-I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast, Eσ70 required high levels of DNA superhelicity for maximum activity. The optimum DNA superhelicity for the maximum transcription of osmY promoter by Eσ70 was high (above 0.1), and upon decrease in DNA superhelicity, Eσ70 becomes inactive in transcription of the osmY promoter. Transcription of lacUV5 and RNA-I by Eσ70 was rather insensitive to the change in DNA superhelicity (these promoters are classified into a group of promoters that are recognized by both Eσ70 and Eσ38 holoenzymes(10.Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Google Scholar, 15.Tanaka K. Kusano S. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 827-834Google Scholar)). To correlate these in vitro observations with in vivo situations, we next examined the levels of DNA superhelicity for the plasmids that were purified from transformed DH5α cells at various phases grown in Luria broth at 37°C. The results, shown in Fig. 6, indicated that the superhelicity of plasmids, prepared from the stationary phase cells, was approximately half of the level of plasmids from the exponentially growing cells. Furthermore, the plasmids from the stationary phase cells showed nearly the same extent of superhelicity as the plasmids that gave the maximum transcription in vitro by Eσ38 (see Fig. 5). To confirm this relationship, we examined the template activity in in vitro transcription by Eσ70 and Eσ38 for all the templates prepared at various phases of the cell growth. The level of transcription by Eσ38 was maximum for the promoters prepared at the stationary phase, i.e. about 2-fold higher than the levels of DNA from the log phase cells (data not shown). Again, the transcription levels by Eσ70 stayed at constant levels (lacUV5 and RNA-I) or rather decreased (osmY) with the decrease in DNA superhelicity (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that Eσ38 preferentially transcribes template DNA with the low superhelicity. To identify the step(s) of transcription that were affected by the DNA superhelicity, we examined the effect of Eσ38 concentration on the relative level of transcription from osmY templates with different superhelicity. At low enzyme concentrations, the maximum transcription level on the template with low superhelical density was about 2-fold higher than that on the high helical density template, but at high enzyme concentrations, the maximum transcription level was almost the same between the two templates (Fig. 7). The results suggest that the affinity of Eσ38 is higher for DNA with low superhelical density than for DNA with high superhelical density. To confirm this prediction, we measured the rate of open complex formation. The time course of open complex formation by Eσ38 is roughly the same between the two templates (the formation of open complexes was achieved within 15 min of preincubation at 37°C). However, the maximum level of open complexes formed differed, indicating that the DNA superhelicity difference does not affect the rate of open complex formation but influences the promoter recognition activity by RNA polymerase (see “Discussion”). The level of osmY transcription by Eσ38 holoenzyme increases with the increase in potassium glutamate concentration(16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of potassium glutamate concentration on transcription directed by circular DNA templates with different superhelicity. The patterns of lacUV5 and osmY transcription level by Eσ70 were essentially the same between DNA from the exponentially growing and stationary phase cells, both showing decreased activity concomitantly with the increase in potassium glutamate concentration (Fig. 8, A and C). On the other hand, the maximum transcription level by Eσ38 holoenzyme was observed at high concentrations of potassium glutamate (Fig. 8, B and D). In particular, Eσ38 preferentially transcribed the osmY promoter only at high potassium glutamate concentrations, and this result agreed with the previous result by using truncated osmo-regulated gene promoters(16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar). The maximum transcription of DNA with low superhelicity was observed between 200 and 300 mM concentrations of potassium glutamate, while using DNA with high superhelicity the maximum transcription was observed above 300 mM potassium glutamate (Fig. 8D). Thus, the requirement for high concentrations of potassium glutamate is partly replaced by the decrease in DNA superhelicity. The σ saturation experiments of in vitro transcription indicate that the affinity of σ38 to core enzyme is lower than that of σ70 (see Fig. 2). Direct measurement of the core enzyme-bound σ subunits by gel filtration-HPLC on Superose 6 column indeed showed that the binding affinity of σ38 to core enzyme is at least 2-fold weaker than that of σ70 (see Fig. 1). This was rather unexpected because the intracellular concentration of σ38 is not higher than that of σ70 even after prolonged starvation in the stationary phase(26.Jishage M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6832-6835Google Scholar). Growth-coupled replacement of core enzyme-associated σ subunit from σ70 to σ38 may therefore require an additional factor(s) or a yet unidentified condition(s). For example, the modification of core enzyme in stationary phase cells (12.Ozaki M. Wada A. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 17-23Google Scholar, 13.Ozaki M. Fujita N. Wada A. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 257-261Google Scholar) may increase selective binding of σ38. The single-round in vitro transcription assays also indicated that the level of Eσ38 holoenzyme required for maximum transcription of a fixed amount of template was higher than that of Eσ70 holoenzyme (see Figure 2:, Figure 3:). However, the maximum yields of transcription in the presence of saturated amounts of enzyme were often lower than the template levels and were different between the promoters. The difference in abortive initiation between promoters provides a part of the explanation as has been experimentally demonstrated(27.Levin J.R. Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 85-100Google Scholar, 28.Kubori, T., Shimamoto, N. (1995) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, the role of sensitivity difference of various initiation complexes to heparin cannot be excluded as a possible cause for the differing yields because our preliminary gel retardation assay indicated that Eσ38•lacUV5 initiation complexes were partly dissociated at 200 μg/ml heparin, while Eσ70•lacUV5 complexes stayed unchanged. 2S. Kusano, unpublished results. Another unexpected observation is that the affinity of Eσ70 holoenzyme to σ38-dependent promoters was rather weaker than that of Eσ70 to σ70-dependent promoters at least under the standard transcription assay conditions employed. Thus, in mixed transcription assays, σ70-dependent promoters are preferentially transcribed at low enzyme concentrations, but upon the increase in enzyme concentration, the σ38-dependent promoters become predominantly transcribed. Again, this is apparently in conflict with the intracellular concentrations of the two holoenzymes during the transition from exponentially growing to stationary growth phase. Thus, promoter-Eσ38 interaction may also be influenced by a specific factor(s) and/or condition(s) present in stationary phase E. coli cells. Previously, we found that addition of high concentrations of potassium glutamate selectively enhances transcription by Eσ38, although Eσ70 activity is inhibited at the high salt concentrations(16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar). In addition, we found in this study that Eσ38 preferentially transcribed the promoters on low superhelical density DNA (see Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Moreover, the optimum superhelical density for maximum transcription by Eσ38 was almost the same as that of plasmids prepared from stationary phase E. coli (see Fig. 6). Preferential transcription of the low superhelical density templates by Eσ38 was due to the high affinity of Eσ38 binding to promoter on the low superhelical density DNA (see Fig. 7). The selective transcription of osmY by Eσ38 increases by adding high concentrations of potassium glutamate(16.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Google Scholar). The optimum potassium glutamate concentrations for the maximum transcription of osmY on the stationary phase plasmid template with low superhelical density by Eσ38 was 200-300 mM, where as that on the DNA with high superhelical density prepared from log phase E. coli cells was above 300 mM (see Fig. 8). Transcription in vivo of osmY in cells growing in nutrient-rich media such as Luria-broth is observed only at the stationary phase, whereas in cells growing in poor media such as M9-glucose, osmY transcription occurs at both log and stationary phases(23.Yim H.H. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3637-3644Google Scholar, 29.Weichart D.R. Lange R.N. Henneberg N. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 407-420Google Scholar). In good agreement with these observations, the superhelical density of plasmids prepared from cells grown in M9-glucose is about half the density of plasmids prepared from exponentially growing cells in Luria-broth.2 These results altogether raise such a model of global regulation that transcription by Eσ38 is enhanced with the decrease in DNA superhelical density under starved conditions. In addition, the increase in intracellular potassium glutamate concentration may lead to enhanced transcription of at least osmo-regulated genes. As an extension of this consideration, each of the stationary phase-specific gene promoters may require a specific transcription factor(s) or condition(s) for efficient transcription. Such predictions are in good agreement with the observations that the σ38-dependent promoters do not carry a consensus promoter sequence(10.Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Google Scholar, 11.Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Thompson N.E. Gentry D.R. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11112-11117Google Scholar, 14.Kolb A.

In addition to selective activation of Eσ38, a nucleoid-associated protein, H-NS (or H1a), which accumulates in the stationary growth phase, represses σ70-dependent transcription in vitro and in vivo(30.Ueguchi C.

Likewise, Dps accumulating in the stationary growth phase cells may play dual roles in not only DNA protection but also repressing gene transcription(33.Almiron M. Link A. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Google Scholar). The differential repression by these DNA binding proteins on transcription between Eσ70 and Eσ38 may also lead to apparently selective transcription of σ38-dependent genes in the stationary phase. -We thank Miki Jishage for experimental support and Kan Tanaka for discussion."

Cis-acting peroxisome proliferator responsive elements (PPREs) have been identified in the 5′-flanking region of H2O2-producing rat acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) gene and in other genes inducible by peroxisome proliferators. To gain more insight into the purported nonresponsiveness of human liver cells to peroxisome proliferator-induced increases in peroxisome volume density and in the activity of the β-oxidation enzyme system, we have previously cloned the human ACOX gene, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation system. We now present information on a regulatory element for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers. The PPRE, consists of AGGTCA C TGGTCA, which is a direct repeat of hexamer half-sites interspaced by a single nucleotide (DR1 motif). It is located at −1918 to −1906 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site of this human ACOX gene. This PPRE specifically binds to baculovirus-expressed recombinant rat PPARα/RXRα heterodimers. In transient transfection experiments, the maximum induction of luciferase expression by ciprofibrate and/or 9-cis-retinoic acid is dependent upon cotransfection of expression plasmids for PPARα and RXRα. The functionality of this human ACOX promoter was further demonstrated by linking it to a β-galactosidase reporter gene or to a rat urate oxidase cDNA and establishing stably transfected African green monkey kidney (CV1) cell lines expressing reporter protein. The human ACOX promoter has been found to be responsive to peroxisome proliferators in CV1 cells stably expressing PPARα, whereas only a basal level of promoter activity is detected in stably transfected cells lacking PPARα. The presence of a PPRE in the promoter of this human peroxisomal ACOX gene and its responsiveness to peroxisome proliferators suggests that factors other than the PPRE in the 5′-flanking sequence of the human ACOX gene may account for differences, if any, in the pleiotropic responses of humans to peroxisome proliferators.

To test these concepts, we used site-directed mutagenesis to prepare ovine PGHS-1 mutants having modifications of Arg120 (R120K, R120Q, R120E), Glu524 (E524D, E524Q, E524K), and Tyr355 (Y355F) and examined the properties of the mutant enzymes expressed in COS-1 cells. All of the mutants retained at least part of their cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities except the R120E mutant, which had no detectable activity. The Km values of the R120K and R120Q mutants with arachidonic acid were 87 and 3300 μM, respectively, versus 4 μM for native PGHS-1. The R120Q mutant failed to undergo suicide inactivation during catalysis or time-dependent inhibition by flurbiprofen. These results are consistent with Arg120 binding the carboxylate group of arachidonate and suggest that interaction of the carboxylate group of substrates and inhibitors with Arg120 is necessary for suicide inactivation and time-dependent inhibition, respectively. The Km values for the E524D, E524Q, and E524K mutants were not significantly different from values obtained for the native PGHS-1, suggesting that this residue is not importantly involved in catalysis or substrate binding. The effect of modifications of Arg120 and Tyr355 on the stereospecificity of inhibitor binding were determined.

PGHS-1 exhibits both a cyclooxygenase activity involved in converting arachidonate to PGG2 and a hydroperoxidase activity that reduces the hydroperoxyl group of PGG2 to PGH2(7.Ohki S. Ogino N.

Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, the arginino group of Arg120 located near the channel opening is complexed with the carboxylate group of flurbiprofen. The carboxylate group of Glu524 appears to form a salt bridge with the arginino group of Arg120. Arachidonate is postulated to bind with its ω-methyl group extending into the core of the channel and its carboxylate group complexed to Arg120. The phenolic side chain of Tyr355 is present near the mouth of the channel opposite Arg120. This bulky group places a constriction on one side of the channel which may determine the stereoselectivity of PGHS-1 for the S-isomers of 2-phenylpropionic acid inhibitors(16.Shen T.Y. Ham E.A. Cirillo V.J. Zanetti M. Robinson H.J. Vane J.R. Prostaglandin Synthetase Inhibitors. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1974: 19-31Google Scholar), such as ibuprofen and flurbiprofen. Finally, some PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 inhibitors, including flurbiprofen, cause a time-dependent, slowly reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity(17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 18.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar, 19.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L.

Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar). This latter observation suggests that modification of the amino acid involved in binding the carboxylate group of time-dependent inhibitors such as flurbiprofen would affect the mechanism of inhibition. To begin testing the functions of Arg120, Glu524, and Tyr355 in the binding of fatty acid substrates and 2-phenylpropionic acid inhibitors, we prepared appropriate mutants of ovine PGHS-1 and examined their kinetic properties. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum and calf serum were obtained from Hyclone. Chloroquine, bovine hemoglobin, hematin, guaiacol, DEAE-dextran, and penicillin G were from Sigma. Arachidonic acid, PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (40-60 mCi/mmol), [1-14C]α-linolenic acid (53.0 mCi/mmol), and [35S]methionine (1000-1500 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. ECL Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Corp. T4 DNA ligase and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Other reagents were purchased from common commercial sources. Mutants of ovine PGHS-1 (R120K, R120Q, R120E, E524K, E524Q, E524D) were prepared starting with M13mp19-PGHSov-1, which contains the coding region of ovine PGHS-1(22.DeWitt D.L. El-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Google Scholar), using a Bio-Rad kit essentially as described previously(23.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12387-12392Google Scholar). Listed in Table 1 are the oligonucleotides used for the preparation of each mutant. Phage samples were sequenced using the dideoxy method (24.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) to identify mutants. The 2.3-kilobase insert from the replicative form of M13mp19-PGHSov-1 containing the desired mutation was isolated after digestion with SalI and subcloned into the SalI site of pSVT7(23.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12387-12392Google Scholar, 25.Bird P. Gething J.J. Sambrook J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2905-2913Google Scholar). The correct orientation of the insert was determined by restriction digestion with PstI. The Y355F mutant of ovine PGHS-1 was as described previously(12.Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Google Scholar). Plasmids used for transfection were purified by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation.Tabled 1 COS-1 cells (ATCC CRL-1650) were grown to near confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 g/liter), and penicillin G (0.1 g/liter) in a water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere. About 16 h before transfection, the cells were subcultured 1:2. The COS-1 cells were transfected as described previously(22.DeWitt D.L. El-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Google Scholar, 23.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12387-12392Google Scholar), using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method. Assays of prostaglandin formation by transfected cells were performed essentially as described previously(26.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Google Scholar). Approximately 40 h post-transfections, the cells were removed from culture dishes using a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/three 100-mm culture plates. The resuspended cells were incubated with 60 μM [1-14C]arachidonic acid or 10 μM [1-14C]α-linolenic acid for 15 min at 37°C. To terminate the reactions, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, the medium was removed, and 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone were added to the medium. After removal of denatured protein by centrifugation, the supernatant containing the radioactive prostaglandin products and unreacted arachidonic acid was acidified with 0.5 volume of 0.2 M HCl and extracted with 6 volumes of chloroform. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform, and applied to a silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatographic plate. The lipid products were separated by chromatography twice in benzene:dioxane:acetic acid:formic acid (82:14:1:1, v/v/v/v), and the thin-layer chromatography plates were then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film, typically for 40 h. Autoradiographic bands were quantified by densitometry using a Visage 110 Image Analyzer. The percentage of radioactive arachidonate converted to prostaglandins was calculated by dividing the density attributable to PGF2α plus PGE2 plus PGD2 by the total density of all bands and multiplying by 100. COS-1 cells expressing human PGHS-1(18.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar), human PGHS-2, ovine PGHS-1 (18.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar), or ovine R120Q PGHS-1 were incubated with 10 μM [1-14C]α-linolenic acid for 15 min at 37°C and the products extracted and separated by radio-thin-layer chromatography essentially as described above. Products chromatographing as 12-hydroxy-9,13,15-octadecatrienoic acid (12-HOTrE) were quantified by densitometry(27.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected and harvested as described above. The isolated cells were resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and used to prepare microsomal membrane fractions as described previously(22.DeWitt D.L. El-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Google Scholar, 23.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12387-12392Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase activities were assayed using microsomal preparations made within 3-4 h of their isolation by monitoring the initial rate of O2 uptake at 37°C (200 μM O2) using an oxygen electrode(22.DeWitt D.L. El-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Google Scholar, 23.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12387-12392Google Scholar). Km values for arachidonate were determined using arachidonic acid concentrations in the range of from 1 to 300 μM. The peroxidase activity of microsomal preparations was measured spectrophotometrically at 436 nm using guaiacol and H2O2 as the cosubstrates (28.Markey C.M. Alward A. Weller P.E. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6266-6279Google Scholar). IC50 values for instantaneous inhibition of the cyclooxygenase activities of microsomal preparations of ovine PGHS-1, R120Q PGHS-1, and Y355F PGHS-1 by ibuprofen or flurbiprofen were determined by measuring cyclooxygenase activity in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor added directly to the assay mixture prior to the addition of enzyme(18.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar). To measure time-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity by flurbiprofen, microsomal preparations of PGHS-1 or R120Q PGHS-1 were incubated at 37°C for 0-20 min in the presence and absence of various concentrations of flurbiprofen. Aliquots of these preincubation mixtures were then assayed for cyclooxygenase activity. Solubilized microsomal membranes were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to BA85 nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μM), essentially as detailed previously(29.Regier M.K. Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 457-463Google Scholar, 30.Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Google Scholar). The filters were washed and incubated for 1-2 h with a 1:2000 dilution of an affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against the sequence LMHYPRGIPPQ-C, corresponding to residues Leu272-Gln283 of ovine PGHS-1(30.Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Google Scholar). The filters were then washed and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The filters were again washed and incubated for 1-5 min with Amersham ECL Western blotting detection reagents and then were blot-dried and exposed to XAR-5 film. Transfected COS-1 cells expressing either native ovine PGHS-1 or ovine PGHS-1 mutants having substitutions of Arg120 or Glu524 were incubated with 60 μM [1-14C]arachidonate for 15 min. The major radioactive prostaglandin products (PGE2, PGF2α, and PGD2) were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantified (Fig. 2). Prostaglandins were formed by cells transfected with all of the PGHS-1 mutants except the R120E mutant; however, significantly less product formation occurred with cells expressing the R120Q PGHS-1 mutant. The radioactive prostaglandin and hydroxy fatty acid products appeared to be formed in the same relative proportions in all cases, indicating that none of the mutations other than the R120E mutation affected the normal mechanism of oxygenation of arachidonate. Western transfer blotting of equal amounts of microsomal protein from COS-1 cells expressing each of the mutants and the native PGHS-1 indicated that all of the enzymes except the R120E PGHS-1 mutant were expressed at comparable levels and that R120E PGHS-1 was expressed at about 22% of the level of native PGHS-1 (data not shown). Ovine native PGHS-1 and the various PGHS-1 mutants were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, and microsomal membranes prepared from the cells were assayed for cyclooxygenase activity, using 100 μM arachidonate, and peroxidase activity, using H2O2 and guaiacol as the cosubstrates (Fig. 3). Again, the R120E mutant lacked detectable cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. The R120K mutant exhibited only 10% of cyclooxygenase activity of native PGHS-1, but increased levels of peroxidase activity. The R120Q mutant had only 5% of the cyclooxygenase activity of the native enzyme but 60% of native peroxidase activity. Mutations of Glu524 had little effect on either the cyclooxygenase or peroxidase activities of PGHS-1. The rate of oxygenation by native PGHS-1 falls by greater than 90% within 2 min of adding enzyme to the assay chamber (Fig. 4); this is due to suicide inactivation of native ovine PGHS-1(1.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 163-199Google Scholar). In contrast, the rate of oxygenation of arachidonate by the R120Q mutant remained relatively constant for several minutes after mixing enzyme and substrates. The t1/2 values for suicide inactivation of native PGHS-1 and R120Q PGHS-1 were estimated by plotting the log of activity at different times after initiation of oxygenation versus time and found to be approximately 15 and 330 s, respectively (Fig. 4). Clearly, R120Q PGHS-1 undergoes suicide inactivation at a much slower rate than native enzyme; this difference between rates of suicide inactivation accounts for the rather small (2-fold) difference in prostaglandin product formation observed after a 15-min incubation (Fig. 2) versus the rather large (20-fold) difference in initial velocities of oxygenation (Fig. 3) when comparing native PGHS-1 and R120Q PGHS-1. The Km values determined for arachidonic acid with native PGHS-1 and various mutant PGHSs-1 are presented in Table 2. Native ovine PGHS-1 had a Km value of 4 μM with arachidonate. In the case of the R120K mutant, this value increased about 20-fold to 87 μM. An even more dramatic increase of roughly 1000-fold was observed for the R120Q mutant. In contrast, the E524K, E524Q, and E524D mutants of ovine PGHS-1 exhibited Km values in the low micromolar range, similar to that of native PGHS-1.Tabled 1 α-Linolenic acid is a C18 fatty acid that can be oxidized to 12-HOTrE by either human PGHS-1 or PGHS-2(27.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Google Scholar); however, α-linolenic acid exhibits a particularly low Kcat/Km value with human PGHS-1(27.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 5 is a comparison of 12-HOTre formation from [1-14C]linolenic acid by COS-1 cells expressing human PGHS-1, human PGHS-2, ovine PGHS-1, or the R120Q mutant of ovine PGHS-1. Although ovine PGHS-1 formed product from α-linolenic acid, the R120Q mutant failed to form any product. Thus, modification of Arg120 dramatically affects the oxygenation of this C18 fatty acid substrate as well as arachidonate. To determine whether elimination of the positively charged Arg120 group permits PGHS-1 to use fatty acid methyl esters as substrates, we also incubated microsomal preparations of COS-1 cells expressing native PGHS-1 and the R120Q PGHS-1 mutant with methyl arachidonate. However, no oxygenation of the methyl ester was observed with either enzyme preparation as determined by O2 electrode assays. In the crystal structure of the ovine PGHS-1/S-flurbiprofen complex, the phenolic side chain of Tyr355 is located in a position which permits the carboxylate group of S-flurbiprofen to bind to Arg120; however, molecular modeling of the binding of R-flurbiprofen suggests that the phenolic group of Tyr355 would interact with the α-methyl group of this inhibitor, so as to interfere with the binding of the carboxylate group to Arg120; this provides an explanation for why R-isomers of 2-phenylpropionic acid derivatives are always much poorer inhibitors of PGHS-1 than the corresponding S-isomers. We tested this concept using D- and L-ibuprofen and an ovine Y355F PGHS-1 mutant prepared previously(12.Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Google Scholar); IC50 values were determined for native PGHS-1 and the Y355F and R120Q PGHS-1 mutants (Fig. 6). The ratios of the IC50 values determined with D- and L-ibuprofen were 32, 7, and 67 for native PGHS-1, Y355F PGHS-1, and R120Q PGHS-1, respectively. Thus, there is a partial loss of stereochemical specificity with the Y355F mutant. This result is consistent with the proposal that the phenolic side chain of Tyr355 does influence the stereospecificity of binding of 2-phenylpropionic acid derivatives to ovine PGHS-1. Flurbiprofen causes a time-dependent inhibition of PGHS-1(17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 18.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar), whereas the methyl ester of flurbiprofen does not(17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar). The following experiments were performed to determine if the converse were true (i.e. whether the R120Q mutant of PGHS-1 was refractory to time-dependent inhibition by flurbiprofen). First, the IC50 values were determined to be 5 μM and 1 mM for “instantaneous” inhibition by flurbiprofen of native PGHS-1 and R120Q PGHS-1, respectively (data not shown); the value for native PGHS-1 is very similar to that reported earlier(17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 22.DeWitt D.L. El-Harith E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the effects of incubating R120Q PGHS-1 with 1 mM flurbiprofen for different times. No time-dependent inhibition of R120Q PGHS-1 was observed upon treatment of this mutant enzyme with flurbiprofen. However, as reported previously, flurbiprofen caused a time-dependent inhibition of native PGHS-1 activity(17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 27.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Google Scholar); with 10-6M flurbiprofen, the t1/2 for inactivation of PGHS-1 was about 2.5 min (data not shown). The studies reported here were designed to examine postulated roles for Arg120, Glu524, and Tyr355(10.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar) in the binding of fatty acids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to the cyclooxygenase active site of ovine PGHS-1. Our results support the concept that Arg120 is involved in binding the carboxylate moieties of arachidonate and two different 2-phenylpropionate inhibitors, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, but that Glu524 is not involved in either catalysis or substrate binding (Fig. 1). Placing a negative charge in the form of the side chain of a glutamate at residue 120 reduced cyclooxygenase activity to undetectable levels. However, this loss of cyclooxygenase activity was accompanied by a corresponding loss of peroxidase activity, suggesting that the R120E mutant does not fold properly(2.Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Google Scholar, 13.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Google Scholar); also consistent with this conclusion was the observation of substantially diminished expression of the R120E mutant compared with all the catalytically active PGHS-1 mutants examined in this study. When Arg120 was replaced with a glutamine residue having a neutral side chain, the R120Q PGHS-1 mutant retained detectable levels of cyclooxygenase activity (5%) and peroxidase activity (approximately 60%), but the Km value for arachidonate was about 1000-fold higher than that seen for the native enzyme. The lack of activity of the R120Q PGHS-1 toward α-linolenic acid suggests that Arg120 is also required for binding this fatty acid in the cyclooxygenase active site. Overall, the studies of the R120Q mutant PGHS-1 indicate that Arg120 is not essential for catalysis, but that this residue affects the affinity of the enzyme for arachidonate. Taken in the context of the crystal structure of PGHS-1 (10.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar), we interpret these results as indicating that the arginino group of Arg120 binds to the carboxylate group of arachidonate. When IC50 values were determined using the same concentration of arachidonate, the concentration of D-ibuprofen required to cause half-maximal inhibition of R120Q PGHS-1 was 10-20 times higher than that required to inhibit the native enzyme (Fig. 6). Because the difference in Km values for arachidonate between native PGHS-1 and R120Q PGHS-1 differ by about 1000-fold (Table 2), this observation suggests that Arg120 is relatively more important for arachidonate binding than ibuprofen binding. Previous studies had shown that Tyr355 of ovine PGHS-1 can be nitrated in the presence but not the absence of either indomethacin or ibuprofen(12.Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Google Scholar, 31.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Hla T. Maciag T. Shimokawa T. Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Fritsch J. Hedqvist P. Advances in Prostaglandin, Thromboxane, and Leukotriene Research. 20. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 14-21Google Scholar). These findings indicated that Tyr355 could reside in or near the cyclooxygenase active site of the enzyme; nonetheless, the Y355F PGHS-1 mutant retained appreciable activity, indicating that Tyr355 is not essential for catalysis(12.Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Google Scholar). When the crystal structure of the ovine PGHS-1/S-flurbiprofen complex was solved, Tyr355 was found to reside near the mouth of the cyclooxygenase channel and to neighbor the α-methyl group of S-flurbiprofen. Accordingly, Garavito and co-workers (10.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar) proposed that modification of this Tyr355 might alter the stereochemical specificity of PGHS-1 toward inhibitors of the 2-phenylpropionic acid group such as ibuprofen and flurbiprofen. Indeed, the Y355F PGHS-1 mutant, which has a relatively small decrease in side chain size at this position, exhibited considerably less specificity toward D- and L-ibuprofen than did the native PGHS-1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs fall into two major functional groups based on their abilities to cause simple competitive versus time-dependent, competitive inhibition (19.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 179-194Google Scholar, 21.Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Google Scholar). Ibuprofen is a freely reversible competitive inhibitor, whereas flurbiprofen and indomethacin cause a time-dependent inhibition which is only slowly reversible (17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 18.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar, 19.Smith W.L.

Prostaglandins. 1986; 31: 625-637Google Scholar). However, the methyl esters of time-dependent inhibitors are freely reversible, competitive inhibitors(17.Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar). In the case of flurbiprofen, esterification would be expected to diminish the ability of the inhibitor to bind Arg120. Our results indicate that the converse is also true because the R120Q mutant of PGHS-1 did not undergo a time-dependent inhibition even in the presence of high concentrations (10-3M) of flurbiprofen. Thus, binding of the carboxylate group of inhibitors is one important characteristic of time-dependent inhibition. We speculate that one requirement for time-dependent inhibition is that the inhibitor remain in the cyclooxygenase active site long enough for some secondary NSAID-induced change in protein structure to occur and that the occupancy time for binding of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as flurbiprofen to the active site of the R120Q mutant is too short to permit such structural changes to occur. A final unexpected characteristic of the R120Q PGHS-1 mutant is its incapacity to undergo suicide inactivation. This feature has been observed with several other forms of ovine PGHS-1, including the Mn3+-heme PGHS-1 (33.Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Google Scholar) and several mutants having modification near the active site tyrosine, notably H386A/Q ovine PGHS-1 (13.Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Google Scholar) and H372A human PGHS-2. 1The abbreviations used are: PGHSprostaglandin endoperoxide H synthasePGprostaglandin12-HOTrE12-hydroxy-(9Z,13E/Z,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acids However, unlike these mutants, the R120Q PGHS-1 mutant exhibits considerable peroxidase activity. One characteristic of peroxidase-deficient forms of PGHS-1 is that they fail to form a tyrosyl radical in abundance(33.Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2151875532,"The characteristics of P-glycoprotein (MDR1), an ATP-dependent drug extrusion pump responsible for the multidrug resistance of human cancer, were investigated in an in vitro expression system. The wild-type and several mutants of the human MDR1 cDNA were engineered into recombinant baculoviruses and the mutant proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells. In isolated cell membrane preparations of the virus-infected cells the MDR1-dependent drug-stimulated ATPase activity, and 8-azido-ATP binding to the MDR1 protein were studied. We found that when lysines 433 and/or 1076 were replaced by methionines in the ATP-binding domains, all these mutations abolished drug-stimulated ATPase activity independent of the MgATP concentrations applied. Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP showed that the double lysine mutant had a decreased ATP-binding affinity. In the MDR1 mutant containing a Gly185 to Val replacement we found no significant alteration in the maximum activity of the MDR1-ATPase or in its activation by verapamil and vinblastine, and this mutation did not modify the MgATP affinity or the 8-azido-ATP binding of the transporter either. However, the Gly185 to Val mutation significantly increased the stimulation of the MDR1-ATPase by colchicine and etoposide, while slightly decreasing its stimulation by vincristine. These shifts closely correspond to the effects of this mutation on the drug-resistance profile, as observed in tumor cells.

The overexpression of a 170-kDa membrane protein, termed P-glycoprotein (Pgp) 1The abbreviations used are: PgpP-glycoproteinMDR1multidrug resistance proteinSf9 cellsSpodoptera frugiperda ovarian cellsNBDnucleotide-binding domainABC transportersATP-binding cassette transportersECLenhanced chemiluminescencentnucleotides. or multidrug resistance transporter (MDR1), is one of the major causes of multidrug resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. The human MDR1 protein actively extrudes or interacts with a wide variety of chemically dissimilar and apparently unrelated compounds, e.g. cytotoxic drugs (Vinca alkaloids, colchicine, epipodophyllotoxins, and anthracyclines), calcium channel blockers (verapamil and nifedipine), calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine), or cyclosporines (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993). It has been recently reported that Pgp is also capable of interacting with a variety of small peptides and peptide derivatives (Sharma et al., 1992; Sarkadi et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994) as well as hydrophobic fluorescent dyes (Neyfakh, 1988; Homolya et al., 1993; Holló et al., 1994). P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance protein Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells nucleotide-binding domain ATP-binding cassette transporters enhanced chemiluminescence nucleotides. In connection with its transport activity, Pgp has been shown to possess a drug-stimulated ATPase activity in isolated plasma membrane vesicles (Sarkadi et al., 1992; Doige et al., 1992; Shimabuku et al., 1992; Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993), or when the partially purified protein was reconstituted into liposomes (Ambudkar et al., 1992; Doige et al., 1993; Shapiro and Ling, 1994; Urbatsch et al., 1994). Drug transport in vesicles containing partially purified Pgp was shown to be coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Sharom et al., 1993). These studies, in addition to earlier data indicating an energy-requirement for MDR1-dependent drug extrusion clearly demonstrate a direct coupling between drug transport and ATP hydrolysis in the functioning of this protein. Regarding its molecular architecture, P-glycoprotein is a member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family of membrane transporters, containing 1280 amino acids, which form two symmetrical homologous halves, each with six putative transmembrane domains and an intracellular nucleotide binding domain (Endicott and Ling, 1989; Higgins, 1992). Of major importance would be to learn how ATP binding and hydrolysis is coupled to drug transport within this molecule, that is how the nucleotide binding domains interact with the transmembrane regions when performing active drug extrusion. Both predicted NBDs contain the “homology A” and “homology B” consensus sequences, originally described by Walker et al.(1982). These highly conserved regions are characteristic for several ATP-binding proteins including all the known ABC transporters (Higgins, 1992), and it has been demonstrated that the intact structure of these regions of the NBDs is essential for the drug transporting activity of Pgp. In the mouse MDR1 gene, the conversion of Gly to Ala at positions 431 or 1073, or that of Lys to Arg at positions 432 or 1074 (within the homology A consensus sequences), resulted in an almost complete loss of the function of the transporter, although 8-azido-ATP binding was conserved (Azzaria et al., 1989). Concerning the site of interaction of Pgp with its transported substrates, e.g. cytotoxic drugs or drug resistance reversing agents, photoaffinity labeling has determined that both halves of Pgp contribute to a single substrate binding site (Bruggemann et al., 1992). Photoaffinity drug labeling experiments combined with trypsin digestion, mapped two major photolabeled fragments within, or immediately COOH-terminal to the last transmembrane domains of each half of the molecule, suggesting that some regions of the drug binding sites are in close proximity to the ATP binding regions (Greenberger, 1993). A key region in substrate handling seems to be the cytoplasmic loop between the second and third transmembrane α-helices. A spontaneous mutation in this region from the wild-type Gly to Val occurred at position 185 in human KB cells, when these cells were selected in high concentrations of colchicine. This substitution greatly increases the relative resistance to colchicine and etoposide (Choi et al., 1988; Kioka et al., 1989), and influences the photoaffinity labeling of Pgp with different drugs (Safa et al., 1990; Bruggemann et al., 1992). Recent experiments of Loo and Clarke (1994a) indicated that a Gly-Val exchange at five different positions in the cytoplasmic loops of Pgp resulted in a similarly increased resistance to colchicine and adriamycin without altering resistance to vinblastine. In order to investigate the functional significance of the changes in the nucleotide binding and substrate recognition regions, we expressed the wild-type and some mutant MDR1 proteins in a baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell expression system, and characterized the MDR1-ATPase activity and ATP binding in isolated membrane preparations. As demonstrated earlier, this baculovirus-insect cell expression system can be used for producing large amounts of membrane-inserted human MDR1, which, although underglycosylated, is antigenically and functionally similar to its mammalian counterpart (Germann et al., 1990; Sarkadi et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1994). In the present experiments we used site-directed mutagenesis to alter single amino acids of the human Pgp in the homology A consensus sequences in the NBDs of the NH2-terminal (Lys433 to Met) and/or COOH-terminal (Lys1076 to Met) halves, and applied the cDNA of the spontaneous Gly185 to Val substitution mutant. The MDR1 cDNAs were engineered into baculovirus vectors, recombinant baculoviruses were generated, and after the infection of Sf9 insect cells with the MDR1 viruses the cell membranes were isolated. The expression levels and the functional characteristics of the MDR1 mutants were studied by immunoblotting, by measuring vanadate-sensitive drug-stimulated ATPase activity, and by examining the binding of 8-azido-ATP in the isolated cell membranes. In this work the following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-GGAATTGGTGCTGGGGTGCTGG, mdr01 (nt 358-379); 5′-GTCCAAGAACAGGACTGATGG, mdr02R (nt 659-679); 5′-CCATCTCGAAAAGAAGTTAAG, abc01 (nt 1204-1224); 5′-CTTATCCAGAGCCACCTGAACC, abc22R (nt 1704-1725); 5′-CCCACCCGACCGGACATCCCA, abc02 (nt 3133-3153); 5′-ATGCAGGTGCGGCCTTCTCT, abc04R (nt 3663-3683). The transfer vector pAc373-MDR1/Val185 was prepared as described by Germann et al.(1990); for the preparation of transfer vector pVL941-MDR1/Val185 a similar strategy was utilized. The transfer vector pVL1393-MDR1/Gly185 was constructed by isolating the wild-type MDR1 cDNA from plasmid pHaMDRGA (Kioka et al., 1989). The insert was ligated as a blunt ended BstUI-XhoI fragment (containing a 10-base pair 5′-untranslated region and a 110-base pair 3′-untranslated region with no polyadenylation site) into the SmaI site of baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen). To obtain pVL941-MDR1/Gly185, both pVL941-MDR1/Val185 and pVL1393-MDR1/Gly185 were subjected to BglII digestion. This enzyme cuts MDR1 cDNA at nucleotide positions 258 and 1223 but leaves both vectors unharmed. The approximate 1-kilobase pair BglII insert, originated from pVL1393-MDR1/Gly185, was gel-purified and ligated into the gel-purified pVL941-MDR1/Val185, which lacked the MDR1 258-1223 region. The orientation of the fragment was checked by restriction mapping, the presence of the Gly185 codon was confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products generated with primers mdr01-mdr02R; mdr01 was used as sequencing primer. Transfer vectors pVL941-MDR1/Val185/Met433/Lys433, pVL941-MDR1/Val185/Lys433/Met1076, and pVL941-MDR1/Val185/Met1076/Met1076 were produced by replacing the 1177-3372 EcoRI-PstI region of MDR1 in pVL941-MDR1/Val185 with those of pUCFVXMDR1/neo MK, KM, and MM, respectively. 2B.

Recombinant baculoviruses, carrying the different mutants of the human MDR1 cDNA, were generated by using the BaculoGold Transfection Kit (Pharmingen), according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were infected and cultured according to the procedures described previously (Germann et al., 1990). For each MDR1 construct the mutation was confirmed by sequencing the respective cDNA from the recombinant baculovirus. Virus supernatant (500 μl, containing about 5 × 107 virus) was incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K (final volume 1 ml) at 42°C for 3 h. To precipitate the protein 0.5 volumes of 7.5 M ammonium acetate was added. After centrifugation the virus DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then EtOH precipitated. Various amounts (10-100 ng) of this virus DNA preparation were subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification. The polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced as follows: the polymerase chain reaction reaction mixture was diluted to 400 μl with H20 and the amplification primers and other low molecular mass constituents of the mixture were removed by filtration through a Ultrafree-MC filter unit. This step was repeated twice. Then an aliquot of 60 ng of DNA was subjected to denaturation in the presence of 25 pmol of sequencing primer in annealing buffer (Sequenase kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 10 μl final volume: the reaction mixture was kept at 100°C for 2 min and then it was immediately cooled down in dry ice/EtOH. For chain termination the standard Sequenase protocol (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was followed. The virus-infected Sf9 cells were harvested and their membranes were isolated and stored, the membrane protein concentrations were determined as described by Sarkadi et al.(1992). ATPase activity of the isolated Sf9 cell membranes was estimated by measuring inorganic phosphate liberation as described in the same article. The data points in the figures show the means of triplicate determinations in representative experiments. The differences between the ATPase activities measured in the absence and presence of vanadate (100 μM) are plotted. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the 4077 polyclonal antibody which recognizes human MDR1 (Tanaka et al., 1990) were carried out as described in Sarkadi et al.(1992). The second antibody was an anti-rabbit, peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), used in 20,000 × dilutions. Horseradish peroxidase-dependent luminescence on the polyvinylidine difluoride membrane immunoblots (ECL, Amersham) was determined by excising the respective bands from the polyvinylidine difluoride membrane and measuring their luminescence in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000, SPM mode). The amounts of the expressed MDR1 were calculated from the luminescence values, based on a calibration by a dilution series of standard Sf9-MDR1 membrane preparations. For the photoaffinity labeling of the wild-type or mutant MDR1 protein, isolated Sf9 cell membranes (150 μg of protein) were incubated in a reaction buffer of Tris (50 mM), mannitol (50 mM), EGTA (2 mM), dithiothreitol (1 mM), MgCl2 (2 mM), pH 7.0, in a final volume of 50 μl, in the presence of 5-70 μM final concentration of 8-azido-ATP (Sigma), containing 0.1 MBq [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (ICN Biomedicals, 196 GBq/mM), and in some samples various concentrations (0.1-1 mM) of ATP or AMP. The samples in a drop on a Parafilm-covered glass plate, cooled to 4°C, and kept on ice, were irradiated for 10 min with an UV lamp (λmax about 250 nm) at a distance of 3 cm. Thereafter the membranes were precipitated with 2 ml of ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 15 mM inorganic phosphate and 10 mM ATP, spun down with 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and washed 3 times with 3 ml of the same trichloroacetic acid solution with similar centrifugations. The final pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of the electrophoresis buffer, and the samples were run on 4-12% gradient (Bio-Rad) or on 6% Laemmli-type gels, thereafter electroblotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Sarkadi et al., 1992). The blots were dried and subjected to autoradiography, and the identity of the [32P]azido-ATP-labeled MDR1 band was assured by immunostaining with MDR1-specific antibody(4077) on the same blot (see Fig. 1C). In the first set of experiments we compared the expression levels of the mutant MDR1 proteins in the baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells by quantitative immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of the various MDR1 constructs in the isolated Sf9 cell membranes yielded approximately the same amounts of immunoreactive proteins, while the β-galactosidase-infected cells had no measurable amount of MDR1. The MDR1 expression levels varied from cell batch to batch within about 20%, and the mean values (in micrograms/mg of membrane protein) for each mutant used in the further experiments are given in Fig. 1. These values were obtained from the quantitation of the ECL luminescence of the peroxidase-labeled MDR1-specific bands on the immunoblots, and as a reference we used the previously estimated MDR1 expression level of 30 μg/mg membrane protein for the MDR1-Val185 construct (Sarkadi et al., 1992). Fig. 1, B and C, demonstrate photoaffinity labeling of the isolated Sf9 cell membranes with 8-azido-ATP. The isolated membranes were labeled in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 and 35 μM [α-32P]8-azido-ATP, membrane proteins separated by gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (see “Materials and Methods”). The protein band corresponding to the [32P]azido-ATP-labeled MDR1 was identified by immunostaining with MDR1-specific antibody on the same blot (see Fig. 1C). As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, in contrast to the β-galactosidase expressing cell membranes, an additional 8-azido-ATP-labeled band, corresponding to the antigenically identified MDR1 protein, was observed in the membranes expressing either the wild-type or any of the mutant MDR1 constructs. We found that 8-azido-ATP binding and photoaffinity labeling required the presence of Mg2+ (1 mM EDTA eliminated labeling). At the 8-azido-ATP concentration applied in these experiments (35 μM), the photoaffinity labeling of the different MDR1 proteins were not significantly different (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the addition of excess cold ATP (1 mM) abolished radioactive 8-azido-ATP labeling of the expressed MDR1 proteins, while 1 mM AMP was ineffective in this respect. In the following experiments we have analyzed the effects of different 8-azido-ATP concentrations on the level of MDR1 labeling by this photoaffinity ATP analogue. After gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of the labeled membranes, the MDR1 bands (identified and the amount of MDR1 quantitated by immunostaining) were excised, and 32P radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. As shown in Fig. 2, in the case of the wild-type MDR1 and the MK and KM mutants, ATP binding had a relatively high-affinity component between 5 and 25 μM 8-azido-ATP concentrations, while such a component was not observable in the case of the MM mutant. As shown also above, there was no major difference in the level of 32P incorporation between the different mutant MDR1 proteins at higher azido-ATP concentrations. In these experiments we studied the basal and the drug (verapamil)-stimulated ATPase activity of the isolated Sf9 cell membranes. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, in contrast to the β-galactosidase-infected cell membranes, both the wild-type (Gly185) and the MDR1-Val185 containing membranes showed a significant amount of vanadate-sensitive verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. In this set of experiments the maximum ATPase activity in the presence of 20 μM verapamil, corrected on the basis of the mean MDR1 expression levels, was about 3 μmol/mg MDR1 protein/min for the Val185, and about 2.5 μmol/mg MDR1 protein/min for the Gly185 enzyme. The ratio of the verapamil-stimulated and non-stimulated ATPase activity was somewhat greater in the case of the Gly185 (5.5) than in the Val185 (3.9) enzyme. Fig. 3 also presents the ATPase activity data for the isolated Sf9 cell membranes containing the NBD mutant MDR1 proteins. In these membranes containing amounts of MDR1 similar to that of the Gly185 or Val constructs (see Fig. 1A), we found that neither the basal nor the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities were significantly greater than those in the β-galactosidase-infected cell membranes. Since in different membrane preparations this background ATPase activity was somewhat variable (see error bars), this may mask a low level of MDR1-ATPase activity (e.g. 3-5% of the wild-type) in the NBD site mutants. Fig. 4 shows the MgATP dependence of the verapamil-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activities of β-galactosidase-infected and various MDR1-expressing Sf9 cell membranes. Both the wild-type and the Gly185-Val mutant MDR1 containing membranes show a verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity which reaches maximum levels at about 3 mM MgATP, with an apparent Km for ATP about 0.5-0.8 mM. MgATP concentrations above 10 mM slightly inhibit this drug-stimulated ATPase. In contrast, the β-galactosidase expressing membranes, or the membranes containing either the KM, MK, or MM mutants of MDR1 (in Fig. 4 we present only the MM construct), have no significant vanadate-sensitive verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity in the whole range of MgATP concentrations examined. Thus, although present in comparable amounts in the isolated membranes and showing 8-azido-ATP labeling, these ATP-binding site mutants have no detectable MDR1-related ATPase activity. As shown above, in the case of the Gly185 to Val mutant we could not see a significant difference in the maximum level of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity or in its MgATP concentration dependence. However, according to the data in the literature (Choi et al., 1988; Kioka et al., 1989) these mutants have different drug specificities. Fig. 5 presents the effects of increasing concentrations of several MDR1-interacting drugs on the vanadate-sensitive ATPase of the two different (Gly185 and Val185) MDR1-expressing cell membranes. In this figure we present the vanadate-sensitive MDR1-dependent ATPase activity values corrected for the amount of the MDR1 protein in the isolated Sf9 membranes (see Fig. 1). As shown, the verapamil-stimulation curves for the two different MDR1 proteins are similar, although slight differences can be observed. The concentration required for 50% of maximal stimulation (AC50) for verapamil is slightly higher in the case of the Gly185 (1.8 μM) than for the Val185 (1.2 μM) MDR1 construct, and the inhibition of this latter enzyme is more pronounced at higher verapamil concentrations. In fact, this latter difference may explain the somewhat higher apparent AC50 values calculated in the case of the Gly185 form. The vinblastine activation of the two different MDR1-ATPases are also similar: in both cases the maximum activity is obtained at about 2 μM vinblastine, with an apparent AC50 of about 0.5 μM. In contrast to verapamil and vinblastine, the activation of the two MDR1 forms is distinctly different by colchicine and VP-16 (etoposide). These compounds activate the Val185 MDR1 at lower concentrations and to much higher maximum levels, than the wild-type MDR1. The AC50 value for colchicine in the Val185 membrane is 15 μM, the maximum stimulation is 65% of that by verapamil, while in the case of the Gly185 MDR1 the AC50 is over 100 μM and the level of maximum stimulation is less than 20% of that by verapamil. In the case of etoposide, in the Val185 MDR1 membranes the AC50 value is 12 μM, the maximum stimulation is again 65% of that by verapamil, while in the Gly185 MDR1 membrane the AC50 value is estimated to be about 60 μM, and the maximum stimulation level is less than 15% of that by verapamil. For etoposide, in the Gly185 MDR1 a pronounced inhibition of the MDR1 ATPase activity is seen at above 70 μM of the drug, while such an inhibition is found only above 100 μM etoposide in the Val185 mutant. We have also observed a difference for the activation of the MDR1-ATPase by vincristine: in this case the wild-type form is slightly more sensitive to the drug (the AC50 is about 1.5 μM for the Gly, and about 4 μM for the Val enzyme), although in this case the levels of maximum activations are about the same. P-glycoprotein, the product of the human MDR1 gene, is responsible for an ATP-dependent extrusion of numerous cytotoxic drugs from a wide variety of cancer cells, thus a thorough knowledge concerning its molecular mechanism of action would be of utmost importance for a clinical intervention. In vitro expression systems combined with functional assays of the protein may greatly facilitate such studies and may allow a deeper understanding of the structure-function connections within the protein in its natural membrane environment. A recombinant baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell expression system for producing large amounts of human multidrug transporter has been developed by Germann et al.(1990). The major advantages of this system are that the Sf9 cells perform most of the higher eukaryotic post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, and seem to insert foreign proteins into the cell membrane in a correct transmembrane orientation (O'Reilly et al., 1992). Antibodies raised against different regions of MDR1 recognized the Sf9-expressed protein, and 8-azido-ATP and specific drug binding was also retained by the molecule (Germann et al., 1990; Sarkadi et al., 1992). The molecular mass of the Sf9-expressed MDR1 is slightly smaller than in most mammalian cells (about 130-140 kDa), representing an underglycosylated form of the protein. However, previous studies indicated that the variable levels of glycosylation in various tissues has no significant effect on the function of MDR1 (Greenberger et al., 1987), and Schinkel et al.(1993) demonstrated that Pgp mutants lacking the N-glycosylation sites produced a drug resistance pattern indistinguishable from that of fully glycosylated wild-type MDR1. In the experiments presented above we have used the baculovirus-Sf9 cells expression system to produce wild-type and mutant forms of the human MDR1 protein. As shown in Fig. 1, all the expressed mutants showed electrophoretic mobilities comparable to that of the wild-type P-glycoprotein and were recognized by a polyclonal antibody specific for the NH2-terminal half of MDR1 (antibody 4077; see Tanaka et al.(1990)). A similar antibody recognition of all the expressed proteins could be seen by the commercially available C219 monoclonal antibody and by the polyclonal antibody 4007, recognizing the COOH-terminal half of MDR1 (Tanaka et al., 1990). Since our experiments showed a highly selective and quantitative recognition of Pgp by antibody 4077 in several cell types (Homolya et al., 1993), the quantitative assessment of the expression levels was carried out by using this antibody and the ECL measurements in scintillation counter (see “Materials and Methods”). In the studies reported here we used baculovirus-infected Sf9 membrane preparations with roughly similar MDR1 expression levels and provide for each mutant the measured specific protein values (Fig. 1A). In each case the respective MDR1 form was produced via baculoviruses containing the MDR1 cDNA in a pVL941 virus vector. It should be noted that MDR1 expression levels were variable when using different baculovirus vectors: e.g. MDR1 in pVL1393 had an expression level of less than one-third of that in the pVL941. Still, the molecular masses, the antibody recognition, and all the functional characteristics were similar in the MDR1 preparations prepared by different baculovirus vectors. For the functional characterization of the mutant MDR1 forms we have studied 8-azido-ATP binding, as well as the drug-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity related to the expressed protein. The photoaffinity analog, 8-azido-ATP has been successfully used to specifically label various ATP-binding proteins, including Pgp (Cornwell et al., 1987; Sarkadi et al., 1992; Al-Shawi et al., 1994). In the past few years several studies have demonstrated a high activity vanadate-sensitive, drug-stimulated ATPase, directly connected to the presence of MDR1 in isolated membranes (Sarkadi et al., 1992; Doige et al., 1992; Shimabuku et al., 1992; Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993; Loo and Clarke, 1994b), or in partially purified and reconstituted Pgp preparations (Ambudkar et al., 1992; Doige et al., 1993; Shapiro and Ling, 1994; Urbatsch et al., 1994; Sharom et al., 1993). The MDR1-ATPase has been reported to have a relatively low affinity for ATP, with Km(MgATP) values ranging between 0.5 and 0.8 mM (Sarkadi et al., 1992; Ambudkar et al., 1992; Urbatsch et al., 1994), in accordance with a strong effect of ATP depletion on drug extrusion in intact cells (Endicott and Ling, 1989; Gottesman and Pastan, 1993). All the available evidence strongly suggest that this MDR1-specific ATPase is closely coupled to the ATP-dependent transport function of this protein. In fact, 8-azido-ATP, until exposed to UV light, was shown to be an ATP-like substrate of MDR1, while covalently bound 8-azido-ATP abolished further ATP splitting by the transporter (Al-Shawi et al., 1994). The combination of the ATP binding and hydrolysis assays is believed to provide valuable information about the interaction of genetically manipulated Pgp both with its energy-donor substrate and the transported species. In order to address these questions, the first set of mutants examined in this work was prepared to contain point mutation(s) in the predicted nucleotide binding domains. Both of the predicted NBDs of P-glycoprotein contain the highly conserved A and B consensus motifs, which were originally described by Walker et al.(1982), from sequence comparisons of a large number of bacterial and eukaryotic ATP-binding proteins. The glycine-rich A motif (believed to form a loop between a β bend and an α helix) plays a crucial role in ATP utilization, and the conserved lysine residue in the Walker A sequence is thought to interact directly with one of the phosphate groups of the ATP molecule. Mutational analysis of this A motif in ATP-binding proteins showing ATPase activity, such as the α and β subunits of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (Parsonage et al., 1988), and the yeast STE6 transporter (Berkower and Michaelis, 1991), indicated that substitution of the conserved lysine residue jeopardizes transport activity. The experiments of Azzaria et al.(1989) demonstrated that in mouse Pgp the replacement of these key lysines by arginines in either one of the NBDs eliminated the drug resistance, suggesting that both NBDs are required for the activity of the transporter, although in this mutant ATP binding was conserved. It is interesting to note that when the wild-type and the same double lysine-to-arginine mutant of the mouse MDR1 were expressed in E. coli, the wild-type MDR1-dependent drug efflux was retained by the mutant (Bibi et al., 1993). Unpublished experiments of Morse et al.2 showed, that when mouse cells were transfected with human MDR1 in which lysines 433 and/or 1076 were replaced by methionines, these mutant MDR1 proteins did not confer a multidrug-resistant phenotype. In the experiments described here we demonstrate that when the MDR1 mutants carrying the same lysine/methionine substitutions were expressed in Sf9 cells, each of these point mutations abolished the drug-stimulated ATPase activity, independent of the MgATP concentrations applied. At the same time, specific high affinity photoaffinity labeling of MDR1 by 8-azido-ATP (completely inhibitable by excess cold ATP) was only altered in the double lysine to methionine (MM) mutant, and even in this case the labeling of MDR1 was only slightly decreased at 8-azido-ATP concentrations above 25 μM. It is to be noted that Morse et al.2 observed a significant change of 8-azido-ATP binding in the mutant MDR1 proteins when examined at low (2.5 μM) 8-azido-ATP concentrations. The ATP concentrations producing half-maximal stimulation of the MDR1-ATPase activity (see Sarkadi et al.(1992) and Shapiro and Ling(1994), and Fig. 4 of this paper), or of the MDR1-dependent drug transport (see Gottesman and Pastan (1993)) are in the range of 0.3-0.5 mM. Thus the functional role of the high-affinity ATP binding by MDR1, as seen in the azido-ATP binding experiments, as well as its alteration in the MM mutant, cannot be properly appreciated as yet. Still, our data indicate that drug-stimulated ATPase activity is absent if these highly conservative residues are altered in any of the two NBDs of MDR1, and while single NBD mutations have no major effect on ATP binding at low ATP concentrations, the double lysine to methionine mutation considerably alters this ATP binding. In a previous study, aimed at investigating the role of various parts of the MDR1 protein in its function, the separately expressed NH2-terminal half of the human Pgp showed an ATPase activity comparable to that of the full-length protein, but did not confer drug resistance when expressed in mammalian cells (Shimabuku et al., 1992). The authors suggested that the NH2-terminal NBD contains all the residues required to hydrolyze ATP, without necessarily interacting with the COOH-terminal binding site. A key problem in the studies of Shimabuku et al.(1992) was the relatively low level of the ATPase activity in the isolated full-length or truncated MDR1 (about 150 nmol/mg MDR1 protein) and the lack of drug-stimulation in either case. Convincing data for the role of the two halves of MDR1 have recently been provided by Loo and Clarke (1994b). When the two halves of MDR1 were expressed in Sf9 cells separately, both proteins showed a low level of ATPase activity with no substrate stimulation, while their co-expression restored high-activity, drug-stimulated ATPase. The data presented in this paper, in accordance with the experiments of Azzaria et al.(1989) and Loo and Clarke (1994b), strongly support the idea that the interaction of two functional NBDs are essential both for drug extrusion and drug-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP by MDR1. At the same time it is still unclear whether the concerted hydrolysis of two ATP molecules may be required to transport one molecule of drug. Another key issue to be addressed in the structure-function studies is the site(s) of interaction of the multidrug resistance protein with its transported substrates. A single point mutation in human Pgp, a spontanous exchange of Gly to Val at position 185 (Choi et al., 1988), was reported to result in an increased relative resistance to colchicine and etoposide, while unchanged or slightly reduced resistance toward vinblastine and vincristine (Choi et al., 1988; Currier et al., 1992; Cardarelli et al., 1995). In this study we have reproduced the Gly185 to Val point mutation in the baculovirus-Sf9 expression system for MDR1. Our experiments showed no significant alteration in the maximum activity of the MDR1-ATPase or in its activation kinetics by verapamil and vinblastine, and this mutation did not modify the MgATP affinity or the 8-azido-ATP binding of the transporter either. However, the Gly185 to Val mutation significantly increased the stimulation of the MDR1-ATPase by colchicine and etoposide, while slightly decreasing its stimulation by vincristine. These shifts closely correspond to the effects of this mutation on the drug-resistance profile in intact tumor cells. Moreover, the data indicating that the Gly185 to Val exchange, while increasing colchicine extrusion and colchicine stimulation of the MDR1-ATPase activity, reduces the binding of this drug to the MDR1 protein (Safa et al., 1990), may suggest that in the molecular mechanism of drug extrusion, ATP splitting is required for the dissociation of the drug from the transporter protein. Altogether the data presented in this paper further support the usefulness of the MDR1-ATPase assay in isolated Sf9 membranes for a functional characterization of molecular alterations in the P-glycoprotein. While the present paper was under revision, a publication by U. S. Rao (1995) reported the expression and partial characterization of the Gly185 to Val MDR1 mutants in Sf9 cells. The related findings of the two reports are mostly in accordance, although Rao (1995) obtained a higher maximum activity and a lower Ka for the Val185 MDR1-ATPase than for the Gly185 protein when using verapamil. Since in the experiments of Rao(1995) the maximal MDR1-ATPase activity/mg of membrane protein was significantly smaller than in our studies, this difference may have been caused by the difficulties of MDR1 quantitation at lower protein levels, as well as by the use of different expression vectors and Sf9 cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W2058899879,"Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the rate-limiting step in hepatic gluconeogenesis, is primarily regulated at the level of gene transcription. Insulin and phorbol esters inhibit basal PEPCK transcription and antagonize the induction of PEPCK gene expression by glucocorticoids and glucagon (or its second messenger cAMP). Insulin activates a signaling cascade involving Ras → Raf → p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) → p42/p44 MAP kinase (ERK 1 and 2). Recent reports suggest that activation of this Ras/MAP kinase pathway is critical for the effects of insulin on mitogenesis and c-fos transcription but is not required for insulin action on metabolic processes such as glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, and Glut-4-mediated glucose transport. We have used three distinct approaches to examine the role of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in the regulation of PEPCK transcription by insulin in H4IIE-derived liver cells: (i) chemical inhibition of Ras farnesylation, (ii) infection of cells with an adenovirus vector encoding a dominant-negative mutant of Ras, and (iii) use of a chemical inhibitor of MEK. Although each of these methods blocks insulin activation of MAP kinase, none alters insulin antagonism of cAMP- and glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK transcription. Although phorbol esters activate MAP kinase and mimic the effects of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription, inhibition of MEK has no effect on phorbol ester inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription. Using the structurally and mechanistically distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitors, wortmannin and LY 294002, we provide further evidence supporting a role for PI 3-kinase activation in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin. We conclude that neither insulin nor phorbol ester regulation of PEPCK gene transcription requires activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and that insulin signaling to the PEPCK promoter is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation.

Increased hepatic PEPCK expression has been demonstrated in several animal models of diabetes(4.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281Google Scholar), and overexpression of PEPCK in transgenic mice results in the phenotype of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (5.Valera A. Pujol A. Pelegrin M. Bosch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9151-9154Google Scholar). There are no known allosteric modifiers of PEPCK; its activity is regulated by the level of gene expression(4.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281Google Scholar, 6.O'Brien, R. M., Granner, D. K. (1996) Physiol. Rev., in pressGoogle Scholar). Insulin and phorbol esters inhibit basal PEPCK gene transcription and antagonize the induction of PEPCK expression by glucocorticoids and glucagon (or its second messenger cAMP)(4.Hanson R.W.

Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Google Scholar). Although insulin regulates the transcription of many genes, the regulation of PEPCK transcription has been the most extensively studied and has served as a useful model (6.O'Brien, R. M., Granner, D.

The signaling pathways involved in insulin action have been the subject of intense research (for review see (8.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar) and (9.Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Google Scholar)). Ligand binding stimulates insulin receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc. These molecules then function as high affinity binding sites for several downstream effectors through src homology 2 domains. The two best studied effectors that bind to the IRS-1 docking protein are PI 3-kinase and Grb-2-Sos. The mechanism through which PI 3-kinase activation by insulin or other agents leads to biologic effects is poorly understood. Phosphorylated inositol products have been proposed to activate specific phorbol ester-insensitive protein kinase C isoforms(10.Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Google Scholar, 11.Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase also appears to be tightly associated with or contain a protein kinase activity(13.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K.

Whatever the downstream mechanisms, studies based on PI 3-kinase inhibition have provided clear evidence for a role of this enzyme in the effect of insulin on Glut-4-mediated glucose transport(15.Okada T.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Google Scholar). The other major insulin signaling pathway that is initiated by src homology 2-dependent binding to IRS-1 is the Ras/MAP kinase cascade. Binding of the Grb-2-Sos adapter complex to IRS-1 (or Shc) activates Ras through a Sos-mediated GDP:GTP exchange. Ras subsequently stimulates Raf through a poorly understood mechanism requiring the involvement of other as yet unidentified factors(27.Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Google Scholar, 28.Dent P. Reardon D.B. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Google Scholar). A linear phosphorylation cascade of Raf → MEK → p42/p44 MAP kinase (ERK 1 and 2) subsequently occurs. MAP kinase activation represents a major branch point, and this enzyme may translocate to the nucleus to activate several specific transcription factors. Phorbol esters (via stimulation of protein kinase C) also activate the MAP kinase cascade, and although the precise mechanism is unclear, protein kinase C activation of Raf has been implicated(29.Kolch W.

Adipocytes have been permeabilized to allow the entry of GTP analogs that inactivate Ras(36.Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 709-714Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides have also been used to block Raf activity(37.Tornkvist A. Parpal S. Gustavsson J. Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13919-13921Google Scholar). Clonally selected cells in which active raf mutants were introduced by retroviral infection have also been studied(38.Fingar D.C. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10127-10132Google Scholar). In addition, the ability in certain cells of other growth factors to stimulate the Ras/MAP kinase cascade has been compared with the selective metabolic effects of insulin in these cells(39.van den Berghe N.

Recently, a specific chemical inhibitor of MEK has been developed(42.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar), and its effects were studied in muscle and adipose cell lines(43.Lazar D.F. Weise R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies support a role for activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in nuclear effects of insulin on mitogenesis and c-fos expression(19.Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Available evidence also suggests that the regulation of c-fos gene transcription by insulin requires both Ras and PI 3-kinase activation(18.Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Google Scholar, 19.Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Google Scholar, 33.Medema R.H. Wubbolts R.

To date, however, the involvement of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in insulin signaling in the liver has not been examined. This has in part been the result of the inability to utilize some of the approaches described above (microinjection and transfection) in well characterized liver cell lines. Although the regulation of PEPCK is a critical physiological site of insulin action, little is understood regarding the initial signal transduction mechanisms involved. We have used three different approaches to examine the involvement of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in insulin signaling to PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE-derived liver cells. Farnesylation, an obligatory step in Ras processing, was blocked by two structurally distinct farnesyltransferase inhibitors. An adenovirus containing a dominant-negative ras mutant was used to attenuate the Ras pathway. Finally, a newly described chemical inhibitor of MEK (42.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar) was employed to prevent the activation of this pathway. Each of these three mechanistically distinct approaches used to inhibit the Ras/MAP kinase pathway failed to alter insulin regulation of PEPCK gene transcription. In addition, phorbol ester signaling, which mimics insulin action on the PEPCK gene, in part through the same promoter sequence(44.O'Brien R.M. Bonovich M.T. Forest C.D. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6580-6584Google Scholar), was likewise not dependent on Ras/MAP kinase pathway activation. Recently, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin has been shown to block the effects of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription(45.Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Google Scholar). We extend these results by demonstrating similar effects of the structurally and mechanistically distinct PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002, and we corroborate the original report (45.Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Google Scholar) by demonstrating inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity at the wortmannin concentrations used to antagonize insulin's actions on PEPCK gene transcription. We conclude that insulin regulation of PEPCK gene transcription does not require Ras/MAP kinase pathway activation but is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation. The MEK inhibitor PD 98059 and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor PD 152440 were generously provided by Dr. Alan Saltiel (Parke-Davis Warner Lambert Pharmaceutical Research Division, Ann, Arbor, MI). The farnesyltransferase inhibitor B581 and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor were obtained from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 was kindly provided by Dr. Bentley Cheatham (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Polyclonal anti CT-IRS-1 antibody was a gift from Dr. Morris White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). γ-32P-labeled ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN, and the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The isolation of the H4IIE rat hepatoma-derived stable transfectant, HL1C, which contains the PEPCK promoter sequence from −2100 to +69 ligated to the CAT reporter gene, has been described previously(46.Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Google Scholar). This cell line has been extensively characterized and contains all the promoter elements required for PEPCK gene regulation by cAMP, dexamethasone, phorbol esters, and insulin. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5.5 mM glucose, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Hormone and inhibitor additions were carried out with cells at 70% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture plates for times and at the concentrations detailed in the figure legends. For CAT protein determinations, cells were harvested by trypsinization and lysis in 0.45 ml of CAT lysis buffer according to the Boehringer Mannheim CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results from CAT measurements are expressed as the percentage of CAT protein relative to the amount obtained in the presence of cAMP and dexamethasone. A recombinant adenovirus expressing a dominant-negative Ras was generated by cloning of the cDNA with serine mutated to asparagine at position 17 (gift of G. Cooper) into the polylinker of the vector pACCMVpLpA (gift of C. Newgard) through a series of cloning steps detailed below. This vector was developed (47.Gluzman Y. Eukaryotic Viral Vectors. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) by modification of the pAC vector by replacement of a region of the adenovirus genome between map units 1.3 and 9.4 with the cytomegalovirus promoter, a cloning cassette, and the SV40 genome that includes the small intron of the t antigen and the polyadenylation signal. The ras Asn17 cDNA was isolated from the plasmid pMT-M17 (gift of G. Cooper); the resulting 0.7-kilobase XbaI-PstI fragment was subsequently subcloned in Xba-PstI sites of the pGem-3zf vector polylinker. The ras Asn17 cDNA was then isolated using the Bamh1-PstI sites and cloned into the PBSII-SK± vector. The corresponding Bamh1-SalI fragment was then finally cloned into the corresponding sites of the pACCMVpLpA polylinker with the generation of pACCMVpLpA-ras-Asn17. The pACCMVpLpA-ras-Asn17 vector and the pJM17 vector (gift of C. Newgard) were cotransfected in confluent 293 cells using the CaPO4-DNA coprecipitation technique with modified bovine serum (Stratagene kit 200388). After 8-10 days, the death of the 293 cells was used to select for recombinant virus encoding Ras Asn17 protein. The viral DNA was then extracted from 293 cells, and the insert was confirmed by Southern blotting analysis. A single clone of recombinant adenovirus was isolated through serial dilution using a plaque assay. The expansion of the recombinant adenovirus was performed as described previously (48.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Google Scholar) with 293 cells, and the recombinant adenovirus was subsequently concentrated on a cesium chloride gradient and desalted in a desalting column (Pharmacia HR 10/10). The concentration of the recombinant adenovirus was assessed based on the adsorbance at 280 nm where 1 optical density unit corresponds to 1012 pfu/ml. An identical adenovirus containing the β-galactosidase gene instead of the Asn17ras was used as a control. The infectivity of the adenovirus construct was greater than 90% based upon β-galactosidase staining of cells infected with a β-galactosidase containing adenovirus (gift of C. Newgard) at a final concentration of 1010 pfu/ml. HL1C cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with hormone/inhibitor for the times and the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Total cellular RNA (approximately 100 μg/106 cells) was then isolated(46.Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes complementary to positions +102 to +129 and +42 to +67, relative to the transcription start site, in the PEPCK and β-actin genes were then used in primer extension assays as described(45.Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were subsequently quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). HL1C cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 18 h in 10-cm dishes and preincubated with wortmannin or Me2SO for 15 min. Insulin (10 nM) was subsequently added where indicated, and 5 min later cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized in buffer composed of 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 135 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-CT IRS-1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose, in each case for 90 min at 4°C. Immunopreciptates were washed twice in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM vanadate. PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate was then determined by measuring 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into phosphatidylinositol as described (49.Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 20 μl of the above immunoprecipitate was added to 20 μl of assay buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml PI, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2, and 250 μM ATP containing 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of 1 N HCL and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). The samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed in a solution containing 37.5% methanol, 30% CHCl3, 22.5% pyridine, 1 M boric acid, 1.33% formic acid, and 8.5 mM butyrated hydroxytoluene. Plates were subsequently dried and visualized by autoradiography. Cells (10-cm dishes) were incubated with inhibitors for the times indicated in the figure legends. Insulin (10 nM) was subsequently added, and 5 min later cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped, and sonicated in 0.4 ml of buffer containing 50 mM glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM vanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM benzamidine(50.Wilden P.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 558-567Google Scholar). Extracts were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were assayed for MAP kinase activity as described previously(50.Wilden P.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 558-567Google Scholar). Briefly, 12.5 μl of cell extract was incubated with 12.5 μl of the reaction mixture (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM vanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 μM calmidazolium, 25 μg/ml cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein) for 15 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by spotting on phosphocellulose paper and washed three times in 150 mM phosphoric acid, and radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. The basal activity of MAP kinase was 160.5 cpm/min/μg of cell lysate. Elements of the insulin signaling pathway involved in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription were studied in the rat hepatoma-derived cell line (H4IIE) stably transfected with the PEPCK promoter sequence from −2100 to +69 (relative to the transcriptional start site) ligated to a CAT reporter gene (termed HL1C cells)(46.Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Google Scholar). This stable transfectant has been previously characterized, and the PEPCK-CAT fusion gene exhibits similar regulation by insulin, glucocorticoid, cAMP, and phorbol esters when compared with the endogenous gene. That is, insulin and phorbol esters act in a dominant fashion, blocking the induction of PEPCK-CAT transcription by cAMP and dexamethasone(46.Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Google Scholar). Given the low basal level of PEPCK transcription in the absence of other effectors, transcriptional regulation of PEPCK has been best studied using the ability of insulin to counteract stimulation of gene transcription by glucagon (or cAMP) and glucocorticoids(4.Hanson R.W.

A similar need to observe insulin effects as the antagonism of the actions of counter-regulatory hormones has been reported for many of insulin's actions in liver. Here we focus on the signaling pathways that mediate insulin's antagonism of maximally stimulatory concentrations of cAMP (using the nonhydrolyzable analog 8-CPT-cAMP) and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The role of Ras in insulin regulation of the PEPCK-CAT fusion gene was first investigated by blocking farnesylation of Ras (an obligatory step in Ras processing) using two structurally different farnesyltransferase inh"

Ac39 and Ac116, two other transmembrane subunits of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase, were also found by Western blotting to be enriched in the immunoprecipitates. None of these V-ATPase subunits, or synaptophysin, was present in anti-synaptobrevin 2 immunoprecipitates obtained from frozen-thawed Triton X-100 extracts, which were greatly enriched, instead, in SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1. Accordingly, V-ATPase subunit c was found in anti-synaptophysin immunoprecipitates generated from fresh, but not frozen-thawed extracts, and was not found in anti-syntaxin 1 immunoprecipitates. Thus, the two complexes appear to be mutually exclusive. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain demonstrated that V-ATPase subunit c is localized with synaptobrevin 2 and synaptophysin in synaptic vesicles. The coprecipitation of V-ATPase subunit c with the synaptobrevin-synaptophysin complex suggests that this interaction may play a role in recruiting the proton pump into synaptic vesicles. Freeze-thawing, which involves a mild denaturing step, may produce a conformational change which dissociates the complex and mimics a change which occurs in vivo as a prerequisite to SNARE complex formation.

INTRODUCTIONSynaptic vesicles (SV), 1The abbreviations used are: SVsynaptic vesicleNSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteinSNAPsoluble NSF attachment proteinSNARESNAP receptorv-SNAREvesicle SNAREt-SNAREtarget SNAREPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the vesicular carriers responsible for secretion of non-peptide neurotransmitters at synapses, are a very useful experimental model for investigating fundamental mechanisms in vesicular traffic(1.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 2.Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Google Scholar, 3.Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Google Scholar, 4.De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 3-12Google Scholar). Studies carried out on SVs have converged with studies on neurotoxins, genetic studies in yeast, and cell-free studies of vesicular transport, and allowed to formulate a fist hypothetical model of docking and fusion(5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). The model predicts that small proteins located at the cytosolic surface of the vesicular carrier, v-SNAREs, interact with small proteins located at the cytosolic surface of the target membrane, t-SNAREs, to a form the so-called SNARE complex, and that this interaction is one of the key steps leading to fusion(5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar, 6.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar). In the case of SVs, v-SNAREs are the synaptobrevins and t-SNAREs are syntaxin and SNAP-25(5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar).Formation of SNARE complexes, and in particular of the synaptic SNARE complex, must be highly regulated. The presence of the same v-SNAREs on different types of secretory organelles, and of t-SNAREs all along the plasmalemma of neurons, clearly indicates that SNAREs are not themselves responsible for the spatiotemporal regulation of exocytosis (7.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar, 8.Chilcote T.J. Galli T. Mundigl O. Edelmann L. McPherson P.S. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 219-231Google Scholar, 9.Galli T. Garcia E.P. Mundigl O. Chilcote T.J. De Camilli P. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1351-1360Google Scholar). A variety of other factors which control formation and dissociation of the SNARE complex have already been identified (for review, see (10.Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Google Scholar)).Studies on purified SVs have demonstrated that at least a significant fraction of synaptobrevin is in a complex with synaptophysin, and that this complex is mutually exclusive with the interaction of synaptobrevin with syntaxin 1 and with SNAP-25 to form the SNARE complex(11.Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar, 12.Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Google Scholar, 13.Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Google Scholar). Thus, the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin interaction may have a regulatory role on SNARE complex formation(11.Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar, 12.Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Google Scholar, 13.Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Google Scholar). Conversely, the interaction of synaptophysin with synaptobrevin may be important for the biogenesis of a new SV at each exo-endocytic cycle, and this process may be coupled to dissociation of synaptobrevin from the t-SNAREs after exocytosis. Given the key role of synaptobrevin in vesicle docking, it is possible that the synaptobrevin-synaptophysin complex may in turn interact with other vesicle components to ensure their incorporation into the vesicular carrier. At present, only very little information is available on the protein-protein interactions in vesicle membranes which may be important for SV biogenesis(14.Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 761-775Google Scholar).In order to obtain new insights into the protein interactions established by synaptobrevin during the exo-endocytic cycle of SVs, we have studied proteins which are coprecipitated together with synaptobrevin 2 from a Triton X-100 extract of synaptosomes. We have found that the binding partners of synaptobrevin 2 are drastically different dependent upon whether fresh or frozen-thawed Triton X-100 extracts are used for the immunoprecipitations. The bulk of synaptobrevin 2 is associated with synaptophysin in fresh brain synaptosomal extracts and with t-SNAREs in frozen-thawed extracts, suggesting that freeze-thawing may mimic physiological steps leading to docking and fusion. In addition, a significant fraction of the c subunit and other subunits of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase are associated with synaptobrevin 2 in fresh extracts.RESULTSMonoclonal antibodies directed against synaptobrevin 2 (Cl 69.1) and control mice IgGs were used to immunoprecipitate synaptobrevin-associated proteins in Triton X-100 extracts of rat brain synaptosomes. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE run in either reducing or nonreducing conditions to allow visualization of bands hidden by the heavy and light chains of IgGs. In agreement with previous data, several known proteins were found to coimmunoprecipitate specifically with synaptobrevin 2 and not with control antibody as demonstrated by Fig. 1a. Surprisingly, however, the pattern of coprecipitating bands was completely different dependent on whether the Triton X-100 used as the starting material was fresh or frozen-thawed.As shown in the nonreduced gels of Fig. 1a, when freshly made Triton X-100 extract was used, synaptophysin (Fig. 1, a and b, see also Fig. 3) and a protein migrating at approximately 80 kDa were the major bands visible by protein staining in the immunoprecipitates. In addition, a 10-kDa protein (p10) and several other minor bands of higher molecular mass were visible. When frozen-thawed extract was used, the major proteins which coprecipitated with synaptobrevin 2 were SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1 (Fig. 1, a and b, and Fig. 3), in addition to a band of approximately 85 kDa. Less abundant bands of 16, 18, and 22 kDa (p16, p18, p22) were visible. Synaptophysin, p10, and the band of 80 kDa were virtually absent from the immunoprecipitate obtained from frozen-thawed extract (Fig. 1, a and b, and Fig. 3). By Western blotting, rbSec1 (26.Garcia E.P. Gatti E. Butler M. Burton J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2003-2007Google Scholar) was not detected in any of the immunoprecipitates while synaptotagmin 1 (6.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar, 27.Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Google Scholar) was detected in the immunoprecipitate formed from frozen-thawed extract (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Presence of subunits of the V0 sector of the ATPase in anti-synaptobrevin 2 immunoprecipitates (bead fractions) obtained from fresh, but not in those obtained from frozen-thawed, Triton X-100 extracts of synaptosomes. The figure shows Western blots for the proteins indicated of the starting extract (lane A), bead fraction obtained from fresh extract (lane B), and bead fraction obtained from frozen-thawed extract (lane C). The gel was run in nonreduced conditions. Equal amounts of protein from the two bead fractions were loaded in lanes B and C. Note the absence of the B subunit of the V-ATPase, which is part of the V1 sector, in both immunoprecipitates. Quantification of the autoradiograms showed the following recoveries relative to the recovery of synaptobrevin 2 in the immunoprecipitates from fresh extracts: 57% of synaptophysin, 56% of V-ATPase c subunit, 66% of Ac39, and 91% of Ac116.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The 80-kDa band, visible in the nonreduced immunoprecipitates formed from fresh extracts, was reactive for synaptophysin by Western blots and disappeared in reduced gels with a corresponding increase of the synaptophysin band (compare the two lanes A in Fig. 1b). Thus, the 80-kDa band represents a synaptophysin dimer in agreement with previous reports that synaptophysin can dimerize (28.Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8869-8873Google Scholar). The 85-kDa band visible in the nonreduced immunoprecipitates obtained from frozen-thawed extracts reacted with anti-syntaxin 1 antibodies by Western blotting and most likely represents the 7 S SNARE complex. It was shown previously that even in reducing conditions the 7 S synaptobrevin 2-SNAP-25-syntaxin 1 complex does not dissociate in SDS unless boiled for at least 5 min(29.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Google Scholar). The close proximity of the three SNAREs may facilitate the formation of disulfide bridges in nonreducing conditions. The migration of p10, p16, p18, and p22 was unaffected by the reducing or nonreducing conditions of SDS-PAGE. p10, p16, and p22 were investigated further.The bands corresponding to these proteins were excised and processed for microsequencing. Sequences of one peptide each derived from p16 and p22 perfectly matched the sequences of the rat myelin basic proteins of 14 and 19 kDa(30.de Ferra F. Engh H. Hudson L. Kamholz J. Puckett C. Molineaux S. Lazzarini R.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 721-727Google Scholar), respectively (not shown). The identity of p16 and p22 as myelin basic proteins was further confirmed by Western blotting (not shown). The association of myelin basic proteins with SNARE complexes had already been documented(6.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar). It must represent an in vitro artifact since myelin basic proteins and synaptic SNAREs are localized in different cell types(7.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar, 8.Chilcote T.J. Galli T. Mundigl O. Edelmann L. McPherson P.S. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 219-231Google Scholar).Sequences from two peptides of p10 matched the sequence of the c subunit of rat V-ATPase also called ductin (31.Finbow M.E. Eliopoulos E.E. Jackson P.J. Keen J.N. Meagher L. Thompson P. Jones P. Findlay J.B. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 7-15Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In agreement with this identification, Western blotting demonstrated that V-ATPase c and other transmembrane subunits of V-ATPase including Ac39 and Ac116 were present in anti-synaptobrevin 2 immunoprecipitates obtained from fresh Triton X-100 extract but not from frozen-thawed extract (Fig. 3). The c subunit of the V-ATPase precisely comigrated with p10. A cytosolic subunit of the catalytic domain of V-ATPase, the B subunit, was absent from the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3). Thus, our data suggest the existence of a Triton X-100-resistant complex between synaptobrevin 2, synaptophysin, and the V0 sector of the V-ATPase which does not include the cytosolic V1 sector of V-ATPase. Quantification of the autoradiograms showed that 57% of the total synaptophysin and 56% of the total c subunit of V-ATPase are associated with synaptobrevin 2 in fresh Triton X-100 extract. Furthermore, the two other subunits of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase, Ac39 and Ac116, were enriched in roughly similar proportion as the c subunit (see legend of Fig. 3). The putative stoichiometric ratio of the c, Ac39, Ac116, and 19-kDa subunits in the V0 domain is 6:1:1:1(32.Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Google Scholar), thus explaining why the c domain is more easily detectable than other V-ATPase subunits in Coomassie Blue-stained gels of the immunoprecipitates. It was shown previously that the Ac39 subunit can bind in vitro to synaptophysin(33.Siebert A. Lottspeich F. Nelson N. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28329-28334Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the interaction between V-ATPase subunits and synaptobrevin 2 may be indirect and mediated by synaptophysin.Figure 2:p10 is ductin, the c subunit of V-ATPase. Amino acid sequence of two p10 peptides aligned with the sequence of ductin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We confirmed the specificity of the association between synaptobrevin 2, synaptophysin, and the V-ATPase by performing immunoprecipitation experiments using monoclonal antibodies against synaptophysin (Cl 7.2) and syntaxin 1 (HPC-1) (Fig. 4). In agreement with the data shown above and with previous studies, syntaxin 1 was not found in anti-synaptophysin immunoprecipitates and synaptophysin was not found in anti-syntaxin 1 immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, the V-ATPase c subunit was present together with synaptobrevin in anti-synaptophysin immunoprecipitates obtained from fresh, but not from frozen-thawed extracts, and was not found in any anti-syntaxin 1 immunoprecipitate. Therefore, the freeze-thawing treatment which induces dissociation of synaptobrevin 2 from synaptophysin and V-ATPase also induces dissociation of synaptophysin from V-ATPase. Note that the synaptophysin monomer is less abundant in anti-synaptophysin immunoprecipitates obtained from frozen-thawed extract (Fig. 4, left panel). A corresponding increase was observed in the synaptophysin dimer (not shown). Thus, the freeze-thawing procedure enhances dimer formation. Freeze-thawing must also induce a conformational change in syntaxin 1, because the recovery of syntaxin 1 (both monomer and SNARE complex) in anti-syntaxin 1 (antibody HPC1) immunoprecipitates was consistently greater when frozen-thawed extract was used.Figure 4:Western blots demonstrating the presence of the c subunit of V-ATPase in anti-synaptophysin (antibody Cl 7.2) immunoprecipitates from fresh (B) but not from frozen-thawed (C) Triton X-100 synaptosomal extracts. The c subunit is absent from anti-syntaxin 1 (antibody HPC-1) immunoprecipitates obtained from both extracts. Lanes A correspond to the starting material. The gel was run in nonreduced conditions. The greater recovery of syntaxin 1 in the bead fraction from frozen-thawed extracts was reproducible and due to the greater reactivity of syntaxin 1 with the HPC-1 antibody after freeze-thawing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The c subunit of the V-ATPase was found to be associated with synaptobrevin 2 and synaptophysin also in freshly prepared Triton X-100 extracts of PC12 cells.

J. Physiol. (Paris). 1993; 87: 171-178Google Scholar, 35.Floor E. Leventhal P.S. Wang Y. Meng L. Chen W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 689-699Google Scholar). An analysis of the localization of the c subunit of V-ATPase in mammalian brain, however, was not carried out previously. In fact, several functions have been hypothesized for this protein, beside a putative role as the key pore-forming protein in the V-ATPase (for review, see Finbow et al.(36.Finbow M.E. Harrison M. Jones P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 247-255Google Scholar)). We investigated, therefore, the intracellular localization of the c-subunit in rat brain.The subcellular fractionation profile of the c subunit of the V-ATPase was very similar to the subcellular fractionation profile of the SV proteins synaptophysin and synaptobrevin 2 and different from SNAP-25, which is present in SV fractions (37.Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Google Scholar) but is primarily enriched in the plasmalemma(7.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar). A similar coenrichment in SVs was observed for the Ac116 and B subunits of the V-ATPase. However, a small pool of the B subunit was also found in the cytosolic fraction of synaptosomes LS2, in agreement with previous findings(38.Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Google Scholar), suggesting a dynamic association-dissociation between the cytosolic and transmembrane portions of the V-ATPase (Fig. 6). These findings are not in contrast with the expected localization of the V-ATPase, and in particular of the c-subunit, in other membranes of brain including membranes of non-neuronal cells. They suggest, however, that the bulk of the brain V-ATPase in the brain is localized on SVs. Accordingly, immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections of rat brain stem with antibodies directed against the B subunit of the V-ATPase, demonstrated that V-ATPase immunoreactivity is concentrated in nerve terminals in a pattern which resemble synaptobrevin immunoreactivity (Fig. 7). Available antibodies directed against the c subunit and other ATPase subunits did not react in immunofluorescence experiments.Figure 6:The c subunit of V-ATPase copurifies with other proton pump subunits and SV markers during preparation of a purified SV fraction. Western blots of subcellular fractions for the proteins are indicated on the right. The fractions are as follows(18.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J.

Bar, 22 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that in brain the subunits comprised in the V0 sector of V-ATPase (subunit c, Ac39, and Ac116) (for review see Nelson(34.Nelson N. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1993; 87: 171-178Google Scholar)) are involved in a Triton X-100-resistant interaction with synaptophysin and synaptobrevin 2. The interactions among these components, which are likely to reflect a physiological association in SV membranes(35.Floor E. Leventhal P.S. Wang Y. Meng L. Chen W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 689-699Google Scholar), are highly sensitive to freeze-thawing of the Triton X-100 extract, indicating that they can be disrupted by a mild denaturing step. Freeze-thawing, in contrast, promotes a massive association of synaptobrevin 2 with t-SNAREs to form SNARE complexes. Freeze-thawing may induce a conformational change in synaptobrevin 2 which mimics a physiological change occurring in vivo and which is part of the events leading to exocytosis.The Ac39 and Ac116 subunits of V-ATPase had already been shown to be highly enriched in mammalian SVs (33.Siebert A. Lottspeich F. Nelson N. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28329-28334Google Scholar, 34.Nelson N. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1993; 87: 171-178Google Scholar, 39.Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Google Scholar) where the proton pump plays a crucial role in the uptake of neurotransmitters. However, the presence of the V-ATPase c subunit on mammalian SVs had never been demonstrated. This subunit, which is represented by a small polypeptide with 4 putative transmembrane regions, is thought to represent the hydrophilic channel thorough which protons are translocated (for review, see (36.Finbow M.E. Harrison M. Jones P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 247-255Google Scholar)). The demonstration of the localization of the c-subunit on SVs within the context of a V-ATPase is of significant interest because alternative functions and localizations have been proposed for this molecule. The c subunit is identical with the so-called mediatophore, a synaptic protein from the Torpedo electric organ which has been reported to form an acetylcholine-permeable transmembrane channel(40.Brochier G. Morel N. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 23: 525-539Google Scholar). The mediatophore was originally thought to be localized in the presynaptic plasmalemma and to be responsible for nonexocytotic, quantal release of acetylcholine, although more recent studies in the nervous system of Torpedo have suggested a predominant localization in SVs (41.Brochier G. Israel M. Lesbats B. Biol. Cell. 1993; 78: 145-154Google Scholar). The same proteins were also found to be identical with ductin, a putative subunit of gap junction channels(36.Finbow M.E. Harrison M. Jones P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 247-255Google Scholar). Based on findings suggesting that ductin can be present in membranes in two opposite orientations, it has been proposed that the orientation of ductin in the membrane specifies whether the proteins will be assembled into a V-ATPase or into a GAP junction(42.Dunlop M. Jones P.C. Finbow M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3609-3616Google Scholar). Our data indicate a colocalization of ductin with other subunits of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase in the antisynaptobrevin 2 or antisynaptophysin immunoprecipitates and favors therefore the model in which ductin is a subunit of the ATPase. However, additional roles for this protein cannot be excluded. A possible function of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase, independent from the V1 sector, has been discussed(36.Finbow M.E. Harrison M. Jones P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 247-255Google Scholar). Given its pore-forming properties(36.Finbow M.E. Harrison M. Jones P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 247-255Google Scholar), its unusual mechanism of membrane incorporation(42.Dunlop M. Jones P.C. Finbow M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3609-3616Google Scholar), and its link to synaptobrevin demonstrated here, a role of the c subunit/ductin in the membrane interactions which lead to fusion cannot be ruled out completely.In a previous study, a search for synaptophysin binding proteins in synaptic membrane had led to the identification of physophillin(43.Thomas L. Betz H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2041-2052Google Scholar). Physophillin was subsequently found to be identical with the Ac39 subunit of the V-ATPase(33.Siebert A. Lottspeich F. Nelson N. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28329-28334Google Scholar). A possible connection between the Ac39 subunit of the V-ATPase and synaptophysin was also suggested by a study on SV protein complexes formed in various detergents(14.Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 761-775Google Scholar). Our data could be explained by an indirect interaction of synaptobrevin with the V-ATPase mediated by synaptophysin. The association of the c subunit of the V-ATPase with a synaptophysin-containing complex is of special interest because this protein was shown to coassemble with connexin. Synaptophysin and connexins are structurally related(44.Thomas L. Hartung K. Langosch D. Rehm H. Bamberg E. Franke W.W. Betz H. Science. 1988; 242: 1050-1053Google Scholar).The association of the synaptobrevin 2-synaptophysin complex with the V-ATPase could be important in the biogenesis of SVs by ensuring inclusion of the proton pump into the vesicles. Since many other organelles of the secretory and endocytic pathway contain the V-ATPase, it will be of interest to determine whether an interaction between V-SNAREs and the proton pump is generally found on other organelles. Such an interaction would provide a simple mechanism to couple generation of a transport vesicle to inclusion of the pump in the carrier.A striking observation made in our study is that a cycle of freeze-thawing has a drastic effect on the V-ATPase-synaptophysin-synaptobrevin 2 complex and on SNARE complex formation. Most likely, the effect of freeze-thawing can be explained by the transient increase in the ionic strength which occurs during freezing, when the growth of ice crystal displaces solutes in the residual liquid phase. This result may explain the variable recovery of SNARE complexes observed in published studies. We note that the first evidence for the interaction of synaptobrevin 2 with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 came from studies performed with frozen-thawed bovine brain Triton X-100 extract(6.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar). The abundance of synaptobrevin-syntaxin 1-SNAP-25-SNARE complexes observed in many published studies cannot reflect endogenous complexes because only minor pools of these SNAREs are colocalized in the cell (the v-/t-SNARE complexes of docked vesicles)(7.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar). NSF and its yeast homologue Sec18 have the structure of molecular chaperones(45.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 335-339Google Scholar). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that even the massive presence of Golgi SNARE complexes observed in extracts of Sec18 yeast mutants exposed to the restrictive temperature, may reflect a postlysis phenomenon due to abnormal folding states of the SNAREs (46.S⊘gaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Google Scholar).Our data favor a model in which the bulk of brain synaptobrevin is localized on SVs in a complex with synaptophysin and in which the V0 sector of the V-ATPase is associated with this complex. Since the presence of synaptobrevin in the complex is not compatible with its interaction with the t-SNAREs ((11) and this study) and since the bulk of t-SNAREs is localized on the plasmalemma(7.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar, 9.Galli T. Garcia E.P. Mundigl O. Chilcote T.J. De Camilli P. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1351-1360Google Scholar), dissociation of this complex must precede fusion. Freeze-thawing may promote a conformational change which bypasses the need for the physiological regulators which catalyze this transition in situ. Since NSF and α-SNAP do not bind the v-SNARE(47.McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2213-2217Google Scholar, 48.Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that NSF and α-SNAP could have such an activity. Identifying such factors is an important priority for future work. NSF, which is required for the dissociation of the SNARE complex (5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar, 6.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar) may help in regenerating a synaptobrevin conformation (45.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 335-339Google Scholar) compatible with the interaction with synaptophysin and the V0-ATPase.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 2.Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Google Scholar, 3.Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Google Scholar, 4.De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 3-12Google Scholar). Studies carried out on SVs have converged with studies on neurotoxins, genetic studies in yeast, and cell-free studies of vesicular transport, and allowed to formulate a fist hypothetical model of docking and fusion(5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). The model predicts that small proteins located at the cytosolic surface of the vesicular carrier, v-SNAREs, interact with small proteins located at the cytosolic surface of the target membrane, t-SNAREs, to a form the so-called SNARE complex, and that this interaction is one of the key steps leading to fusion(5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar, 6.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar). In the case of SVs, v-SNAREs are the synaptobrevins and t-SNAREs are syntaxin and SNAP-25(5.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar).Formation of SNARE complexes, and in particular of the synaptic SNARE complex, must be highly regulated. The presence of the same v-SNAREs on different types of secretory organelles, and of t-SNAREs all along the plasmalemma of neurons, clearly indicates that SNAREs are not themselves responsible for the spatiotemporal regulation of exocytosis (7.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar, 8.Chilcote T.J. Galli T. Mundigl O. Edelmann L. McPherson P.S. Takei K. De Camilli P. J.

A variety of other factors which control formation and dissociation of the SNARE complex have already been identified (for review, see (10.Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Google Scholar)).Studies on purified SVs have demonstrated that at least a significant fraction of synaptobrevin is in a complex with synaptophysin, and that this complex is mutually exclusive with the interaction of synaptobrevin with syntaxin 1 and with SNAP-25 to form the SNARE complex(11.Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar, 12.Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Google Scholar, 13.Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Google Scholar). Thus, the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin interaction may have a regulatory role on SNARE complex formation(11.Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar, 12.Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Google Scholar, 13.Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Google Scholar). Conversely, the interaction of synaptophysin with synaptobrevin may be important for the biogenesis of a new SV at each exo-endocytic cycle, and this process may be coupled to dissociation of synaptobrevin from the t-SNAREs after exocytosis. Given the key role of synaptobrevin in vesicle docking, it is possible that the synaptobrevin-synaptophysin complex may in turn interact with other vesicle components to ensure their incorporation into the vesicular carrier. At present, only very little information is available on the protein-protein interactions in vesicle membranes which may be important for SV biogenesis(14.Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 761-775Google Scholar).In order to obtain new insights into the protein interactions established by synaptobrevin during the exo-endocytic cycle of SVs, we have studied proteins which are coprecipitated together with synaptobrevin 2 from a Triton X-100 extract of synaptosomes. We have found that the binding partners of synaptobrevin 2 are drastically different dependent upon whether fresh or frozen-thawed Triton X-100 extracts are used for the immunoprecipitations. The bulk of synaptobrevin 2 is associated with synaptophysin in fresh brain synaptosomal extracts and with t-SNAREs in frozen-thawed extracts, suggesting that freeze-thawing may mimic physiological steps leading to docking and fusion. In addition, a significant fraction of the c subunit and other subunits of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase are associated with synaptobrevin 2 in fresh extracts."

Binding to HB-GAM and inhibition of neurite outgrowth was observed with heparin-related polysaccharides only; galactosaminoglycans were inactive. Significant inhibition of neurite outgrowth was induced by heparin and by N-syndecan heparan sulfate but not by heparan sulfates from other sources. A minimum of 10 monosaccharide residues were required for HB-GAM binding, as well as for inhibition of HB-GAM-induced neurite outgrowth.

https://openalex.org/W1596717338,"Lemon fruit vacuoles acidify their lumens to pH 2.5, 3 pH units lower than typical plant vacuoles. To study the mechanism of hyperacidification, the kinetics of ATP-driven proton pumping by tonoplast vesicles from lemon fruits and epicotyls were compared. Fruit vacuolar membranes were less permeable to protons than epicotyl membranes. H+ pumping by epicotyl membranes was chloride-dependent, stimulated by sulfate, and inhibited by the classical vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors nitrate, bafilomycin, N-ethylmaleimide, and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In addition, the epicotyl H+ pumping activity was inactivated by oxidation at room temperature, and oxidation was reversed by dithiothreitol. Cold inactivation of the epicotyl V-ATPase by nitrate (≙100 mM) was correlated with the release of V1 complexes from the membrane. In contrast, H+ pumping by the fruit tonoplast-enriched membranes was chloride-independent, largely insensitive to the V-ATPase inhibitors, and resistant to oxidation. Unlike the epicotyl H+-ATPase, the fruit H+-ATPase activity was partially inhibited by 200 μM vanadate. Cold inactivation treatment failed to inhibit H+ pumping activity of the fruit membranes, even though immunoblots showed that V1 complexes were released from the membrane. However, cold inactivation doubled the percent inhibition by 200 μM vanadate from 30% to 60%. These results suggest the presence of two H+-ATPases in the fruit preparation: a V-ATPase and an unidentified vanadate-sensitive H+-ATPase. Attempts to separate the two activities in their native membranes on linear sucrose density gradients were unsuccessful. However, following detergent-solubilization and centrifugation on a glycerol density gradient, the two ATPase activities were resolved: a nitrate-sensitive V-type ATPase that is also partially inhibited by 200 μM vanadate, and an apparently novel vanadate-sensitive ATPase that is also partially inhibited by nitrate.

Eukaryotic cells contain a variety of acidic intracellular compartments, including coated vesicles, secretory vesicles, Golgi bodies, endosomes, lysosomes, and vacuoles, which have in common that their membrane transport processes are energized by the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPasevacuolar H+-ATPaseBTP1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneDCCDN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimideDTTdithiothreitolHBhomogenization bufferH+-PPaseH+-pyrophosphataseMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidnH+/ATP stoichiometryNEMN-ethylmaleimideNPMN-phenylmaleimidePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRBresuspension bufferΔψmembrane potentialPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

In addition to the V-ATPase, plant vacuolar membranes contain an H+-pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase), although in most tissues the V-ATPase is the dominant pump(4.Rea P.A. Sanders D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 71: 131-141Google Scholar, 5.Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol.

In animal cells, different compartments of the endocytotic pathway have characteristic lumenal pHs, ranging from pH 6.5 in the coated vesicles to pH 5.0 in the lysosomes, suggesting that the lumenal pH of each organelle is tightly regulated(6.Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Google Scholar). A number of observations suggest that the pH of plant vacuoles is also regulated. In plants with crassulacean acid metabolism for example, the vacuolar pH of the leaves varies diurnally, from pH 3 at night to pH 6 in the day(7.Lüttge U. New Phytol. 1987; 106: 593-629Google Scholar). In stomatal guard cells, the vacuolar pH is 4.5 in the dark when the stomata are closed, and 6 in the light when the stomata are open(8.Meidner H. Mansfield T.A. The Physiology of Stomata. McGraw-Hill, New York1968: 138-141Google Scholar). During fruit development the vacuolar pH often changes, becoming either more or less acidic as ripening progresses. Such fluctuations indicate that the vacuolar pH is under metabolic and developmental control. However, even in the case of vacuoles with a constant pH the V-ATPase may be continually regulated, inasmuch as the typical steady state ΔpH across the tonoplast appears to be considerably less than the theoretical maximum. From the H+/ATP stoichiometry of the pump (n), the membrane potential (Δψ), the Faraday constant (F), and the ΔGATP, the maximum ΔpH at equilibrium can be calculated according to the equation: 1n△ATP≥F△ψ−2.303RT△pH(Eq. 1) Bennett and Spanswick (9.Bennett A.B. Spanswick R.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 545-548Google Scholar) determined an H+/ATP stoichiometry of 2 for the plant V-ATPase, which was confirmed by Guern et al.(10.Guern J. Matthieu Y. Kurkdjian A. Manigault P. Gillet B. Beloeil J.-C. Lallemand J.Y. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 27-36Google Scholar). Schmidt and Briskin (11.Schmidt A.L. Briskin D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 165-173Google Scholar) extended these studies to the H+-PPase and included estimates of internal buffering capacity. They confirmed an n value of 2 for the V-ATPase and calculated a maximum possible ΔpH across the tonoplast of 5.0-5.4 units when the membrane potential is +20 mV. The authors concluded that the V-ATPase normally functions far from equilibrium and is regulated by factors other than energy supply. Mechanisms that have been proposed to regulate the V-ATPase include “slip”(12.Moriyama Y. Nelson N. Stein W.D. The Ion Pumps: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 387-394Google Scholar), cytosolic activators or inhibitors(13.Zhang K. Wang Z.-Q. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9701-9705Google Scholar, 14.Zhang K. Wang Z.-Q. Gluck S.

As yet, none of these mechanisms has been shown to correlate with in vivo proton gradients. In lemon fruit juice sacs, the vacuolar pH declines from 6.5 to as low as 2.2 during maturation(20.Sinclair W.B. The Biochemistry and Physiology of the Lemon and Other Citrus Fruits. University of California, Oakland, CA1984: 79-156Google Scholar). Assuming a cytosolic pH of ∼7.2, the final pH corresponds to a ΔpH of ∼5 units. Thus, the fruit V-ATPase either operates near thermodynamic equilibrium, or, alternatively, the pump H+/ATP stoichiometry is <2. If the V-ATPase operates near thermodynamic equilibrium, it follows that the regulatory mechanisms that normally prevent the V-ATPase from reaching equilibrium are absent or deficient in the fruit juice sac cells. On the other hand, if the proton pump responsible for hyperacidification has an n < 2, it could be either a V-ATPase with variable H+/ATP stoichiometry (17.Davies J.M. Hunt I. Sanders D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8547-8551Google Scholar) or a novel type of tonoplast H+-ATPase with an n = 1. Here we report that the H+ pumping activity of juice sac tonoplast-enriched membrane vesicles is relatively insensitive to a variety of V-ATPase inhibitors and is inhibited ∼30% by 200 μM vanadate. Centrifugation of the detergent-solubilized fruit membranes on linear glycerol gradients resulted in the separation of two peaks of ATPase activities: a nitrate-sensitive V-ATPase that is partially inhibited by 200 μM vanadate, and an apparently novel vanadate-sensitive ATPase that is partially inhibited by high nitrate concentrations. The possibility that these two proton pumps may interact with each other during vacuolar hyperacidification is discussed. Lemon seeds (Citrus limon var.

Tonoplast-enriched membrane vesicles were prepared from lemon fruit juice sacs as follows. Three lemons were peeled, and their segments were carefully separated. The surrounding endocarp tissue was slit longitudinally along the narrow edge of each segment using a single-edged razor blade, and the juice sacs were released into 100 ml of cold homogenization buffer (HB; 1.5 M MOPS-KOH, pH 8.5, 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 0.75% bovine serum albumin, 7.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C and the membranes were maintained on ice. The juice sacs were ground using a mortar and pestle and filtered through a 0.28-mm nylon mesh. Cellular debris, nuclei and plastids were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min in a Sorvall RC2-B refrigerated centrifuge (SS-34 rotor). The supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW-28 rotor at 132,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of resuspension buffer (RB; 10 mM BTP-Mes, pH 7.6, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF). The microsomal fraction was further purified on a 10%/35% sucrose step gradient made up in gradient buffer (10 mM BTP-Mes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF). After 60 min of centrifugation at 132,000 × g in a Beckman SW-28.1 rotor, the 10%/35% interface containing tonoplast-enriched membranes was recovered, diluted with two volumes of RB, and pelleted at 174,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor. The tonoplast-enriched membranes were resuspended in RB at a final concentration of 10 μg of membrane protein/μl. Unless otherwise stated, when membranes were prepared for experiments involving oxidation or inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or N-phenylmaleimide (NPM), they were resuspended in RB in the absence of DTT. Lemon seeds were germinated and grown for 4 weeks at 29°C, in the dark, in flats containing moist vermiculite. Epicotyls (40 g fresh weight) were harvested with a razor blade and homogenized in 150 ml of cold HB using a mortar and pestle. All other steps were as described in the fruit membrane preparation. L-α-Phosphatidylcholine type IV-S (Sigma) was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in a total volume of 10 ml of diethyl ether, evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, lyophilized, resuspended in 10 ml of water, and sonicated to clarity with a Braun-Sonic U probe sonicator. Membranes were made up to 6 mg of protein/ml with RB. One volume of 4% (w/w) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside in solubilization buffer (10 mM BTP/Mes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM DTT, 200 μg/ml sonicated liposomes, and 0.012% butylated hydroxytoluene) was added drop by drop to the membranes while stirring on ice. The mixture was further incubated 30 min on ice with gentle stirring before being used in ATP hydrolysis experiments or further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Solubilized membrane proteins (3.5 mg) were centrifuged for 15 min at 412,000 × g (4°C) in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filter and loaded on a linear 15-30% glycerol gradient in 10 mM BTP-Mes, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM MgSO4, 10 mM KCl, 50 μg/ml sonicated liposomes, and 20 mM DTT. After centrifugation for 16 h at 177,000 × g (4°C) in a Beckman SW-41 rotor, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for ATPase activity in the presence or absence of nitrate and vanadate. Membranes were made up to 0.3 mg of protein/ml in 2.5 ml of RB containing 5 mM ATP, 7 mM MgSO4, and 0, 20, 100, 200, or 500 mM KNO3 or KI. They were incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged 15 min at 412,000 × g (Beckman TLA-100.3). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of RB and used for proton pumping and immunoblotting. The proteins in 50 μl of the resuspended pellet, and 167 μl of the supernatant were used for immunoblotting after being precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with cold acetone, lyophilized, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proton pumping by tonoplast vesicles was monitored by the quenching of quinacrine fluorescence as described previously(21.Chanson A. Taiz L. Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 232-240Google Scholar). The reaction mix contained 10 mM BTP-Mes, pH 7.0, 250 mM sorbitol, 100 mM KCl, 50 μM vanadate, 1 mM azide, 250 nM valinomycin, 2.5 mM ATP, and 10 μM quinacrine unless otherwise stated. 100 μg of membrane proteins were typically used and the reaction was usually started with 3.5 mM MgSO4. In kinetic experiments, ionic interactions were taken into account by means of the SOLCON computer program (generously provided by D. C. S. White, University of York, York, United Kingdom, and Y. E. Goldman, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) using logarithmic association constants of all metal-ligand complexes present in the assay mix(22.Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1977-1989Google Scholar). Proton pumping was initiated with MgSO4 at the concentration indicated to provide the required concentration of MgATP. Typically, the concentration of MgSO4 had to be present at approximately 2 mM in excess of the sum of the concentrations of ATP and ADP present in the assay mix. Fluorescence quenching (423 nm excitation, 502 nm emission) was measured in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Proton pumping activity was expressed as % quench•mg-1•min-1. Native or solubilized membranes were added to a reaction mix containing 2.5 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgSO4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM azide, 1 mM molybdate, 2 μM gramicidin D, and 1 mg/ml sonicated liposomes in 25 mM BTP/Mes buffer, pH 7.0. The total reaction volume was 300 μl. After 30 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding one volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 4% perchloric acid (ice-cold) to the reaction mix. The mixture was maintained on ice for 5 min, centrifuged 4 min at 14,000 × g (4°C) in a Tomy MTX-150 microcentrifuge, and the supernatant assayed for released inorganic phosphate by the Fiske and Subbarow reaction(23.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). Boiled membranes were used for background estimates. Where nitrate-sensitive activity is reported, 200 μM vanadate were present in the reaction mix and the results are expressed as the difference in activity in the presence or absence of 200 mM KNO3. Where vanadate sensitive activity is reported, 200 mM KNO3 were present in the mix and the results show the difference in activity in the presence or absence of 200 μM vanadate. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE of tonoplast enriched membranes was performed as described by Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins from SDS gels were electrotransferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (35 V, 200-300 mA, overnight; or 100 V, 250-350 mA for 1 h) in a Transphor TE 50 transfer cell (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) or in a Mini Trans-Blot® electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked with 3% nonfat instant milk in TPBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 0.05% Tween® 20, and 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.5, with NaH2PO4) for 1 h before being incubated for 7 h in TPBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and the primary antibody to the 70-kDa subunit of the corn V-ATPase(25.Mandala S. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12850-12855Google Scholar). The blots were then washed in TPBS and visualized by a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody reaction (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Preimmune serum and antiserum raised against the 70-kDa subunit of the corn V-ATPase were purified on a Protein A-Sepharose column according to Sambrook et al.(26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sera were made up to 2.25 μg of protein/μl in 100 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, before use in proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis experiments. Estimates of protein concentrations were done routinely by a modified BCA protein assay after trichloroacetic acid precipitation(27.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.L. Goeke B.J. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times in duplicates. Proton pumping results are given as the means (± range) of the duplicates of one representative experiment. For ATP hydrolysis experiments, the mean (± S.D.) of two independent experiments are presented. Km and VMAX values were calculated from Hanes-Woolf plots. The proton pumping activities of the tonoplast-enriched membrane fraction from epicotyls and mature fruits were compared by quinacrine fluorescence quenching. When the fruit membranes were diluted to give the same initial rate of H+ pumping as the epicotyl vesicles, they developed a greater pH gradient (total quench) than the epicotyl membranes (Fig. 1). When the gradient had stabilized, 10 mM EDTA was added to stop the reaction by chelating Mg2+. In the absence of MgATP, the fruit membranes maintained 80% of the pH gradient for up to 2 h after an initial leakage, whereas the pH gradient across the epicotyl tonoplast collapsed within 20 min. Addition of gramicidin at the end of the reaction confirmed that a pH gradient was still present across the fruit vesicle membranes. We conclude that the juice sac tonoplast is less permeable to protons than the epicotyl tonoplast. As shown in Fig. 2A, the H+ pumping activity of the epicotyl V-ATPase was almost completely dependent on chloride. Because the reaction was started by adding membranes loaded with 20 mM KCl, and valinomycin was present in the assay mix, chloride stimulation of H+ pumping is probably due to direct activation of the enzyme rather than to the ability of chloride to collapse the membrane potential. Similar results were obtained in the presence of valinomycin and 50 mM potassium iminodiacetate in the assay mix (data not shown). In this latter case, the membrane were allowed to equilibrate for 20-30 min in the reaction mix containing 50 mM potassium iminodiacetate and the proton-pumping reaction was started with Mg2+. Because K+ and valinomycin were present in the mix, the buildup of a positive Δψ should again have been prevented. In contrast to epicotyl membranes, juice sac vesicles did not require chloride for proton transport (Fig. 2A). When ATPase activity was measured under similar conditions, the epicotyl membranes exhibited only a 15% chloride stimulation (Fig. 2B). If only the nitrate-sensitive activity is considered, the percent chloride stimulation increases to 30%. There remains a marked discrepancy between the chloride dependence of proton pumping and ATPase activities in the epicotyl. In contrast, both the proton pumping and ATP hydrolytic activities of juice sacs were equally insensitive to chloride. Thus, the apparent uncoupling of H+-transport from ATP hydrolysis observed in the epicotyl V-ATPase in the absence of chloride, defined as “slip,” does not occur in the juice sac V-ATPase. As shown in Fig. 3, the pH optima for the fruit and the epicotyl V-ATPases were both ∼7.0. Table 1 gives the Km and VMAX values for the fruit and epicotyl membranes based on proton pumping activity. Whereas the Km values for MgATP of the fruit and epicotyl membranes were similar, the average VMAX of the fruit enzyme was about double that of the epicotyl.Tabled 1 The higher VMAX of the fruit V-ATPase could reflect a higher density of V-ATPases on the membrane. Immunoblots probed with antibodies to the 70-kDa subunit of the corn V-ATPase (25.Mandala S. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12850-12855Google Scholar) suggest that the fruit tonoplast vesicles actually contain less V-ATPase per milligram of protein than the epicotyl membranes (Fig. 4). This implies either a higher proportion of active enzyme on the juice sac tonoplast or a higher Kcat. Alternatively, the antibody may have a lower affinity for the fruit V-ATPase than for the epicotyl enzyme, which would imply that the fruit V-ATPase is a different isozyme. Both the fruit and the epicotyl V-ATPases were inhibited by ADP. Inhibition was largely competitive, although the sigmoidal nature of the curves at low [ATP]/[ADP] ratios suggested allosteric inhibition as well (data not shown). The average Ki values for ADP calculated from replots of the slopes of double-reciprocal plots were about 30 μM for both the fruit and epicotyl membranes. Whereas the epicotyl tonoplast proton pumping activity showed a typical inhibition by nitrate and bafilomycin A1, the juice sac tonoplast vesicles were remarkably insensitive to these inhibitors (Fig. 5A and Fig. 6). Measurements of ATP hydrolytic activity also indicated that the fruit V-ATPase was less sensitive to nitrate than the epicotyl enzyme (Fig. 5B, dashed lines). Detergent solubilization increased the nitrate sensitivity of the fruit, and decreased that of the epicotyl, so that both activities were equally sensitive to nitrate at 200 mM (Fig. 5B, solid lines).Figure 6:Inhibition of ATP-dependent H+ pumping by bafilomycin A1 in tonoplast-enriched vesicles from epicotyls and juice sacs. Bafilomycin A1 at the concentrations indicated and 10 μl of tonoplast-enriched membranes (100 μg of protein) were added to the reaction mix (composition as under “Experimental Procedures”). Each reaction was started with 3.5 mM MgSO4 and the initial rates of quinacrine fluorescence quenching are reported (•, epicotyl; ○, juice sac).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The proteolipid-binding inhibitor, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), inhibited both the juice sac and the epicotyl H+ pumping, although the inhibition was less pronounced in juice sac membranes than in epicotyl membranes (Fig. 7). The sensitivity of both enzymes to low concentrations of the sulfhydryl reagent, NEM, is shown in Fig. 8. The epicotyl V-ATPase was highly sensitive to NEM, with 94% of its activity being inhibited by 50 μM NEM, whereas the fruit enzyme was almost unaffected at this concentration. The more hydrophobic sulfhydryl reagent, NPM, was more effective than NEM in inhibiting proton pumping by the fruit V-ATPase (Fig. 8).Figure 8:Inhibition of ATP-dependent H+ pumping by NEM and NPM in tonoplast-enriched vesicles from epicotyls and juice sacs. 100 μg membrane proteins and NEM or NPM at the concentrations indicated were added to a reaction mix (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each reaction was started with 3.5 mM MgSO4, and the initial rates of fluorescence quenching were measured (-•-, epicotyl, NEM; -○-, juice sac, NEM; - -○- -, juice sac, NPM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Azide (1 mM) and vanadate (50 μM) were routinely included in the reaction mix to suppress residual plasma membrane ATPase and mitochondrial ATPase activities, respectively. As shown by the dose-response curves in Fig. 9, these two contaminants would represent no more than ∼10% of the total activity in the fruit membranes under standard assay conditions. Moreover, the membrane-bound vanadate-sensitive activity could not be separated from the nitrate-sensitive activity by linear sucrose or dextran gradients (data not shown), suggesting that the nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive activities are on the same membrane. When fruit and epicotyl membranes were treated with polyclonal antibody to the catalytic subunit of the corn V-ATPase, the proton pumping activity of the epicotyl was inhibited by up to 80%, whereas the fruit membranes were inhibited by only 25% (Fig. 10A). However, following solubilization, the nitrate-sensitive ATPase activities of the fruit and epicotyl were equally inhibited by the 70-kDa antibody (Fig. 10B). The sensitivities of the fruit and epicotyl V-ATPases to DTT-reversible oxidation was examined by measuring the decay of proton pumping activity over time at 20°C, and the restoration of activity by 50 mM DTT. The membranes were resuspended either in RB containing 1 mM DTT (Fig. 11A), or RB without DTT (Fig. 11, B and C). As shown in Fig. 11(A-C), the epicotyl V-ATPase was almost completely inhibited after a 4-h incubation in the presence or absence of 1 mM DTT. In contrast, the activity of the fruit V-ATPase was stable over the same time period in the presence of 1 mM DTT and was only slowly inactivated in the absence of DTT. Incubation of the epicotyl membranes in the presence of 50 mM DTT or 5 mM ATP over the same time period completely protected the epicotyl V-ATPase from inactivation (Fig. 11, A and C). Addition of 50 mM DTT to the oxidized epicotyl preparation restored proton transport activity to >60% of the activity at time 0. When epicotyl membranes were incubated on ice, inactivation was greatly reduced, and was completely reversible with DTT, demonstrating that the oxidation was temperature-dependent. In contrast, the slow loss of activity of the fruit V-ATPase that occurred in the absence of DTT was temperature-independent and could not be reversed by DTT (Fig. 11B). In addition, ATP did not protect against inactivation of the juice sac V-ATPase (Fig. 11C). To determine whether the greater oxygen sensitivity of the epicotyl membranes was due to the release of a soluble oxidant, a 1:1 mixture (μg protein) of fruit and epicotyl membranes was incubated at 20°C and the inactivation kinetics measured. The oxidation curve of the mixture corresponded to the average curve of the two membrane fractions measured separately (data not shown). If a soluble oxidant were involved, the loss of activity would have been additive. To further characterize the oxidative inactivation of the epicotyl V-ATPase, the ability of agents other than ATP to protect the enzyme was examined. As shown in Table 2, a variety of chelators failed to protect against oxidation, arguing against a role for metals as cofactors in an enzymatic oxidation process. Catalysis is not required for protection, since ADP was shown to be as effective as ATP in protecting the enzyme. Surprisingly, 100 mM sulfate not only protected the enzyme against inactivation, it also caused a doubling of the original activity. The effects of sulfate and nucleotides were not additive (Table 2). Other anions also protected against oxidation to varying degrees, including chloride and nitrate. The ability of nitrate to protect against oxidation is surprising inasmuch as nitrate is a potent inhibitor of catalysis. The combination of nitrate plus ATP or MgATP was less effective than nitrate alone in protecting against oxidation. Nevertheless, it clearly protected relative to the control.Ta"

The mechanistic role of the MPRs, i.e. the cargo molecules, in coat assembly is at present unclear. Using a GTP-dependent, brefeldin A-sensitive in vitro AP-1 binding assay, we have determined here the parameters of the AP-1 binding reaction. We demonstrate that, in addition of ARF-1, the MPRs contribute to create high affinity AP-1 binding sites (Kd≈ 25 nM), since their number correlates the number of MPR molecules expressed in MPR-negative cells. The quantitative electron microscopy shows that these high affinity binding sites are present on trans-Golgi network membranes, as expected, and to some extent on early endosomes. The high affinity binding sites are lost when the MPRs or ARF-1 become rate-limiting components. Conversely, GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), which increases the amount of membrane-bound ARF-1, mostly uncovers low affinity AP-1 binding sites (Kd≈ 150 nM) on trans-Golgi network membranes, normally not detected in its absence.

https://openalex.org/W2059356483,"Erythrocyte was found lacking in reactivity to lipid-free apolipoproteins to generate pre-β-high density lipoprotein (HDL) with the cellular lipid and, therefore, was used to study cellular cholesterol efflux to plasma lipoproteins exclusively by a nonspecific exchange mechanism. Over the range of hematocrit from 1-20% (cellular cholesterol pool of 2.5 μg to 50 μg per 250 μl), the fractional rate of cellular cholesterol efflux to lipoprotein was constant, and, therefore, absolute efflux rate was a linear function of the hematocrit of this range. In the absence of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), the cholesterol influx rate from lipoproteins was equal to the efflux rate from erythrocyte resulting in no net transfer of cholesterol, with either HDL or low density lipoprotein. In the presence of LCAT in the mixture of HDL and erythrocyte, cholesterol was esterified exclusively in HDL regardless of the origin. When the hematocrit was low and efflux of cellular cholesterol was slower than cholesterol esterification, the esterification of cell-originating cholesterol did not directly enhance the efflux. With high hematocrit that gives faster cholesterol efflux, the efflux was increased directly by the cholesterol esterification. On the other hand, the LCAT reaction significantly reduced HDL-cholesterol influx. The LCAT reaction thus induces substantial net cholesterol efflux from erythrocytes through a nonspecific cholesterol exchange mechanism.

It maintains the gradient of cholesterol content between cellular and lipoprotein surfaces by reducing free cholesterol in lipoprotein, which is thought to generate continuous flow of cholesterol from cell to lipoprotein (Glomset, 1968). LCAT is known to act mainly on high density lipoprotein (HDL) (Akanuma and Glomset, 1968), and this is one of the reasons why HDL is believed to have a unique function for the efflux of cellular cholesterol. lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein bovine serum albumin. Interestingly, experimental data to support this hypothesis has not been published so much as it is believed. The original work by Murphy (1962) demonstrated the net decrease of cholesterol in erythrocyte membrane by incubating the cells with plasma. Also, free cholesterol was shown to decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) as LCAT esterifies cholesterol in HDL (Akanuma and Glomset, 1968; Ko et al., 1994). However, many works using cultured cells failed to demonstrate direct enhancement of cellular cholesterol efflux by cholesterol esterification in HDL (Stein et al., 1978; Ray et al., 1980; Fielding and Fielding, 1981; Kilsdonk et al., 1993), while some of them showed the increase of net cellular cholesterol efflux by the LCAT reaction by reducing the influx of HDL cholesterol (Ray et al., 1980; Fielding and Fielding, 1981). Thus, a precise role of LCAT in the efflux of cellular cholesterol remains to be identified. This is related to the fact that a genetic defect of LCAT results in cholesterol accumulation only in a limited number of organs but not in general cholesterol deposit (Glomset et al., 1983). Cellular cholesterol efflux is mediated by two distinct mechanisms. One is nonspecific exchange of cholesterol between the cell and lipoprotein surface (Hara and Yokoyama, 1992; Li et al., 1993), and the other is the reaction of lipid-free helical apolipoproteins with cellular surface to result in unidirectional removal of the cellular lipids and to generate new pre-β-HDL particles with the cellular lipid (Hara and Yokoyama, 1991, 1992; Li et al., 1993). The cellular lipid efflux to HDL is likely to involve both mechanisms as HDL-apoproteins dissociate from the lipoprotein to interact with high affinity association sites of the cells (Li et al., 1993, 1995). We demonstrated the efficient esterification of cholesterol by LCAT in the pre-β-HDL newly generated with the cellular phospholipid and cholesterol of macrophages and fibroblasts by lipid-free apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, but it did not enhance net cellular cholesterol efflux any further (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995). Net cellular cholesterol efflux to HDL was increased by LCAT reaction only by decreasing the cholesterol influx from HDL to the cells while the efflux was not directly enhanced (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995), in agreement with the results previously demonstrated by a few other authors (Ray et al., 1980; Fielding and Fielding, 1981). In the work presented in this paper, we demonstrate that erythrocyte is lacking in the free apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux. This means that cholesterol efflux from erythrocyte is by a nonspecific bidirectional movement exclusively. Therefore, the erythrocyte is a good model by which to study the factors including LCAT reaction that may affect cellular cholesterol efflux through a nonspecific cholesterol exchange mechanism. In addition, erythrocyte membrane in fact undergoes pathological change as one of a few symptoms of genetic LCAT deficiency (Glomset et al., 1983). Hence, we have chosen this cell to examine a role of LCAT reaction in cellular cholesterol efflux purely by nonspecific cholesterol exchange. By using erythrocyte, the rate of cellular cholesterol efflux was easily modulated by changing the amount of the cells in the incubation mixture. When the cholesterol exchange rate was high, the LCAT reaction in HDL directly increased the efflux of cellular cholesterol toward HDL. When the exchange rate was low and the efflux rather than the esterification was a rate-limiting step, the increase of the net efflux was mainly by the decrease of the influx. LCAT was isolated from pig plasma as described elsewhere to 16,000-fold (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1993). The protein of the preparation migrated as a single band of molecular mass 67,000 kDa by silver staining in electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Specific activity (VMAX) of the preparation was 18 nmol/μg/h for cholesterol esterification in the cholesterol-labeled HDL (below). LDL and HDL were isolated from fresh human plasma as a fraction of density 1.006-1.063 g/ml and 1.063-1.21 g/ml, respectively, and the purity was verified by lipoprotein electrophoresis in 0.5% agarose gel and by the analysis of apolipoprotein composition in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. HDL was treated with 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide at room temperature for 2 h in order to inactivate endogenous LCAT. Lipid composition of the lipoprotein preparation was analyzed by enzymatic assay methods (Table 1). Lipoprotein-cholesterol was labeled with either [4-14C]cholesterol (Amersham, 53 mCi/mmol) or [7-3H]cholesterol (Amersham, 23.3 Ci/mmol) by incubating LDL or HDL with the radiolabeled cholesterol in a complex with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37°C for 3 h (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1993). ApoA-I was purified further from human HDL as described elsewhere by delipidation with ether:ethanol (3:2) and anion exchange chromatography with DEAE-cellulose (Yokoyama et al., 1982). The purity was verified in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS. Erythrocytes were obtained from normal fresh human blood taken in 0.1% EDTA, being separated from plasma by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4°C and washed with minimum essential medium containing 14 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, three times. The cellular lipid composition was determined after lipid was extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer(1959) (Table 1). The cells were labeled with either [7-3H]cholesterol or L-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Amersham, 60.0 Ci/mmol). The labeled lipid (17.1 nmol of cholesterol or 6.7 nmol of phosphatidylcholine) was dried in a glass tube with a nitrogen stream, redissolved in 60 μl of ethanol, and mixed with the washed erythrocytes in the solution of the washing buffer (24 ml, hematocrit 8.5%) containing 0.2% BSA for the incubation at room temperature for 24 h. The cells were then washed extensively with the same buffer. Specific radioactivity of each cellular lipid was determined. Erythrocytes were also obtained from a pig (approximately 100 kg) before and 1 week after bleeding of 1.0 liter. Reticulocytes were concentrated from the after-bleeding blood sample to the extent that 50-60% of the cells was the reticulocyte according to the method described previously (Kim et al., 1976) except for longer centrifugation at the final stage (3,500 rpm for 30 min). Both control erythrocytes from normal pig blood and the reticulocyte-enriched erythrocytes were used for the efflux experiments by the same method as employed for the human cells. The radiolabeled erythrocytes were incubated with various amounts of apoA-I or unlabeled HDL in the presence of 0.1% BSA with and without LCAT at 37°C in 250 μl, with continuous mixing. Hematocrit of the incubation mixture was chosen between 1 and 20% in order to provide various cellular cholesterol pool sizes. Activity of the LCAT in the mixture supernatant was 20% of that in the standard pooled human plasma, 10.8 nmol/ml/h (0.6 μg of LCAT/ml) unless specified otherwise. The incubation was terminated by placing the mixture in ice, and then erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation at 4°C. Lipids in the supernatant were extracted according to the previous method (Bligh and Dyer, 1959) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography for cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine. For measuring the influx of cholesterol from HDL to erythrocytes at the same time, the [4-14C]cholesterol-labeled HDL was incubated with the [7-3H]cholesterol-labeled erythrocytes in the absence and presence of LCAT, and the radioactivity of the lipid in the medium was determined by the same procedure. In the same experiment using the [4-14C]cholesterol-labeled HDL and the [7-3H]cholesterol-labeled erythrocyte, esterification of cholesterol on HDL was measured for each radioisotope by thin layer chromatography in order to determine the origin of cholesterol esterified by LCAT. The influx of free cholesterol from HDL or LDL was alternatively measured by using the lipoproteins labeled with [7-3H]cholesterol and unlabeled erythrocytes. Human erythrocyte was found lacking in the free apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux. Fig. 1 shows the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine from erythrocyte induced by human HDL and lipid-free apoA-I in the condition of 16% hematocrit. Unlike many other cells in culture, no lipid efflux was induced by lipid-free apoA-I from erythrocyte. Thus, cholesterol efflux from erythrocyte induced by HDL is mediated only by nonspecific cholesterol exchange between the surfaces of the cell and HDL, and this makes it possible to study cellular cholesterol efflux without influence of the free apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux. The same experiment with pig erythrocytes and reticulocytes also showed the specific lack of the free apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux (data not shown). When LCAT was present (0.6 μg) in the incubation mixture of HDL and [3H]cholesterol-labeled erythrocytes, the enzyme esterified cholesterol whether cell-originating or HDL-originating (Fig. 2A). This particular experimental condition included 16% hematocrit (cellular cholesterol pool 40.4 μg), 50 μg of HDL-phospholipid, and 14.0 μg HDL-free cholesterol in 250 μl. Apparent percent esterification in HDL of cell-originating cholesterol was lower than that of HDL-originating cholesterol in the early phase of the radiolabeled cholesterol efflux, presumably due to the influx of HDL-free cholesterol to the erythrocytes and to the time lag caused by mixing of exogenous and endogenous cholesterol in HDL. At the 6-h incubation, percent esterification of cellular cholesterol in HDL was a function of the LCAT concentration in the medium (Fig. 2B). There was no cholesterol esterification by LCAT directly on erythrocytes in any of these experimental conditions (data not shown). In the initial 1 h of the incubation of the same mixture with 16% hematocrit, the efflux and influx of radiolabeled cholesterol between HDL and erythrocyte were both linear, and the rates were nearly the same in the absence of LCAT (Fig. 3). The net efflux of cellular cholesterol was, therefore, almost negligible. Cholesterol esterification by LCAT (0.6 μg of LCAT in the mixture, 20% of the plasma LCAT activity in the medium) caused enhancement of cellular cholesterol efflux and reduction of HDL-cholesterol influx (Fig. 3). Thus, a substantial amount of net cholesterol efflux was generated by LCAT from erythrocytes to HDL. On the other hand, cholesterol was exchanged between erythrocytes and LDL (50 μg of phospholipid and 20.3 μg of free cholesterol) without causing net efflux. The rates were approximately the same as those with HDL in the absence of LCAT (Fig. 4). LCAT hardly esterified cholesterol in LDL causing no change of cholesterol flux (Fig. 4).Figure 4:The initial phase of the cholesterol efflux from erythrocytes to LDL. [3H]Cholesterol-labeled erythrocyte (16% hematocrit) was incubated with unlabeled LDL 20.3 μg of as free cholesterol (50 μg of phospholipid) at 37°C in the presence and absence of LCAT as 20% of its plasma activity (0.6 μg). The same experiment was done except for using [3H]cholesterol-labeled LDL and unlabeled erythrocyte to observe the influx of LDL-free cholesterol. Each data point represents an average of triplicate experimental points with an error bar for the standard error.

Squares and diamonds in C represent the influx of LDL-free cholesterol in the absence and presence of LCAT, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of LCAT reaction on cellular cholesterol efflux was also observed in long time incubation in the mixture of 16% hematocrit (cellular cholesterol pool 40.4 μg) and HDL-free cholesterol pool (1.7 μg). In the absence of LCAT, the cholesterol efflux was rapid and the radiolabeled cholesterol efflux reached nearly steady state equilibrium with back influx in a few hours (Fig. 5A). The influx of HDL cholesterol is reciprocal to the cellular cholesterol efflux reaching the steady state in the same time course (Fig. 5C). When LCAT was present (20% of the plasma activity), the cellular cholesterol efflux was prominently increased particularly in the late phase, and the increment was as much as the cholesterol esterified (Fig. 5B). The influx of HDL cholesterol was decreased by the LCAT reaction, again more markedly in the late phase (Fig. 5C). As a consequence, the net efflux of cellular cholesterol was negligible in the absence of LCAT and was induced substantially by the LCAT reaction (Fig. 6). These data are in contrast to the previous observation with the cells in culture that there was no increase of cellular cholesterol efflux but only a significant decrease of HDL-cholesterol influx by LCAT (Ray et al., 1980; Fielding and Fielding, 1981; Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995).Figure 6:Net cholesterol efflux from erythrocytes to HDL. The data were calculated from the experiment shown in Fig. 5, as the difference between the efflux and influx at each experimental point. Diamonds represent the data with LCAT, and squares represent the data without LCAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We hypothesized that rate of the cellular cholesterol efflux is a determining factor for the direct effect of LCAT on the efflux. To test this hypothesis, the efflux rate was manipulated by changing the hematocrit of the incubation mixtures having a constant amount of HDL (50 μg of phospholipid and 14.0 μg of free cholesterol), and the effect of the LCAT reaction on the efflux was examined in each condition. Fig. 7 represents the reactions with the hematocrit of 1%, 5%, and 15%, in the presence and absence of 0.6 μg of LCAT (20% of its activity in plasma). The rate of esterification of HDL-originating cholesterol was approximately 4.7 nmol/h in this experimental condition being estimated from the data in Fig. 2(percent esterification) and Fig. 3(influx of HDL-free cholesterol). With the lowest hematocrit of 1%, cellular free cholesterol was about 2.5 μg, and this was equivalent to that of many similar experiments using the cells in culture. In this condition, efflux rate of radiolabeled cholesterol was in the same order as the rate from the cells in culture. As shown in the top panels of Fig. 7, the labeled cholesterol in the medium almost linearly increased up to 24 h indicating that the efflux did not reach the steady state equilibrium with the back influx within this incubation time. There was no increase of the cholesterol efflux by cholesterol esterification by LCAT (the top right panel of Fig. 7). The rate of the labeled cholesterol efflux increased as the hematocrit increased. The efflux was reaching the steady state equilibrium with the back influx within the same time range (the middle and lower panels of Fig. 7). The cholesterol esterification in HDL induced significant increases of the efflux in this condition (the lower right panel). The increment of the efflux by LCAT reached the same extent as the amount of esterified cholesterol with the 15% hematocrit. Further analysis was attempted for the data with various cellular cholesterol pools including those shown in Fig. 8. The rate of the cellular cholesterol efflux was estimated from the initial rate of the radiolabeled cholesterol efflux from the erythrocytes (calculated as a least square linear regression of the efflux data for the initial 2 h). The top panel demonstrates that the rate of the cholesterol efflux from erythrocyte is almost directly proportional to the cellular cholesterol pool size in the incubation mixture, showing that the fractional efflux rate of cellular cholesterol (percent of the cellular cholesterol pool) was constant over the range of the experimental condition. The lower panel shows that such increases of the rate of the cholesterol efflux (the x axis) resulted in higher increases of the cholesterol efflux by cholesterol esterification in HDL (the y axis). When the hematocrit is above 15%, the rate of the cholesterol efflux (6.2 nmol/h) would be as high as the esterification rate (4.7 nmol/h) (estimated from the data in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:). The increment of the efflux by LCAT seemed to reach the same extent as that of cholesterol esterification in such a condition. Erythrocyte in peripheral blood, including reticulocyte, was shown to have no interaction with lipid-free helical apolipoproteins to generate pre-β-HDL with the cellular lipids. Therefore, cholesterol transfer between erythrocytes and plasma lipoproteins is exclusively by a nonspecific exchange mechanism. Cholesterol efflux rate from erythrocytes to HDL depended directly on the cellular cholesterol pool size. Without LCAT reaction, the efflux and influx rates between erythrocyte and HDL were the same, and no net flux was generated. Net cholesterol efflux was induced when LCAT esterified cholesterol in HDL. When the efflux (exchange) was slower than cholesterol esterification, a direct increase of the efflux by LCAT was not apparent, and the net cholesterol efflux was caused mainly by the reduction of cholesterol influx from HDL to the cells. When the cholesterol exchange was faster than the esterification, it directly caused the increase of cellular cholesterol efflux. Specific lack of the reactivity to lipid-free apolipoprotein in erythrocyte has provided additional evidence that apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux is an independent pathway of nonspecific cholesterol exchange. Erythrocytes seem to lose the interaction with helical apolipoproteins perhaps during the maturation in an earlier stage than reticulocyte, and, accordingly, it does not provide a direct lipid source for generation of new HDL in blood. By using erythrocytes, therefore, cellular cholesterol efflux can be studied without the influence of the apolipoprotein-cell interaction. It is also possible to make the cellular cholesterol pool in the experimental incubation mixture much larger than that of the cultured cells by more than an order of the magnitude. Accordingly, this system simulates a physiological condition in the bloodstream where HDL and erythrocyte interact directly in solution. Using cells in culture may not exactly mimic an in vivo microenvironment for the interaction of lipoprotein with the cells in tissues, in terms of the local density of cell membrane and its cholesterol pool size exposed to lipoproteins in the adjacent interstitial fluid. LCAT has been known to play a role in regulation of the net cholesterol efflux from erythrocyte. In his classical work, Murphy(1962) demonstrated the decrease of cholesterol in erythrocytes by incubating with plasma. It is also known that cholesterol accumulates in a limited number of organs in the patient with genetic or secondary LCAT deficiencies (Glomset et al., 1983; Simon and Scheig, 1970), and erythrocyte is one of the primary organs where such cholesterol accumulation takes place. These data implicate that lipid of erythrocyte membrane undergoes the direct influence of plasma lipoprotein metabolism as one of the major cholesterol reservoirs in blood (Mindham and 5es, 1991). The results of this study showed that HDL removes cholesterol from erythrocytes only in the presence of LCAT. When cholesterol is esterified in HDL, the influx of cholesterol from HDL to the cell is reduced as the free cholesterol in HDL decreases. However, the efflux is not increased directly by the LCAT reaction when its rate is slower than the esterification (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995). The off-rate of the cellular cholesterol efflux is presumably a rate-limiting step in such a condition so that additional room for free cholesterol in HDL created by the cholesterol esterification cannot immediately be filled with cell cholesterol due to the slow efflux. Thus, a condition such as 1% hematocrit is equivalent to most of the in vitro experiments using the cells in culture, with respect to the cellular cholesterol pool size and the rate of the cellular cholesterol efflux. The rate of cellular cholesterol efflux increased in proportion to the cellular cholesterol pool size, and the efflux of radiolabeled cellular cholesterol rapidly reached a steady state equilibrium with the back influx. In such a condition, esterification of cholesterol by LCAT in HDL has caused a direct increase of the appearance of cellular cholesterol in HDL as a consequence of this rapid exchange rate. Thus, LCAT regulates cellular cholesterol efflux through a nonspecific exchange mechanism. As it esterifies cholesterol in HDL, the rate of cholesterol influx from HDL to cells is reduced significantly. The LCAT reaction directly increases the efflux of cellular cholesterol when the rate of cholesterol exchange between HDL and the cells is faster than cholesterol esterification. Cholesterol accumulation varies over various organs in the patients with genetic or secondary defects of LCAT, resulting in a pathological change in a limited number of the organs (Glomset et al., 1983; Simon and Scheig, 1970). From the conclusion of this study, it can be speculated that the tissues lacking in a free apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid efflux pathway are more severely affected by LCAT deficiency because the LCAT-dependent nonspecific pathway is the only available mechanism to remove cholesterol from such tissues. Erythrocyte, and perhaps cornea as well, seems to be such a case since these cells may not synthesize the new protein required for the cells to interact with helical apolipoproteins. Other tissues are capable of shedding cholesterol via the apolipoprotein-mediated pathway even without the help of LCAT. It is also conceivable that the tissues having a slow rate of cholesterol exchange with HDL may be less affected by the deficiency of LCAT since the contribution to net cell cholesterol removal of the LCAT-mediated efflux is small. This paper demonstrated that LCAT actively regulates cholesterol content of erythrocytes in the bloodstream. The question is whether this conclusion can be extrapolated to other tissues where the exchange rate of cholesterol between the cells and HDL is yet to be determined. Recently, Francis et al.(1995) reported that fibroblasts from homozygous Tangier disease patients (genetic HDL deficiency) showed specific and complete defect of the apolipoprotein-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux pathway. Therefore, cholesterol removal from the peripheral tissues is carried out only by the LCAT-dependent nonspecific mechanism in these patients. Interestingly, cholesterol esterification in the plasma of these patients is not drastically reduced in spite of their extremely low plasma HDL level (Clifton-Bligh et al., 1972; Ohtaki et al., 1983), and the accumulation of cholesterol is limited only in certain organs related to the reticuloendothelial system (Schaefer et al., 1980). Therefore, the LCAT-mediated net cellular cholesterol removal seems active and efficient through nonspecific cholesterol exchange in the tissues of many organs. Thus, together with the finding in the LCAT deficiency, we conclude that the two distinct mechanisms to induce net cellular cholesterol efflux back each other up in most of the tissues. A role of HDL in net cellular cholesterol efflux thus seems to be dual. One is to carry helical apolipoproteins that dissociate from HDL and interact directly with cellular surface to remove the cellular lipid by generating new pre-β-HDL. LCAT does not play a significant role in this pathway (Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1995). The other role of HDL is to provide the site for LCAT reaction to induce the net cholesterol efflux by reducing the influx of cholesterol from HDL to the cells and by increasing the efflux of cellular cholesterol through nonspecific cholesterol exchange.

https://openalex.org/W2065620914,"The amino acid transporter AAP1/NAT2 recently cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and we used electrophysiological, radiotracer flux, and electron microscopic methods to characterize the biophysical properties, kinetics, and specificity of the transporter. Uptake of alanine was H+-dependent increasing from 14 pmol/oocyte/h at 0.032 μM H+ to 370 pmol/oocyte/h at 10 μM H+. AAP1 was electrogenic; there was an amino acid-induced depolarization of the oocyte plasma membrane and net inward currents through the transporter due to the transport of amino acids. AAP1 transported a wide spectrum of amino acids favoring neutral amino acids with short side chains. The maximal current (iMAX) for alanine, proline, glutamine, histidine, and glutamate was voltage- and [H+]o-dependent. Similarly, the iMAXH was voltage- and [amino acid]o-dependent. The iMAX for both H+ and amino acid were dependent on the concentrations of their respective cosubstrates, suggesting that both ligands bind randomly to the transporter. The K0.5 of the transporter for amino acids decreased as [H+]o increased and was lower at negative membrane potentials. The K0.5 for H+ was relatively voltage-independent and decreased as [amino acid]o increased. This positive cooperativity suggests that the transporter operates via a simultaneous mechanism. The Hill coefficients n for amino acids and H+ were >1, suggesting that the transporter has more than one binding site for both H+ and amino acid. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy was used to estimate the number of transporters expressed in the plasma membrane of oocytes.

In plants, amino acid transport is essential for the redistribution of nitrogen. Amino acids are transported within the phloem and xylem from their site of synthesis (roots and leaves) to organs that are net importers of nitrogen such as leaves, seeds, and tubers. Likewise, amino acids resulting from the degradation of storage proteins during germination are exported via the vascular system to supply the developing plant. Studies using whole tissues, individual cells, protoplasts, and isolated plasma membrane vesicles showed that amino acid transport in plants is mediated by specific membrane transport proteins that couple the electrochemical potential gradient of H+ to secondary active accumulation of amino acids (Reinhold and Kaplan, 1984; Bush and Langston-Unkefer, 1988; Li and Bush, 1990, 1991, 1992; Williams et al., 1990, 1992; Weston et al., 1994; Bush, 1993). In recent years, molecular biological techniques, whereby yeast amino acid transport mutants are complemented with higher plant cDNA libraries, have enabled the genes encoding amino acid transport proteins to be isolated (Frommer et al., 1993; Hsu et al., 1993; Kwart et al., 1993; Fischer et al., 1995). One amino acid transporter clone (AAP1) was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana by complementing a yeast mutant defective in proline uptake and was characterized as a general amino acid transporter (Frommer et al., 1993). Another clone, NAT2, was isolated from Arabidopsis by Hsu et al. (1993), which has >99% identity to AAP1. Both have a predicted molecular mass of 53 kDa, are highly hydrophobic, and contain 10-12 putative membrane-spanning regions. When expressed in yeast both transporters exhibited saturable, concentration-dependent amino acid transport and had a broad substrate specificity. Direct and detailed analysis of the transport properties of many cloned cotransporters has been achieved by their expression in Xenopus oocytes. These include the plant H+/hexose cotransporter (STP1) (Boorer et al., 1994), the plant K+/H+ cotransporter (HKT1) (Schachtman and Schroeder, 1994), and the mammalian Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) (Parent et al., 1992a, 1992b). In this study, we have expressed AAP1 and NAT2 in Xenopus oocytes and used electrophysiological, radiotracer flux, and morphometric methods to characterize their kinetics and substrate specificity. We show that AAP1 1AAP1 and NAT2 behave identically with respect to their transport kinetics and substrate specificity. Therefore, for simplicity and in view of the large size of the AAP gene family, they will be referred to as AAP1 throughout the text. has a broad substrate specificity and is electrogenic with membrane voltage influencing the apparent K0.5 for protons and amino acids and the maximal current generated by the transporter. Furthermore, a freeze-fracture analysis of AAP1 expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane allowed us to determine the turnover number of the transporter. The 3′-untranslated region of NAT2 lacks a poly(A) tail, and that of AAP1 has a poly(A) tail of only 16 nucleotides. We have found that a poly(A) tail of at least 30 nucleotides is necessary for the efficient expression of plant transport proteins in oocytes. Therefore, a poly(A) tail of 70 adenosines was introduced to the 3′-untranslated region of NAT2 and AAP1 as follows. A poly(A) tail of 70 adenosines was inserted between the HindIII and XhoI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Strategene) to yield pKJB1. The EcoRI fragments of NAT2 and AAP1 were inserted into the EcoRI site of pKJB1, and the length of the poly(A) tail was verified by sequencing the 3′-end of the construct using Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The resulting plasmids pKNAT2 and pKAAP1 were linearized with KpnI, and capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and an RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V or VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis were incubated in 5 mg/ml collagenase-B (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 22°C and defolliculated by incubation in 100 mM K2HPO4, 0.1 g/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h with gentle agitation. Oocytes were maintained at 18°C in Barth's medium containing (in mM) 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, pH 7.4, before and after injection of 50 ng (1 μg/μl) of cRNA. Xenopus oocytes possess endogenous amino acid transporters, which function either as facilitators or are driven by the electrochemical gradient for Na+ (Campa and Kilberg, 1989; Taylor et al., 1989). Although these activities are low, experiments were done in the absence of Na+ to avoid background activity due to endogenous Na+-dependent amino acid transporters. Radiotracer uptake experiments and electrophysiological recordings were done in transport buffer containing (in mM) 100 choline chloride, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 PIPES, 2The abbreviations used are: PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidHOMOPIPEShomopiperazine-N,N′-bis-2-(ethanesulfonic acid)P faceprotoplasmic face. and 10 HOMOPIPES. The [H+]o of the bathing medium was varied between 0.032 and 15.8 μM (pH 7.5 and 4.8) using Tris base.

Experiments were carried out 6-7 days after injection of 50 ng (1 ng/nl) of complementary RNA (cRNA) or 50 nl of water. Groups of 7-10 oocytes were equilibrated in 700 μl of transport buffer at 0.032, 0.32, 3.2, or 10 μM H+ (pH 7.5, 6.5, 5.5, or 5.0, respectively) for 10 min at 22°C. They were then transferred to 700 μl of transport buffer at 0.032, 0.32, 3.2, or 10 μM H+ containing 50 μML-[3H]alanine for 1 h at 22°C. Uptake was terminated by rinsing four times in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer. Individual oocytes were lysed in 5% SDS, 2 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and the amount of radioactivity per oocyte was determined. The 2-electrode voltage-clamp method was used to measure the kinetics of H+/amino acid cotransport as described previously (Loo et al., 1993; Boorer et al., 1994). Two protocols were used to measure inward currents. 1) The oocyte membrane potential was clamped at −50 mV, and currents induced in response to the addition of amino acids were continuously monitored by a chart recorder. 2) The oocyte plasma membrane was held at −50 mV, and membrane currents were measured after stepping from the holding potential (V) to test potentials (Vm) between −150 and +50 mV in 20-mV increments. Each voltage pulse was applied for 40 ms. The currents were averaged from five sweeps, filtered at 500 Hz, and digitized at 100 μs per point. Steady-state amino acid-induced currents were obtained by taking the difference between steady-state currents at 40 ms in the presence and absence of amino acid. Base-line currents recorded at 0.032 μM H+ (pH 7.5) in the absence of organic substrate were monitored throughout the experiments. Oocytes were equilibrated at the [H+]o of the test solution for about 2 min before exposure to amino acids. After every exposure, they were washed in amino acid-free solution at 0.032 μM H+ until the currents returned to base-line levels. For kinetic analysis, the amino acid-induced steady-state currents (i) at each test potential (Vm) were fitted to using ENZFITTER software (Elsevier-Biosoft): i=imaxS([S]on+(K0.5S)n)(Eq. 1) where So is the [amino acid]o or [H+]o, iMAXS is the maximal current for saturating So, K0.5S is the apparent K0.5 of the substrate (So giving half the iMAX), and n is the Hill coefficient. The substrate specificity of AAP1 was investigated by measuring steady-state substrate-dependent currents with 10 mM of various organic substrates at 10 μM H+. All substrate-induced currents were normalized with respect to the alanine-induced current obtained at −150 mV, which was taken as 100%. Electron microscopic methods are described in detail in Zampighi et al.(1995). After measurements of iMAXalanine, the oocytes were fixed in 3-3.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.5 for 1 h and infiltrated with 25% glycerol in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.5 for 1 h. Pieces of the oocyte were placed on Balzer specimen holders with the vitelline membrane facing upward, frozen in liquid propane, and fractured at between −150 and −120°C. The fractured surfaces were coated with platinum at an angle of 80° and carbon at an angle of 90°, coated with 0.5% collodion in amyl acetate, and organic material was removed by immersion in bleach. The replicas were washed in distilled water, placed on formvar-coated copper grids, and the collodion was removed by immersion in amyl acetate. The replicas were inspected in the electron microscope, and images of the protoplasmic fracture faces were digitized and analyzed as described (Zampighi et al., 1995). The oocyte surface area was obtained by measuring the oocyte membrane capacitance (Cm). Cm was determined from the slope of the Q (integral of the capacitive transients) versus voltage relation for 20-mV voltage pulses from V (−50 mV). The surface area of oocytes was calculated by assuming a specific capacitance of 1 μF/cm2 (Loo et al., 1993) and was verified by electron microscopy (Zampighi et al., 1995). The results presented are representative of experiments that were repeated at least twice with oocytes from different donor frogs. All experiments were carried out at 22°C. Amino acids were purchased from Sigma. Fig. 1A shows membrane potential changes in an oocyte expressing AAP1 in response to changing [H+]o and the addition of amino acids. Addition of 1 mM alanine at 10 μM H+ depolarized the oocyte membrane potential by 71 mV (−42 mV to 29 mV). The depolarization induced by 1 mM histidine was less (20 mV). These results indicated that there was a substrate-induced net inward movement of positive charge. Decreasing the [H+]o from 10 to 0.032 μM and removal of organic substrate from the transport buffer restored the oocyte resting potential. The same oocyte was clamped at −50 mV, and currents were recorded after increasing [H+]o and adding amino acids to the bathing medium (Fig. 1B). Addition of 1 mM alanine induced an inward current (∼250 nA), which returned to base-line levels after washing with alanine-free buffer at 0.032 μM H+. The inward current induced by histidine was less (∼45 nA). A membrane potential depolarization (∼30 mV) and inward current (∼20 nA) were also observed when the [H+]o was increased from 0.032 to 10 μM in the absence of organic substrate indicating an uncoupled transport of H+ through the transporter. These currents were about 10% of the currents induced by 1 mM alanine at 10 μM H+. Smaller depolarizations (∼18 mV) and inward currents (∼5 nA) were also recorded from control oocytes when the [H+]o was increased from 0.032 to 10 μM. Amino acid-induced depolarizations and currents were not observed in water-injected oocytes. There were no qualitative or quantitative differences in the amino acid-induced currents when choline in the transport buffer was replaced by Na+ or K+ or when Cl− was replaced by gluconate. Fig. 2 shows the current records from a cRNA-injected oocyte, which were obtained by stepping the membrane potential from the holding potential (V = −50 mV) to between −150 and 50 mV in 20-mV increments. At 10 μM H+ and in the absence of organic substrate, the currents consisted of an initial capacitive transient, which relaxed to a steady-state level 2 ms after the onset of the voltage pulse (Fig. 2A). Apart from the capacitive transient, no presteady-state cotransporter currents were observed. Inward steady-state currents were induced by amino acids at all applied membrane potentials upon the addition of 10 mM alanine (Fig. 2B). The alanine-dependent current/voltage (I/V) curve (inset) was obtained by subtracting the steady-state currents at 40 ms in the absence of alanine from those recorded in the presence of alanine. Between −150 and 50 mV, the I/V curve exhibited a supralinear dependence on voltage. To demonstrate that the inward current induced by alanine was accompanied by the uptake of alanine, radiotracer flux experiments were carried out. Table 1 shows that the uptake of 50 μML-[3H]alanine in oocytes injected with cRNA was H+-dependent, increasing from 14 to 371 pmol/oocyte/h as [H+]o was increased from 0.032 to 10 μM. The uptake of alanine into water-injected oocytes was H+-independent. There was no significant difference in the uptake of alanine between cRNA- and water-injected oocytes at 0.032 μM H+.Tabled 1 The kinetics of alanine transport were studied by measuring the steady-state alanine-induced currents (obtained 40 ms after the onset of the voltage pulse) as a function of [alanine]o and [H+]o. Fig. 3, 4, and 5 show the data obtained from a single oocyte and are representative of data from three oocytes. Alanine-dependent I/V curves were obtained at 1.0, 3.2, and 10 μM H+ with [alanine]o between 50 μM and 20 mM, and at 0.5, 1.0, and 10 mM alanine with [H+]o between 0.032 and 15.8 μM H+. The I/V relationships for alanine at 10 μM H+ (Fig. 3A) and 10 mM alanine (Fig. 3B) showed a supralinear dependence on voltage between 50 and −150 mV. At 10 μM H+, the inward currents increased at each membrane potential as the [alanine]o increased. Likewise, at 10 mM alanineo, the inward currents increased at each membrane potential as the [H+]o increased. I/V curves obtained at 1 and 3.2 μM H+ while varying [alanine]o and at 0.5 and 1.0 mM alanine while varying [H+]o had the same qualitative characteristics as the I/V curves shown in Fig. 3. At each membrane potential (−10 to −150 mV) the alanine-induced currents were plotted against [alanine]o or [H+]o, and the current/concentration curves were fitted to. Fig. 4 shows the data obtained at −150 mV. Fig. 4A shows that the H+ activation curves at 0.5, 1.0, and 10 mM alanine saturated at 10 μM H+ and were sigmoidal. The alanine activation curves at 1, 3.2, and 10 μM H+ saturated between 5 and 10 mM alanine and were also sigmoidal (Fig. 4B). The voltage dependence of the kinetic parameters obtained from the fitted data are shown in Fig. 5.Figure 5:Kinetics of alanine transport. These parameters were obtained by fitting the alanine-induced currents obtained at each membrane potential as a function of [H+]o and [alanine]o to. A, the iMAXalanine increased supralinearly with voltage and increased as [H+]o increased. B, the iMAXH increased supralinearly with voltage and increased as [alanine]o increased. C, as [H+]o decreased, K0.5alanine increased and became more voltage-dependent. D, K0.5H was relatively voltage-independent and increased as [alanine]o decreased. E, the Hill coefficient n for alanine was between 1 and 2. F, the n for H+ was 2 and was independent of [alanine]o and voltage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The maximal current induced by alanine iMAXalanine exhibited a supralinear dependence on voltage (Fig. 5A) and, as shown in Table 2, decreased as [H+]o decreased. The iMAXH showed the same voltage dependence (Fig. 5B) and decreased as [alanine]o decreased (Table 2). The iMAXalanine at saturating [H+]o (∼1600 nA) was similar to the iMAXH at saturating [alanine]o (∼1400 nA), suggesting a coupling ratio of 1 H+:1 alanine. Fig. 5C shows that K0.5alanine was relatively voltage-independent at 10 μM H+, became more voltage-dependent as the [H+]o decreased, and increased as [H+]o decreased (Table 3). However, at hyperpolarizing potentials, K0.5alanine was almost independent of [H+]o. The K0.5H was slightly voltage-dependent at low [alanine]o, was voltage-independent at 10 mM alanine, and increased as [alanine]o decreased (Fig. 5D; Table 3). Therefore, the apparent affinity for H+ and alanine depends on the concentration of their respective cosubstrates. The apparent coupling coefficient n for H+ was >1 and was voltage-independent (Fig. 5F). n for alanine was voltage-independent and was >1 over the range of [H+]o tested (Fig. 5E).Tabled 1Tabled 1 The substrate specificity of AAP1 was determined by measuring steady-state substrate-induced currents at −150 mV using 10 mM various organic compounds at 10 μM H+. Fig. 6 shows the substrate-induced currents normalized with respect to the current induced by 10 mM alanine. AAP1 exhibits a very broad but stereospecific substrate specificity preferring L- to D-isomers. Although there were no inward currents induced by lysine, β-alanine, and 2-methylamino isobutyric acid at 10 mM, 50 mM of these amino acids induced inward currents, which were 17, 7, and 2% of the alanine-induced current, respectively. The D-isomers of all the amino acids shown in Fig. 6 were tested. Only those that induced an inward current are shown. Other organic compounds that were not transported included sucrose, glucose, malate, and the dipeptide glycyl-glycine. To determine whether amino acids differing in their structure and net charge in solution have different transport kinetics, we investigated the kinetics of AAP1 using histidine, glutamate, proline, and glutamine. Fig. 8A shows that the iMAXalanine > iMAXglutamine > iMAXglutamine > iMAXproline≥ iMAXhiatidine, all of which increased supralinearly with voltage and decreased as [amino acid]o decreased (Table 2). The iMAX for each amino acid decreased with decreasing [H+]o (Table 2). The K0.5 values for histidine, glutamate, proline, and glutamine at 10 μM H+ were voltage-dependent and increased as the membrane potential was made more positive (Fig. 7B) and as [H+]o decreased (Table 3). The K0.5H at 10 mM of each amino acid was voltage-independent (Fig. 7C) and except for proline increased as [amino acid]o decreased (Table 3). The current/concentration curves for histidine, glutamate, proline, glutamine, and H+ for each amino acid were sigmoidal (data not shown) with Hill coefficients >1.Figure 7:Kinetics of glutamate, glutamine, proline, and histidine transport. A, iMAX of alanine, glutamine, proline, glutamine, and histidine obtained from a single oocyte. The I/V curves were obtained at saturating [H+]o and [amino acid]o (10 μM H+ and 50 mM amino acid). B, voltage dependence of K0.5 for histidine, glutamate, glutamine, and proline obtained at 10 μM H+. Steady-state amino acid-induced currents were obtained by varying [histidine]o, [glutamate]o, [glutamine]o, and [proline]o at 10 μM H+. Steady-state amino acid-induced currents at membrane potentials between −10 and −150 mV were fitted as a function of [amino acid]ousing, and K0.5 values for amino acids were determined from the fitted data. C, voltage dependence of K0.5H obtained at 10 mM histidine, glutamate, glutamine, and proline by varying [H+]o at 10 mM each amino acid and fitting the data as a function of [H+]o to.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain an estimate of the number of transporters/oocyte and the turnover number of AAP1, we examined the density of particles on the protoplasmic face (P face) and external face of the plasma membrane of oocytes expressing AAP1 after recording iMAXalanine. Fig. 8 shows the density of particles on the P face of the plasma membrane of a water-injected control oocyte (A), an oocyte expressing AAP1 (B), and, for comparison, an oocyte expressing the rabbit Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (C). The density of particles in the P face of the control oocyte was 212 ± 43 particles/μm2 (Fig. 8A); similar values were obtained for all controls. The density of particles in the P face of the oocyte expressing AAP1 was 1037 ± 136 particles/μm2. The capacitance of this oocyte was 297 nF, which corresponds to an oocyte surface area of 2.97 × 107μm2 (assuming a capacitance of 1 μF/cm2) from which was calculated the total number of particles (2.4 × 1010/oocyte). The turnover number of AAP1 was calculated using the equation iMAX = kzeNT, where iMAX = maximal current induced by alanine at −150 mV (2712 nA), k = turnover number, z = number of charges per transport cycle (2.Burkhardt B.-C. Frömter E. Pflügers Arch. 1992; 420: 83-86Google Scholar), e = elementary charge, and NT = number of transporters per oocyte. These values yield a turnover number of ∼350 s-1. Turnover numbers of 580 and 800 s-1 were calculated for two other oocytes expressing AAP1. The particle density of the oocyte expressing rabbit SGLT1 (Fig. 8C) was 4,121 ± 950/μm2, and the iMAXsugar was 515 nÅ. This corresponds to a turnover number of ∼11 s-1. Expression of AAP1 and SGLT1 did not increase the density of particles (∼900/μm2) on external faces data not shown. Expression of the H+/amino acid cotransporter (AAP1) from A. thaliana in Xenopus oocytes has allowed us to directly determine the substrate specificity and kinetics of the transporter using electrophysiological, radiotracer flux, and electron microscopic methods. Amino acid transport was H+-driven, and the electrogenicity of the transporter was demonstrated by amino acid-induced depolarizations of the oocyte plasma membrane and amino acid-induced inward currents, which were accompanied by the uptake of amino acids into the oocyte. AAP1 transports a wide spectrum of amino acids and is stereospecific, preferring L- to D-isomers. Neutral amino acids with short side chains were preferred by the transporter and include cysteine, alanine, leucine, serine, and glycine. Amino acids with longer side chains such as citrulline and methionine and those with a γ-phenyl (phenylalanine), β-amide (asparagine), γ-amide (glutamine), and a γ-carboxyl (glutamate) were also transported. AAP1 did not so readily transport amino acids containing an imidazole side chain (histidine), β-methyl groups (threonine, valine, and isoleucine), and cyclic amino acids (proline and hydroxyproline). The basic amino acids arginine, ornithine, and lysine, which have δ-guanido, δ-amino groups, and an ∊-amino group, respectively, were transported poorly. The α-amino group is important for substrate recognition; β-alanine and 2-methylamino isobutyric acid were transported poorly, and γ-aminobutyric acid was not. These observations confirm and extend results obtained by expression of AAP1 in yeast (Frommer et al., 1993; Hsu et al., 1993; Kwart et al., 1993; Fischer et al., 1995). A detailed kinetic investigation of AAP1 was undertaken using alanine, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, and proline, which differ either in their structure and/or net charge in solution. All induced inward currents through the transporter, the magnitude of which increased as [H+]o and [amino acid]o increased and as the membrane voltage was made more negative. This is a direct demonstration that AAP1 operates via a H+-coupled transport mechanism. The transporter exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to [H+]o and [amino acid]o but not to voltage. Amino acid-induced currents may saturate with respect to membrane voltage in planta where the membrane potential that the transporter senses is probably more negative than −150 mV. For example, in a study of nitrate transport in Arabidopsis roots, the cell-resting potential was ∼200 mV, and I/V curves were supralinear at −150 mV and did not saturate until −250 mV (see Fig. 5B) (Meharg and Blatt, 1995). The net charge of amino acids in solution depends on the pKa of their side groups. Greater than 99% of alanine, proline, and glutamine in solution are zwitterions over the range of [H+]o (0.032-10 μM) used in the experiments presented here. About 95, 24, and 9% of histidine and 0.06, 5, and 15% of glutamate are zwitterions at 0.032, 3.2, and 10 μM H+, respectively; the majority of the other charged species of histidine and glutamate bear a single positive charge or a single negative charge, respectively. In view of the structural and charge differences between these amino acids, it is interesting that the kinetic properties of the transporter for each amino acid were qualitatively similar. 1) The current/voltage curves did not saturate at negative membrane potentials. 2) The iMAXaminoacid decreased with decreasing [H+]o. 3) The iMAXH for each amino acid decreased with decreasing [amino acid]o. 4) The K0.5aminoacid decreased as [H+]o decreased. 5) The K0.5aminoacid was voltage-dependent and decreased as the membrane potential was made more negative. 6) Except for proline, the K0.5H decreased as [amino acid]o decreased. 7) At 10 mM amino acido K0.5H was voltage-dependent and became slightly more voltage-dependent at lower [amino acid]o. 8) The substrate-activation curves for both ligands (H+ and amino acid) were sigmoidal with apparent coupling coefficients >1. These similarities suggest that the transport mechanism for each amino acid is the same. We propose a kinetic model of amino acid transport by AAP1 (Fig. 9). In this mechanism, 2 H+ or 2 substrate molecules (S) bind to the transporter Co at the external face of the membrane to form CH2 or CS2. These intermediates then bind S2 or H2, respectively, to form the complex CH2S2. A conformational change allows H2 and S2 to be transported to the cytoplasmic surface where they dissociate. The transport cycle is completed when the empty transporter Ci undergoes another conformational change allowing the ligand binding sites to face the external surface. The broken lines between [CH2]o and [CH2]2 indicate possible uncoupled transport of H+. The rationale for this mechanism is as follows. The H+ and amino acid activation curves for all the amino acids tested were sigmoidal with Hill coefficients for H+ and amino acids >1. To simplify the transport model, we assume that the Hill coefficients for H+ and amino acid are 2. Thus, we propose that 2 H+ and 2 substrate molecules bind to the transporter per transport cycle. The stoichiometry of transport could not be determined from reversal potentials as the currents did not reverse over the voltage range used in the experiments. Uncoupled transport of H+ is proposed based on the observation that increasing [H+]o in the absence of amino acids induced inward currents that were significantly higher than those induced in water-injected controls; the depolarizations observed in control oocytes are due to the H+ inhibition of an outward K+ current (Burckhardt and Frömter, 1992). However, without a specific blocker of amino acid transport, we are unable to draw conclusions from this observation in the present study. Uncoupled transport of Na+ occurs through the Na+/glucose cotransporter (Umbach et al., 1990; Parent et al., 1992a, 1992b) and the serotonin transporter (Mager et al., 1994). There is no significant leak for amino acid through AAP1; flux experiments showed that at low [H+]o there was no uptake of amino acid above water-injected controls. A random versus an ordered, and a simultaneous versus a sequential mechanism of transport, are evaluated using the kinetic parameters obtained with alanine. Fig. 10 shows a replot of the data presented in Fig. 6. The K0.5alanine decreased at all membrane potentials as [H+]o became saturating (Fig. 10A). Likewise, the K0.5H decreased as [alanine]o became saturating (Fig. 10B). The increase in the apparent affinity of the transporter for H+ and amino acid as the concentration of their respective cosubstrates increased suggests positive cooperativity between both ligands for binding to their respective sites on the transporter. This cooperativity suggests that both ligands must be bound to the transporter before the transporter-H+-amino acid complex crosses the membrane, i.e. that the transporter operates via a simultaneous mechanism (Jauch and Läuger, 1986). The iMAXalanine increased as [H+]o increased at all membrane potentials (Fig. 10C), and iMAXH increased as [alanine]o increased (Fig. 10D). The iMAX for both H+ and amino acid was dependent on the concentrations of their respective cosubstrates, which would suggest a random binding of substrates to the transporter (Jauch and Läuger, 1986). Results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 suggest that the same mechanism applies to all the amino acids tested. There was no decrease in K0.5H when [proline]o was increased from 1 to 10 mM, probably because 10 mM proline is not saturating. AAP1 transports neutral, basic, and acidic amino acids. The iMAXalanine > iMAXglutamine > iMAXglutamine > iMAXproline≥ iMAXhiatidine and the shape of the I/V curves are the same. This suggests that the mechanism of transport for each amino acid is the same and that differences in iMAX are due to changes in a rate-limiting step in the transport cycle, possibly the translocation rate of the fully loaded transporter ([CH2S2]) or any of the dissociation steps on the inside of the cell. These rates cannot be determined from measurement of inward currents in intact oocytes. The I/V curves did not saturate between −150 and 50 mV, and this was independent of [H+]o and [alanine]o. Therefore, at least one rate-limiting step in the transport mechanism is potential-dependent over this voltage range. There is a voltage dependence of K0.5H and K0.5aminoacid at low concentrations of amino acid and H+, respectively, which decreases as the concentration of ligands increases. Therefore, part of the effect of voltage is to enhance the affinity of the transporter for substrates. Even at saturating [H+]o and [amino acid]o, there is a voltage dependence of iMAX. Therefore, reaction steps other than H+ and amino acid binding are voltage-dependent, possibly the conformational changes of the empty and loaded transporters. Previous studies have shown that neutral, basic, and acidic amino acids are transported by different mechanisms within the plant. For example, in Chlorella (Cho and Komor, 1983) and sugar cane cells (Wyse and Komor, 1984), neutral amino acids were accompanied by an influx of H+ and an efflux of K+. Wyse and Komor(1984) observed that basic amino acids were driven by the negative membrane potential and were not cotransported with H+ and that acidic amino acids were accompanied by the uptake of 2 H+ and the release of K+. Kinraide and Etherton(1980) obtained similar results with amino acid transport in oat coleoptiles. Unlike plant cells where the interpretation of amino acid transport data is complicated by the presence of a variety of transport systems, overexpression of AAP1 in oocytes shows that neutral, basic, and acidic amino acids are transported by one protein by the same mechanism. Due to the qualitative similarities in their transport kinetics, we have assumed that the zwitterionic species of alanine, proline, glutamine, histidine, and glutamate are transported. This assumption alters the K0.5 for histidine and glutamate, but the dependence of K0.5aminoacid on [H+]o remains the same. Therefore, if 5 and 15% of glutamate is zwitterionic at 3.2 and 10 μM H+, respectively, the K0.5glutamine will be 0.15 and 0.12 mM instead of 3.0 and 0.8 mM. Likewise, for histidine where 24 and 9% is zwitterionic at 3.2 and 10 μM H+, the K0.5hiatidine will be 2.5 and 0.6 mM instead of 10.4 and 6.8 mM. Freeze fracture electron microscopic methods have been used to determine the unitary functional capacity of various transport proteins including the Na+/glucose cotransporter from rabbit small intestine (SGLTl) and the water channels MIP and CHIP (Zampighi et al., 1995). These investigators showed that the expression of cloned transporters increased the density of particles in the P face but not in the external face of the oocyte plasma membrane. Expression of AAP1 in oocytes also increased the density of particles in the protoplasmic fracture face of the oocyte plasma membrane (4-5-fold above water-injected controls). The turnover number of 350 to 800 s-1 was calculated assuming a valence of 2 (2 charges/transport cycle) and that all particles expressed in the oocyte were transporting substrate. This turnover number is an underestimate because the iMAX did not saturate with respect to membrane voltage. The turnover number calculated for AAP1 is higher than that obtained for other cloned cotransporters. Using electrical methods, a turnover number of 59 s-1 was determined for the H+/hexose cotransporter (STP1) (Boorer et al., 1994), 60 s-1 for human SGLT1 (Loo et al., 1993), and 25 s-1 for rabbit SGLT1 (Panayotova-Heiermann et al., 1994). In conclusion, transport by AAP1 is relatively fast compared to other cloned cotransporters and is H+-dependent and electrogenic with membrane voltage enhancing the maximal transport rate and the affinities for H+ and amino acid. Future kinetic studies of other members of the AAP gene family, in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis of AAP1, will enable us to identify the amino acid residues involved in substrate and H+ binding and in voltage regulation. -We thank Manoli Contreras for the preparation and injection of oocytes and Todd Chappell for quantification of P face particles."
https://openalex.org/W1494502885,"Binding of components of the fibrinolytic system to fibrin is important for the regulation of fibrinolysis. In this study, decomposition of the fibrin network and binding of plasminogen and plasminogen activators (PAs) to fibrin during lysis of a plasma clot were investigated with confocal microscopy using fluorescein-labeled preparations of fibrinogen, plasminogen, tissue-type PA (t-PA), and two-chain urokinase-type PA (tcu-PA).Lysis induced by PAs present throughout the plasma clot was accompanied by a gradual loss of fibrin content of fibers and by accumulation of plasminogen onto the fibers. Two sequential phases could be distinguished: a phase of prelysis, during which the fibrin network remained immobile, and a phase of final lysis, during which fibers moved with a tendency to shrink and eventually disappeared.The two phases occurred simultaneously but in different locations when lysis was induced by PAs present in the plasma surrounding the clot. The zone of final lysis was located within a 5-8-μm superficial layer, where fibers were mobile, and surface-associated fibrin agglomerates appeared. Plasminogen accumulated in these agglomerates up to 30-fold as compared with its concentration in the outer plasma. t-PA was also highly concentrated in the agglomerates, and tcu-PA bound to them slightly. The zone of prelysis, where plasminogen was moderately accumulated on the immobile fibers, was located deeper in the clot. This zone was much thinner in the case of t-PA-induced lysis than in the case of tcu-PA-induced lysis, reflecting the difference in penetration of the two PAs into the clot.We conclude that under conditions of diffusional transport of fibrinolytic enzymes from outside a plasma clot, extensive lysis is spatially restricted to a zone not exceeding 5-8 μm from the clot surface. In this zone the structure of the fibrin network undergoes significant changes, and strikingly high accumulation of fibrinolytic components takes place.

Using conventional fluorescence microscopy, we have recently demonstrated that plasminogen accumulates severalfold in a thin superficial layer of a plasma clot during its lysis(18.Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Google Scholar). Here, we report on the fibrin architecture in a lysing plasma clot as studied with confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy. Using this technique, we were able to follow the structural rearrangements of the fibrin network and to quantitate the spatial microdistribution of plasminogen and plasminogen activators (PAs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAplasminogen activatort-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatortcu-PAtwo-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activatorFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. near the surface of the plasma clot during its lysis. The study reveals specific fibrin structures associated with the surface of the lysing clot that provide a scaffold for an extremely high superficial accumulation of fibrinolytic components. plasminogen activator tissue-type plasminogen activator two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator fluorescein isothiocyanate. Glu plasminogen was a product of Biofine (Leiden, The Netherlands). No contamination by the Lys form of plasminogen or by other proteins was found in the preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The t-PA preparation (Actilyse) was supplied by Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany), and human urinary tcu-PA (Ukidan) was obtained from Serono (Aubonne, Switzerland). Human fibrinogen from Kabi (Stockholm, Sweden) was made plasminogen-free by lysine-Sepharose chromatography. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was from Sigma. Fluorescein 5-maleimide was from Pierce. We also used thrombin (Leo, Ballerup, Denmark) and hirudin (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland). Experiments were performed with pooled citrated platelet-poor plasma from healthy volunteers. Fibrinogen (0.3 ml, 20 μM) was gel-filtered in a centrifuge using a 2-ml microcolumn with Sephadex G-25 (fine) equilibrated with a buffer containing 30 mM sodium borate, 140 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. FITC (1 mg/ml in Me2SO) was added to the fibrinogen solution under intensive stirring to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After 1 h of incubation in the dark at room temperature, unreacted FITC was removed by gel filtration on the same column with Sephadex G-25 reequilibrated with Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The preparation was stored frozen in small portions, which were thawed only once before each experiment. The ratio A495/A280 in preparations of FITC-fibrinogen was about 0.2, corresponding to a molar fluorescein:fibrinogen ratio of 2. The fluorescent signal of the FITC-fibrinogen was neither quenched upon polymerization with thrombin nor dequenched upon cleavage with plasmin (data not shown), as was described for more heavily labeled preparations of FITC-fibrinogen (19.Wu J.H. Diamond S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 83-91Google Scholar). The procedures for labeling plasminogen and tcu-PA with FITC were described in detail elsewhere(18.Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Google Scholar). t-PA was labeled with fluorescein 5-maleimide, presumably attached to the sulfhydryl group in position 83, as described by others(20.Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Google Scholar). As reported earlier(18.Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Google Scholar), the labeling did not significantly disturb functional properties of the fibrinolytic enzymes. The experimental system for visualization of the spatial distribution of FITC-labeled molecules inside a plasma clot has been described elsewhere(18.Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Google Scholar, 21.Sakharov D.V. Domogatsky S.P. Bos R. Rijken D.C. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 116-119Google Scholar). In brief, plasma was clotted with thrombin (final concentration 1.4 NIH units/ml) between two parallel glass slides separated by a spacer about 0.2 mm high. After 3 min a clot with an approximate diameter of 2-3 mm was formed firmly attached to the parallel glass slides, and then the remaining volume of the chamber was filled with plasma containing 5 antithrombin unit/ml of hirudin. Plasminogen activators and/or tracer fluorescent molecules were added either to plasma before clotting or to the outer plasma after clotting, as indicated. Lysis was performed at room temperature. The confocal microscopy experiments were performed using an MRC-600 Laser Sharp system (Bio-Rad Microscience Ltd., Hemel Hempsted, United Kingdom) linked to a Zeiss IM 35 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, FRG). The microscope was equipped with a Zeiss 63× Planapo oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.3). An argon laser was used in combination with a 488-nm band pass filter for the excitation and a 520-nm-long pass filter for the emission. The optical resolution (about 0.5 μm in the x-y direction and about 0.7 μm in the z direction) allowed the reliable measurement of the fluorescence in structures with characteristic dimensions of 1 μm and more. Thinner structures (i.e. fluorescence-labeled fibrin fibers) were visible, although neither their dimensions nor the concentration of a fluorescence label associated with the fibers could be measured quantitatively. The design of the system allowed images to be collected periodically during ongoing lysis. Bleaching of fluorescence in the specimens was reduced by using optical filters attenuating laser intensity to 3 or 10% of the full intensity. To exclude the disturbing influence of clot/glass interface, all images were taken at a distance of 40-50 μm from the surface of the glass. A computer equipped with standard Bio-Rad software (Comos 6.03) was used for operating the system and for processing of images. Images were collected in a format of 768 × 512 pixels, with 256 gradations of intensity. Kalman filtering (averaging of images to reduce noise) was used for improvement of image quality. Collecting a single complete image took 5 s. Images were printed using either a Sony Video Graphic Printer UP-850 (black and white) or a Mitsubishi CP50-1 color printer. The software was used to determine the intensity of the fluorescence signal in selected areas of the images obtained. Calibration curves (not shown) establishing correlations between concentration of labeled proteins in the chamber and the intensity of fluorescence were linear and were not affected significantly by the presence of the plasma clot. The accumulation of labeled fibrinolytic components in different layers of the clot (see Table 1) was measured as a ratio of intensity of fluorescence in the selected layer and the intensity of fluorescence in the plasma surrounding the lysing clot. It should be noted that this technique does not allow discrimination of intact labeled proteins (Glu plasminogen, PAs, and fibrin) and their derivatives, which might be generated during fibrinolysis (like Lys plasminogen, plasmin, complexes of plasmin or PAs with inhibitors, and fibrin degradation products).Tabled 1 In order to judge the mobility of the fibrin network, consecutive images were taken at 30-s intervals. The fibers were considered to be immobile if their positions in such images coincided. Merging of two consecutive images into one was used to distinguish mobile and immobile fibers. Confocal fluorescence microscopy allows visualization of the fibrin network of a plasma clot, monitoring of changes in its architecture during lysis, and quantitation of the spatial microdistribution of fluorescence-labeled components inside the clot. Two different experimental setups were used: 1) lysis induced by a PA present throughout the plasma clot, and 2) lysis induced by a PA added to plasma surrounding the clot. Fig. 1, A-D, shows the dynamics of the FITC-labeled fibrin network of a plasma clot during its lysis induced by t-PA present inside the clot. The structure of the clot during the first phase of lysis (B) was similar to that of the intact clot in the absence of PA (A) and, in general, resembled the images published recently by Blombäck et al.(22.Blombäck B. Carlsson K. Hessel B. Liljeborg A. Procyk R. Aslund N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 96-110Google Scholar, 23.Blombäck B. Carlsson K. Fatah K. Hessel B. Procyk R. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 521-538Google Scholar). It was a network consisting of fibers that formed nodes in places of intersections. During the first phase of lysis, the fibrin lattice remained immobile, and some loss of the fibrin content of fibers took place, manifested by a reduction of fiber-associated fluorescence. Then the network changed its geometry, fibers started to move with a tendency to shrink (C and D), and very soon thereafter the network was completely dissolved. Parallel experiments performed in the presence of tracer amounts of FITC-plasminogen are presented in Fig. 1(E-H). The binding of plasminogen to the intact fibrin network was very weak, hardly allowing the visualization of the fibrin lattice of a clot without the addition of a PA (E). In the presence of t-PA, plasminogen accumulated gradually onto the immobile fibers during the first stage of lysis (F) and remained bound to the mobile and partially disconnected lattice until its complete lysis during the second phase (G, H). In the very last moments of lysis, both fibrin and plasminogen appeared to be concentrated in the remnants of the lattice (D, H), possibly as a result of shrinkage and/or aggregation of disconnected pieces of the fibrin network. The sequence of events illustrated in Fig. 1 was basically the same when lysis was induced by tcu-PA under the same conditions (not shown). Fig. 2A represents four consecutive views of the boundary of a plasma clot that was lysed by the addition of t-PA to the surrounding plasma. Fibrin fibers were mobile in close proximity to the moving surface of the lysing clot. They adhered to the surface, bent along with its movement, and eventually merged with it. Further away from the surface, the fibrin network remained immobile. The regions with either mobile or immobile network can be easily discriminated in Fig. 2B, in which a pair of consecutive images from Fig. 2A are combined into one image. The network of the second and third images of Fig. 2A is presented in green and red, respectively, resulting in a yellow color in places where the two images coincide. Based on this typical image, we estimated the width of the layer in which the network was mobile (the layer in which the “red” fibers are split from the “green” ones) as approximately 5-8 μm. The surface bore agglomerates of fibrin (2-4 μm in diameter), which mainly appeared in places where the moving surface came in contact with the nodes of the fibrin fibers. The concentration of fibrin in these agglomerates appeared to be 3-7-fold higher than the average concentration of fibrin in the original plasma clot (about 10 μM). Thus, the concentration of fibrin in the agglomerates was estimated as 30-70 μM. Once an agglomerate appeared, it moved together with the reducing surface of the clot for several minutes and eventually disappeared. The dynamics of changes of the fibrin network were essentially the same when the lysis of a plasma clot was induced by tcu-PA (not shown). The patterns of the spatial distribution of plasminogen during lysis induced by t-PA (1.5 μg/ml) and by tcu-PA (300 IU/ml) in the surrounding plasma are presented in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. In both cases, the high accumulation of plasminogen in a thin superficial layer of the lysing clot was observed. The highest concentration of plasminogen was found in the surface-associated fibrin agglomerates described above. Deeper into the clot, plasminogen bound moderately to fibrin fibers, making them visible. As in Fig. 1F, this binding reflects exposure of new plasminogen binding sites on the fibrin fibers, generated as a result of their nicking with plasmin. The depth of this zone of “prelysis” depended on the plasminogen activator used. In the case of t-PA, this zone was restricted to a 20-μm layer adjacent to the surface. The fibrin lattice remained invisible beyond this layer (Fig. 3A). The zone of prelysis was much deeper when the lysis was induced by tcu-PA, as illustrated by Fig. 3B, where the fibrin matrix is visible at least up to the depth of 150 μm inside the clot. Quantitative data on the accumulation of fibrinolytic components at different distances from the surface of the lysing clot are summarized in Table 1. They demonstrate that plasminogen (during lysis induced by either t-PA or tcu-PA) was concentrated up to 30-fold in individual surface-associated agglomerates in comparison with its concentration in the surrounding plasma (1.5 μM(1.Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1980; 43: 77-89Google Scholar)). Thus, the local concentration of plasminogen in the agglomerates could be as high as 45 μM. On average, plasminogen was concentrated about 10-fold within a 3-μm layer comprising these agglomerates. The average concentration of plasminogen was also somewhat elevated (about 2-fold) in a 3-20-μm layer contiguous to the surface but not including the surface-associated agglomerates. Binding of plasminogen to fibers in deeper layers of the clot (20-150 μm) in case of tcu-PA-induced lysis was not associated with an overall increase of the plasminogen concentration within the area. Therefore, the observed binding seems to be a result of local redistribution of plasminogen between the soluble and the fibrin-bound phases within this clot region rather than a result of recruiting of plasminogen from other areas of the clot or from the surrounding plasma. Experiments with fluorescence-labeled derivatives of PAs indicated a considerable difference in penetration of the two PAs into the clot during its lysis (Fig. 3, C and D). The distribution of labeled t-PA (C) was very similar to that of plasminogen in the case of the t-PA-induced lysis. t-PA was highly concentrated in the surface-associated agglomerates and was moderately bound to immobile fibers within a 3-20-μm layer near the surface not including these agglomerates (see Table 1). This pattern of binding of both plasminogen and t-PA was apparently not dependent on the time passed after the beginning of lysis (data not shown). These results suggest that the penetration of t-PA into the clot was restricted, supposedly, as a result of its affinity to fibrin(5.Rijken D.C. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7035-7041Google Scholar, 8.Higgins D.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7786-7791Google Scholar). In contrast, labeled tcu-PA diffused into the clot freely, although a weak binding was detected in the surface-associated agglomerates (D). tcu-PA did not bind detectably to fibers inside the clot and penetrated deeper into the clot as compared with t-PA. The distance of the tcu-PA penetration increased during the course of lysis (data not shown). In control experiments, fluorescence-labeled bovine serum albumin bound neither to surface-associated agglomerates nor to the fibrin network inside the lysing clot (not shown). The in vitro model of a noncontracted plasma clot, obtained as a result of thrombin-induced clotting of blood plasma, is commonly used for studying fibrinolysis. Depending on the aim of the investigation, lytic agents are added to plasma before clotting (see, for example, (13.Tran-Thang C. Kruithof E.K.O. Bachmann F. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2009-2016Google Scholar) and (24.Matsuo O. Rijken D.C. Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1981; 45: 225-229Google Scholar) −26) or, alternatively, are added to the surrounding medium after the preparation of the clot (see, for example, (27.Rijken D.C. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2920-2925Google Scholar, 28.Zamarron C. Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 52: 19-23Google Scholar, 29.Nishino N. Kakkar V.V. Scully M.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 672-677Google Scholar)). Lysis either proceeds throughout the clot or from the boundary to the inside of the clot, respectively. The two variants roughly correspond to two different modes of transport of therapeutic fibrinolytic agents into a thrombus: pressure-driven permeation and diffusional transport. Both modes of transport are, presumably, realized in vivo during thrombolytic therapy. Pressure-driven permeation is known to accelerate the lysis(30.Blinc A. Planinsic G. Keber D. Jarh O. Lahajnar G. Zidansek A. Demsar F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 549-552Google Scholar, 31.Blinc A. Keber D. Lahajnar G. Stegnar M. Zidansek A. Demsar F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 667-671Google Scholar, 32.Wu J.H. Siddiqui K. Diamond S.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 105-112Google Scholar, 33.Blinc A. Kennedy S.D. Bryant R.G. Marder V.J. Francis C.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 223-230Google Scholar) and is expected to play a role in vivo when a considerable drop in blood pressure exists across the thrombus (i.e. in occluding arterial thrombi). The fibrinolytic components rapidly delivered to the inner parts of the thrombus by pressure-driven flow lyse these parts of the thrombus from inside(34.Zidansek A. Blinc A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 553-559Google Scholar, 35.Diamond S.L. Anand S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2622-2643Google Scholar). The diffusional mode of transport is expected to be dominant when there is no pressure applied across the thrombus or when this pressure is insignificant (i.e. nonoccluding thrombi, remainders of partially lysed occluding thrombi after reperfusion, or large venous thrombi(30.Blinc A. Planinsic G. Keber D. Jarh O. Lahajnar G. Zidansek A. Demsar F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 549-552Google Scholar, 34.Zidansek A. Blinc A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 553-559Google Scholar, 35.Diamond S.L. Anand S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2622-2643Google Scholar). In this case, lysis proceeds from the surface to the inner parts of the thrombus. Although many data on functional activities of different fibrinolytic and antifibrinolytic components have been obtained in these models, little is known about the changes in fibrin architecture occurring during lysis. Fibrin acts as an important regulator of the lytic process, exposing binding sites for components of both fibrinolytic and antifibrinolytic systems (for review see (3.Gaffney P.J. Longstaff C. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1994: 549-573Google Scholar)). Thus, lysis-associated changes in fibrin organization may be important for the regulation of fibrinolysis. In a previous study(18.Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Google Scholar), we observed accumulation of plasminogen in a thin superficial layer of a plasma clot during its lysis, using conventional fluorescence microscopy. We have supposed that not only plasmin-mediated generation of C-terminal lysines on the fibrin fibers (12.Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 513-522Google Scholar, 13.Tran-Thang C. Kruithof E.K.O. Bachmann F. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2009-2016Google Scholar, 14.Harpel P.C. Chang T.S. Verderber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4432-4440Google Scholar) but also structural changes of the fibrin network close to the surface of the lysing clot contribute to this strictly superficial plasminogen binding. Here, we investigate the phenomenon using confocal fluorescence microscopy, allowing individual fibrin fibers to be visualized. During clot lysis induced by PAs present throughout the clot, we distinguished two sequential phases. During the first phase (prelysis), plasminogen gradually accumulated onto the relatively immobile fibrin lattice of the clot. Clearly, this accumulation is a consequence of the gradual increase of plasminogen binding sites appearing on the fibers as a result of fibrin nicking by plasmin. It took a considerable time for this partial degradation to start affecting the general architecture of the clot. Fragmentation of the plasminogen-loaded fibrin lattice took place during the second phase (final lysis). The fibrin network became mobile and collapsed, and soon after this was completely dissolved. During the lysis of a plasma clot induced by PAs added to the surrounding plasma, the two phases of lysis occurred simultaneously but in different locations within the clot; the zone of the final lysis was localized within a 5-8-μm superficial layer, and the zone of prelysis was located farther away from the moving surface of the clot. In the zone of prelysis, FITC-plasminogen moderately accumulated to immobile fibers, making them visible on the confocal images. The depth of this zone was dependent on the fibrin-binding properties of the PA used and corresponded to the depth of penetration into the clot of the PA itself. The penetration of t-PA was restricted to a 20-μm zone near the surface of the lysing clot (Fig. 3C), presumably due to its high affinity to fibrin(5.Rijken D.C. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7035-7041Google Scholar, 8.Higgins D.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7786-7791Google Scholar). FITC-plasminogen appeared to be bound to the fibrin network in the same zone in the case of t-PA-induced lysis (Fig. 3A). Urokinase-type PA did not bind detectably to the fibrin network and penetrated deeper inside the clot (Fig. 3D). The depth of the penetration increased with time. Correspondingly, the zone of prelysis spread deeper into the clot, as revealed by FITC-plasminogen binding to fibrin fibers in areas lying much deeper than 20 μm from the surface (Fig. 3B). In the zone of final lysis (5-8-μm layer near the surface of the clot) fibers loaded with plasminogen became mobile, adhered to the moving surface, and formed surface-associated agglomerates. Using differential interference contrast microscopy, Wu et al.(32.Wu J.H. Siddiqui K. Diamond S.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 105-112Google Scholar) have recently observed agglomerated material on the surface of a lysing coarse fibrin clot. In this study, we were able to follow transformations of fibrin fibers leading to formation of these agglomerates. We found that the agglomerates accumulate plasminogen to an extremely high level (up to 45 μM) that is about 30-fold higher than its concentration in the surrounding plasma. The overall concentration of fibrin within the agglomerate volume (30-70 μM) appeared to be severalfold higher than its average concentration in the plasma clot (about 10 μM) but was considerably lower than in normally packed fibrin fibers, where the fibrin concentration is about 800 μM(36.Carr M.E. Hermans J. Macromolecules. 1978; 11: 46-50Google Scholar). Plasminogen is capable of bridging fibrin molecules (37.Garman A.J. Smith R.A.G. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 311-320Google Scholar) with a tendency to form 1:1 complexes with polymerizing fibrin or with fibrin degradation products(38.Petersen L.S. Suenson E. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 51-59Google Scholar, 39.Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Korsholm B. Petersen L.C. Suenson E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1117-1135Google Scholar). The roughly equimolar concentrations of fibrin and plasminogen found in the surface-associated agglomerates allowed us to suppose that plasminogen bridging contributes to the formation of the observed agglomerates. Disintegration of fibers into thin filaments during lysis as described by Bauer et al.(40.Bauer R. Hansen S.L. Jones J. Suenson E. Thorsen S. Ogendal L. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 239-252Google Scholar) may facilitate the plasminogen-mediated agglomeration of fibrin. t-PA was also highly accumulated in the surface-associated fibrin agglomerates, explaining the earlier results of Krause and Deutsch (41.Krause J. Deutsch H. Fibrinolysis. 1989; 3: 85-91Google Scholar), who observed spots of fluorescence-labeled t-PA on the surface of a model thrombus. Even tcu-PA, which has no apparent affinity to fibrin, appeared to accumulate weakly in these agglomerates, in line with our earlier results(21.Sakharov D.V. Domogatsky S.P. Bos R. Rijken D.C. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 116-119Google Scholar). One of the interesting aspects of the results obtained is the demonstration of a very sharp front of lysis (5-8-μm layer between completely lysed and virtually nonlysed areas of a clot). Probably this is a result of the extremely high accumulation of fibrinolytic components, strictly localized to the thin superficial zone of the lysing clot, where the structure of the fibrin network undergoes significant changes. We hypothesize that this mechanism can provide an accurate, layer-by-layer elimination of thrombi in vivo without releasing partially lysed but still insoluble material into the bloodstream. We are grateful to Drs. J. Verheijen and W. Nieuwenhuizen for critical reading of the manuscript and for valuable suggestions. We appreciate the skillful assistance of H. J. G. M. de Bont."

https://openalex.org/W1565483293,"Laminin, the major glycoprotein of basement membranes, actively supports cell migration in development, tissue repair, tumor growth, metastasis, and other pathological processes. Previously we have shown that the locomotion of murine skeletal myoblasts is specifically and significantly enhanced on laminin but not on other matrix proteins. One of the major laminin receptors of myoblasts is the α7β1 integrin, which was first described in human MeWo melanoma cells and Rugli glioblastoma cells. In order to investigate and directly test the role of the α7 integrin in cell migration on laminin, we expressed the murine α7B splice variant in human 293 kidney cells and 530 melanoma cells which cannot migrate on laminin and are devoid of endogenous α7. Northern blotting of the transfected cells showed that the α7 mRNA was expressed efficiently, and the protein was detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cell motility measurements by computer-assisted time-lapse videomicroscopy of the α7-transfected cells revealed an 8-10-fold increase in motility on laminin-1 and its E8 fragment, but not on fibronectin. Mock-transfected cells did not migrate significantly on laminin or on fibronectin. Similarly, transmigration of α7-transfected 293 cells through laminin-coated filters in a Boyden chamber assay was significantly enhanced in comparison to mock-transfected cells. These findings prove that α7 integrin expression confers a gain of function-motile phenotype to immobile cells and may be responsible for transduction of the laminin-induced cell motility. Laminin, the major glycoprotein of basement membranes, actively supports cell migration in development, tissue repair, tumor growth, metastasis, and other pathological processes. Previously we have shown that the locomotion of murine skeletal myoblasts is specifically and significantly enhanced on laminin but not on other matrix proteins. One of the major laminin receptors of myoblasts is the α7β1 integrin, which was first described in human MeWo melanoma cells and Rugli glioblastoma cells. In order to investigate and directly test the role of the α7 integrin in cell migration on laminin, we expressed the murine α7B splice variant in human 293 kidney cells and 530 melanoma cells which cannot migrate on laminin and are devoid of endogenous α7. Northern blotting of the transfected cells showed that the α7 mRNA was expressed efficiently, and the protein was detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cell motility measurements by computer-assisted time-lapse videomicroscopy of the α7-transfected cells revealed an 8-10-fold increase in motility on laminin-1 and its E8 fragment, but not on fibronectin. Mock-transfected cells did not migrate significantly on laminin or on fibronectin. Similarly, transmigration of α7-transfected 293 cells through laminin-coated filters in a Boyden chamber assay was significantly enhanced in comparison to mock-transfected cells. These findings prove that α7 integrin expression confers a gain of function-motile phenotype to immobile cells and may be responsible for transduction of the laminin-induced cell motility. INTRODUCTIONCells utilize extracellular matrix to migrate during embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and invasion of tissues in inflammation and tumor metastasis (reviewed in (1.Liotta L.A. Invest. 1983; 49: 636-649Google Scholar)). Laminin-1, a major glycoprotein of basement membranes, has been shown to promote migration of different cell types including neural crest cells(2.Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1-7Google Scholar), skeletal myoblasts(3.Albelda S.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 4-16Google Scholar), or B16 mouse melanoma cells(4.Goodman S.L. Timpl R. Molecular & Cell Aspects of Basement Membranes. Academic Press, New York1993: 345-358Google Scholar). The mechanism of laminin-induced cell locomotion and the cellular receptors mediating the locomotor signals are, however, not known. Integrin- and non-integrin receptors are involved in the specific adhesion of cells to laminin. Dystroglycan, a 156-kDa protein forms a transmembrane linkage together with other proteins between laminin-2 and dystrophin in the muscle cell membrane(5.Gee S.H. Blacker R.W. Douville P.J. Provost P.R. Yurchenco P.D. Carbonetto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14972-14980Google Scholar); a high affinity laminin receptor of 67 kDa has been isolated from several tumor cells, myoblasts, and other primary cells (for reviews, see (6.Liotta L. Rao C.N. Wewer U.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1037-1057Google Scholar, 7.von der Mark K. Risse G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 490-507Google Scholar, 8.Sobel M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4/5: 311-318Google Scholar)). Five laminin-binding integrins of the β1 family recognize different sites and isoforms of laminin: α6β1 (9.Sonnenberg A. Modderman P.W. Hogervorst F. Nature. 1988; 336: 487-489Google Scholar, 10.Sonnenberg A. Linders C.J.T. Modderman P.W. Damsky C.H. Aumailley M. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2145-2155Google Scholar) and α7β1 (11.von der Mark H. Dürr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Google Scholar, 12.Kramer R.H. McDonald K.A. Wu M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15642-15649Google Scholar) bind to laminin-1, recognizing specifically the E8 domain; α1β1 binds to a cryptic site in the E1 region of laminin(13.Goodman S.L. Deutzmann R. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 589-598Google Scholar), but also to types I and IV collagen(14.Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Google Scholar). The α3β1 integrin binds to laminin-5 (kalinin) (15.Delwel G.O. deMelker A.A. Hogervorst F. Jaspars L.H. Fles D.L. Kuikman I. Lindblom A. Paulsson M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 203-215Google Scholar) and to other matrix proteins; α2β1 is predominantly a collagen receptor(16.Gullberg D. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12686-12694Google Scholar), but when isolated from endothelial cells it also binds to laminin-1(17.Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wagner E. Carter W. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 190: 2455-2462Google Scholar).While much has been published on the involvement of these receptors in cell adhesion, the role of the integrins in cell migration on laminin remains to be investigated. When murine skeletal myoblasts are plated on laminin-1-coated dishes, they respond rapidly in a characteristic manner by extending long cell processes and lamellopodia within 1 h, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of cell motility(18.Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 125: 158-169Google Scholar, 19.Goodman S.L. Risse G. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 799-809Google Scholar). The functional domain of laminin was restricted to the C-terminal elastase fragment E8; in contrast, fibronectin, collagens or the E1 fragment of laminin-1 do not support migration of murine myoblasts (18.Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 125: 158-169Google Scholar, 19.Goodman S.L. Risse G. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 799-809Google Scholar).The major laminin-binding integrin isolated from murine skeletal myoblasts is α7β1(11.von der Mark H. Dürr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Google Scholar, 20.Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufmann S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 643-659Google Scholar), which exists in three cytoplasmic and two extracellular splice variants(21.Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufmann S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Google Scholar, 22.Ziober B. Wu M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26773-26783Google Scholar). The predominant cytoplasmic splice variant of α7 integrin in fetal mouse muscle and proliferating myoblasts is the α7B form; α7A is expressed in adult skeletal muscle and myotubes(22.Ziober B. Wu M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26773-26783Google Scholar, 23.Collo G. Starr L. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19019-19024Google Scholar). We postulated that the α7•β1 complex mediates the multiple responses of myoblasts to laminin, including cell motility(11.von der Mark H. Dürr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Google Scholar).In order to elucidate the role of α7 integrin in cell locomotion, we expressed the full-length α7B cDNA in two cell lines, human 293 kidney cells and human 530 melanoma cells (24.Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Google Scholar) which are not motile on laminin. They do not express α7, but β1 integrin subunits(25.Bodary S.C. McLean J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5938-5941Google Scholar, 26.Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Google Scholar) which are necessary to form a heterodimeric complex on the cell surface. Here we show that, after transfection with α7B, both cell types gain motility on laminin and its E8 fragment severalfold over the mock-transfected or untransfected cells. Adhesion to laminin, however, was not affected significantly.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA full-length murine α7B integrin cDNA was generated which included parts of the 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions and the complete coding sequence(21.Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufmann S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Google Scholar, 22.Ziober B. Wu M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol.

For expression in human 293 kidney and 530 melanoma cells, it was positioned under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter within the episomal vector pCEP4 (Fig. 1). Expression of the α7 integrin message was measured by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). The α7-specific probe hybridized to a 4.1-kb α7 mRNA band in the RNA of murine C2C12 myoblasts, of 293-α7B and 530-α7B cells, but not to the RNA of mock-transfected cells or HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells.Figure 2:Analysis of α7 expression by Northern hybridization. RNA (12 μg each) from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, from cultured C2C12 myoblasts containing about 30% nuclei in myotubes, from 293 and 530 cells transfected with α7 cDNA (293EBNA-α7B and 530-α7B), or with the pCEP4 vector only (293EBNA-pCEP4 and 530-pCEP4) were separated by electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a murine α7 cDNA probe. Only C2C12 cells and the α7-transfected 293 and 530 cells show the 4.1-kb band characteristic for α7 mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Immunofluorescence staining with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant extracellular domain of α72 revealed high levels of surface fluorescence on 35% of the transfected 293 cells, a result which was confirmed by FACS analysis (Fig. 3 and Table 1). This indicated that the murine α7 chain must have associated with an endogenous human β-integrin chain to form heterodimeric complexes. When plated onto laminin-coated dishes, about 15% of the α7-transfected 293 cells assumed spindle shape, in contrast to mock-transfected cells which stayed round. The adhesion rates on laminin-1, its E8 fragment, or on fibronectin of α7- and mock-transfected cells did not differ significantly (Fig. 4). A dramatic difference, however, was seen when the locomotion of single cells was followed by time-lapse video microscopy, and paths were measured by a computer- assisted track analysis program: the motility of 293EBNA-α7B and 530-α7B cells on laminin or the E8 fragment was 8-10-fold enhanced as compared to untransfected or pCEP4-transfected cells (Fig. 5). More than 90% of the α7-transfected cells revealed a jerky, nondirected movement of cells by protruding lamellopodia and rapid retraction of the cell body into the extended filopodia. The path length of α7-transfected 293 cells after 15 h on laminin was up to 200 nm (Fig. 5). Locomotion over fibronectin was not altered.Figure 3:Surface expression of murine α7β1 integrin analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) after staining with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody raised against recombinant α7 integrin peptide. 293 kidney cells stably transfected with the α7B (293EBNA-α7B) or the vector alone (293EBNA-pCEP4) were stained at 4°C with the antibody, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig, and analyzed within 1 h. About 30-35% of the α7-transfected cells show strong surface fluorescence. - - -, nonimmune serum; -, α7 immune serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tabled 1Figure 4:Adhesion of α7- and mock-transfected 293 cells on surfaces coated with fibronectin (FN), laminin-1 (LN), and LN-E8 fragment. 96-well plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) were coated with serial dilutions of the proteins for 1 h at 37°C and blocked with heat-treated 2% BSA overnight. Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well. No significant differences in the adhesion rate after 1 h in relation to the substrate concentration was found for both cell lines. Adhesion rates were measured by colorimetric determination of endogenous hexosaminidase of the attached cells as described previously(16.Gullberg D. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12686-12694Google Scholar). ○-○, 293EBNA-α7B; •-•, 293EBNA-pCEP4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5:Videomicroscopy of α7- (293EBNA-α7B) and mock-transfected 293 kidney cells (293EBNA-pCEP4) (A) and 530 melanoma cells (B), locomoting over LN, FN, and LN-E8 fragment at 37°C. The tracks of single cells were followed and recorded by time-lapse videomicroscopy over 15 h. The paths of 10 cells each were normalized and converted to wind rose display (19.Goodman S.L. Risse G. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 799-809Google Scholar) where all cells start from the same point in order to illustrate the average motility.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The enhanced motility accompanying α7 expression was tolerant to the cell background. When α7 was transfected into human 530 melanoma cells, they also showed a significantly enhanced motility on laminin-1 or E8 (Fig. 5), even though the level of expression of α7 was considerably lower in the 530 cells than in the 293 cells that are stably transfected with EBNA. In comparison to 293 EBNA-α7 cells, hardly any surface fluorescence of α7 could be detected on transfected 530 cells, although the locomotory response of these cells to laminin was as pronounced as that of the transfected 293 cells (Fig. 5).The results of the α7 transfection on cell motility on laminin-coated surfaces were confirmed in a transmigration assay, using Boyden chambers with Nuclepore filter membranes coated with laminin-1 or fibronectin. About 104α7- or mock-transfected 293 cells in serum-free medium were placed in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate through the filters against a gradient of 5% fetal calf serum in the lower chamber(29.Albini A. Allavena G. Melchiori A. Giancotti F. Richter H. Comoglio P.M. Parodi S. Martin G.R. Tarone G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1867-1872Google Scholar). After 6 h, the cells appearing on the lower side of the filter were stained and counted. About 3 times as many α7-transfected cells had migrated through the laminin-coated filter in comparison to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6). On fibronectin-coated filters, there was no significant migration of both α7- and mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6); no migration of cells was observed on filters coated with BSA alone. These results confirmed the ability of α7 to enhance the motility of 293 cells not only on two-dimensional laminin surfaces, but also to specifically stimulate transmigration through laminin-coated filters.Figure 6:Transmigration of α7- and mock- transfected 293 cells through laminin-1 - and fibronectin-coated nuclepore filters in a Boyden chamber. 104 cells in serum-free medium were placed in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate into the lower chamber against a serum gradient. After 6 h, the cells on the lower side of the filter were stained and counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The ability of laminin to stimulate migration of cells in development and many pathological processes has received considerable attention in the past, in particular also in view of its role in promoting tumor cell invasion and metastasis(1.Liotta L.A. Invest. 1983; 49: 636-649Google Scholar, 2.Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1-7Google Scholar, 3.Albelda S.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 4-16Google Scholar). For example, lung colonization of B16 melanoma cells is enhanced by coinjection with laminin, and melanoma cells selected for attachment on laminin have a higher metastatic potential(1.Liotta L.A. Invest. 1983; 49: 636-649Google Scholar, 2.Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1-7Google Scholar). Each effect could conceivably be the result of motile induction which we show here can be triggered by α7 integrin.Our data indicate that α7β1 integrin is a laminin receptor involved in cell migration on laminin-1 and its E8 fragment, but not on fibronectin. It does not seem to play a crucial role in the adhesion of the transfected 293 or 530 cells to laminin-1 as no difference was seen in the adhesion behavior between α7-expressing and nonexpressing cells. In fact, there is no experimental evidence yet in the literature that α7 integrin is involved in cell adhesion to laminin. Up to now, no adhesion-blocking antibodies to α7 integrin are available. The best evidence for α7β1 integrin being a laminin receptor is the fact that it binds to laminin in vitro; thus, it has been isolated by affinity chromatography on laminin-1(11.von der Mark H. Dürr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Google Scholar, 30.Kramer R.H. Vu M.P. Cheng Y.-F. Ramos D.M. Timpl R. Waleh N. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 805-817Google Scholar). Other laminin-binding integrins or non-integrin laminin receptors seem responsible for the adhesion of 293 and 530 cells to laminin-1. Candidates are the α6 integrin which has been shown to mediate adhesion of several human tumor cells (10.Sonnenberg A. Linders C.J.T. Modderman P.W. Damsky C.H. Aumailley M. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2145-2155Google Scholar) and murine B16 melanoma (11.von der Mark H. Dürr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Google Scholar) to laminin-1; it is expressed by the kidney epithelial cell line 293 in small amounts(25.Bodary S.C. McLean J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5938-5941Google Scholar, 26.Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Google Scholar). Furthermore, embryonic kidney epithelial cells synthesize α-dystroglycan, a major laminin receptor of muscle cells binding to the E3 fragment of laminin(31.Durbeej M. Larsson E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 79-91Google Scholar).The locomotion of the α7-transfected cells shown in the lateral motility assay is not directed and appears random chemokinesis. Laminin has the ability to induce outgrowth of neurites (32.Van Evercooren A. Kleinman H.K. Ohno S. Merangos P. Schwartz J.P. Dubois-Dalq M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1982; 8: 179-194Google Scholar, 33.Rogers S.L. Letourneau P.C. Palm S.L. McCarthy J. Furcht L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 212-220Google Scholar) and of filopodia and lamellopodia, e.g. in Schwann cells (34.McGarvey M.L. van Evercooren A. Kleinmann H.K. Dubois-Dalq M. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 18-28Google Scholar) or myoblasts(18.Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 125: 158-169Google Scholar). The α7-transfected 293 cells showed enhanced outgrowth of cell processes and were more elongated on laminin than their mock-transfected counterparts (Table 1), indicating that α7 is responsible for this activity of laminin.Although α7 confers motility to such different cell types as kidney epithelial cells and melanoma cells, other cell types may utilize different integrins in migrating over laminin, and certainly when migrating over other matrix macromolecules (for review, see (41.Huttenlocher A. Sandberg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Google Scholar)). For example, the human melanoma cell BLM migrates over laminin and expresses α6 but not α7 integrin. 3S. Schöber et al., manuscript in preparation. Recently, Melchiori et al.(38.Melchiori A. Mortarini R. Carlone S. Marchisio P.C. Aninchini A. Noonan D. Albini A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 233-242Google Scholar) have shown that transmigration of human 2/14 melanoma cells through the pores of a Boyden chamber coated with basement membrane proteins, using fibronectin, collagen IV, or laminin as chemoattractants, is inhibited by antibodies to α3 and β1 integrin chains. Increased expression of α3β1 integrin has been also associated with enhanced tumor cell metastasis(39.Natali P.G. Nicotra M.R. Bartolazzi A. Cavaliere R. Bigotti A. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 68-72Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells utilize αvβ3 for migration on osteopontin(42.Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Google Scholar), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells use the same integrin for transmigration on collagen- or vitronectin-coated filters(43.Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Google Scholar). The migration of rhabdomyosarcoma cells through collagen gels was enhanced when cells were transfected with chimeric α2-chains carrying the cytoplasmic domain of α4 integrin(44.Chan B.M. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Google Scholar).Undirected migration of cells over matrix-coated surfaces, in the absence of any concentration gradient, was termed haptotaxis(35.McCarthy J.B. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 772-777Google Scholar, 36.McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1474-1480Google Scholar), in contrast to chemotaxis which was described for cells migrating against a gradient of laminin or fibronectin fragments(37.Mensing H. Albini A. Krieg T. Pontz B.F. Müller P.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 33: 43-48Google Scholar, 38.Melchiori A. Mortarini R. Carlone S. Marchisio P.C. Aninchini A. Noonan D. Albini A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 233-242Google Scholar). Transmigration of cells through capillaries, basement membranes of epithelial tumors, or the matrixcovered filter of a Boyden chamber is, however, a more complex event than lateral locomotion on laminin-coated surfaces and may involve also other matrix-induced events such as proliferation and synthesis of proteases (40.Werb I. Tremble P.M. Berendtzen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Google Scholar). Interestingly, transfection with α7 cDNA also stimulated the ability of 293 cells to transmigrate specifically through laminin-coated filters in the Boyden chamber assay. Migration rates through fibronectin-coated filters were much lower for both α7- and mock-transfected cells, but there was no stimulation after α7 transfection.The α7B splice variant is prominent in proliferating myoblasts and thus could play a role in myoblast migration in early embryonic development, e.g. during migration of myotome cells from the somites into the limb buds (45.Christ B. Jacob M. Jacob H.J. Anat. Embryol. 1983; 166: 87-101Google Scholar) or during muscle regeneration by satellite cells(46.Bischoff R. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 129-139Google Scholar). The rapid response of α7-transfected cells to laminin, e.g. cell elongation, outgrowth of lamellopodia, and locomotion within 1 h, offers the possibility to study the signal transduction mechanism of α7-mediated cell motility. Cell migration over solid substrates requires continuous membrane reshuffling from the trailing edge to the leading edge of the cell, and actin polymerization and depolymerization in the microfilaments in the tips of lamellopodia (47.Trinkaus J.P. Neurosci. Res. 1985; 13: 1-19Google Scholar). All these events involve protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The cytoplasmic domain of the α7B splice variant which was used in these experiments contains domains with homology to protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and two regions similar to a catalytic phosphotransfer domain and the ATP-binding domain of serine/threonine kinases(21.Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufmann S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Google Scholar). Whether this domain activates the focal adhesion kinase pp125PAK-mediated signal transduction pathway of other integrins (for reviews see (48.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar) and (49.Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Google Scholar)) remains to be investigated. Comparison of the α7B- and mock-transfected cells should now enable us to analyze the mechanism of laminin-induced cell locomotion. It will be interesting to see whether transfections with the α7A domain (21.Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufmann S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Google Scholar, 22.Ziober B. Wu M.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19019-19024Google Scholar) also enhance cell motility on laminin. INTRODUCTIONCells utilize extracellular matrix to migrate during embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and invasion of tissues in inflammation and tumor metastasis (reviewed in (1.Liotta L.A.

Laminin-1, a major glycoprotein of basement membranes, has been shown to promote migration of different cell types including neural crest cells(2.Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1-7Google Scholar), skeletal myoblasts(3.Albelda S.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 4-16Google Scholar), or B16 mouse melanoma cells(4.Goodman S.L. Timpl R.

The mechanism of laminin-induced cell locomotion and the cellular receptors mediating the locomotor signals are, however, not known. Integrin- and non-integrin receptors are involved in the specific adhesion of cells to laminin. Dystroglycan, a 156-kDa protein forms a transmembrane linkage together with other proteins between laminin-2 and dystrophin in the muscle cell membrane(5.Gee S.H. Blacker R.W. Douville P.J.

Deutzmann R. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 589-598Google Scholar), but also to types I and IV collagen(14.Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Google Scholar). The α3β1 integrin binds to laminin-5 (kalinin) (15.Delwel G.O. deMelker A.A. Hogervorst F. Jaspars L.H. Fles D.L. Kuikman I. Lindblom A. Paulsson M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12686-12694Google Scholar), but when isolated from endothelial cells it also binds to laminin-1(17.Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wagner E. Carter W. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 190: 2455-2462Google Scholar).While much has been published on the involvement of these receptors in cell adhesion, the role of the integrins in cell migration on laminin remains to be investigated. When murine skeletal myoblasts are plated on laminin-1-coated dishes, they respond rapidly in a characteristic manner by extending long cell processes and lamellopodia within 1 h, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of cell motility(18.Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 125: 158-169Google Scholar, 19.Goodman S.L. Risse G. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 799-809Google Scholar). The functional domain of laminin was restricted to the C-terminal elastase fragment E8; in contrast, fibronectin, collagens or the E1 fragment of laminin-1 do not support migration of murine myoblasts (18.Öcalan M. Goodman S.L. Kühl U. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 125: 158-169Google Scholar, 19.Goodman S.L. Risse G. von der Mark K. J.

The predominant cytoplasmic splice variant of α7 integrin in fetal mouse muscle and proliferating myoblasts is the α7B form; α7A is expressed in adult skeletal muscle and myotubes(22.Ziober B.

We postulated that the α7•β1 complex mediates the multiple responses of myoblasts to laminin, including cell motility(11.von der Mark H. Dürr J. Sonnenberg A. von der Mark K. Deutzmann R. Goodman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23593-23601Google Scholar).In order to elucidate the role of α7 integrin in cell locomotion, we expressed the full-length α7B cDNA in two cell lines, human 293 kidney cells and human 530 melanoma cells (24.Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Google Scholar) which are not motile on laminin. They do not express α7, but β1 integrin subunits(25.Bodary S.C. McLean J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5938-5941Google Scholar, 26.Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L.

Here we show that, after transfection with α7B, both cell types gain motility on laminin and its E8 fragment severalfold over the mock-transfected or untransfected cells.

Minus strand DNA synthesis is accompanied by cleavage of template viral RNA directed by RT positioned at the growing 3′ DNA end.

Using substrates having RNA primers annealed to circular DNA templates, we showed that cleavage can be independent of the presence of a DNA 3′ end and is directed by the 5′ RNA end. Overall, the results suggest that the RT initially binds an internal region of the hybrid and then is driven in the direction to encounter a 3′ DNA or 5′ RNA end, where it is positioned for catalysis by the strand end.

Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RTreverse transcriptaseHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus-1. catalyzes many essential steps required for viral replication. RT has been shown to possess DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, RNase H activity, strand transfer and strand displacement activities, all of which are essential to complete the process of conversion of single stranded viral RNA genome to double-stranded proviral DNA (reviewed by Goff(1990)). Because the RT is vital to the life cycle of the virus, it has been the target of chemotherapy. Biochemical properties of the RT are being examined in many laboratories in an effort to obtain information needed to design more effective antiviral drugs. reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus-1. The native enzyme is a heterodimer of 66- and 51-kDa subunits (diMarzo Veronese et al., 1986; Lightfoote et al., 1986). The amino-terminal region of each subunit harbors a polymerase domain, and the carboxyl terminus of only the larger subunit harbors the RNase H domain (Johnson et al., 1986). The absolute requirement of RT RNase H for retroviral replication has been established by mutational analysis (Repaske et al., 1989; Tanese and Goff, 1988). RNase H activity has been shown to catalyze the necessary destruction of the plus strand RNA and the tRNA primer, and the generation and removal of the polypurine tract plus strand primer (for a review, see Champoux(1993) and Telenitsky and Goff(1993)). RNase H activity has also been demonstrated to be required for the strand transfer reactions needed in the replication cycle (Cirino et al., 1995; DeStefano et al., 1992; DeStefano et al., 1994b; Ghosh et al., 1995; Peliska and Benkovic, 1992). Several studies have shed light on the mechanism by which the RT uses its RNase H activity for the removal of the plus strand RNA during and after minus strand DNA synthesis (DeStefano et al., 1991a, 1993, 1994a; Schatz et al., 1990; Gopalakrishnan et al., 1992; Fu and Taylor, 1992; Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Huber et al., 1989; Krug and Berger, 1989; Wöhrl and Moelling, 1990). We and others have employed substrates that resemble intermediates of minus strand DNA synthesis. Results show that the RT makes initial cleavages of template RNA about 14-18 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ hydroxyl of a DNA primer (DeStefano et al., 1991b; Gopalakrishnan et al., 1992; Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Ghosh et al., 1995;, Schatz et al., 1990; Zhan et al., 1994). These are followed by additional cleavages in the direction of the primer terminus. Crystallographic studies show that the polymerase and RNase H active sites of the RT are separated by a distance of about 20 nucleotides (Jacobo-Molina et al., 1993; Kohlstaedt et al., 1992), suggesting that interaction of the polymerase active site with the primer template determines the positioning of the RNase H active site. RNase H activity that accompanies minus strand DNA synthesis directed from the growing 3′ hydroxyl of the DNA primer was termed “polymerase-dependent” (Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Peliska and Benkovic, 1992). A “polymerase-independent” mode of RNase H activity has been implicated for cleavages not mediated by the 3′ OH of the DNA primer (Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Peliska and Benkovic, 1992). Biochemical analyses indicate that polymerase-dependent RNase H activity does not completely degrade the plus strand RNA during minus strand DNA synthesis, but produces RNA oligomers, many of which are long enough to remain bound to the newly synthesized DNA (DeStefano et al., 1991b; DeStefano et al., 1994a; Dudding et al., 1991; Kati et al., 1992). These RNA segments must then be removed by RTs that act after passage of the growing minus strand DNA primer. Examining the action of RTs on such substrates, i.e. RNA oligomers annealed to longer DNAs, we found that the positions of initial cleavage are about 18 nucleotides from the 5′ end of RNA (DeStefano et al., 1993). Again, this distance suggests that the separation between the catalytic sites on the RT is determining the positioning of the RNase H. We proposed that the 5′ end of the RNA fixed the position of the polymerase active site as indicated in Fig. 1, model A (DeStefano et al., 1993). This differs from positioning which is apparently caused by the high affinity of the polymerase active site for the 3′ end of a DNA primer (Fig. 1, model B). However, there is no obvious reason why the polymerase active site would be expected to have an affinity for the 5′ end of the RNA. In this paper we investigate the possibility that the structure of the RNA-DNA hybrid region of the substrate, rather than the termini of the RNA or DNA strands, is the major determinant of RT positioning. We propose that the RT could first position at the 3′ end of the DNA, and then slide to the nearest region of hybrid (Fig. 1, model C). This would give the impression that the 5′ end of the RNA determines positioning, when it actually does not. Results presented here distinguish the influence of the RNA end structure versus the hybrid region structure on positioning of the RT. Recombinant HIV-RT in its native form was graciously provided to us by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This heterodimer RT has a specific activity of approximately 40,000 units/mg. One unit of RT is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into poly(rA)-oligo(dT) template in 10 min at 37°C. Aliquots of RT were stored frozen at −70°C, and fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. DNase I, dNTPs, alkaline phosphatase, rNTPs, RNase inhibitor, T7 RNA polymerase, and quick spin gel filtration columns were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Radio nucleotides were from DuPont NEN. Plasmids pBS+ and pBS+(Δ) have been previously described (DeStefano et al., 1992). Two RNA templates, 142 and 189 nucleotides in length, were generated by run-off transcription by T7 RNA polymerase from plasmids pBS(Δ) and pBS+, respectively, following digestion by BstNI. A 41-nucleotide-long RNA substrate was also generated by a similar procedure following restriction digestion of plasmid pBS+ with AccI. Dephosphorylation of RNA molecules was carried out using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. These were then 5′ end-labeled when required with [γ-32P]ATP(3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Following this, the RNA samples were purified by gel electrophoresis, subsequently eluted, and quantitated by gel “shift-up” assays using primers of known concentrations as described previously (DeStefano et al., 1993; Palaniappan et al., 1995). A deletion of either 9 or 27 nucleotides immediately following the T7 promoter region in the parent phagemid pBS+ was accomplished by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985; Kunkel et al., 1987), and the resulting variants were referred to as pCP1 and pCP2, respectively. Construction of these phagemids allowed us to anneal the 189-mer RNA generated from the parent plasmid to the single stranded circular pCP1 and pCP2 DNA with 9- and 27-nucleotide 5′ unannealed RNA tails (Fig. 2). Annealing of RNA and DNA was performed in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 80 mM KCl. Components were mixed, heated to 60°C for 10 min, and slow cooled over a 90-min period. Excess primer was removed by gel filtration spin chromatography. Hybrids were analyzed by either native polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure the absence of excess unannealed primers. In some cases, hybrids were cut from the gels to be used in experiments. Escherichia coli RNase H was used when required to establish the presence of RNA-DNA hybrids. The presence of an f1 origin of replication in parent plasmid pBS+ as well the constructs pBS(Δ), pCP1, and pCP2 enabled us to prepare single-stranded plasmid DNA by adapting the procedure from the Promega application guide. Final reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM EDTA, 34 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 nM substrate, and varying amounts of HIV-1 RT. In all cases the enzyme was allowed to prebind to the substrate for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was initiated with MgCl2, allowed to incubate for 15 min and terminated with 25 μl of 2 × termination mix. For time course analysis, a mixture of all components except MgCl2 was prepared. Subsequent to the initiation of reaction with MgCl2 at 37°C, 25-μl aliquots were drawn at varying time intervals and quenched by adding an equal volume of the 2 × termination mixture (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanole and bromphenol blue). Samples of 8 μl were then subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis to resolve reaction products. The gels were then vacuum dried and subjected to autoradiography employing standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). RNA molecular markers were made either by alkaline treatment of 5′-labeled RNA substrates to generate a nucleotide hydrolysis ladder or RNase T1 treatment to generate a G-ladder as described in the protocols supplied with the Pharmacia RNA sequencing kit. HindIII-digested fragments of plasmid pBR322 (Life Technologies, Inc.), which were labeled at the 5′ end, were also run in each gel as additional size markers. The nucleotide sequences of the 189 and 142 RNAs generated from pBS+ and pBS(Δ) are as follows: 5′-GGGCG AAUUCGAGCU CGGUACCCGG GGAUCCUCUA GAGUCGACCU GCAGGCAUGC AAGCUUUUGU UCCCUUUAGU GAGGGUUAAU UCCGAGCUUG GCGUAAUCAU GGUCAUAGCU GUUUCCUGUG UGAAAUUGUU AUCCGCUCAC AAUUCCACAC AACAUACGAG CCGGAACCAU AAAGUGUAAA GCCU and 5′-GGGCGAAU UAGCUUUUGU UCCCUUUAGU GAGGGUUAAU UCCGAGCUUG GCGUAAUCAU GGUCAUAGCU GUUUCCUGUG UGAAAUUGUU AUCCGCUCAC AAUUCCACAC AACAUACGAG CCGGAACCAU AAAGUGUAAA GCCU.

DNA template 1 is 5′-ATGCTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCCATGGTCATAGCTGTT; DNA template 2 is 5′-ATGCTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGCCCGCTGTT. The position of primary RNase H-directed cleavage of short RNA primers on longer DNA templates may be determined by the tendency of the RT to bind a region of RNA/DNA hybrid, nearest to the 3′ end of the DNA strand. If so, the location of the 5′ end of the RNA strand would not determine the binding position of the RT. A 41-mer RNA transcript (primer 1) was generated from plasmid pBS+ subsequent to digestion by AccI. The transcript was 5′-labeled and quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transcript was annealed to either template 1 or template 2 DNAs, both of which are 47 nucleotides in length. Primer 1 annealed completely to template 1 such that the 5′ end was recessed on the template DNA, producing substrate A (Fig. 2). Primer 1 partly annealed to template 2, but with a 10-nucleotide-long unannealed 5′ RNA tail, to make substrate B (Fig. 2). We expected to see primary and secondary cleavage products 28 and 20 nucleotides in length, respectively, with substrate B, if hybrid helical structure positioned the RT for cleavage as proposed in Fig. 1, model C. The anticipated primary and secondary cleavage product lengths with substrate A should be about 18 and 10 nucleotides measured from the RNA 5′ end as previously observed (DeStefano et al., 1993) and as proposed in Fig. 1, model A. Comparison of cleavage products from substrate A and substrate B, with varying amounts of RT ranging from 0.2 to 8 units after a 15-min incubation period are presented in Fig. 3. Substrate A, when subjected to HIV-RT RNase H-mediated cleavages, underwent both primary and secondary cleavages at the previously observed positions of 18 and 10 nucleotides, respectively, measured from the 5′ terminus of RNA. Since with substrate A both the primary and the secondary cleavages were complete in the 15-min reaction time, the predominant products observable were 9-10 nucleotides long (Fig. 3, right panel, lanes 9-12). However, with substrate B the only products that appeared were cleaved 18 nucleotides from the 5′ end of RNA (Fig. 3, left panel, lanes 3-6). There were no other observable products even after long autoradiographic exposures. Cleavage directed from the point of hybridization should have yielded products 28 and 20 nucleotides in length, but these were totally absent. Quantitation of primer 1 using PhosphorImager(™) analysis showed that the amount of cleavage at any RT concentration was about the same in substrates A versus B (Fig. 3, compare the disappearance of the 41-mer in lanes 3-6 with lanes 9-12, respectively). Therefore, differences observed in product distribution did not result from fundamental differences in the sensitivity of the two substrates to cleavage. Contrary to our anticipation that the point of hybridization determines or influences the positional cleavage by RT, the products obtained from gel electrophoresis analysis indicate that the 5′ terminus of the RNA is a primary determinant. Influence of the 5′ end predominates even if it is not annealed! Cleavage of substrate B also consisted of only primary products (Fig. 3, compare amounts of 18-nucleotide products). This was probably because, following the initial cleavage at about 18 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the RNA on substrate B, the cleaved product had such a short region of complementarity with the template that it dissociated before secondary cleavage could occur. E. coli RNase H was employed to demonstrate the presence of RNA/DNA hybrid in substrates A and B (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 7). E. coli RNase H cleavage does not follow the cleavage pattern of HIV-1 RT. Additionally, the presence of a product of 16 nucleotides in length following E. coli RNase H treatment of substrate B demonstrates that the tail region of substrate B does not undergo cleavage, and therefore is unannealed (Fig. 3, left panel, lane 1). Substrates A and B were cleaved over a time course to compare the rates of the reactions (Fig. 4). Initial cleavage of primer 1 was evident in both substrates by 15 s. The appearance of secondary cleavage products of substrate A, with a concomitant disappearance of primary products, was evident starting at about 1 min (Fig. 4, right panel, lanes marked 1 min to 16 min). However, consistent with above results, secondary products from substrate B were not observable (Fig. 4, left panel, lanes marked 0.25 min to 16 min). In general, irrespective of the tailed structure of substrate B, both substrates were cleaved with nearly identical kinetics. The surprising observation that an unannealed 5′ RNA end could determine RNase H cleavage specificity prompted us to question whether an unannealed 3′ DNA end could have a similar influence on mode B cleavage (Fig. 1). The template used was a 142-mer RNA labeled at the 5′ end (template 3). A 20-nucleotide-long DNA (primer 3) was annealed with perfect complementarity to template 3 to generate substrate C (Fig. 2). Substrate D was generated by annealing a 26-nucleotide long DNA (primer 4) to template 3. Substrate D was identical to substrate C, except that the DNA primer, although annealed to the same 20-nucleotide region as primer 3, also had a 6-nucleotide-long unannealed 3′ tail. Primary and secondary RNA cleavage products resulting from the action of RT on substrate C were anticipated to be about 102 and 94 nucleotides long, respectively. These products would result from the expected cleavages measured from the 3′ end of the recessed DNA primer as in our previous studies (DeStefano et al., 1991b). With substrate D, if the point of hybridization determined the position of cleavage, the same length RNA products should be observed. However, if the DNA 3′ end positioned the RT for cleavage, products 6 nucleotides shorter (96 and 88) should be seen. Cleavage of substrates C and D over a range of RT concentrations is shown in Fig. 5. After 15 min, both substrates C and D sustained some cuts even at the lowest RT concentration tested, and both appeared similarly sensitive to cleavage as the concentration was raised. With both substrates, however, the predominant products observed were the secondary cleavage products at 94 nucleotides. There were also some minor residual primary cleavage products visible with substrate C (Fig. 5, left panel, lanes 1-5). Importantly, the appearance of cleavage products of same sizes with substrates C and D suggests that the enzyme measures the distance from the point of hybridization, indicating that helical structure does influence cleavage position on hybrids with recessed DNA oligomers. Kinetics of cleavage of substrates C and D was performed to determine whether the cleavage process proceeded in normal fashion from primary to secondary positions (Fig. 6). With substrate C, the primary cleavage is evident as early as 15 s (Fig. 6, left panel, lanes marked 0.25 min and above). Over the reaction period most of the primary cleavage products disappear with a simultaneous increase in secondary cleavage products. PhosphorImager quantitation reveals that about 90% of RNA sustained cleavages as early as 15 s (Fig. 6, left panel, compare 0′ time point with 0.25 min). Very few secondary products are seen up to about 1 min into the reaction period. Secondary cleavage products continued to accumulate and reached maximum levels at 16 min. With substrate D, the same progression of cleavages, first to the 102-mer and then the 94-mer, is evident but over a shorter time frame (Fig. 6). The kinetic profile further supports the importance of the hybrid region in positioning the RT. It also shows that the presence of the 3′ unannealed tail on this substrate actually improves the ability of the primer-template to act as a substrate. Results so far suggested that the 5′ terminus of recessed RNA on a RNA/DNA hybrid plays an essential role in positioning of RT-directed cleavages. Although we anticipated 3′ DNA terminus would have a similar influence when recessed on RNA, the above experiments yielded surprising results emphasizing the importance of hybrid helical structure. We next determined whether the 3′ DNA end had any influence on cleavage of recessed RNAs, such as providing a site for RT loading as in mode C (Fig. 1). The experiment involved measuring cleavage specificity of hybrid substrates lacking a DNA 3′ terminus, a structure obtained by using a circular DNA. Single-stranded circular DNAs from plasmids pBS+ and pCP1 were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and annealed to the 5′-labeled 189-mer RNA to generate substrates E and F (see Fig. 2). The 189-mer RNA annealed completely to its circular SS pBS+ DNA template in substrate E, but had a 9-nucleotide tail at its 5′ end when bound to pCP1 resulting in substrate F. Both substrates were cleaved efficiently by RT (Fig. 7), demonstrating that the 3′ end of the DNA is not needed for entry or positioning for cleavage. As before, cleavage occurred at the expected distances, 18 and 9 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the RNA, whether that end was annealed or not. The low level of secondary cleavage with the tailed RNA could again be attributed to dissociation of the RNA product after primary cleavage reduced its annealed region. The characteristic RT RNase H cleavages observed on substrate E, wherein there is no free 3′ DNA end demonstrates the existence of “polymerase-independent mode” of RNase H cleavages as originally proposed (Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Peliska and Benkovic, 1992). The only difference in nuclease action between the two substrates was that the tailed substrate in this case required a higher level of enzyme for the same amount of cleavage (Fig. 7, compare lanes 1-3 with 7-9, respectively.). Since the unhybridized 5′ tail in substrate F was only 9 nucleotides long, there was a possibility that the transient hybridization during the course of the reaction promoted by an annealing activity of RT held down the non-complementary region against the template, allowing the RT to measure from the 5′ end to fix the position of cleavage. We reasoned that a substrate in which the tail at the 5′ end of RNA exceeds the normal 18-nucleotide spanning distance from 5′ end to the cleavage site, would not support terminus-directed cleavages. To test this we employed substrate G, in which the 189-mer RNA primer was annealed to a circular template, such that it had a 27-nucleotide-long 5′-unannealed tail (Fig. 2). Cleavage of substrates E and G by various concentrations of RT RNase H were compared (Fig. 8). Even at the highest enzyme concentrations tested, the 189-mer RNA in substrate G underwent virtually no cleavage (Fig. 8, right panel, lanes 8-12). However, as before, the 189-mer RNA in substrate E was cleaved effectively even at relatively low RT concentrations (Fig. 8, left panel, lanes 1-5). The presence of hybrid RNA/DNA substrates was established both by treatment with E. coli RNase H (Fig. 8, lanes 7 and 14) and by a separate native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The insensitivity of substrate G clearly demonstrates that a sufficiently long 5′ unannealed tail prevents the 5′ RNA end from exerting a necessary influence on the positioning of the RT for cleavage. The result is a clear demonstration of the inability of helical structure alone to direct the cleavage reaction. We considered the possibility that although a 5′ RNA end is required for cleavage of an RNA primer on a DNA template, the helical structure still has an influence on positioning of the RT. To test this, we constructed a substrate with an RNA primer having an unannealed loop (Fig. 2, substrate H). Starting at the 5′ end, the RNA primer had a complementary region of 9 nucleotides, followed by a noncomplementary region of 40 nucleotides before complementation resumed and continued to the 3′ end. Remarkably, the presence of the 9 5′ end complementary nucleotides promoted the formation of primary and secondary cleavage products 18 and 9 nucleotides in length (Fig. 9, lanes 1, 2, and 4). This suggests that guided by 5′ complementarity, the RNase H portion of the RT can orient noncomplementary RNA and DNA strands in its active site such that catalysis is achieved. An additional surprise was a class of cleavage products 69 and 61 nucleotides in length (Fig. 9, left panel, lanes 1, 2, and 4). These appear to derive from positioning of the polymerase active site at the 3′ side of the loop, and then measurement of the usual 18 nucleotide distance to the RNase H site. This indicates that the beginning of the RNA/DNA hybrid structure was the determinant of the position of cleavage. These observations present a complicated picture. The results show that cleavage directed from the point of hybridization is possible but can only be facilitated by the presence of a hybridized 5′ RNA terminus. They emphasize the essential role of the 5′ RNA end, but also a potentially important role for helical structure. We have examined the role of RNA/DNA hybrid structure versus the location of the ends of the RNA and DNA strands in the determination of HIV-RT-mediated RNase H cleavage specificity. In previous work, RT positioning either at the 3′ end of a DNA primer on an RNA template, or the 5′ end of an RNA primer on a DNA template was found to be important for the RNA cleavage specificity (DeStefano et al., 1991a, 1994a; Gopalakrishnan et al., 1992; Ghosh et al., 1995; Schatz et al., 1990; Zhan et al., 1994). Since RT has to extend the DNA primer during minus strand DNA synthesis, it is easy to envision RT binding to the 3′ end of the DNA strand, and thereby mediating RNA cleavage of the template RNA at a distance determined by the spatial separation of active sites. It is more difficult to imagine why the 5′ RNA end influences the RT positioning on substrates with recessed RNA primers on DNA templates. As a unified explanation for these observations, we proposed an alternative model whereby the structure of the hybrid influences or determines RT RNase H cleavages as proposed in Fig. 1, model C. In this model the RT binds the RNA/DNA hybrid region as close as possible to the 3′ end of the DNA strand and the 5′ end of the RNA strand. This, of course, is the same end of the duplex in either case. However, if the DNA is recessed on the RNA, the RT would contact the DNA 3′ end, whereas if the RNA is recessed on the DNA the RT would contact the RNA 5′ end. The model also suggests initial binding to the 3′ DNA end as a means for the RT to load onto the substrate. We originally anticipated that the helical structure of the substrate would have a dominant role in the positioning of the RT when it was binding over the 5′ end of a recessed RNA. To our surprise, the 5′ RNA end has a predominant influence on positioning the RT. This was revealed by comparison of substrates having an RNA primer annealed completely to the template DNA, with substrates having an unannealed 5′ RNA (Fig. 3). For unannealed regions up to 10 nucleotides long, cleavage continued to be measured from the 5′ RNA end. There was no apparent influence of the hybrid region. When the unannealed region was 27 nucleotides long, cleavage was inhibited (Fig. 8). This suggested that the RT could “hold down” a short unannealed region to make the measurement, but was frustrated by a longer region. By careful primer-template design, however, we could still observe a positioning effect of the helical region. The substrate in question had an RNA primer with an internal unannealed loop. The DNA template was circular to eliminate possible influence of the 3′ end of the DNA template. In this case, the patterns of cleavages indicated that some RTs positioned at the RNA 5′ ends, but others bound the hybrid adjacent to the loop. This latter positioning suggests that the RT could sense the helix orientation, and tried to position as close as possible to the 5′ RNA and 3′ DNA ends. However, it could not pass the unannealed region and stopped just next to it. The results of this experiment imply that the RT might bind the hybrid at any point and move in the direction of the 5′ RNA and 3′ DNA ends. However, we do not have direct experimental evidence for a movement process. Also, the means by which the RT downstream of the loop can sense the annealed 5′ RNA end is a mystery. An additional surprising observation was that short unannealed 3′ end regions of a DNA primer on an RNA template relinquished their influence on RT positioning. In this case, the helical region dominated the binding location of the RT. In fact, use of circular DNA templates indicates that the presence of a DNA end on the substrate is not a requirement for RT binding or positioning for RNase H activity. This result demonstrates that our mode C model is overly complicated. The RT does not need to first bind a DNA 3′ end and then move to the hybrid region. It can bind and position itself through the use of the helix, and the 5′ RNA end. When an RNA primer with a long 5′ tail was annealed to a circular DNA template, no cleavage occurred. This shows that in the absence of a DNA 3′ end, an RNA end, either annealed or with a sufficiently short unannealed region, is necessary for cleavage. Although on our template with a looped primer (substrate H) we observed cleavage indicative of positioning by helix structure, cleavage was possible only in the presence of an annealed 5′ RNA end. This shows a role of hybrid structure in the determination of cleavage specificity, but clearly a critical determinant is the 5′ annealed RNA end. Overall, we have found that the positions of HIV-RT RNase H cleavage of RNA/DNA hybrid structures present during viral replication are determined by the location of strand ends, and by the helical structure of the hybrid. Cleavage of RNA on a substrate with a recessed DNA primer on an RNA template is directed by the binding of the polymerase active site to the DNA 3′ end. This is the normal binding configuration of the RT during minus strand viral synthesis. Results presented here show that in the absence of a fully annealed DNA 3′ end the RT still positions on the hybrid as close as possible to the DNA 3′ end. This suggests that the hybrid structure influences the RT to preferentially bind, and possibly move to, the correct position for minus strand synthesis and accompanying RNA template cleavage. The RT is also expected to cleave short RNAs left annealed to the newly synthesized minus strand. A surprising finding was that the 5′ ends of short RNAs annealed to DNA are a major determinant of the positioning of the RT for such cleavage. We also detected an influence of the helical structure to position the RT as close as possible to the 5′ ends of these RNA primers. Possibly, in both cases, the role of the helix binding specificity is to direct a movement of bound RT to the appropriate strand end for catalysis. The reason for the high specificity of the RT to measure cleavages from 5′ RNA end remains elusive. It may simply have evolved to be the means by which short RNA primers are recognized for binding and cleavage. We thank Drs. John McCoy and Jasbir Seehra of Genetics Institute for their generous gift of HIV-1 RT. We also thank Weimin Wu for helpful discussions."

Price M. de Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Google Scholar) that binds to the promoters of thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroperoxidase (TPO) genes, whose expression is restricted to the thyroid follicular cells(2.Musti A.M.

Biochem. 1990; 193: 311-318Google Scholar). Transactivation studies demonstrated that TTF-1 is able to activate transcription from co-transfected thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase promoters in non-thyroid cells, suggesting that TTF-1 may play an important role in the transcriptional activation of thyroid-specific genes during development(4.Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Google Scholar, 5.De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar). However, the presence of TTF-1 protein does not always correlate with active transcription of Tg and TPO genes, as TTF-1 has been demonstrated in tissues other than thyroid, where no Tg and TPO mRNA could be detected. Furthermore, TTF-1 protein has been detected very early during thyroid development, 5 days before the appearance of Tg and TPO mRNAs(6.Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Google Scholar). These data indicate that, in physiological conditions, TTF-1 is not sufficient to activate transcription of thyroid-specific genes. Such a notion is strongly supported by the observation that transgenic mouse lines carrying a thyroglobulin promoter fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene express the reporter only in thyroid, again indicating that TTF-1 present in other tissues is unable to activate the Tg promoter(7.Ledent C. Parmentier M. Vassart G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6176-6180Google Scholar). Interestingly, the promoters of the surfactant protein B and A genes, exclusively expressed in lung, have been demonstrated to depend on TTF-1 for expression(8.Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A.

Phosphorylation is perhaps the most frequent post-translational modification of those proteins whose activity is regulated in response to changes in metabolic activity, environmental conditions, and hormonal signals. Many transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation through several distinct mechanisms (10.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Google Scholar, 11.Jackson S.P.

Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Google Scholar) that can affect either their DNA binding or their transcriptional activity. We have previously demonstrated that, in the rat thyroid cell line FRTL-5, TTF-1 is phosphorylated(14.Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. De Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a Ha-ras-transformed FRTL-5 cells TTF-1 has been demonstrated to be underphosphorylated and unable to activate transcription, suggesting that phosphorylation could be an important mechanism in controlling TTF-1 activity(14.Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. De Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that Ki-ras reduces the capacity of TTF-1 to bind to DNA via a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism(15.Avvedimento E.V. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Google Scholar). We report in this study the mapping of TTF-1 phosphorylation sites. TTF-1 mutants unable to be phosphorylated show normal levels of DNA binding and transcriptional activity in heterologous cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of TTF-1 may have an important role only in specific cell types. Two primers (start) CCCGGGAAGCTTCTCCACTCAAGCCAATTAAGGCGG and (end) GCGCGCTCTAGAGAGCAGCGGGCGAATGGTGG were used to specifically amplify the entire coding region of TTF-1 by polymerase chain reaction. HindIII and XbaI sites, respectively, were included in these primers to facilitate cloning. Specific serine codons were changed to alanine codons by polymerase chain reaction as described previously, using primers containing the specific mutations, together with (start) and (end) primers. The amplified products were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector Rc/CMV (Invitrogen). Finally, restriction fragments containing the serine-alanine substitutions were excised and subcloned in CMV/TTF-1, D14, or D26, described in De Felice et al.(5.De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M.

The FRTL-5 cell line has been previously described in detail(16.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Coon H.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 10: 163-172Google Scholar). Briefly, FRTL-5 cells were grown in Coon's modified F-12 medium (Seromed) supplemented with 5% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and six growth factors as described by Ambesi-Impiombato and Coon(16.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Coon H.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 10: 163-172Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient expression assays, before the in vivo labeling, cells were plated at 8 × 105/100-mm diameter tissue culture dish 1 day prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique as described elsewhere(4.Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, an excess of TTF-1 antibody (6.Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Google Scholar) was added, and immune complexes were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Blocking experiments were performed by preincubation of the anti-peptides antibody with an excess of the corresponding synthetic antigenic peptide. Bound proteins were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by electrophoresis in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-10% PAGE). Labeling of HeLa cells was performed in a similar manner. The cells were transfected with 15 μg of the expression vectors carrying either wild-type TTF-1 or the deletion and point mutants, and after 36 h the cells were labeled and immunoprecipitated as above. For pulse-chase experiments, FRTL-5 or transfected HeLa cells were labeled in methionine-free DMEM containing 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine for 1 h (pulse), the medium was then removed, and the cells were incubated in DMEM containing an 100-fold excess of nonradioactive methionine (chase). For Western blot analysis, the samples were electroblotted onto Immobilon membrane after SDS-PAGE, the blots were probed with the same TTF-1 antibody used in immunoprecipitation, and the immunocomplexes were identified by ECL (Amersham Corp.). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to a brief autoradiography, and the 32P-labeled TTF-1 band was excised and eluted from the acrylamide. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping by two-dimensional separation on thin layer cellulose plates were carried out as described elsewhere(20.Boyle W.J. Geer P.v. d. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). For gel shift assays, binding reactions were carried out by incubating the proteins for 45 min in binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 75 mM KCl, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 μg/ml poly(dI•dC) in a 20-μl final volume) containing increasing concentrations of labeled oligonucleotide C. Bound and free DNA were visualized by autoradiography, and the data obtained from each titration were plotted in graphs. The following equilibrium equation was fitted to the data by nonlinear least-squares in order to calculate KD: [bound] = Po•KD-1•[free]/(1 + KD-1•[free]), where Po is the total concentration of TTF-1, KD is the dissociation constant, and [bound] and [free] are the concentrations of the bound and free oligonucleotide C probe, respectively. Purified TTF-1 from E. coli was used for in vitro labeling with protein kinase C. Phosphorylation conditions were the following. The reaction was carried out in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 μM phospholipids (phosphatidylserine and diolein), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 microunits of the kinase in each sample. Protein kinase C from rat brain was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. After labeling, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. FRTL-5 cells and HeLa cells, transiently transfected with a TTF-1 expression vector, were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and TTF-1 was immunoprecipitated from whole cells extracts by means of a specific anti-peptide antibody. After electrophoresis and autoradiography, TTF-1 was detected as a band of the expected molecular mass (∼43 kDa) (Fig. 1, Panel A, lanes 1 and 3). The specificity of the immunoprecipitate was demonstrated by competition experiments performed in the presence of an excess of the TTF-1 peptide used for immunization (lanes 2 and 4). When TTF-1 was revealed by Western blot in extracts from FRTL-5 and transfected HeLa cells, a similar TTF-1 doublet was detected in both cell lines (Fig. 1, Panel A, lanes 5 and 6). To determine the amino acid residue(s) involved in phosphorylation, immunoprecipitated, 32P-labeled TTF-1 from both FRTL-5 and transfected HeLa cells was acid-hydrolyzed and subjected to thin layer electrophoresis/chromatography. In both cell lines, the result indicated that TTF-1 is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 1, Panel B). Furthermore, the labeled TTF-1 band, eluted from the acrylamide gel after immunoprecipitation, was extensively digested with trypsin, and the resulting phosphopeptides were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis/chromatography (Fig. 1, Panel C). Three similar phosphopeptides could be detected (numbered 1, 2, and 3) whose identity in the two cell lines used was confirmed by mixing experiments (data not shown). These results validate the use of HeLa cells as an heterologous expression system for the study of TTF-1 phosphorylation. In order to map the phosphorylated serine residues in TTF-1, a series of deletion and point mutation constructs were generated. Preliminary experiments using deletion mutants allowed us to localize the phosphorylated residues in two regions, one near the amino terminus of TTF-1 and the second on the carboxyl-terminal side of the homeodomain (data not shown). We then focused on these regions and mutagenized the codons for those serine residues that, on the basis of their sequence context, were candidate phosphorylation sites, to alanine codons (Fig. 2, Panel A). The resulting mutant proteins were expressed in HeLa cells, metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to examine their level of phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, P-32). The presence of comparable levels of TTF-1 in the different transfections was monitored by Western blot (Fig. 2B, WB). A schematic drawing of the most relevant mutants and their phosphorylation level is shown in Fig. 2, Panels A and B, respectively. Deletion mutant D14, that lacks all the region on the carboxyl-terminal side of TTF-1 homeodomain, is phosphorylated, but replacement of serines 4, 12, 18, and 23 with alanines (mutant DS40) results in a complete loss of phosphorylation, indicating that one or more of these serines are the substrate for protein kinases. Mutant DS41 encodes for a TTF-1 mutated at the amino terminus as DS40 and deleted of residues 221-294 at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Hence, DS41 phosphorylation must be located among residues 295-372. Mutations of codons for serines 328 and 337 within this region results in a loss of phosphorylation, thus allowing the identification of these two additional phosphorylation sites. Mutant S61 encodes a full-length TTF-1 protein containing Ser to Ala substitutions at residues 4, 12, 18, 23, 328, and 337. (Hence S61 cannot be phosphorylated at neither of the two previously identified sites.) Since S61 is phosphorylated, additional site(s) must exist among residues 221-294, in the region immediately downstream the homeodomain. Substitution of serine 255 with an alanine residue generates a full-length protein, named S80, completely unable to incorporate inorganic 32P. A summary of all the mapped phosphoserines is shown in Fig. 2, Panel C. From this mutagenesis study we can conclude that the identified 7 serines are the major phosphorylation sites of TTF-1. Even though none of the mapped phosphorylation sites lies in the DNA-binding domain of TTF-1, we asked whether the ability of TTF-1 to bind to its target sequence could depend upon phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, purified TTF-1 made in HeLa cells (Fig. 3, Panel A), purified TTF-1 produced in E. coli (Fig. 3, Panel B), total extracts of HeLa cells expressing either wild-type TTF-1 or mutant S80 (Fig. 3, Panels C and D, respectively), and FRTL-5 nuclear extract (Fig. 3, Panel E) were compared for their affinity toward the oligonucleotide C, containing a high affinity TTF-1 binding site(17.Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Google Scholar). The amount of TTF-1 from different sources has been previously normalized by silver staining for the purified proteins and by Western blot for the extracts (data not shown). From the data shown in Fig. 3 it is evident that none of the Ala to Ser replacements has an effect on TTF-1 binding activity (Fig. 3, Panels C and D). Furthermore, bacterial TTF-1 shows the same affinity toward the C oligonucleotide as the protein purified from HeLa cells or that present in FRTL-5 nuclear extract (Fig. 3, Panels A, B, and E). Taken together these experiments suggest that phosphorylation does not directly influence the ability of TTF-1 to bind DNA. We next approached the question of whether phosphorylation modulates the ability of TTF-1 to activate transcription. To this end, several expression vectors encoding either wild-type or mutated TTF-1 and a reporter gene under the control of the Tg promoter were co-transfected in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4, all TTF-1 mutants were able to activate transcription as well as the wild-type protein. We conclude that in heterologous HeLa cells transient transfection assay TTF-1 does not require phosphorylation to activate transcription. The turnover of TTF-1 was studied in a pulse-chase experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of 35S-labeled TTF-1 decreased by 50% in about 14 h in FRTL-5 cells. In addition, HeLa cells were transfected with an equal amount of wild-type TTF-1 or mutant S80 which has all the seven mapped serines substituted with alanines. The half-life of wild-type TTF-1 in HeLa cells is also 14 h and no significant alteration was observed with the S80 mutant (data not shown). In order to determine whether any of the kinases for which a consensus sequence is present among the phosphorylation sites of TTF-1 were indeed capable of phosphorylating this transcription factor, we performed in vitro phosphorylation experiments. Among several protein kinases tested, only protein kinase C was able to phosphorylate TTF-1 in vitro (Fig. 6) (data not shown). These data suggest that TTF-1 could be a target for a specific cell signaling pathway. In this study, we have identified the phosphorylation sites of TTF-1, a transcription factor implicated in the activation of both thyroid- (21.Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys.

TTF-1 is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues in three different tryptic peptides. The number of phosphorylated serines may range from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 7 sites, given the uncertainty on the cluster of serines at the amino terminus. Fine mapping of the sites has been obtained in HeLa cells, by measuring the incorporation of labeled phosphate into TTF-1 mutants missing putative phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, no sites for protein kinase A are observed, even though an important role has been proposed for phosphorylation of TTF-1 by this protein kinase(15.Avvedimento E.V. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Google Scholar). The sites that we have identified show homology to CKII (Ser-18), protein kinase C (Ser-4, −23, and −255), or microtubule-associated protein kinase (Ser-328 and −337) phosphorylation sites. These protein kinases are components of signal transduction pathways that have been shown to control thyroid function and to be activated in thyroid cells in response to a variety of stimuli(23.Dumont J.E. Vassart G. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. 3rd Ed. 1. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1995: 543-559Google Scholar). In our in vitro experiments only protein kinase C was able to phosphorylate TTF-1. This result is of interest since activation of protein kinase C has been suggested to inhibit thyroid cell differentiation(24.Bachrach L.K. Eggo M.C. Mak W.W. Burrow G.N. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1603-1609Google Scholar, 25.Ginsberg J. Murray P.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 309-312Google Scholar, 26.Lombardi A. Veneziani B.M. Tramontano D. Ingbar S.H.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 585-590Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C has been implicated in TSH stimulation of thyroid cell growth(31.Fujimoto J. Brenner-Gati L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1587-1592Google Scholar, 32.Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Google Scholar). Since TTF-1 has been implicated both in the expression of thyroid differentiated function (21.Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Google Scholar) and in the control of thyroid cell growth(33.Rossi D.L. Acebron A. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23139-23142Google Scholar), it is an attractive hypothesis that some of these functions could be controlled via phosphorylation of TTF-1 by protein kinase C. The data presented in this study do not, at present, support this hypothesis, since we could not demonstrate any alteration in TTF-1 activity as a consequence of the lack of phosphorylation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that we were unable to provide evidence for the relevance of phosphorylation in TTF-1 because of the transient transfection assay in heterologous cells that we used. The regulation of TTF-1 through phosphorylation may impinge on thyroid-specific mechanisms which do not operate in HeLa cells such as, for example, phosphorylation-dependent interaction (34.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Google Scholar) with specific co-activators. Future experiments should aim at studying the phosphorylation mutants in thyroid cells. More conclusive are our studies on the role of phosphorylation in the DNA binding activity of TTF-1. Phosphorylation has been indicated as a critical step for the binding of TTF-1 to its target sequence on the Tg promoter (15.Avvedimento E.V. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Google Scholar, 35.Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Cassano A.F.S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1621-1630Google Scholar) as well as on the TSHr one(36.Shimura H. Okajima F. Ikuyama S. Shimura Y. Kimura S. Saji M. Kohn L.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1049-1069Google Scholar). Moreover, TTF-1 binding was shown to be abrogated when nuclear extracts were incubated with acid phosphatases. Treatment of extracts with protein kinase A (15.Avvedimento E.V. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Google Scholar) was able to restore TTF-1 DNA binding activity, leading to the conclusion that TTF-1 is directly modified by protein kinase A and binds to the Tg promoter only if phosphorylated(35.Gallo A. Benusiglio E. Bonapace I.M. Cassano A.F.S. Garbi C. Musti A.M. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1621-1630Google Scholar). In contrast, our results clearly show that phosphorylation does not play an important role in the overall TTF-1 DNA binding activity. This conclusion is based on the comparable affinities toward a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a well characterized TTF-1 binding site (oligonucleotide C) (17.Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Google Scholar) of wild-type TTF-1, purified from either bacteria or animal cells, and of the S80 mutant, that contains less that 0.1 phosphorus atom/molecule. We cannot exclude that ancillary proteins, which are protein kinase A substrates, could either help or interfere with TTF-1 binding(15.Avvedimento E.V. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Google Scholar), depending on the physiological conditions. In addition, we have recently discovered that TTF-1 DNA binding activity can be easily lost during extract preparation and can be readily recovered by exposure to reducing agents (37.Arnone M.I. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12048-12055Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that the exquisite sensitivity of TTF-1 to oxidation could interfere with the interpretation of in vitro treatments with phosphatases and kinases. Previous data from our laboratory have demonstrated that TTF-1 is inactive in Ha-ras-transformed cells, although it is present and capable of binding to DNA(14.Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. De Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Google Scholar). In this cell line, we have observed a reduced phosphorylation of TTF-1(14.Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. De Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Google Scholar), and we proposed that this could be the cause for the inactivity of TTF-1 in transformed cells. In this respect, it is interesting to note that ras activation has been reported to affect the stimulation of protein kinase C in Xenopus oocytes (38.Lacal J.C. Pena P.d. l. Moscat J. Garcia-Barreno P. Anderson P.S. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 238: 533-536Google Scholar) and in PC12 cells(39.Lacal J.C. Cuadrado A. Jones J.E. Trotta R. Burstein D.E. Thomson T. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 10: 2983-2990Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy the role of Ras proteins in signal transduction pathways initiated in membrane receptors (insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin, and epidermal growth factor) and involving microtubule-activating protein kinases. These alterations in protein kinases activities can be somehow affecting TTF-1, either by a direct or an indirect mechanism involving other kinases and/or phosphatases. The characterization of the phosphorylation sites in TTF-1 may be instrumental for the elucidation of the mechanisms leading to the interference between transformation and differentiation in thyroid cells."

Treatment of confluent cells with 10 nM triiodothyronine in a serum-free medium, in the absence of noradrenergic stimulation, increased the amount of UCP mRNA in a time-dependent manner. This effect was due to an increased UCP gene transcription rate and UCP mRNA stabilization, resulting in a higher content of immunoreactive mitochondrial UCP and functional UCP (detected by its ability to bind GDP). Thus, triiodothyronine might play a significant physiological role in the UCP expression throughout fetal development, when brown adipose tissue starts to differentiate and UCP is primarily expressed.

We have used clonal Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK-D1) epithelial cells as a model system to investigate the effects of extracellular nucleotides (e.g. ATP, UTP), which promote increase in activity of several phospholipases, on cAMP production. In contrast to observations in some other cell systems, ATP and UTP, acting via P2 purinergic receptors, stimulated cAMP production in MDCK-D1 cells. At maximally effective concentrations, ATP and UTP were not additive with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, but were synergistic with forskolin in increasing cAMP production, indicating that Gαs is activated by these nucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W2062077009,"The predominant characteristics of multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cells are broad spectrum resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and a pronounced defect in intracellular accumulation of the drugs, in association with overexpression of the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein. Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates the linker region of P-glycoprotein. Evidence has been presented that the isozyme PKC-α may contribute to the drug resistance phenotype of human breast cancer MCF7-MDR cells. PKC-α is markedly overexpressed in MCF7-MDR cells, and artificial overexpression of PKC-α in MCF7 constructs that overexpress P-glycoprotein significantly enhances the MDR phenotype of the cells in association with increased P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. Verapamil, cyclosporin A, and a number of other agents that compete with cytotoxic drugs for binding sites on P-glycoprotein can potently reverse MDR, but this is accompanied by severe toxicity in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that an N-myristoylated peptide that contains a sequence corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKC-α (P1) partially reverses multidrug resistance in MCF7-MDR cells by a novel mechanism that involves inhibition of PKC-α. P1 and two related PKC inhibitory N-myristoylated peptides restored intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in association with inhibition of the phosphorylation of three PKC-α substrates in MCF7-MDR cells: PKC-α, Raf-1 kinase, and P-glycoprotein. A fourth N-myristoylated peptide substrate analog of PKC, P7, did not affect drug accumulation in the MCF7-MDR cells and failed to inhibit the phosphorylation of the PKC-α substrates. The effects of P1 and verapamil on drug accumulation in MCF7-MDR cells were additive. P1 did not affect P-glycoprotein expression. MCF7-MDR cells were not cross-resistant to P1, which suggests that the peptide was not transported by P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, P1 was distinguished from MDR reversal agents such as verapamil and cyclosporin A by its inability to inhibit [3H]azidopine photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein. P1 actually increased [3H]azidopine photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein in MCF7-MDR cells, providing evidence that the effects of P1 on P-glycoprotein in MCF7-MDR cells are not restricted to inhibition of the phosphorylation of the pump. P1 may provide a basis for developing a new generation of MDR reversal agents that function by a novel mechanism that involves inhibition of PKC-α-catalyzed P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. The predominant characteristics of multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cells are broad spectrum resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and a pronounced defect in intracellular accumulation of the drugs, in association with overexpression of the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein. Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates the linker region of P-glycoprotein. Evidence has been presented that the isozyme PKC-α may contribute to the drug resistance phenotype of human breast cancer MCF7-MDR cells. PKC-α is markedly overexpressed in MCF7-MDR cells, and artificial overexpression of PKC-α in MCF7 constructs that overexpress P-glycoprotein significantly enhances the MDR phenotype of the cells in association with increased P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. Verapamil, cyclosporin A, and a number of other agents that compete with cytotoxic drugs for binding sites on P-glycoprotein can potently reverse MDR, but this is accompanied by severe toxicity in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that an N-myristoylated peptide that contains a sequence corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKC-α (P1) partially reverses multidrug resistance in MCF7-MDR cells by a novel mechanism that involves inhibition of PKC-α. P1 and two related PKC inhibitory N-myristoylated peptides restored intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in association with inhibition of the phosphorylation of three PKC-α substrates in MCF7-MDR cells: PKC-α, Raf-1 kinase, and P-glycoprotein. A fourth N-myristoylated peptide substrate analog of PKC, P7, did not affect drug accumulation in the MCF7-MDR cells and failed to inhibit the phosphorylation of the PKC-α substrates. The effects of P1 and verapamil on drug accumulation in MCF7-MDR cells were additive. P1 did not affect P-glycoprotein expression. MCF7-MDR cells were not cross-resistant to P1, which suggests that the peptide was not transported by P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, P1 was distinguished from MDR reversal agents such as verapamil and cyclosporin A by its inability to inhibit [3H]azidopine photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein. P1 actually increased [3H]azidopine photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein in MCF7-MDR cells, providing evidence that the effects of P1 on P-glycoprotein in MCF7-MDR cells are not restricted to inhibition of the phosphorylation of the pump. P1 may provide a basis for developing a new generation of MDR reversal agents that function by a novel mechanism that involves inhibition of PKC-α-catalyzed P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment, and it often accounts for the failure of aggressive chemotherapy to eradicate malignant disease(1.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). Most metastatic cancers are either innately resistant to chemotherapy or acquire drug resistance during the course of chemotherapy(1.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

The relevance of MDR to clinical drug resistance in cancer therapy is indicated by the abundant expression of P-glycoprotein and its message mdr1 in specimens of human cancer that are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy and in malignant tumors from patients who have relapsed during or after chemotherapy(1.Gottesman M.M.

Highly selective phorbol-ester PKC activators induce resistance in cancer cells to multiple cytotoxic drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates in association with a sharp reduction in the intracellular accumulation of the drugs, providing evidence that PKC activation contributes to MDR. The phorbol-ester effects on chemosensitivity and drug accumulation have been observed in several drug-sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines including human breast cancer MCF7-WT and MCF7-MDR, and the magnitude of the effect is generally a 2-6-fold increase in the IC50 values of cytotoxic drugs (6.Ferguson P.J.

In a previous report, we characterized the mechanism of PKC inhibition by an N-myristoylated peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence of PKC-α (P1) that had been shown to selectively inhibit PKC in human fibroblasts(26.Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J.

In this report, we show that the peptide P1 reverses MDR by a novel mechanism that is associated with a sharp increase in intracellular drug accumulation and inhibition of the phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein and two other PKC-α substrates, Raf-1 kinase and PKC-α itself. P1 was distinguished from verapamil and related MDR reversal agents(20.Kang Y. Perry R.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2952-2958Google Scholar, 21.Chen G. Ramachandran C. Krishan A.

P1 did not affect P-glycoprotein expression in MCF7-MDR cells. MCF7-MDR cells were not cross-resistant to P1, providing indirect evidence that the peptide was not transported by P-glycoprotein. The N-myristoylated PKC-α pseudosubstrate peptide P1 may be a valuable starting point for developing a new generation of MDR reversal agents that function by a novel mechanism that involves inhibition of PKC-α-catalyzed P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. The drug-sensitive wild-type human breast cancer cell line MCF7-WT and the MDR subline MCF7-MDR were supplied by Dr. Kenneth H. Cowan (National Cancer Institute). The MCF7-MDR cells were derived from the parental line MCF7-WT by serial passage with increasing ADR concentrations and are maintained in the presence of 1 μg/ml ADR. The MCF7-MDR subline is >100-fold resistant to ADR, vincristine, and VLB(18.Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Google Scholar). MCF7-MDR cells were grown in the absence of ADR for at least two passages prior to their use in experiments. Cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, vitamins, sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. The oligopeptides N-myristoyl-FARKGALRQ (P1), N-myristoyl-YARKGALRQ, FARKGALRQ (P2), N-myristoyl-RFARKGALRQKNV(P3), RFARKGALRQKNV(P4), N-myristoyl-RKRTLRRL (P5), RKRTLRRL (P6), and N-myristoyl-NDSRSSLIRKR (P7) were synthesized using the Vega Coupler 250 peptide synthesizer. The peptides were purified to >98% purity by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Vydac C4 column and an acetonitrile gradient. All peptides were prepared at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Synthetic Antigen Facility. [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol), [32P]Pi (200 mCi/mmol), [14C]adriamycin (55 mCi/mmol), [3H]azidopine (49 Ci/mmol), and [3H]vinblastine sulfate (11 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. [3H]5-Fluorouracil (14 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN. The P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody C219 was obtained from Signet Laboratories (Dedham MA), adriamycin and vinblastine sulfate were from Cetus Laboratories (Emeryville CA), 5-fluorouracil was from SoloPak (Franklin Park, IL), and protein assay solution and SDS-PAGE reagents were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Protease inhibitors, tetrazolium, myristic acid, N,N-dimethylmyristamide, verapamil, protein A-Sepharose, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Purified rat brain PKC was prepared from rat brains, and its Ca2+- and phosphatidylserine-stimulated histone kinase activity was assayed as described previously(28.O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4278-4282Google Scholar). The intracellular accumulation of cytotoxic drugs was measured by an established method (10.Dong Z. Ward N.E. Fan D. Gupta K.P. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 563-569Google Scholar, 12.Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Google Scholar). Stock solutions of 50 μM [14C]ADR, 23 μM [3H]VLB, and 70 μM [3H]5FU were diluted before use in tissue culture medium containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3). Stock solutions of N-myristoylated and nonmyristoylated peptides (1 mM) were made in either PBS or water. Cells were plated into 24-well Costar plates (201 mm2/well) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. Following a 20-24-h attachment period at 37°C, cells were preincubated with the peptides under investigation at indicated concentrations for 30 min at 37°C. Treatment with buffer alone served as a negative control, and treatment with 10 μM verapamil was used as a positive control. Next, the pretreated cells were incubated at 37°C with radiolabeled cytotoxic drug ([14C]ADR, [3H]VLB, or [3H]5FU) in the presence of the peptides (or controls) for the duration of the drug accumulation period (5 min to 6 h). The drug accumulation assay was terminated by rapidly washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS, detaching the cells by a 30-min exposure to trypsin-EDTA at 37°C, harvesting the cells, and counting them in vials containing 15 ml of scintillation fluid. To measure net drug efflux rates, MCF7-MDR cells were preloaded with 0.2 μM [14C]ADR for 2 h, washed rapidly with ice-cold PBS four times, and incubated at 37°C in the presence of N-myristoylated peptides, verapamil, or medium alone. At the indicated time intervals, the incubation was stopped and the radioactivity released into the medium was counted, as described previously(10.Dong Z. Ward N.E. Fan D. Gupta K.P. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 563-569Google Scholar). The reduction in viable cell number affected by a 24-h exposure to cytotoxic drugs (ADR, VLB, and 5FU) was measured as described previously using a tetrazolium assay(10.Dong Z. Ward N.E. Fan D. Gupta K.P. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 563-569Google Scholar, 12.Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in their exponential growth phase, and single cell suspensions with a viability of >95% were seeded into 96-well microculture plates at a density of 3,000 MCF7-WT or 4,500 MCF7-MDR cells/well. Following a 20-24-h attachment period, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with either the synthetic peptide under investigation or buffer (which served as a vehicle control). Next, the peptide-containing medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with either medium alone or medium containing cytotoxic drugs (ADR, VLB, and 5FU) for 24 h at 37°C. Drug-containing medium was then removed from the cells, fresh medium was applied, and the cells were further incubated for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, 40 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (2.5 mg/ml in PBS) was pipetted into each well and allowed to react with mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells for 2 h at 37°C. Unreacted dye and medium were removed from the wells, 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well, and the conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide to formazan by viable cells was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate-scanning spectrophotometer(10.Dong Z. Ward N.E. Fan D. Gupta K.P. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 563-569Google Scholar, 12.Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Google Scholar). Direct growth-inhibitory effects of the peptides against MCF7-WT and MCF7-MDR were measured by a modification of this procedure, in which the cells were exposed to the peptides for the entire 96-h growth inhibition assay. Effects of N-myristoylated and nonmyristoylated synthetic peptides on P-glycoprotein phosphorylation in [32P]Pi-labeled MCF7-MDR cells were determined using established methods(18.Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Google Scholar, 29.Bates S.E. Lee J.S. Dickstein B. Spolyar M. Fojo A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9156-9164Google Scholar). Nearly confluent MCF7 cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were labeled with [32P]Pi by washing the cells with phosphate-free buffered saline and phosphate-free medium successively and then incubating the cells with 6 ml of phosphate-free medium containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) and 0.6 mCi of [32P]Pi for 3 h at 37°C. Where indicated, synthetic peptides were included in the incubation mixtures. All subsequent procedures were done at 4°C. Labeled cells were washed three times with ice-cold DPBS and scraped from the plates with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (1 ml/plate). The resultant cell suspensions were stirred for 15 min, lysates were spun at 13,800 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected. The procedures used to immunoprecipitate P-glycoprotein, PKC-α, and Raf-1 kinase were based on previously described methods(18.Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Google Scholar). For P-glycoprotein immunoprecipitation, the supernatant (100 μg of protein) was incubated with 5 μg of C219 monoclonal antibody by rotation for 16 h at 4°C. In the case of Raf-1 kinase and PKC-α immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated with Raf-1 kinase mAb (5 μg) (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY) or PKC-α mAb (5 μg) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) by rotation for 2 h at 4°C, and rotation was continued in the presence of 5 μg rabbit antimouse IgG for an additional 30 min. at 4°C. Next, 0.2 ml of a 25% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose was added to the incubation mixture followed by rotation for 30 min at 4°C. After a 1-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the beads were recovered as a pellet, and they were washed successively with 1 M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and lysis buffer containing 1 M urea. To recover immune complexes from the beads, the beads were incubated for 10 min at 30°C with 0.1 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then they were pelleted in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was recovered and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were silver stained, and autoradiography was done. P-glycoprotein expression was measured by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates using the monoclonal antibody C219 (500 ng/ml)(30.Zheng B. Chambers T.C. Raynor R.L. Markham P.N. Gebel H.M. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12332-12338Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to 100 μM P1, P3, P5, or medium alone for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested at 4°C with 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates was done by standard procedures (12.Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Google Scholar), except that samples were not boiled prior to SDS-PAGE(30.Zheng B. Chambers T.C. Raynor R.L. Markham P.N. Gebel H.M. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12332-12338Google Scholar). The secondary antibody employed was horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Corp.). Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.), and bands were quantitated using a computerized densitometer. For Raf-1 kinase expression, an identical procedure was used except that samples were boiled and the primary antibody employed was a Raf-1 kinase-specific mAb (Oncogene Scis., Uniondale, NY). The mAb concentration was 10 μg/ml. PKC-α immunoblot analysis was done as described in (12.Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein was photoaffinity labeled with [3H]azidopine in whole MCF7-MDR cells by a standard method(20.Kang Y. Perry R.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2952-2958Google Scholar, 29.Bates S.E. Lee J.S. Dickstein B. Spolyar M. Fojo A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9156-9164Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 MCF7-MDR cells suspended in PBS were incubated in the dark with [3H]azidopine (15 μCi) and the peptide under investigation for 1 h at 37°C. Next, the photoreaction was initiated by irradiation at 365 nm at a distance of 5 cm (4°C) using a self-filtering lamp. After an irradiation period of 30 min, cells were lysed at 4°C in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. To immunoprecipitate P-glycoprotein, the sample was incubated with 5 μg of C219 mAb, and this was followed by the addition of protein-A Sepharose, as described above. The beads were pelleted and washed once with 1 M NaCl containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and three times with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NH4Cl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1% CHAPS(20.Kang Y. Perry R.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2952-2958Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein was dissociated from the beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis as described above. Gels were soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Corp.) for 30 min and dried prior to autoradiography at −70°C. For statistical analysis of data, the two-tailed Student's t test was performed with Microsoft software using a Dell computer. Table 1 shows the structures of the peptides under investigation for modulatory effects on the intracellular accumulation and growth-inhibitory activity of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in human breast cancer MCF7-MDR cells. P2 contains the core sequence of the pseudosubstrate region of PKC-α (PKC[20-28]), P4 contains a more extensive PKC-α pseudosubstrate sequence (PKC[19-31])(26.Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Google Scholar, 27.Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar), and P6 contains the sequence of the PKC phosphorylation site of the epidermal growth factor receptor at Thr654(27.Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A.

Each of these N-myristoylated peptides inhibits the histone kinase reaction of purified PKC (Table 1); the corresponding nonmyristoylated peptides do not inhibit PKC-catalyzed histone phosphorylation (Table 1). P7 is an N-myristoylated peptide with a sequence that corresponds to a PKC phosphorylation site in P-glycoprotein (residues 656-666)(13.Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Raynor R.L. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4592-4595Google Scholar). Although P7 does inhibit the histone kinase activity of PKC, it is weaker than P1, P3, and P5 in this regard, and, at concentrations ≤10 μM, P7 actually stimulates the histone kinase reaction (Table 1). In a previous report, we showed that the mechanism of PKC inhibition by several N-myristoylated peptide substrate analogs of PKC, including P1 and P5, entailed binding interactions of the inhibitor peptides with the active site of PKC and with phospholipid vesicles(27.Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar). In control experiments that monitored the absorbance of the Tyr-containing P1 analog NmYARKGALRQ, we have found that the phospholipid-interacting peptide does not bind to plastic-, glass-, or collagen-coated surfaces (data not shown).Tabled 1 P1 has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of the PKC substrate MARCKS in intact rat fibroblasts(26.Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J.

https://openalex.org/W1973079711,"We have developed a bZIP protein, GBF-F, with both dominant-negative (DN) and gain-of-function properties. GBF-F is a chimera consisting of two components: the DNA binding (basic) region from the plant bZIP protein GBF-1 (GBF) and a leucine zipper (F) designed to preferentially heterodimerize with the C/EBPα leucine zipper. Biochemical studies show that GBF-F preferentially forms heterodimers with C/EBPα and thus binds a chimeric DNA sequence composed of the half-sites recognized by the C/EBP and GBF basic regions.

Vertebrate gene expression is regulated by an abundance of transcription factors, many of which exist as members of gene families whose products have similar DNA-binding properties and thus have potentially overlapping target genes and biological functions. Several methods exist to address this problem. Gene disruption (1.Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Google Scholar) and replacement (2.Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A. Joyner A. Science. 1995; 269: 679-682Google Scholar) by homologous recombination provide a powerful genetic approach to assess the in vivo functions of a particular transcription factor. However, several examples have been reported recently in which the functional redundancy within a gene family allows other family members to substitute, at least partially, for the disrupted gene. A well documented example is the MyoD family of bHLH transcription factors (3.Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P. Stead R.H. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Google Scholar) and the Src family of tyrosine kinases(4.Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 387-398Google Scholar). The fundamental problem with this method is that it obscures tissue specific and developmentally later functions. To study these later functions, homologous recombination using the CRE LOX system activated in a tissue or stage specific manner can be used(5.Sauer B. Henderson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5166-5170Google Scholar).An alternative approach which is pharmacological is to use a dominant-negative (DN) system to inhibit the function of one or several family members(6.Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Google Scholar). Expression of antisense RNA, using either the conserved or nonconserved part of mRNA as a target to inactivate one or all family members, respectively, is an attractive possibility. Lane's (7.Lin F.-T. Lane M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Google Scholar) group has used this approach to demonstrate that C/EBPα is critical for the differentiation of 3T3L1 cells into adipocytes. Expression of DN proteins is another method to inactivate gene function. A number of different DN inhibitors of bZIP protein function have been described, both as naturally occurring members of transcription factor families or as experimentally designed proteins. These DN molecules can be divided into two general classes. The first class binds the same DNA target but lack an activation domain(8.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Google Scholar, 9.Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar, 10.Mumberg D. Lucibello F.C. Schuermann M. Muller R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1212-1223Google Scholar, 11.Nakabeppu Y. Nathans D. Cell. 1991; 64: 751-759Google Scholar). This class of DNs acts as competitive inhibitors, forming either non-activating homodimers that compete with the target protein for binding to its cognate binding sites or heterodimers with reduced transcriptional activity. By virtue of their mode of action, these DN proteins must be expressed in excess relative to their target for efficient inhibition. The second class dimerizes with the endogenous bZIP protein but which either lack a DNA-binding domain or contain a DNA-binding domain with different binding specificity from the target protein(12.Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar). The second class potentially functions more efficiently as DNs, since heterodimers formed with these proteins do not bind to DNA and are therefore completely inactive.In this study we describe the design of an efficient DN molecule with specificity for the C/EBP family of bZIP transcription factors. There are four major proteins in the C/EBP family, to which we refer using the nomenclature C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and CRP1 (reviewed in (13.Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche T. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar)). C/EBP proteins have been implicated in a variety of regulatory functions, including activation of constitutive and acute phase responsive genes in the liver, control of adipocyte differentiation, and regulation of inflammatory cytokine genes and other activities of monocytic cells(13.Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche T. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). C/EBP family members can heterodimerize in all combinations and recognize a common palindromic DNA motif (consensus: ATTGCGCAAT). Each monomer is a long (∼70 amino acids) bipartite α-helix when bound to DNA(14.Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Google Scholar, 15.Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Google Scholar, 16.Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Google Scholar, 17.Baxevanis A. Vinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 278-285Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of the α-helix is amphipathic with the two helices interacting along their hydrophobic surfaces to create a dimeric leucine zipper coiled coil. The NH2-terminal half of the motif interacts with the major grove of DNA in a sequence specific fashion and becomes α-helical upon DNA binding(18.O'Neil K.T. Shuman J.D. Ampe C. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9030-9034Google Scholar, 19.Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 149: 771-774Google Scholar). DNA binding stabilizes the dimer complex, which complicates the design of non-DNA binding DNs to bZIP proteins.As a first step in developing a DN with specificity for C/EBP proteins, we used a previously designed a leucine zipper (the F zipper) that preferentially heterodimerizes with C/EBPα as a result of substitutions in charged amino acids occupying the e and g positions of the zipper α-helix(20.Vinson C.R. Hai T.W. Boyd S.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1047-1058Google Scholar). We have appended to this F zipper the basic region from the plant bZIP protein G-box binding factor-1 (GBF-1)(21.Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckman H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1261-1273Google Scholar), which recognizes a DNA sequence highly divergent from that recognized by C/EBP proteins. This chimeric protein creates a dominant-negative protein (GBF-F) that inhibits C/EBP mediated transactivation. Both the heterodimerizing leucine zipper and the novel basic region are critical for optimal activity of the designed DN. In addition to its ability to inhibit C/EBP transactivation of a canonical C/EBP site, we show that GBF-F also has gain-of-function properties as a GBF-F:C/EBP heterodimer which can transactivate the non-palindromic site composed of C/EBP and GBF half-sites.DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to create a potent dominant-negative to C/EBP, we have explored several structurally different protein designs. The first two DNs consisted of bZIP domains from either wild type C/EBPα (ΔC/EBP) or C/EBPα containing the F zipper (C/EBP-F), which preferentially heterodimerizes with C/EBPα. Since these proteins lack an activation domain, their overexpression could be predicted to competitively inhibit C/EBPα activity by either the formation of inactive or less-active heterodimers or, in the case of ΔC/EBP, competition with C/EBPα for binding to its cognate site. Both ΔC/EBP and C/EBP-F were able to inhibit C/EBPα activity by 50%. Similar naturally occurring structures also act as efficient DNs for other bZIP families, including the AP-1 and CREB proteins(9.Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar, 10.Mumberg D. Lucibello F.C. Schuermann M. Muller R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1212-1223Google Scholar, 11.Nakabeppu Y. Nathans D. Cell. 1991; 64: 751-759Google Scholar, 40.Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Google Scholar). A naturally occurring DN molecule analogous to ΔC/EBP is encoded by the C/EBPβ gene: translational initiation at an internal AUG codon generates a truncated protein, LIP, that lacks an activation domain (8.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Google Scholar). LIP has been reported to exhibit DN properties when co-expressed with the activating form of C/EBPβ. A similar truncated protein can be generated from C/EBPα by internal translational initiation. This shorter form of C/EBPα (C/EBP-30) lacks the major activation domain located at the NH2 terminus(41.Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar, 42.Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Google Scholar). However, unlike C/EBPβ, C/EBPα contains a second activation domain that is retained in C/EBP-30, and, thus, it is likely that this shorter form functions as a weak activator rather than as an inhibitor.For ΔC/EBP and C/EBP-F to act as efficient inhibitors, heterodimers between these DNs and C/EBPα must be less efficient transactivators than C/EBPα homodimers. At present, it is not clear whether these heterodimers are less active. Indeed, the inability of these two DN proteins to efficiently inhibit C/EBPα activity suggests that a single activation domain is sufficient for transactivation. In this regard, Goodman's group has been using a heterodimerizing zipper system by mutating amino acids in the e and g positions and substituting a3 asparagine with histidine. They can show that a CREB dimer requires only one phosphorylated activation domain to activate transcription of a CRE-containing promoter(43.Loriaux M. Rehfuss R. Brennan R. Goodman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Google Scholar).The second pair of DNs tested consisted of isolated leucine zipper domains. The two C/EBP zippers examined, wild-type and F, were even less effective inhibitors than the bZIP domains, conferring only 40% inhibition of C/EBPα activity. We suggest that the lack of efficient inhibition by the F zipper is due to the fact that the F:C/EBPα heterodimer is less stable than a C/EBPα homodimer. The presence of DNA should drive the equilibrium toward the formation of C/EBPα homodimers at the expense of F:C/EBPα heterodimers which cannot bind DNA. Zippers designed to heterodimerize even more avidly with C/EBPα may not need the basic region for efficient heterodimer formation and, therefore, might function more effectively as inhibitors. However, it is unclear whether a leucine zipper that heterodimerizes with C/EBPα more stably than the F zipper could be constructed.Similar DN molecules with specificity for the Jun/Fos family have been reported. These inhibitors are fusion proteins produced by joining the v-Jun or c-Jun leucine zippers to the bacterial lexA gene (9.Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar, 44.Granger-Schnarr M. Benusiglio E. Schnarr M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4236-4239Google Scholar). In both cases, the LexA:Jun hybrids efficiently inhibited transactivation by Fos and Jun. Proteins that form a heteromultimer complex which cannot bind DNA has been identified for bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) proteins. In the bHLH family, the DN proteins Id and extramacrochaetae can multimerize with other bHLH factors, but, because they lack a functional DNA-binding domain, repress the DNA binding activities of their multimerization partners(45.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 46.Ellis H.M. Spann D.R. Posakony J.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 27-38Google Scholar, 47.Fairman R. Beran-Steed R.K.

Cell. 1990; 61: 39-48Google Scholar).GBF-F is a potent DN to C/EBP. The most successful DN design was achieved by altering the DNA binding specificity of the DN:C/EBP heterodimer. The DN thus configured, GBF-F, inactivated sequence-specific DNA binding by C/EBPα in vitro as well as transactivation by C/EBPα and related family members in HepG2 cells. GBF-F is a chimera, both parts of which are critical for optimal DN properties: one component is the F leucine zipper and the second is the DNA-binding region from the plant bZIP protein, GBF-1(21.Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckman H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1261-1273Google Scholar). The bipartite bZIP helix permits the exchange of basic regions and, therefore, DNA-binding specificity without changing dimerization specificity(37.Agre P. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 922-925Google Scholar). Alone, each component of the GBF-F chimera has modest DN potential (Fig. 3A); in combination, these components exhibit enhanced inhibitory properties (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, the DN activity of GBF-F is specific to bZIP proteins of the C/EBP family, as demonstrated by using C/EBPα derivatives containing a heterologous leucine zipper (Fig. 5).An alternative DN could be generated by extending the leucine zipper in a manner that engenders additional dimerization stability and, simultaneously, prevents the target protein from binding to DNA. One approach, which is currently under development(49.Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Google Scholar), is the addition of a DNA mimetic in the form of an acidic amphipathic α-helical extension to the NH2 terminus of the F leucine zipper. Such an extension would be predicted to form a heterodimeric coiled-coil interaction with the bZIP basic region helix, thereby stabilizing the dimeric complex and hindering basic region interactions with DNA.When fused to an activation domain, GBF-F cooperates with C/EBPβ to transactivate a chimeric DNA site, showing that this DN protein can also exhibit gain-of-function properties (Fig. 6). We show by both biochemical and biological experiments that GBF-F heterodimerizes with C/EBPα and binds a chimeric site, consisting of C/EBP and GBF recognition motif half-sites, in preference to a normal C/EBP site. C/EBPα:GBF-F heterodimers preferentially bound a C/EBP|GBF site in vitro, while in transfected cells, a reporter gene containing the C/EBP|GBF chimeric binding site was activated only by the combination of C/EBPβ and a GBF-F derivative bearing an activation domain. Although the C/EBP|GBF sequence is predicted to be the optimal binding site for C/EBP:GBF-F heterodimers, binding site selection experiments currently in progress should reveal whether this is the case.In vivo, the relative levels of C/EBP proteins and GBF-F should specify the dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects of GBF-F. If GBF-F is expressed at lower levels than endogenous C/EBP, both C/EBP homodimers and C/EBP:GBF-F heterodimers should exist in the cell. Under these conditions, gain-of-function properties should predominate over DN effects. If GBF-F is expressed at greater levels than C/EBP, we expect to observe the activation of chimeric binding sites as well as more complete inhibition of C/EBP homodimer activity. A natural example of a GBF-F-like molecule is CHOP (gadd153), a putative dominant-negative molecule of the C/EBP family(12.Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar, 50.Fornace A.J.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Google Scholar). CHOP10 inhibits C/EBP proteins from binding to canonical C/EBP sites, but also recognizes a novel sequence as a heterodimer with C/EBP. 2D. Ron, personal communication. However, the significance and specificity of DNA binding by CHOP10:C/EBP heterodimers is not yet clear. CHOP10 could potentially mediate the activation of a distinct set of genes through its binding with C/EBP family members. In light of its potential to activate natural target genes, CHOP10 may not be an appropriate DN for inhibiting C/EBP function in vivo. GBF-F, on the other hand, confers a novel, presumably non-physiological, DNA-binding specificity to C/EBP and, therefore, is less likely to cause the activation of endogenous genes when expressed in mammalian cells.C/EBP DN proteins such as GBF-F should be useful for inhibition of C/EBP activity in vivo. For example, two groups have reported the targeted disruption of the c/ebpβ gene (51.Screpanti I. Romani L.P.M. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G.

Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Google Scholar) and have shown that this mutation has only minor effects on the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. These results are surprising in light of previous data showing that C/EBPβ plays a critical role in the expression of genes such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in cell lines(26.Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Google Scholar, 53.Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Google Scholar), and suggest that a redundant C/EBP activity compensates for the absence of C/EBPβ in knockout animals. To demonstrate that the compensatory activity is provided by another member of the C/EBP family, one could create DN transgenic mice that express the C/EBP inhibitor specifically in hepatocytes or monocytic cells. Assuming that these animals are viable, they could be used to examine the requirement for a C/EBP factor in the activation of acute-phase responsive genes or the induction of inflammatory cytokines, respectively.Numerous experiments indicate that the expression or activation of C/EBP proteins is coincident with terminal differentiation of a particular cell lineage. For instance, C/EBPβ synthesis is induced during the conversion of HL60 cells or M1 myeloblasts into mature macrophages(56.Natsuka S. Akira S. Nishio Y. Hashimoto S. Sugita T. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1992; 79: 460-466Google Scholar, 57.Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Google Scholar). Similarly, C/EBPδ is strongly up-regulated when 32D Cl3 pregranulocytic cells differentiate into granulocytes in response to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(57.Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Google Scholar). In these and other cases, it has not been established whether C/EBP proteins play an essential role in terminal differentiation. Overexpression of C/EBP DNs in the appropriate cell types should provide a straightforward means of determining the requirement for C/EBP-related activator proteins in cell maturation.The gain-of-function activity observed for the GBF-F protein containing an activation domain suggests the possible use of this molecule in regulating experimental transgenes. When expressed in submolar levels relative to endogenous C/EBP proteins, the GBF-F construct could be used as a tool to activate transfected genes whose transcription is regulated by the C/EBP|GBF-F cis-element. Since the activation of these chimeric sites would be dependent on the presence of C/EBP proteins, this approach provides a strategy to control transgene expression by inducing the synthesis or activity of an endogenous C/EBP protein. For example, several mediators of the inflammatory response have been shown to stimulate C/EBPβ-dependent transactivation(53.Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Google Scholar, 58.Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Google Scholar). If the same activating mechanism applies to C/EBPβ:GBF-F heterodimers, stimulation of C/EBPβ by these cytokines in cells expressing low levels of GBF-F should induce transcription from promoters containing the C/EBP|GBF site without significantly disrupting normal gene expression in the cell.

Vertebrate gene expression is regulated by an abundance of transcription factors, many of which exist as members of gene families whose products have similar DNA-binding properties and thus have potentially overlapping target genes and biological functions. Several methods exist to address this problem. Gene disruption (1.Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Google Scholar) and replacement (2.Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A. Joyner A. Science. 1995; 269: 679-682Google Scholar) by homologous recombination provide a powerful genetic approach to assess the in vivo functions of a particular transcription factor. However, several examples have been reported recently in which the functional redundancy within a gene family allows other family members to substitute, at least partially, for the disrupted gene. A well documented example is the MyoD family of bHLH transcription factors (3.Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P. Stead R.H. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Google Scholar) and the Src family of tyrosine kinases(4.Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 387-398Google Scholar). The fundamental problem with this method is that it obscures tissue specific and developmentally later functions. To study these later functions, homologous recombination using the CRE LOX system activated in a tissue or stage specific manner can be used(5.Sauer B. Henderson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5166-5170Google Scholar).An alternative approach which is pharmacological is to use a dominant-negative (DN) system to inhibit the function of one or several family members(6.Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Google Scholar). Expression of antisense RNA, using either the conserved or nonconserved part of mRNA as a target to inactivate one or all family members, respectively, is an attractive possibility. Lane's (7.Lin F.-T. Lane M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Google Scholar) group has used this approach to demonstrate that C/EBPα is critical for the differentiation of 3T3L1 cells into adipocytes. Expression of DN proteins is another method to inactivate gene function. A number of different DN inhibitors of bZIP protein function have been described, both as naturally occurring members of transcription factor families or as experimentally designed proteins. These DN molecules can be divided into two general classes. The first class binds the same DNA target but lack an activation domain(8.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Google Scholar, 9.Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar, 10.Mumberg D. Lucibello F.C. Schuermann M. Muller R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1212-1223Google Scholar, 11.Nakabeppu Y. Nathans D. Cell. 1991; 64: 751-759Google Scholar). This class of DNs acts as competitive inhibitors, forming either non-activating homodimers that compete with the target protein for binding to its cognate binding sites or heterodimers with reduced transcriptional activity. By virtue of their mode of action, these DN proteins must be expressed in excess relative to their target for efficient inhibition. The second class dimerizes with the endogenous bZIP protein but which either lack a DNA-binding domain or contain a DNA-binding domain with different binding specificity from the target protein(12.Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar). The second class potentially functions more efficiently as DNs, since heterodimers formed with these proteins do not bind to DNA and are therefore completely inactive.In this study we describe the design of an efficient DN molecule with specificity for the C/EBP family of bZIP transcription factors. There are four major proteins in the C/EBP family, to which we refer using the nomenclature C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and CRP1 (reviewed in (13.Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche T. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar)). C/EBP proteins have been implicated in a variety of regulatory functions, including activation of constitutive and acute phase responsive genes in the liver, control of adipocyte differentiation, and regulation of inflammatory cytokine genes and other activities of monocytic cells(13.Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche T. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). C/EBP family members can heterodimerize in all combinations and recognize a common palindromic DNA motif (consensus: ATTGCGCAAT). Each monomer is a long (∼70 amino acids) bipartite α-helix when bound to DNA(14.Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Google Scholar, 15.Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J.

Dev. 1993; 3: 278-285Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of the α-helix is amphipathic with the two helices interacting along their hydrophobic surfaces to create a dimeric leucine zipper coiled coil. The NH2-terminal half of the motif interacts with the major grove of DNA in a sequence specific fashion and becomes α-helical upon DNA binding(18.O'Neil K.T. Shuman J.D. Ampe C. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9030-9034Google Scholar, 19.Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 149: 771-774Google Scholar). DNA binding stabilizes the dimer complex, which complicates the design of non-DNA binding DNs to bZIP proteins.As a first step in developing a DN with specificity for C/EBP proteins, we used a previously designed a leucine zipper (the F zipper) that preferentially heterodimerizes with C/EBPα as a result of substitutions in charged amino acids o"

We have investigated the ability of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) to synthesize in vitro over a 634-nucleotide HIV LTR DNA template, having or lacking a single full-length DNA downstream primer. The presence of the downstream primer resulted in an approximately 12-fold reduction in the rate of upstream primer elongation. Addition of Escherichia coli single-stranded binding protein (SSB) or human replication protein A (RP-A) enhanced strand displacement synthesis; however, addition of HIV nucleocapsid protein (NC) did not. The presence of excess single-stranded DNA complementary to the downstream primer did not stimulate displacement synthesis. Interestingly, we observed that the elongating upstream primer could readily transfer to this DNA. This observation suggests that recombination is favored during strand displacement synthesis in vivo.

Retroviruses convert their RNA genomes into proviral DNA by the process of reverse transcription (reviewed in Whitcomb and Hughes(1992)). Reverse transcription starts from a cellular tRNA that binds near the 5′ end of the virus to the PBS. Synthesis proceeds to the end, forming the minus strong stop DNA. Transfer of this DNA to the 3′ end of either co-packaged RNA molecule is necessary to complete the (-)-strand DNA. This transfer reaction is thought to be facilitated by complementary regions at the ends of the virus and by the RNase H activity that degrades the RNA complementary to the newly synthesized DNA. Second strand synthesis is initiated from a purine-rich sequence tract (PPT) located just upstream of the U3 region. This oligoribonucleotide is created by degradation of the viral genome by the RNase H activity of the RT. Synthesis from the PPT, ending in copying part of the tRNA primer of the(-)-strand DNA, forms the plus strong stop DNA. This DNA needs to be transferred to the 3′ end of the (-)-strand DNA to resume synthesis. Transfer in this case is thought to be facilitated by the removal of the tRNA primer which allows the complementary sequences spanning the PBS site, at the ends of the (+)- and(-)-strands, to circularize and complete their synthesis (Fig. 1A). After this circularization step in HIV, polymerization displaces about 637 nucleotides (Ratner et al., 1985) to generate the long terminal repeats containing the duplications of the U3, R, and U5 regions. This whole process is carried out by the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT), which is encoded by the pol gene and is carried inside the virion. The native enzyme in HIV is a heterodimer composed of a 66- and a 51-kDa subunit (diMarzo et al., 1986; Lightfoote et al., 1986). human immunodeficiency virus primer binding site reverse transcriptase long terminal repeats primer binding site regions unique to the 5′ and 3′ end of the LTRs, respectively redundancy common to 5′ and 3′ ends of the LTRs nucleocapsid protein single-stranded binding protein replication protein A base pair(s). Not only is strand displacement necessary for viral replication, it is also likely to play a role in recombination according to the strand displacement-assimilation model (Junghans et al., 1982). This model proposes that recombination can occur during (+)-strand DNA synthesis. The model assumes that during reverse transcription two (-)-strand DNAs are created, and that (+)-strand synthesis can be initiated at multiple points. According to this model, when a downstream DNA is displaced by upcoming synthesis, this fragment can migrate to, or invade, the second copy of(-)-strand DNA and serve as a primer there. If the fragment of DNA being transferred is not 100% homologous to the new template DNA, it may lead to a recombinant virus. Additionally, strand displacement was proposed to be involved in a new model for the second template switch in reverse transcription (Li et al., 1993). In this model, synthesis from the central PPT displaces the plus strong stop DNA. The displaced DNA can base-pair with the 3′ end of the(-)-strand DNA; this would eliminate the need for a second jump or transfer event. Strand displacement by HIV-1 RT has been documented in vitro by Huber et al.(1989) and Hottiger et al.(1994) for segments up to 50 nucleotides in length, but to date there has been no evidence that this reaction can be extensive enough to carry out the lengthy displacement required in vivo. This activity has also been reported for avian myeloblastosis virus and murine leukemia virus RT (Collet et al., 1978; Matson et al., 1980; Whiting and Champoux, 1994). In murine leukemia virus, there is recent evidence that the enzyme can displace 1,334 base pairs of DNA duplex, which is a much greater distance than what is required during reverse transcription in vivo (Whiting and Champoux, 1994). In this paper, we examine the ability of HIV-RT to displace a 634-nucleotide-long segment of DNA containing the natural LTR sequences in vitro. HIV-RT with native primary structure was provided by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). The enzyme had a specific activity of 40,000 units/mg. One unit is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37°C using poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16 as template primer. The enzyme was divided into aliquots, stored at −70°C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. HIV NC was chemically synthesized by the Louisiana State University Medical Core Center Laboratories. The sequence of the mature NC was that of the first 55 amino acids of the NC precursor protein described by Khan and Giedroc(1992). Biologically expressed NC was obtained from Enzyco (Denver, CO) and was used as a control. The peptide was kept under reducing conditions, and aliquots were stored in 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. The NC protein was also divided into aliquots, stored at −70°C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. Purified recombinant human RP-A was obtained from Dr. Marc S. Wold (University of Iowa). This protein was purified as described by Henricksen et al.(1994). T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, and poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16 were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Escherichia coli SSB and Sequenase™ were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The dNTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and the Nensorb columns were purchased from DuPont NEN. The DNA oligonucleotides used as primers and the Affinitips™ streptavidin capture microcolumns were obtained from Genosys, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The LTR sequences came from the plasmid pUC-BS-WT provided to us by Dr. Malcolm A. Martin (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). The template was created by amplifying the segment of plasmid DNA containing these sequences using polymerase chain reaction. One of the primers used was biotinylated. After polymerase chain reaction amplification, the nonbiotinylated strand could be obtained by passing the double-stranded product through an Affinitip™ streptavidin capture microcolumn. The downstream segment of DNA was obtained in the same manner using another set of primers. The sequence of the primers (5′ to 3′) used to obtain the template DNA were: biotin-ACTTTCGCTTTCAAGTCCC and TGGAAGGGGCTAATTCACTG. The sequence of the primers (5′ to 3′) used to obtain the downstream segment of DNA were: biotin-TGGAAGGGCTAATTCACTG and TGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC. The sequence of the primers (5′ to 3′) used to obtain the “acceptor” DNA were: biotin-TGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC and GGGAGCAGTATCTCGAGAC. The sequence (5′ to 3′) of the primer used for the strand displacement experiments was: TCGCTTTCAAGTCCCTGTT. The templates were quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. The DNA primer used in the experiments was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified through Nensorb columns. The hybrids were prepared by mixing the upstream and downstream primers with the template in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 80 mM KCl. The primers were present at a 2.5 to 1 molar ratio over the template. This mixture was heated to 95°C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The substrate was preincubated with the 4 units of enzyme for 5 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 32 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and the reactions were started with the addition of 6 mM MgCl2 and 100 μM concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). The reactions were performed in a final volume of 12.5 μl at 37°C. The incubation time used in each experiment is specified under each figure legend. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of a 2 × loading buffer (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mM EDTA (pH = 8), 0.1% xylene cyanole, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Trapped reactions were performed by adding 2 μg of poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16 to start the reaction along with the MgCl2 and the dNTPs. The amount of HIV NC necessary to coat the templates used was calculated based on one molecule of NC binding to every 7 nucleotides (You and McHenry, 1993). The substrate was preincubated with the indicated amount of protein for 5 min before the addition of HIV-RT. The reaction conditions were as described above except that 50 μM ZnCl2 was included in the reactions. The amount of protein necessary to coat the templates used was calculated based on one tetrameric molecule of SSB binding to every 65 nucleotides (Kornberg and Baker, 1992) and one molecule of RP-A binding to every 30 nucleotides (Henricksen et al., 1994). The substrate was preincubated with HIV-RT for 5 min, and the indicated amount of protein was added when the reaction was started. Standard HIV-RT reaction conditions were used. Samples were separated using 5% denaturing sequencing gels containing 7 M urea (Sambrook et al., 1989). The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Quantitations of labeled species were done by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant program. The postulated substrate for strand displacement during reverse transcription is shown in Fig. 1A. The substrates used in this study are shown in Fig. 1B. We designed the templates so they would contain the sequences involved during this process in vivo. HIV-RT was allowed to carry out DNA synthesis on the substrates used to study strand displacement (Fig. 1B) in a time course reaction (Fig. 2). To show that all molecules of the substrate B contained an annealed downstream segment of DNA, we employed T4 DNA polymerase, which does not catalyze strand displacement synthesis. The downstream DNA stopped T4 DNA polymerase-directed primer elongation beyond 10 nucleotides on essentially all of the substrate B molecules (Fig. 2, lane 2). In the absence of a downstream primer, HIV-RT takes less than 7 min to elongate most annealed primers to the end of the template. After 1 min, the maximum length of extension on substrate A is approximately 200 nucleotides, which gives a rate of synthesis of 3.3 nucleotides per s. Virtually the same distribution of products was obtained after 1 min in two additional independent experiments (not shown). On substrate B, the first elongated primers reach the end after 15 min. Even at the 60-min time point, there is little synthesis to the end of the template. At the 7-min time point, the maximum length of extension is approximately 120 nucleotides, which gives an approximate strand displacement rate of 0.28 nucleotides per s. At 15 min, the maximum length of extension is approximately 250 nucleotides. This gives a consistent displacement rate of 0.27 nucleotide per s. Two other independent experiments produced essentially the same distribution of products (not shown). This indicates that strand displacement slows RT-directed synthesis by approximately 12-fold. We studied the effect of ionic strength on strand displacement synthesis by titrating the amount of KCl in the reactions from 32 mM to 80 mM (not shown). Synthesis on substrate A was not affected significantly by the amount of KCl in the reactions over the range examined, but synthesis on substrate B was more efficient at low ionic strength. With substrate B at KCl concentrations above 50 mM, there were virtually no extension products longer than 100 nucleotides after incubation with HIV-RT for 30 min. This inhibition of strand displacement at high ionic strength is expected since high salt stabilizes duplex DNA. Using the PhosphorImager, we noticed that with substrate B the length of the extension products is decreased, but the number of primers being extended remained approximately the same as with substrate A. This suggests that at least one reason why strand displacement synthesis is a slow process is because it promotes the premature dissociation of the RT from the template. The time necessary for frequent rebinding would then contribute to the slowdown in the reaction. To determine whether this is the case, we measured the amount of synthesis that occurs during a single enzyme binding event by using an enzyme trap (Fig. 3). The trap, poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16, was added in great excess over the template so that it would sequester RT molecules that dissociate from the experimental primer-template, preventing their return for a second round of synthesis. When the trap was added to the reaction before the enzyme, no products were formed, demonstrating that the trap effectively sequestered the RT (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5). Experiments were performed by binding the enzyme to the primer-template and then initiating the reaction by simultaneous addition of dNTPs and trap. In the presence of trap, approximately 2% of the enzymes on substrate A synthesized the 644 nucleotides needed to reach the end of the template, without dissociating. Approximately 60% of the enzymes dissociated before synthesizing 100 nucleotides. Under the same conditions, all the enzymes on substrate B dissociated before adding 100 nucleotides. These results show a decrease in processivity, the number of nucleotides added per binding of RT to the polynucleotide substrate, when the enzyme performs strand displacement synthesis. Even when the strand displacement reactions were carried out for over 3 h in the absence of trap, we did not observe a high proportion of the upstream primer reaching the end of the template (not shown). We thought that extension may not have reached the end of the template because most the enzymes inactivated before synthesis could be completed. To test our hypothesis, we added fresh enzyme to the strand displacement reaction every 30 min and showed that with sufficient time, and a constant replenishment of RT, complete extension of initiated primers can be accomplished (not shown). The effect of HIV NC, E. coli SSB, and human RP-A in the strand displacement reaction was tested. Single-stranded binding proteins exist in all cell types and are often used to stimulate DNA replication (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). NC is a viral protein that normally coats part of the viral genome in vivo. NC promotes strand exchange from double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA favoring the most stable complex (Tsuchihashi et al., 1994). NC was titrated into the strand displacement reactions at concentrations ranging from 1.2 μM to 75 nM. These concentrations of NC are enough to cover 200% to 12.5% of the DNA in the reactions. At high concentrations, NC was inhibitory for synthesis, and, at low concentrations, no stimulation of strand displacement was observed (not shown). The effect of NC was tested by adding NC before and after preincubation of the substrate with RT. To investigate whether the effect of NC was due to the melting of the primer away from the template, we fractionated an aliquot of the completed reactions on a native polyacrylamide gel. We found approximately the same proportion of unannealed primers in the presence and absence of NC (not shown). We then tested whether a protein known to stimulate DNA synthesis by melting template secondary structure could enhance the reaction. E. coli SSB has this capacity, presumably because of its ability to bind and stabilize single-stranded DNA (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). Decreasing concentrations of SSB were added to the strand displacement reactions after preincubation of the substrate with HIV-RT (Fig. 4A). E. coli SSB enhanced the extent of strand displacement synthesis, especially at concentrations of 150 nM and lower (lanes 3-5). In order to quantitate this enhancement, we measured the percent of the extended products longer than 400 nucleotides. There was an approximately 3-fold increase in these products in the presence of E. coli SSB. Furthermore, the percent of extended primers in the presence and absence of E. coli SSB remained constant. This indicates that E. coli SSB affected the reaction by increasing the length of the extension products rather than increasing the amount of extended products. This effect of E. coli SSB was unchanged when the protein was preincubated with the substrate before the addition of the RT. When E. coli SSB was present at 600 and 300 nM (lanes 1 and 2), the enhancement of strand displacement synthesis was diminished. This could be because E. coli SSB aggregates at high concentrations (Kornberg and Baker, 1992), and its ability to enhance strand displacement synthesis could be impaired. Finally, the effect of human RP-A on the strand displacement reactions was tested (Fig. 4B). RP-A is the human analog of E. coli SSB. It binds single-stranded DNA, and it can stimulate the activity of polymerases and helicases (Henricksen et al., 1994). Like E. coli SSB, RP-A enhanced the percent of extended primers that were longer than 400 nucleotides. Using the PhosphorImager, we measured a 4-6-fold increase in the percent of these products in the presence of 35-140 nM RP-A (lanes 1-3). When RP-A was present at 280 nM, virtually no synthesis occurred (lane 4). At 140 nM RP-A, the percent of extended primers was decreased, and, at 70 and 35 nM, the percentage of extended primers in the presence and absence of RP-A remained constant. Therefore, RP-A increases the formation of long products, even when it is present at levels high enough to decrease the total amount of synthesis. The inhibition of polymerases by RP-A has been observed previously (Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991), possibly because high concentration RP-A blocks the binding of the polymerase to the primer terminus. It is possible that during reverse transcription, two(-)-strand DNAs are synthesized from the two RNAs found in the virion. In vivo, the presence of the second (-)-strand DNA in the reaction may enhance strand displacement synthesis by binding or stabilizing the displaced segment of DNA. In order to test this hypothesis, we designed an 834-nucleotide-long DNA which was complementary to the downstream DNA primer. This DNA was called the acceptor DNA. It was made longer than the template DNA so that the two strands could be distinguished by electrophoretic mobility. The strand displacement reaction was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of the acceptor DNA (Fig. 5). The presence of acceptor DNA did not stimulate strand displacement synthesis. Instead, the primer DNA transferred to the acceptor DNA whether there was a downstream segment of DNA annealed to the template or not. The primer did not have homology to the acceptor DNA until it had been elongated by at least 10 nucleotides. Transfer in the absence of a downstream segment of DNA, substrate A, was first observed when the acceptor DNA was present at a 10-fold excess over the template DNA. Transfer in the presence of a downstream segment of DNA, substrate B, was first observed when the acceptor DNA was present at a 5-fold excess over the template DNA. Furthermore, with substrate B, virtually no full-length products were seen. This transfer phenomenon was not specific for HIV-RT, since Sequenase™ was also found to perform this reaction (not shown). During HIV replication, a DNA segment approximately 637 nucleotides in length needs to be displaced in order to generate the long terminal repeats. Strand displacement by HIV-RT in vitro has been documented previously for substrates 50 or less nucleotides in length (Huber et al., 1989; Hottiger et al., 1994). Preliminary results from our laboratory (not shown) using similar substrates showed a small but noticeable slowing of primer elongation in the presence of a downstream primer. This suggested that displacement of the natural LTR region, as is necessary in vivo, might be a daunting problem for the RT. When we measured strand displacement synthesis on an LTR substrate in vitro, we found that, indeed, synthesis was slow and inefficient. In fact, the primer elongation rate was reduced by approximately 12-fold from synthesis over an LTR sequence template lacking the long downstream primer. Whiting and Champoux(1994) reported that murine leukemia virus RT was able to displace 1334 base pairs of DNA with approximately a 10-fold reduction in the rate of synthesis. These results show a similarity in strand displacement rates between these two RTs despite the differences in the substrate used. After infection by HIV-1 in cell culture, it takes 4-8 h before complete polymerization is observed (Kim et al., 1989). Synthesis of two strands of 9.5 kilobases each must occur. This requires a minimum synthetic rate of 0.65-1.31 nucleotides per s. In this study, we observed a polymerization rate of 3.3 nucleotides per s in the absence of a downstream primer. This is comparable to the polymerization rate observed by Klarmann et al.(1993) and Yu and Goodman(1992) of 1-3 nucleotides per s over heteropolymeric templates. In our system, the polymerization rate in the presence of a downstream primer dropped to 0.28 nucleotide per s. It is still not known whether the (+)-strand is initiated at one or two sites, or if strand displacement is performed by one RT extending the (-)-DNA or by two RTs extending the(-)- and (+)-strands simultaneously (Fig. 1A). If two RTs extend the(-)- and (+)-strand simultaneously, it would take approximately the same time for one enzyme to synthesize through the whole LTR region (637 nucleotides/0.28 nucleotide/s = 38 min) as for the other enzyme to synthesize the rest of the (+)-strand (9000 nucleotides/3.3 nucleotides/s = 45 min). However, if the (+)-strand is initiated at two or more sites, strand displacement may be a rate-limiting step in the reaction. In either case, the rate of strand displacement that we have observed does not conflict with known information on the rate of viral growth in vivo. Nevertheless, it is remarkably slow compared to the synthesis rates of most DNA polymerases, which are hundreds to thousands of nucleotides per s (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). We observed that the HIV-RT is less processive for synthesis during strand displacement. The need to frequently rebind the primer-template during synthesis contributes to the length of time needed to complete primer elongation. The RT may also have a particularly difficult time rebinding at sequences that promote pausing and are likely positions for dissociation. Klarmann et al.(1993) observed that HIV-RT preferentially initiates synthesis at unextended primers, even when pause products comprise a significant proportion of potentially available primers. This is consistent with our observation that the entire population of primers that can be elongated grow slowly throughout the reaction. We attempted to enhance strand displacement by including single-stranded binding proteins in the reaction. Since viral NC protein normally coats part of the viral genome in vivo, we tested whether its presence would enhance the rate of synthesis. We did not see an enhancement of strand displacement synthesis over a wide range of tested NC concentrations. Current results with the LTR template showed an inhibition of DNA synthesis at high NC concentrations. We do not know why this inhibition is observed, but it does not seem to result from melting of the primer from the template by NC. On the other hand, E. coli SSB and human RP-A enhanced the extent of strand displacement in vitro. These proteins presumably act by stabilizing the displaced fragment of DNA. This makes displacement more energetically favorable. Stabilization of the single-stranded region may also discourage the partially displaced strand from promoting dissociation of either the RT or the 3′ end region of the upstream primer. Hottiger et al.(1994) did not report a stimulation of the HIV-RT strand displacement reaction catalyzed by E. coli SSB. However, the effects of SSB may not have been great for the 50-nucleotide segment displaced in their system. Even though RP-A enhances strand displacement in vitro, it is unknown whether it would do so in vivo. Immunocytochemistry studies have shown that RP-A is found almost exclusively in the nucleus (Kenny et al., 1990). It is widely accepted that reverse transcription occurs in the cytoplasm (Whitcomb and Hughes, 1992). Furthermore, it has been shown that full-length(-)-strand DNA can be found in the cytoplasm (Miller et al., 1995). These findings suggest that RP-A does not influence strand displacement synthesis in vivo. In another attempt to enhance the strand displacement reaction, we added an additional segment of single-stranded DNA to the reaction that was complementary to the downstream segment of DNA. The strand displacement/assimilation model suggests that the displaced DNA can actively migrate to a complementary piece of DNA. We expected that this process would stimulate the displacement reaction by stabilizing the displaced strand in a double-stranded form. However, the presence of this DNA strand did not stimulate the strand displacement reaction. Instead, the extending upstream primer readily transferred to the new strand sometime after it had been extended by at least 10 nucleotides. This is an interesting observation since it suggests that recombination is possible during (+)-strand synthesis. The process may be due to complex secondary structures that are formed in the LTR template. Strand transfer in vitro is promoted at positions where the RT pauses during synthesis (Wu et al., 1995), and pausing correlates with secondary structure in the template (DeStefano et al., 1992). The transfer was observed in the presence or absence of a downstream DNA, but it appeared to be more efficient in the presence of a downstream DNA primer. During displacement, when the enzyme pauses or dissociates, the already displaced segment of DNA may reanneal to the template, forcing dissociation of the 3′ end region of the upstream primer. This process, called branch migration, is likely to occur between episodes of dissociation and reassociation of the RT that occur frequently during strand displacement synthesis. Once the 3′ terminus is dislodged, it would be expected to associate readily with the new complementary DNA. This process is so efficient in vitro, that when the complementary DNA is present in excess, virtually all extending primers undergo transfer. We propose that this reaction is a likely means of recombination in vivo. We thank Dr. Jasbir Seehra, from the Genetics Institute, for the generous gift of HIV-RT used in these studies.

https://openalex.org/W1991239330,"Heparin is capable of solubilizing a subset of collagen-tailed (A12) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecules from skeletal muscle fibers, but cannot detach AChE from the synaptic basal lamina (Rossi, S. G., and Rotundo, R. L.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19152-19159). In the present study, we used tissue-cultured quail myotubes to show that, like adult fibers, neither heparin- nor high salt-containing buffers detached AChE molecules from cell-surface clusters. Prelabeling clustered AChE molecules with anti-AChE monoclonal antibody 1A2 followed by incubation in heparin-containing medium showed that there was no reduction in the number or size of pre-existing AChE clusters. In contrast, incubation of myotubes with culture medium containing heparin for up to 4 days reversibly blocked the accumulation of new cell-surface AChE molecules without affecting the rate of AChE synthesis or assembly. Newly synthesized A12 AChE becomes tightly attached to the extracellular matrix following externalization. However, in the presence of heparin, blocking the initial interactions between A12 AChE and the extracellular matrix results in release of AChE into the medium with a t12 of ∼3 h. Together, these results suggest that once A12 AChE is localized on the cell surface, initially attached via electrostatic interactions, additional factors or events are responsible for its selective and more permanent retention on the basal lamina. Heparin is capable of solubilizing a subset of collagen-tailed (A12) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecules from skeletal muscle fibers, but cannot detach AChE from the synaptic basal lamina (Rossi, S. G., and Rotundo, R. L.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19152-19159).

The asymmetric collagen-tailed (A12) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 1The abbreviations used are: AChEacetylcholinesteraseHSPheparan sulfate proteoglycanAChRacetylcholine receptorHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionPBSphosphate-buffered salineDFPdiisopropyl fluorophosphateLSBlow salt extraction bufferHSBhigh salt extraction buffermAbmonoclonal antibodyTRITCtetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanateBTXα-bungarotoxin. molecule is the predominant oligomeric form of this enzyme at the neuromuscular junction, where it is attached to the synaptic basal lamina (reviewed by Taylor(1991) and Massouliéet al.(1993)). The molecular mechanisms underlying the highly selective targeting and retention of this synaptic component at the appropriate location on the cell surface are still not clearly understood, but probably involve a combination of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational events. In tissue-cultured skeletal muscle fibers, the AChE catalytic subunits are locally translated and assembled around the nuclei encoding their transcripts (Rotundo, 1990), and the newly synthesized AChE oligomers are selectively localized to regions of the cell surface over the nucleus of origin (Rossi and Rotundo, 1992). The levels of AChE mRNA, studied in tissue-cultured cells, appear to be regulated post-transcriptionally (Fuentes and Taylor, 1993). In vivo, transcripts encoding AChE are highly concentrated at the vertebrate neuromuscular synapse (Jasmin et al., 1993), suggesting that, like the tissue-cultured myotubes, AChE oligomers are locally transcribed, translated, assembled, and selectively localized to the overlying synaptic basal lamina. The inability of conventional extraction procedures to remove the junctional AChE molecules, such as high ionic strength buffers, polyanions, and chaotropic agents, suggests that the enzyme is covalently attached to the extracellular matrix (Rossi and Rotundo, 1993). acetylcholinesterase heparan sulfate proteoglycan acetylcholine receptor Hanks' balanced salt solution phosphate-buffered saline diisopropyl fluorophosphate low salt extraction buffer high salt extraction buffer monoclonal antibody tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate α-bungarotoxin. A likely candidate molecule involved in localizing AChE to the neuromuscular junction is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSP). A12 AChE binds specifically to heparin and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (Bon et al., 1978; Vigny et al., 1983; Brandan et al., 1985; Brandan and Inestrosa, 1986) and can be solubilized from muscle with heparin (Torres and Inestrosa, 1983; Barat et al., 1986) or other polyanions (Pérez-Tur et al., 1991a). Electron microscopy of negatively stained aggregates of A12 AChE and polyanionic components of the extracellular matrix from Torpedo electric organs shows that the distal regions of the collagen-like tail are involved in the binding (Bon et al., 1978). Brandan and Inestrosa(1984) demonstrated that only the A12 AChE form binds to heparin-agarose, indicating that binding is dependent on the noncatalytic collagen-like tail subunit, and only heparin is able to displace the bound AChE. In contrast, however, heparin does not detach A12 AChE from the synaptic basal lamina (Rossi and Rotundo, 1993). Although widely distributed throughout the extracellular matrix surrounding muscle fibers, HSP also extends into the junctional region, where its density is increased severalfold on the synaptic basal lamina (Bayne et al., 1981; Anderson and Fambrough, 1983; Sanes et al., 1986). The deposition of HSP is spatially and temporally correlated with AChR aggregation in developing myotubes and at developing neuromuscular synapses in culture (see Anderson and Fambrough(1983) and Bayne et al.(1984); reviewed by Hall and Sanes(1993)). Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between the formation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters and subsequent accumulation of extracellular matrix components, including HSPs, in cultured muscle cells (Bayne et al., 1984; Swenarchuk et al., 1990). Agrin, a protein originally isolated from basal lamina-rich extracts of Torpedo electric organs, induces the clustering of AChR, AChE, butyrylcholinesterase, the cytoplasmic AChR-associated 43-kDa protein, and HSP on chick myotubes in culture (Wallace et al., 1985; Nitkin et al., 1987; Wallace, 1989; Lieth and Fallon, 1993). However, in myotubes pretreated with inhibitors of protein synthesis, aggregates of HSP and AChE were not detected even though agrin continued to induce the formation of AChR aggregates (Wallace, 1989). These observations indicate that the formation of HSP and AChE clusters are downstream events from the initial AChR clustering and suggest that they may possibly be linked. In quail skeletal muscle cultures, the A12 AChE form is clustered on the upper surface of the myotubes, where it can be removed using purified collagenase (Rossi and Rotundo, 1992). However, the mechanism of attachment of the clustered A12 AChE has not been analyzed in detail. In this study, we show that heparin does not detach A12 AChE previously clustered on the surface of myotubes. In contrast, heparin reversibly blocks the accumulation of newly synthesized A12 AChE in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that only the newly synthesized A12 AChE molecules can be solubilized from the cell surface. In untreated cultures, these molecules become tightly linked to the extracellular matrix, whereas in the presence of heparin, they are readily removed. This study suggests that HSPs are involved in the initial targeting of AChE to specialized regions of the cell surface, but that once localized, more permanent mechanisms of attachment are formed. Pectoral muscle cells from 10-day-old quail embryos were grown on scratched collagen-coated coverslips (25-mm diameter) in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% chick embryo extract, 10% horse serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (EMEM 210) as described previously (Rossi and Rotundo, 1992). Cultures were fed on the third day and every other day thereafter. When used, 0.5-1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma, H-3393; Mr 9,000-21,000) was dissolved directly in the medium, and the cultures were fed at the indicated times. Other test compounds added to the culture medium included polyaspartate (Sigma), dextran sulfate (Sigma), and sodium chlorate (NaClO3; Fluka Chemical Co.) at the indicated concentrations. In some experiments, differentiated myotubes were incubated in serum-free defined medium (Bottenstein and Sato, 1979) modified for muscle culture (Rubin, 1985). Sulfate-free defined medium (Imai et al., 1994) was prepared using 50 × Eagle's minimal essential medium amino acid stock solution and 100 × vitamin supplement (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) and Earle's salts as recommended by the manufacturer, substituting sodium chloride for magnesium sulfate. Cell-surface AChE activity was determined using a modification of the method of Johnson and Russell(1975) for whole cultures (Rotundo and Fambrough, 1980). Cultures were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and twice with PBS, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 1 ml of buffered substrate mixture/dish. The buffer/substrate mixture consisted of 0.6 mM unlabeled acetylcholine in PBS and 0.1 μCi of [3H]acetylcholine (DuPont NEN; specific activity = 73.7 mCi/mmol). All incubations were done at 4°C to prevent secretion of AChE from the intracellular pool. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots from each culture were removed and mixed with 1.5 ml of 50 mM glycine HCl buffer (pH 2.5) with 2 M NaCl in scintillation vials, and the labeled acetate was counted by addition of 5 ml of ACS scintillation fluid containing 20% 1-butanol (v/v). Under these assay conditions, the assay was linear for >1 h. To measure the effects of heparin on cell-surface AChE activity during development in culture, three cultures per group were washed three times with 2 ml of PBS and placed on ice, and the reaction was started by addition of 1 ml of buffer/substrate mixture. After a 1-h incubation, 100-μl aliquots were removed and counted. Alternatively, AChE oligomeric forms expressed on the cell surface were analyzed by velocity sedimentation following protection with the water-soluble reversible AChE inhibitor BW284c51 and irreversible inactivation of the intracellular AChE with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) as described previously (Rotundo, 1984b). Under these conditions, >80% of the total cell-surface AChE is protected by BW284c51 (data not shown). Muscle culture AChE was extracted using borate extraction buffer containing 20 mM borate buffer (pH 9.0), 5 mM EDTA, 0.03-1 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM benzamidine, 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide, and 0.7 mM bacitracin, with or without 0.5-1 mg/ml heparin. Triton X-100 was omitted from the solution when live cells were treated with extraction buffers to test removal of surface AChE. Alternatively, cultures were washed with PBS and extracted with PBS containing either additional NaCl or polyanions at the indicated concentrations. Low salt extraction buffer (LSB) consisted of borate extraction buffer with 30 mM NaCl, and high salt extraction buffer (HSB) contained 1.0 M NaCl. To quantitate newly synthesized AChE, three 35-mm cultures dishes per group were rinsed three times with HBSS, followed by a 10-min incubation with 10 μM DFP in HBSS to irreversibly inhibit all AChE activity. The cultures were then rinsed with HBSS and returned to the culture incubator for 24 h in modified defined medium with or without heparin. To identify secreted AChE forms, 200-μl aliquots of medium from each dish were analyzed by velocity sedimentation. The three cultures per group were then rinsed with HBSS and extracted in a total volume of 600 μl of borate extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 M NaCl (HSB) to determine total cell-associated AChE forms. The pooled culture extracts were homogenized and centrifuged for 20 min in a microcentrifuge (4°C, 14,000 rpm). The AChE oligomeric forms were resolved by velocity sedimentation on 5-20% sucrose gradients for 16 h at 32,000 rpm in an SW 50.1 rotor. Fifteen-drop fractions were collected, and AChE activity was assayed by a modification of the radiometric method of Johnson and Russell(1975) as described previously (Rotundo and Fambrough, 1979). Clustered AChE molecules were localized by indirect immunofluorescence by incubation with 20 μg/ml mAb 1A2 (Rotundo, 1984a) for 30 min, followed by 10 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Laboratories). All incubations were done at 4°C in 1 ml/dish phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 10% horse serum (PBS/horse serum). In some experiments, 1 μg/ml TRITC α-BTX (Molecular Probes, Inc.), was included in the first incubation to localize acetylcholine receptor clusters. Following fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS to label nuclei. Coverslips were mounted in bicarbonate-buffered 90% glycerol containing 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine and viewed with a 40× objective on a Zeiss Universal microscope equipped for epifluorescence. For quantitation of AChE clusters, only accumulations >3 μm localized on the upper surface of the myotubes were counted in each field. The total number of nuclei in myotubes and the number of AChR clusters in the same field were also determined. Ten fields (350 μm2 each) were sampled from each coverslip culture, and three coverslips were quantitated for each point. The results are expressed as clusters per myotube nuclei (mean ± S.E.). The asymmetric AChE form accumulates in clusters on the upper surfaces of myotubes in culture (Rossi and Rotundo, 1992), possibly attached to heparan sulfate proteoglycan-like molecules. To determine whether high salt- or heparin-containing buffers could detach clustered AChE molecules from the extracellular matrix, 7-day-old quail muscle cultures were incubated for 1 h in either LSB or HSB with or without 0.5 mg/ml heparin. The cultures were rinsed with PBS, and the AChE clusters were visualized using anti-AChE mAb 1A2 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody. Consistent with our findings on intact adult muscle fibers (Rossi and Rotundo, 1993). neither heparin nor high salt buffers could remove the AChE molecules from cell-surface clusters, indicating that, even in culture, the standard high salt- or heparin-containing buffers cannot solubilize the matrix-bound AChE (Fig. 1). In addition, we have attempted to remove the cell-surface AChE with chaotropic agents. Extraction buffers containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or 4 M urea, concentrations that still leave the cells attached to the substratum, do not remove AChE (data not shown). To quantitate the amount of cell-surface AChE remaining after the different extraction procedures, three cultures per group were incubated for 1 h with PBS alone, PBS plus 1.0 mg/ml heparin, PBS with 1.0 M NaCl, or PBS with 1 M NaCl and 1.0 mg/ml heparin; and the remaining cell-surface AChE activity was assayed. Control cultures were incubated with PBS alone. The results show that neither heparin nor high concentrations of NaCl removed catalytically active AChE molecules from the cell surface (Table 1). In addition, other polyanion-containing buffers have also been shown to solubilize at least some asymmetric AChE from adult chicken muscle (Pérez-Tur et al., 1991a). To determine whether any of these buffers could detach AChE clusters on quail myotubes, the number of clusters per nucleus was quantitated following solubilization. The results, shown in Table 2, indicate that AChE was not detached even after 1 h of extraction using high salt- or polyanion-containing buffers. Following cell fusion and formation of multinucleated myotubes, the cells begin to produce the collagen-tailed A12 AChE form capable of clustering on the cell surface. The clusters of AChE molecules begin to form around day 5 in culture, coincident with the onset of spontaneous contractile activity. To determine whether long-term exposure to heparin affected the accumulation of cell-surface AChE activity, muscle cultures were incubated for 1 h to 4 days in normal medium containing 0.5 mg/ml heparin. At the indicated times, the cultures were rinsed with PBS, and cell-surface AChE activity was assayed. Fig. 2A shows the linearity of cell-surface AChE activity with time for each group assayed on day 7. The results in Fig. 2B show the effect of long-term heparin treatment on cell-surface AChE activity during development of myotubes. There was a time-dependent inhibition of cell-surface AChE activity accumulation during exposure to heparin-containing medium that occurred coincident with the onset of A12 AChE form accumulation on day 5, suggesting that heparin blocks the attachment of the enzyme molecules to specific cell-surface sites. To determine whether only the attachment of newly synthesized AChE is affected by heparin, 5-day cultures were incubated with DFP for 10 min and returned to normal or heparin-containing medium for 2 days. The accumulation of newly synthesized cell-surface AChE was decreased by 30% in the presence of heparin (data not shown; however, see below and Fig. 7B). Since cell-surface AChE has been shown to form clusters that correlate with the localization of heparan sulfate proteoglycan on tissue-cultured myotubes and is colocalized with the same heparan sulfate proteoglycan concentrated at sites of nerve-muscle contact in adult muscle, we sought to determine whether heparin could inhibit the formation of AChE clusters. Tissue-cultured myotubes grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips were incubated in the presence of heparin at concentrations ranging from 0.1 μg/ml (0.01 μM) to 1.5 mg/ml (100 μM) (based on an average Mr of 15,000) from days 5 to 7. The clusters were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence, and the number of AChE clusters per nucleus was determined. Fig. 3 shows that heparin inhibited the formation of AChE clusters in a concentration-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition near 10 μg/ml or ∼1 μM. Since the inhibition of cell-surface AChE accumulation and lack of cell-surface AChE cluster formation could also result from an inhibition of AChE biosynthesis, we measured the effect of heparin on newly synthesized AChE. Six-day-old muscle cultures were preincubated in complete medium with or without 1 mg/ml heparin for 24 h. The cultures were then treated with DFP in HBSS to inhibit all AChE, followed by washing and recovery for 2 h in complete medium with or without heparin. Under these conditions, the rate of appearance of AChE activity is linear with time and cell numbers and reflects the rate of de novo AChE synthesis (Rotundo and Fambrough, 1980). After a 2-h recovery, the total AChE activity was (4.89 ± 0.08) × 103 cpm in control cultures versus (4.70 ± 0.09) × 103 cpm in cultures incubated with heparin. We conclude that there are no long-term effects of heparin on AChE synthesis. Heparin could decrease the amount of cell-surface AChE and the accumulation of enzyme clusters either by a decrease in targeting and retention of AChE at cell-surface clusters or by gradually removing enzyme molecules from previously formed clusters, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, myotube cultures were incubated with medium containing 0.5 mg/ml heparin beginning on day 3, 5, or 6 of culture. AChE clusters were localized by indirect immunofluorescence using mAb 1A2; AChR clusters were localized using TRITC α-BTX; and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 on the indicated days. The presence of heparin in the medium prevented the formation of new AChE clusters in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In contrast, heparin had no effect on the spontaneous formation of AChR clusters (Fig. 4B), indicating that the heparin effects are specific for AChE. Note that, in these cultures, the density of AChR clusters is about an order of magnitude lower than that of the AChE clusters, a ratio that we have consistently observed in our quail muscle cultures. To determine whether heparin could disperse or release previously clustered AChE molecules, 6-day-old myotubes were incubated with anti-AChE mAb 1A2 for 2 h, washed in complete medium, and incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of complete medium containing 1 mg/ml heparin. The cultures were rinsed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody on day 7, and the number of AChE clusters per nucleus was quantitated. Our results show that heparin did not remove AChE once localized to clusters since the number of clusters per nucleus in cultures incubated in heparin-containing medium from days 6 to 7 following mAb 1A2 addition on day 6 is virtually identical to that in the day 6 controls (Fig. 5). Long-term heparin treatment of cultured muscle cells reduced the accumulation of cell-surface AChE. If heparin acted by blocking the attachment of A12 AChE to a heparan sulfate-like proteoglycan, the observed effects should then be reversible upon removal of heparin from the medium. Cultures treated from days 3 to 6 with heparin-containing medium were rinsed extensively to remove the polyanions and incubated in normal medium from days 6 to 7. The results, shown in Fig. 6, indicate that the heparin effect was at least partially reversible since the clustering of AChE molecules reappeared upon removal of heparin. To quantitate the reversibility of long-term heparin treatment, muscle cultures maintained in heparin-containing medium for 2-3 days were rinsed and returned to normal medium for either 1 or 2 days. The cultures were then incubated with mAb 1A2 to localize and quantitate AChE clusters. As a control, AChE was immunolocalized immediately after heparin treatment (Table 3). The rapid reappearance of AChE clusters following heparin removal suggests that the AChE attachment sites remained localized in the absence of AChE deposition while heparin was in the medium. The A12 AChE form appears to bind only to sulfated proteoglycans (Bon et al., 1978). Therefore, if A12 AChE molecules are localized to specific regions of the cell surface by heparan sulfate-like proteoglycans, and this interaction involves the glycan portions of the molecules, then disruption of post-translational processing of the proteoglycans should also disrupt binding and localization of the asymmetric AChE molecules. To test this possibility, tissue-cultured myotubes were incubated for 24-48 h in the presence of 10 mM sodium chlorate, which inhibits proteoglycan sulfation (Higashiyama et al., 1993). As shown in Table 4(Experiment 1), 10 mM sodium chlorate inhibited the normal increase in cell-surface clusters by 60%, consistent with the hypothesis that the sulfated glycan portion of the molecule probably plays an important role in localizing AChE to the extracellular matrix. A similar reduction in AChE clusters was observed when the myotubes were incubated in sulfate-free defined medium (Table 4, Experiment 2), and the effects were reversed by addition of 800 μM exogenous sodium sulfate. To determine whether the effects of sodium chlorate were due to decreased AChE synthesis, mature 6-day-old muscle cultures were incubated in complete medium with or without 10 mM sodium chlorate for 24 h, and the rates of AChE synthesis were determined. After a 24-h incubation in 10 mM sodium chlorate and in the continued presence of sodium chlorate, the rate of AChE synthesis was (5.50 ± 0.09) × 103 cpm/2 h compared with (4.89 ± 0.08) × 103 cpm in control cultures. Thus, the observed decrease in AChE cluster formation is not due to a decrease in AChE synthesis in the presence of sodium chlorate. The A12 AChE form is normally associated with the cell surface of tissue-cultured myotubes, where it is tightly bound to the extracellular matrix. This form has not been previously observed secreted into the medium of muscle cultures, where only the soluble dimeric and tetrameric forms accumulate. To determine whether heparin could prevent the attachment of newly synthesized A12 AChE to the cell surface, muscle cultures were treated with DFP to irreversibly inhibit all AChE enzyme activity and incubated in defined medium devoid of serum or embryo extract esterases. The newly synthesized AChE forms associated with the cells or secreted into the medium over a 24-h period were analyzed by velocity sedimentation. In the presence of heparin, the collagen-tailed AChE accumulated in the medium (Fig. 7A) rather than on the cell surface (Fig. 7B). Incubation of muscle cultures with heparin-containing medium prevented the formation of cell-surface AChE clusters without apparent effect on the synthesis of AChE since the total amount of globular enzyme molecules synthesized following DFP treatment was not affected (Fig. 7). The small amount of asymmetric form associated with the cells incubated in heparin-containing medium most likely reflects the accumulation of the intracellular pool, which accounts for up to 50% of the total asymmetric AChE forms in quail muscle cultures (Rotundo, 1984b; Fernandez-Valle and Rotundo, 1989). To determine whether asymmetric AChE bound directly to heparin molecules present in the medium, we biotinylated the heparin used in our experiments using N-hydroxysuccinimide-(long chain)-biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol such that only 1-2 biotin molecules would be attached to each heparin molecule. The biotinylated heparin was adsorbed onto avidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma), washed, and incubated with aliquots of isolated AChE oligomeric forms prepared by velocity sedimentation of tissue-cultured muscle cell extracts. This procedure ensured that only the newly assembled collagen-tailed AChE forms present in the intracellular pool (or the weakly attached externalized enzyme molecules present on the cell surface) would be isolated. The relative amounts of AChE bound were determined by direct enzymatic assay of the washed beads (Fig. 8). In concordance with the results of Brandan and Inestrosa(1984), there was selective binding of the A12 AChE form to heparin. The small amount of G4 binding probably reflects contamination of this fraction with the A8 or A4 forms, consisting of either two or four tetramers attached to collagen-like tail subunits. “Nonspecific” binding in this assay, as measured by the binding of the G2 AChE form, is ∼8%. We can conclude that there is probably a direct interaction between the heparin and the A12 AChE form in these experiments. One prediction, based upon the above results, is that the most recently synthesized cell-surface AChE molecules should become tightly associated with the extracellular matrix shortly after externalization in untreated cultures, whereas in the presence of heparin, even the reduced numbers of molecules present on the surface would be only weakly associated with or possibly physically trapped within the matrix. To test this hypothesis, tissue-cultured myotubes, incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml heparin from days 5 to 7, were incubated with or without 10 μg/ml puromycin for 9 h. This protocol allows sufficient time to chase the intracellular pool of AChE oligomeric forms onto the cell surface (∼3 h) (Rotundo and Fambrough, 1980) and allows time for dissociation and/or diffusion of the weakly or nonattached molecules into the medium. Cell-surface AChE was assayed on three dishes per group before and after extraction using the high ionic strength extraction buffer (HSB) to distinguish between electrostatically and tightly attached AChE molecules (Fig. 9). The high ionic strength extraction buffer did not remove significant amounts of cell-surface AChE activity (less than ±5%) from untreated myotubes when compared with unextracted control values (100 ± 3%), either with or without puromycin for 9 h, indicating that the surface AChE molecules, including those most recently externalized, are tightly attached to the extracellular matrix. In contrast, in heparin-treated cultures, where only half (51 ± 7%) of the control levels of AChE activity had accumulated on the cell surface, an additional 30% of the enzyme was removed by extraction with HSB. These results indicate that, in the presence of heparin, most of the surface AChE was electrostatically associated with the extracellular matrix and that only 22 ± 4% of the total surface activity was not extractable with HSB. Incubation of heparin-treated cultures with puromycin indicated that more than one-third of the cell-surface enzyme on heparin-treated myotubes consisted of newly synthesized molecules, that 60% of the previously synthesized AChE molecules were extractable with HSB (compare extracted and unextracted surface AChE activity in heparin-treated cultures), and that only 14% of the cell-surface AChE remained attached to the extracellular matrix of myotubes treated with heparin plus puromycin, followed by extraction with HSB (Fig. 9). These results indicate that most of the cell-surface AChE in heparin-treated myotubes was recently synthesized and high salt-extractable. Therefore, most of the molecules that are associated with the extracellular matrix of heparin-treated myotubes appear to be either weakly associated with components of the extracellular matrix or physically trapped between the matrix and the plasma membrane. A second prediction based on our results would be that the small pool of “extractable” cell-surface A12 AChE molecules, those that have not yet formed tight associations with other molecules, would appear less stable in the presence of heparin, where they would be prevented from short-term interactions with the extracellular matrix. As can be seen in Fig. 9, this pool of extractable AChE molecules constitutes only a very small percentage of the total surface AChE activity. To estimate the relative association time of cell-surface A12 AChE molecules in the presence or absence of heparin, three myotube cultures per group were incubated in the same medium with or without puromycin for 3, 5, 7, or 9 h. Following protection of the cell-surface AChE with BW284c51, the “soluble” surface AChE forms were extracted with HSB and analyzed on sucrose gradients, and A12 AChE was quantitated (Fig. 10). In untreated controls, there was a small but detectable decrease in the amount of extractable A12 AChE during the puromycin chase period, suggesting that a portion of the matrix-associated molecules could maintain electrostatic interactions with the cell surface. In the presence of heparin, however, this small pool was unstable and could rapidly dissociate or diffuse away from the matrix. In the presence of puromycin, there was a rapid decrease in the amount of extractable A12 AChE with time in puromycin to levels <5% of control. This experiment indicates that most of the newly synthesized A12 AChE molecules could not maintain their association with the extracellular matrix in the presence of heparin. The synaptic basal lamina of skeletal muscle fibers contains higher concentrations of several identified molecules, including AChE and heparan sulfate proteoglycan(s), compared with non-innervated regions (reviewed by Massouliéet al.(1993) and Hall and Sanes(1993)). Of the several AChE oligomeric forms expressed in muscle, the asymmetric collagen-tailed, or A12, form appears to be the most abundant at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. Its mechanism of attachment to the synaptic basal lamina is generally thought to be through electrostatic interactions with glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan or dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (Bon et al., 1978; Brandan and Inestrosa, 1987; Pérez-Tur et al., 1991b; Melo and Brandan, 1993). Heparin is capable of solubilizing A12 AChE molecules from vertebrate muscle (Torres and Inestrosa, 1983; Brandan and Inestrosa, 1984, 1986; Barat et al., 1986; Pérez-Tur et al., 1991a) as well as from some neural preparations (Torres et al., 1983). This selective solubilization, together with the strong evidence for direct interactions between A12 AChE and proteoglycans, argues that they may play a role in the anchorage of asymmetric forms to the synaptic basal lamina. On the other hand, we have recently shown that heparin does not detach AChE from the neuromuscular junctions of adult fast and slow quail muscles or from rat muscles (Rossi and Rotundo, 1993). Furthermore, we demonstrated that essentially all of the immunohistochemically detectable enzyme localized on the synaptic basal lamina was tightly attached and could not be removed by high ionic strength buffers, detergents, or chaotropic agents such as guanidine HCl or urea. Only collagenase was able to detach the enzyme (Hall and Kelly, 1971; Betz and Sakmann, 1973; Rossi and Rotundo, 1993), indicating that the basal lamina-associated AChE is most likely covalently linked to one or more molecular components of the extracellular matrix. In this study, we show that, like the adult neuromuscular junction, short-term treatment (≤1 h) of tissue-cultured myotubes with heparin did not detach the AChE molecules associated with cell-surface clusters (Fig. 1), nor did it remove catalytically active enzyme molecules from the cell surface (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Similar results were obtained using the standard high salt- or polyanion-containing buffers, which also were unable to solubilize the matrix-bound AChE (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas incubation of the cultures with purified collagenase removed the surface AChE (Rossi and Rotundo, 1992). These results support the idea that clustered AChE molecules on the surfaces of myotubes are attached in the same manner as at sites of nerve-muscle contact in vivo. In contrast with the inability of heparin to extract previously clustered AChE molecules, long-term exposure to heparin in culture blocked the accumulation of catalytically active AChE on the myotube surface (Fig. 2) as well as the formation of new surface AChE clusters (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). This effect was detectable only after days 3-4 in culture, coincident with the onset of A12 AChE expression and its deposition in clusters on the muscle cell surface. The normal increase in number of AChE clusters per nucleus was prevented when incubations were extended over periods of several days in heparin-containing medium. However, heparin did not prevent the spontaneous formation of AChR clusters, indicating that the effects are specific for AChE (Fig. 4). This heparin block was reversible (Fig. 6 and Table 3), and newly synthesized AChE molecules continued to accumulate once heparin was removed from the medium, suggesting that heparin was interacting directly with the A12 AChE molecule, as shown in Fig. 8, rather than disrupting the binding sites for AChE on the extracellular matrix. Although our present observations on tissue-cultured myotubes, as well as those in vivo (Rossi and Rotundo, 1993), may appear contradictory to published studies from other laboratories, they are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. The A12 AChE form is assembled intracellularly in the Golgi apparatus (Rotundo, 1984a) and must then be transported to the cell surface and secreted prior to attachment to the extracellular matrix. For this reason, a significant pool of intracellular A12 AChE molecules is usually found in mature muscle fibers (Younkin et al., 1982) as well as in cultured cells (Rotundo, 1984a; Brandan and Inestrosa, 1984). Once externalized, most of the A12 AChE molecules appear to accumulate either in clusters on tissue-cultured myotubes or on specialized regions of the muscle fiber surface in vivo. Therefore, the fraction of A12 molecules solubilized by heparin most likely corresponds to those molecules in the intracellular pool residing in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus as well as those that have been externalized but have not yet been strongly attached to the basal lamina. However, once attached, a large fraction of the A12 AChE molecules can no longer be removed by high salt buffers or polyanions, indicating that the association is through more than simply electrostatic interactions. These are the A12 AChE molecules that accumulate in cell-surface AChE clusters in culture or at the neuromuscular junction in vivo. In addition to the tight association between the A12 AChE molecules and the extracellular matrix, we also find that the A12 AChE molecules undergo transient electrostatic interactions as well. In the presence of heparin, the newly synthesized A12 AChE forms were secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 7) rather than accumulated on the extracellular matrix. Under normal culture conditions, only a small fraction of the total surface AChE appears to be electrostatically associated with the extracellular matrix and extractable with HSB (Fig. 9). When heparin is present to interact with the collagen-like tail over long periods, the accumulation of cell-surface AChE is prevented since most of the enzyme (86% of control) either has diffused away (50% of the total cell-surface AChE is not bound to the extracellular matrix in the presence of heparin) or is weakly associated with the cell surface and easily extractable with HSB (30% of control). In these experiments, only the most recently synthesized A12 enzyme appears electrostatically attached to the extracellular matrix (Fig. 9 and 10). The relatively small pool of these molecules on the cell surface of untreated cells would suggest that the more permanent attachment of A12 AChE occurs fairly rapidly, even in tissue culture. In summary, our results are consistent with earlier observations and suggest that a sulfated proteoglycan(s) is the target for localizing newly synthesized A12 AChE molecules on the synaptic basal lamina. In the current model, HSP molecules would initially form cell-surface clusters, either spontaneously in nerve-free muscle cultures or induced at sites of nerve-muscle contact. These localized accumulations would then serve as attachment sites for the A12 AChE molecules. This mechanism for localizing AChE at sites of nerve-muscle contact may explain why the appearance of AChE at ectopic synapses in vivo is such a late event compared with the appearance of AChRs (Lömo and Slater, 1980) and how AChE can reaccumulate at the original synaptic sites following muscle regeneration in the absence of nerves (Anglister and McMahan, 1985), reinnervation of empty basal lamina sheaths (Anglister, 1991), and restoration of muscle activity by reinnervation through ectopic synapses (Weinberg and Hall, 1979). Furthermore, this model provides a mechanism for regulating the numbers and distribution of AChE molecules on the synaptic basal lamina, where the accumulation of HSP molecules at sites of nerve-muscle contact could act as a molecular “parking lot” for the subsequent insertion and removal of the A12 AChE molecules at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction.

We mutated the human LPL cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis in order to produce the G142E hLPL in which the glycine 142 was replaced by a glutamic acid.

INTRODUCTIONLipoprotein lipase (LPL) 1The abbreviations used are: LPLlipoprotein lipasehLPLhuman LPLPBSphosphate-buffered salinerERrough endoplasmic reticulumWTwild typeELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTRITCtetrarhodamine isothiocyanate. is the major enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma(1.Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener Publishers, Inc., Chicago1987: 15-77Google Scholar). Genetic deficiency of LPL causes type I hyperlipoproteinemia syndrome, which is characterized by a significant increase of chylomicron levels in plasma and a marked increase in plasma triglyceride levels(2.Brunzell J.D. Scriver C.K. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1983: 1165-1180Google Scholar, 3.Eckel R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1060-1068Google Scholar).Functional LPL is a homodimeric glycoprotein with a subunit of 448 amino acids(4.Iverius P. Östlund-Lindqvist A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7791-7795Google Scholar). LPL is synthesized in parenchymal cells of tissues such as adipose tissue, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and ovary(5.Camps L. Reina M. Llobera M. Vilaró S. Olivecrona T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: 673-681Google Scholar, 6.Braun J.E.A. Severson D.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 337-347Google Scholar). After synthesis the enzyme is secreted and bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium(7.Jackson R.L. Baker H.N. Gillian E.B. Gotto A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1942-1945Google Scholar). At this site, LPL is rate-limiting for the hydrolysis and removal of triglycerides associated with chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins(8.Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 187-196Google Scholar). The monoglycerides and fatty acids liberated by the LPL reaction are further processed for tissue storage or oxidation. An important part of LPL regulation is a tissue-specific event that is associated to post-translational modifications of the enzyme(9.Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Google Scholar, 10.Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Google Scholar, 11.Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Google Scholar). This modifications might be essential for the expression of LPL catalytic activity. Among these, asparagine-linked glycosylation (12.Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K. Chen S-H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5429-5433Google Scholar) and dimerization of the protein (13.Osborne J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Google Scholar) have been suggested as interrelated processes that confer catalytic activity to LPL(14.Ailhaud G. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 23: 343-347Google Scholar).LPL secretion might also be a crucial regulatory point in the physiological action of the enzyme. Most secretory proteins such as LPL share a common biosynthetic origin in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), from which they are transported to the Golgi complex. In the trans-Golgi network proteins destined to the regulated secretory pathway are sorted from those to be constitutively secreted or sent to lysosomes for intracellular degradation. Secretory pathways involve vesicular transfer to the plasma membrane followed by the secretory event itself and exocytic discharge of vesicle contents(15.Halban P.A. Irminger C.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 299: 1-18Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of LPL deficiency, site-directed mutagenesis, and cellular expression of altered LPL cDNAs in heterologous systems have revealed that some missense changes lead to impaired or altered LPL secretion(16.Santamarina-Fojo S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 86Google Scholar), suggesting that both LPL secretion and enzyme activity are very sensitive to single amino acid exchanges. However, to date, the only single residue studied in some detail with a clear role in LPL secretion is Asn43. Replacement of Asn43 by Ala completely abolishes LPL enzyme activity, leading to the production of an inactive LPL, which accumulates inside the rER(12.Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K.

Invest. 1991; 87: 1165-1170Google Scholar) found that the substitution of a G for an A at nucleotide position 680 of human LPL cDNA, which produced a replacement of glycine 142 by a glutamic acid in the mature LPL protein, led to an inactive enzyme that was not efficiently secreted. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the intracellular destination of the nonsecreted LPL protein to gain further insight into the the mechanism of LPL secretion. We produced, by site-directed mutagenesis, a mutant hLPL carrying the substitution of a glutamic acid for glycine 142 (G142E hLPL), and we transfected COS1 cells with this construction and the wild type one (WT hLPL). The results obtained demonstrated that G142E hLPL presented reduced secretion compared with the WT hLPL, that heparin had no evident effect on the secretion of this mutant protein, and that after transport through the Golgi complex, lysosomes were the final degradation site of this altered, nonfunctional LPL. The findings reported suggest that the missorting of the mutant hLPL to lysosomes could act as a quality control mechanism of the secretory process of LPL.DISCUSSIONOur results suggest that secretion of the G142E hLPL is defective and heparin-insensitive and that the protein is missorted and diverted to lysosomes for degradation.Several studies have indicated that most LPL regulation occurs post-translationally. N-linked glycosylation at Asn43 of hLPL is essential in the development of the enzyme activity(12.Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K. Chen S-H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5429-5433Google Scholar, 32.Masuno H. Schultz C.J. Park J-W. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Mateo C. Scow R.O. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 801-809Google Scholar), and the absence of N-glycosylation at this residue leads to impaired LPL secretion and rER accumulation of the mutant protein(12.Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K. Chen S-H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5429-5433Google Scholar, 17.Buscà R. Pujana M.A. Pognonec P. Auwerx J. Deeb S. Reina M. Vilaró S. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 939-951Google Scholar). However, the model that emerges from the present results (obtained by cellular expression of mutant G142E hLPL) is clearly different, although both mutant proteins are retained inside the cell. In contrast to N43A hLPL, the present results suggest that G142E hLPL leaves the endoplasmic reticulum, as has been shown by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy; reaches the Golgi complex, as indicated by immunogold labeling, confocal analysis of double immunolocalizations and endoglycosidase H sensitivity of the mutant enzyme; and, instead of being secreted to the extracellular medium, is diverted to lysosomes for degradation, as demonstrated using leupeptin treatment, immunofluorescence, and immunogold detection studies. Thus, although the mutation G142E in hLPL leads to impaired secretion, as happens with the N43A hLPL, the intracellular fate of these mutants is different. The molecular and cellular basis of the different intracellular behavior of this mutant G142E hLPL protein is not clear at present.Glycoproteins processed by the trans-Golgi network can be sorted and sent to (i) lysosomes, (ii) constitutive secretory vesicles, (iii) regulated secretory vesicles and (iv) constitutive-like secretory vesicles(15.Halban P.A. Irminger C.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 299: 1-18Google Scholar). Studies performed to date indicate that LPL secretion is a complex event (see (6.Braun J.E.A. Severson D.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 337-347Google Scholar) for a complete review). Pulse-chase experiments have revealed that in adipocytes approximately 80% of the newly synthesized LPL is degraded(33.Cupp M. Bensadoun A. Melford K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6383-6388Google Scholar, 34.Vannier C. Ailhaud G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13206-13216Google Scholar). The main intracellular site for LPL degradation seems to be lysosomes, since leupeptin subtantially reduces the rate of LPL degradation(34.Vannier C. Ailhaud G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13206-13216Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that some LPL degradation may also occur in the rER(35.Ben-Zeev O. Doolittle M.H. Davis R.C. Elovson J. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6219-6227Google Scholar). This result appears to be controverted by other authors who report no rER LPL degradation in Brefeldin A-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells(36.Pradines-Figuères A. Vannier C. Ailhaud G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1467-1476Google Scholar). To explain the high degree of lysosomal LPL degradation observed, two different models have been proposed: Ailhaud (14.Ailhaud G. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 23: 343-347Google Scholar) proposed that active LPL homodimer is sorted either directly from the trans-Golgi to the lysosomes or the constitutive secretory pathway or to the regulated pathway, where the exocytosis of LPL from intracellular secretory vesicles might be accelerated by heparin by an unknown mechanism. It has been suggested that the control of LPL efflux from the Golgi compartment represents the main post-translational regulation of LPL secretion(27.Vannier C. Deslex S. Pradines-Figuères A. Ailhaud G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13199-13205Google Scholar, 37.Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar). In contrast, Cisar et al. (11.Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Google Scholar) proposed another model of LPL secretion in which newly synthesized enzyme would be transported to the cell surface, where it would bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors; LPL would then be either released to the extracellular medium or internalized via the receptor and either degraded in the lysosomes or recycled back to the cell surface. In our experimental system cells expressing the WT hLPL showed some degree of intracellular degradation (mostly in the lysosomes), since leupeptin treatment decreased the intracellular disappearance of the protein. Furthermore, secretion of WT hLPL to the extracellular medium was highly sensitive to heparin, indicating that although COS1 cells normally do not express LPL, they at least process the protein similarly to normal LPL-synthesizing cells. On the other hand, cells transfected with G142E hLPL and treated with leupeptin showed a 3-fold increase in LPL intracellular level. The mutant G142E hLPL had normal heparin binding capacity, but its secretion was not stimulated to the level of the WT hLPL upon heparin treatment, indicating that the intracellular compartment where G142E hLPL is retained might be slightly sensitive or insensitive to heparin modulation. Preliminar experiments performed by incubating transfected COS cells with antibodies against LPL indicated that at least part of the G142E hLPL reached the plasma membrane of the expressing cells. Contrary to what was observed in WT hLPL expressing cells, this membrane-bound mutant LPL was not sensitive to heparin release, suggesting that the membrane component that binds mutant LPL might not be a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The combination of our data demonstrates that the mutant G142E hLPL follows a different intracellular pathway from that of the WT hLPL, and we suggest that both pathways diverge at the level of the trans-Golgi network. The observation that some of the G142E hLPL escapes intracellular degradation and is detected in culture medium cannot be explained at present.Many active domains have been described in the present LPL molecule according to its homology with pancreatic lipase(38.van Tilbeurg H. Roussel A. Lalouel J-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Google Scholar). These domains include three clusters that confer the electrostatic potential to the molecule, the β5-loop, the lipid binding site, the C-terminal domain, the lid or surface loops covering the active site, and the active or catalytic site itself(39.Shamu C.E. Cox J. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Google Scholar). These domains play a crucial role in LPL function, and they are composed of several residues or clusters, which are clearly implied in the tertiary fold of the enzyme. So far, none of the domains described seems to include the Gly142 residue reported in this paper. However, the amino acid sequence surrounding glycine 142 is highly homologous in the several species whose LPL sequences are known. In their paper Ameis et al. (18.Ameis D. Kobayashi J. Davis R.C. Ben-zeev O. Malloy M.J. Kane J.P. Lee G. Wong H. Havel R.J. Schotz M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1165-1170Google Scholar) suggested that the reason for this high local sequence conservation might derive from its proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme (serine 132). Thus, the mutation G142E, which substitutes a large, negatively charged glutamic acid for a small, neutral glycine residue, disrupts the enzymatic function of LPL ((18.Ameis D. Kobayashi J. Davis R.C. Ben-zeev O. Malloy M.J. Kane J.P. Lee G. Wong H. Havel R.J. Schotz M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1165-1170Google Scholar) and this study). Since other missense mutations in the enzyme domains lead to the formation of inactive proteins that are normally secreted from the expressing cells, the results reported in this paper suggest that the Gly142 residue could have an additional role, ensuring the proper secretion of the molecule.At this point, the question to be elucidated concerns the molecular events that direct the mutant G142E hLPL to lysosomes for degradation. One possible explanation would be that the replacement of a glycine with a glutamic acid at position 142 of LPL produced a gross effect on the tertiary fold of the molecule, preventing its efficient secretion. This hypothesis appears unlikely since aberrant proteins carrying major conformational changes are retained within the rER by chaperone proteins, such as BiP and calnexin(40.Damhs N. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Google Scholar). This is the case of the N43A mutant hLPL(17.Buscà R. Pujana M.A. Pognonec P. Auwerx J. Deeb S. Reina M. Vilaró S. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 939-951Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is that this single amino acid change could create a specific missorting sequence signal that could lead the protein to the lysosomal compartment. As far as we know this is not the case, since no homology has been found between the amino acid sequence created by the mutation and any defined specific lysosome-targeting domains. Finally we can consider the possibility that the mutant G142E hLPL had a different oligosaccharide processing as a consequence of the amino acid change, which could confer affinity for lysosomal sorting to the mutant LPL through the mannose 6-phosphate targeting. The presence of the mannose 6-phosphate signal of lysosomal enzymes is extensively reported (41). Since this mechanism appears saturable and mannose 6-phosphate receptors travel to the plasma membrane, this could constitute an explanation of why some of the G142E hLPL is detected at this site and is secreted. Obviously, further studies will be necessary to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms that contribute in the missorting of G142E hLPL to lysosomes. The finding that the G142E hLPL is missorted to lysosomes and degraded suggests that this mechanism might represent an intracellular protein quality control system that would ensure the viability of the cell. INTRODUCTIONLipoprotein lipase (LPL) 1The abbreviations used are: LPLlipoprotein lipasehLPLhuman LPLPBSphosphate-buffered salinerERrough endoplasmic reticulumWTwild typeELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTRITCtetrarhodamine isothiocyanate. is the major enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma(1.Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener Publishers, Inc., Chicago1987: 15-77Google Scholar). Genetic deficiency of LPL causes type I hyperlipoproteinemia syndrome, which is characterized by a significant increase of chylomicron levels in plasma and a marked increase in plasma triglyceride levels(2.Brunzell J.D. Scriver C.K. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1983: 1165-1180Google Scholar, 3.Eckel R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1060-1068Google Scholar).Functional LPL is a homodimeric glycoprotein with a subunit of 448 amino acids(4.Iverius P. Östlund-Lindqvist A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7791-7795Google Scholar). LPL is synthesized in parenchymal cells of tissues such as adipose tissue, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and ovary(5.Camps L. Reina M. Llobera M. Vilaró S. Olivecrona T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: 673-681Google Scholar, 6.Braun J.E.A. Severson D.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 337-347Google Scholar). After synthesis the enzyme is secreted and bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium(7.Jackson R.L. Baker H.N. Gillian E.B. Gotto A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1942-1945Google Scholar). At this site, LPL is rate-limiting for the hydrolysis and removal of triglycerides associated with chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins(8.Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 187-196Google Scholar). The monoglycerides and fatty acids liberated by the LPL reaction are further processed for tissue storage or oxidation. An important part of LPL regulation is a tissue-specific event that is associated to post-translational modifications of the enzyme(9.Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Google Scholar, 10.Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Google Scholar, 11.Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Google Scholar). This modifications might be essential for the expression of LPL catalytic activity. Among these, asparagine-linked glycosylation (12.Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K. Chen S-H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5429-5433Google Scholar) and dimerization of the protein (13.Osborne J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Google Scholar) have been suggested as interrelated processes that confer catalytic activity to LPL(14.Ailhaud G. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 23: 343-347Google Scholar).LPL secretion might also be a crucial regulatory point in the physiological action of the enzyme. Most secretory proteins such as LPL share a common biosynthetic origin in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), from which they are transported to the Golgi complex. In the trans-Golgi network proteins destined to the regulated secretory pathway are sorted from those to be constitutively secreted or sent to lysosomes for intracellular degradation. Secretory pathways involve vesicular transfer to the plasma membrane followed by the secretory event itself and exocytic discharge of vesicle contents(15.Halban P.A. Irminger C.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 299: 1-18Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of LPL deficiency, site-directed mutagenesis, and cellular expression of altered LPL cDNAs in heterologous systems have revealed that some missense changes lead to impaired or altered LPL secretion(16.Santamarina-Fojo S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 86Google Scholar), suggesting that both LPL secretion and enzyme activity are very sensitive to single amino acid exchanges. However, to date, the only single residue studied in some detail with a clear role in LPL secretion is Asn43. Replacement of Asn43 by Ala completely abolishes LPL enzyme activity, leading to the production of an inactive LPL, which accumulates inside the rER(12.Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K. Chen S-H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5429-5433Google Scholar, 17.Buscà R. Pujana M.A. Pognonec P. Auwerx J. Deeb S. Reina M. Vilaró S. J. Lipid.

Despite these efforts, progress has been limited in clarifying the role of the higher oxidation states of the enzyme and the role and the number of tyrosyl radicals implicated in the catalytic mechanism. prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ethyl hydroperoxide t-butyl hydroperoxide m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid prostaglandin G2 prostaglandin H2 diethyldithiocarbamate. Upon reaction with organic hydroperoxides, two distinct spectral intermediates of PGH synthase are formed resembling compound I and compound II peroxidase intermediates(20.Lambeir A.-M. Markey C.M. Dunford H.B. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14894-14896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme Fe(III) of the native enzyme is oxidized by the peroxide, and an Fe(IV)=O porphyrin π cation radical (compound I) is formed. Compound I is readily converted to a second intermediate, which we shall call intermediate II. The oxidation state of intermediate II could be assigned either to an Fe(IV)=O species with no enzymatic free radical (compound II) (21.Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1976; 19: 187-251Crossref Scopus (922) Google Scholar) or to a Fe(IV)=O-tyrosyl radical species (compound I-tyrosyl radical) as in compound I of cytochrome c peroxidase(22.Yonetani T. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 345-362Google Scholar). Both Fe(IV)=O species could be formed under certain conditions, but how they are related to each other is a crucial and as yet unresolved problem in the PGH synthase catalytic mechanism. The detection of tyrosyl radicals has been considered to be key evidence for a postulated reaction mechanism in which the compound I-tyrosyl radical species abstracts a hydrogen atom from arachidonic acid, which initiates the oxygenation reaction and regenerates the tyrosyl residue(23.Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). If the oxygenated arachidonic acid radical, the PGG2 radical, abstracts a hydrogen atom from the tyrosyl residue to become PGG2, then the tyrosyl radical is regenerated and a chain reaction could occur. For every compound I converted to the Fe(IV)=O-tyrosyl radical another chain could be started, so this mechanism is properly called a branched-chain mechanism. The branched-chain mechanism could lead to the accumulation of large amounts of PGG2, not PGH2, which is the precursor of all other prostaglandins. It has been shown that the branched-chain mechanism cannot explain coupled cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities when an excess of a substrate electron donor is present; yet, the chain reaction cannot be excluded under conditions when the peroxidase reaction is rate-limiting, i.e. at low concentration or in the absence of a peroxidase electron donor(18.Bakovic M. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6475-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, however, the inactivation of the enzyme is severe, and the tyrosyl radical(s) could be participating in these processes. An alternative non-chain mechanism involves tyrosyl radical formation at a later stage in the reaction(18.Bakovic M. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6475-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19.Bakovic M. Dunford H.B. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 54: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to test the occurrence of the critical elementary reaction in the tyrosyl radical chain reaction model(23.Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the spontaneous formation of the compound I-tyrosyl radical from compound I. Evidence will be shown that when a hydroperoxide is present, the compound I-tyrosyl radical is not formed from compound I. Compound I rather abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroperoxide to produce compound II and hydroperoxyl radical, as can occur with myeloperoxidase(24.Marquez L.A. Huang J.T. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The compound I-tyrosyl radical could then be formed from compound II and hydroperoxyl radical as previously suggested (18, 19). Materials were purchased from the following sources: arachidonic acid, Nu-chek-Prep; phenol, British Drug House; DE-53 ion exchange chromatography gel, Whatman; Tween 20, J. T.

The concentration of horseradish peroxidase was determined spectrophotometrically at 403 nm using a molar absorptivity of 1.02 × 105M−1 cm−1(25.Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of hydroperoxide stock solutions was determined by the horseradish peroxidase assay(26.Cotton M.L. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1973; 51: 582-587Crossref Google Scholar). PGH synthase, isolated from sheep seminal vesicles(27.Marnett L.J. Siedlik P.H. Ochs R.C. Pagels W.R. Das M. Honn K.V. Warnock R.H. Tainer B.E. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 328-335PubMed Google Scholar, 28.MacDonald I.D. Dunford H.B. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 37: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), consisted of approximately a 50/50 mixture of apo- and holoenzyme and had a specific activity of 40 μmol of arachidonic acid (mg of protein/min)−1 in the presence of 1 μM hematin and 1 mM phenol. Protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The concentration of the enzyme heme was determined at 410 nm using an ε of 123 mM−1 cm−1(29.Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6358-6363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For spectral and kinetic measurements, a 1-ml aliquot of the 50/50 apo-/holoenzyme stock solution was reconstituted by adding an amount of hematin equal to the amount of apoenzyme. The final heme concentration of the enzyme, determined after keeping the enzyme sample on ice for 10-15 min, was usually 23-25 μM. The presence of impurities that may serve as exogenous peroxidase electron donors in all hydroperoxide solutions (except PGG2) was tested using horseradish peroxidase. 1 μM horseradish peroxidase was mixed with an equal amount of hydroperoxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.03, at room temperature. The completeness of the formation of horseradish peroxidase compound I and its stability were examined using a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer. For m-Cl PBA, which is a solid, the crude samples were dissolved in hot water and recrystallized on ice. The tests with horseradish peroxidase and the kinetic measurements with PGH synthase were made before and after the purification of m-Cl PBA. The kinetic experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.17 MV (Micro-Volume) Stopped-flow Reaction Analyzer. If not specified otherwise, the experiments were conducted at 6.7 ± 0.2°C in phosphate buffer, pH 7.03, at an ionic strength of 0.1 M, with buffer contributing 0.01 M and K2SO4 contributing 0.09 M. The pH jump technique was applied to avoid denaturation of the enzyme before the reaction with hydroperoxide(30.Dolman D. Newell G.A. Thurlow M.D. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The enzyme solutions were unbuffered but had an ionic strength of 0.1 M maintained by K2SO4. For a pH dependence study, 0.1 M citrate (pH 3.56-5.95), phosphate (pH 7.03-8.00), and carbonate buffers (pH 8.00-9.06) were used. The pH dependence study was performed only for the reaction with H2O2 at 4.0 ± 0.2°C. In standard mode experiments two solutions are directly mixed and passed to the observation cell. One drive syringe was filled with enzyme solution. The other syringe was filled with hydroperoxide. At least a 10-fold excess of hydroperoxide was used to maintain pseudo-first order conditions. Compound I formation was monitored by the disappearance of native enzyme at 414 nm, an isosbestic point between compound I and compound II. The subsequent compound I disappearance was monitored by following the rate of formation of intermediate II at 426 nm, an isosbestic point between native enzyme and compound I(31.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 68: 965-972Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17649-17657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The intermediate II (compound II or compound I-tyrosyl radical), disappearance was also monitored at 426 nm. When shifting to sequential mixing, a reconfiguration is required of both the hardware and software of the SX.17 MV instrument. Four syringes, A, B, C, and F, are used. Syringes A and B are pushed by drive 1, and after an appropriate delay time, syringes C and F are pushed by drive 2. As recommended by the manufacturer, the positions of the pre-mixing ram (drive 1) and the flush ram (drive 2) were adjusted to provide an ideal total volume of 220 and 180 μl, respectively, to provide accurate mixing conditions. Syringe A was filled with 4× the final concentration of enzyme; syringe B with 4× the final concentration of m-Cl PBA; syringe C with 2× the final concentration of an appropriate hydroperoxide, one of H2O2, EtOOH, t-BuOOH, m-Cl PBA, or PGG2; and syringe F (flush) with the buffer. Drive 2 was adjusted to be activated 60-70 ms after drive 1. This results in an aging time of 55-65 ms (total time that enzyme and m-Cl PBA are allowed to react in the aging loop), which was found in separate experiments to result in complete formation of compound I. Thus compound I was completely formed from the 1:1.3 molar ratio of native enzyme and m-Cl PBA and then immediately mixed with either an excess of m-Cl PBA or another hydroperoxide. The reactions were monitored at 426 nm as in the standard mode stopped-flow experiments. The SX.17 MV was in its standard configuration with one drive (drive 2) in operation. The sets of wavelength-dependent kinetic traces or the steady state sample spectra were collected by setting the wavelength limits to 350-450 nm with 2-nm intervals between scans. 50 kinetic runs were scanned per 1 reaction mixture, which is the maximum allowed for these conditions (100-nm range, 2-nm interval). The kinetic traces were acquired, saved, and analyzed using the GLINT software application. Other conditions were as for the standard mode stopped-flow experiments. 8 to 12 kinetic traces were collected at each wavelength (414 and 426 nm) and for each hydroperoxide concentration. For all hydroperoxides other than H2O2, the standard error was below 10%. For the reaction of H2O2 with native enzyme, the standard errors were also less than 10%, as they were in the faster phase of the pre-steady state reaction of H2O2 with compound I. All other H2O2 reactions were not reproducible with standard errors in excess of 30%. Pseudo-first order rate constants, kobs, were obtained by exponential curve fits to the experimental kinetic traces by using the SX.17 MV kinetic analysis software. The kobs values were plotted against substrate concentrations. Second order rate constants were obtained from the slopes of the linear plots, and the saturation plots yielded two parameters, which we have called kcat and Km, although they were obtained from pre-steady state and transient state experiments, not the traditional steady state experiments of Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics. Plots and calculations were performed by using a non-linear regression data analysis program (Enzfitter, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The reaction of native enzyme (E) with a hydroperoxide (ROOH) and the rate of compound I formation (d[E-I]/dt) are defined in and and: E+ROOH→E−I+ROHREACTION 1 d[E−I]/dt=k1[E][ROOH](Eq. 1) k1,obs=k1[ROOH](Eq. 2) The kinetic traces at 414 nm were single-exponential, and the pseudo-first order rate constants k1,obs were linear functions of [ROOH] (the plot and a kinetic trace for EtOOH are shown in Fig. 1). The bimolecular rate constants k1 were calculated from the slopes of the straight-line plots of k1,obsversus [ROOH]. Resulting values for different hydroperoxides are presented in Table 1, together with a published value for PGG2(23.Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the aliphatic hydroperoxides H2O2, EtOOH, and t-BuOOH are significantly poorer substrates for native enzyme than the aromatic hydroperoxide m-Cl PBA. The rate constants for compound I formation decrease in the order m-Cl PBA ≫ EtOOH > H2O2 > t-BuOOH. For m-Cl PBA, k1 was two to three orders of magnitude higher (5 × 107M−1 s−1) than for other hydroperoxides and similar to the value obtained with the natural substrate PGG2 (Table 1). The rate of formation of intermediate II from compound I (k1,obs) was followed by an increase in absorbance at 426 nm as shown in the inset to Fig. 2. The dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant for intermediate II formation, k1,obs, on [ROOH] is shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The faster reacting substrates, EtOOH and m-Cl PBA, had a linear dependence of k1,obs on [ROOH] (Fig. 2). For the poorer substrates, H2O2 and t-BuOOH, saturation curves were obtained (Fig. 3). Rate data are summarized in Table 2. H2O2 behaved differently and in more complex fashion than all other peroxides. For H2O2, the rate of intermediate II formation was biphasic with only the rate of the faster, earlier phase being reproducible (Fig. 3). PGH synthase intermediate II formation from H2O2 (i) was biphasic at all pH values and (ii) the faster phase always exhibited saturation as a function of [H2O2] (an example at pH 7.03 is shown in Fig. 3). The values of k1,obs and Km, calculated from the best fits to the saturation curves of k1,obsversus [H2O2] for the faster phase, were plotted in logarithmic form against pH (Fig. 4). The results show that the faster phase in the PGH synthase intermediate II formation is not a function of pH. Similar pH independence was obtained by plotting log k1,obs/Km against pH (data not shown). Superoxide dismutase slightly increased the first, fast phase in intermediate II formation but did not eliminate the second, slow phase even at 10 μM concentration. Bovine serum albumin showed a similar effect to that of superoxide dismutase (data not shown). Because of poor reproducibility, the functional relationship between the rate of the slower phase and [H2O2] could not be ascertained. At some pH values, this relationship was linear, but at many other pH values, the relationship could not be established. The quality of the hydroperoxide preparations was tested by reaction with horseradish peroxidase, which provides a sensitive test for the presence of electron-donating impurities. The reactions of other hydroperoxides with horseradish peroxidase were compared with that of H2O2. EtOOH, m-Cl PBA, as well as H2O2 formed horseradish peroxidase compound I quantitatively by using stoichiometric amounts of the enzyme and hydroperoxide. No compound II from the newly formed horseradish peroxidase compound I prepared with EtOOH, m-Cl PBA, or H2O2 appeared in 5 min at room temperature, indicating that no electron donors were present in the hydroperoxide preparations. More than a 20-fold excess of t-BuOOH was necessary to form completely horseradish peroxidase compound I. However, no conversion of horseradish peroxidase compound I to horseradish peroxidase compound II was observed even at very high [t-BuOOH], indicating that no reductants of compound I were present. As an additional test for solid m-Cl PBA, the rate constant k1,obs was determined for both crude and purified preparations. No difference in kinetic performance was obtained (Fig. 2), again indicating that no secondary reactions occurred. Nonetheless, the purified m-Cl PBA was used in the remainder of the experiments. Here, we describe the most suitable way of obtaining a high yield of compound I. Slightly more than a stoichiometric amount of m-Cl PBA was enough to produce compound I of PGH synthase in high yield (Fig. 5A). At 6.7°C and pH 7.03 (0.1 μM enzyme), the formation of compound I was complete within 50 ms. An isosbestic point occurs between the native enzyme and compound I at 422 nm. Compound I was stable for 50-80 ms and then was transformed at a slower rate to the second intermediate (Fig. 5B). This was accompanied by the spectral shift and increase in absorbance at longer wavelengths. The formation of the second intermediate was complete after 200 ms. The second intermediate had a maximum at 419 nm and an isosbestic point with compound I at 413 nm, i.e. similar to 414 nm reported initially(31.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 68: 965-972Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17649-17657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The kinetic trace at 414 nm obtained with m-Cl PBA for the above conditions had two distinct transient phases separated by a steady state phase (Fig. 6). The fast decrease in absorbance is the formation of compound I, and slow increase in absorbance at longer times indicates the conversion of compound I to intermediate II. There was a short steady state period of 30 ms when compound I was stable, and the time within that range, designated by an arrow in Fig. 6(60 ms after the start of the reaction), was selected as an optimal time for studying the reactions of compound I by using the sequential mixing technique. Utilizing the sequential mixing method, the rate of intermediate II formation from compound I was studied directly as a function of [ROOH]. The reaction was followed at 426 nm as in the standard stopped-flow experiments. All hydroperoxides examined reacted with compound I. The natural substrate PGG2 exhibited different behavior, and these results will be presented separately. The transient state results with H2O2 were not reproducible, apparently because of inactivation reactions, and they are not presented here. Fig. 7 shows the linear plots of the observed pseudo-first order rate constant k1,obsversus [ROOH] for the reactions of compound I with EtOOH, t-BuOOH, and m-Cl PBA under transient state conditions. A noticeable difference between the transient state and pre-steady state results was obtained only with t-BuOOH. The plot of k1,obsversus [t-BuOOH] from the transient state results is linear (Fig. 7), not curved as was observed in the pre-steady state (Fig. 3). The linear plots had a common intercept at 15 s−1 (Fig. 7). This value represents the rate for the spontaneous decay of compound I. The spontaneous rate was also determined in separate experiments in a multi-mixing assay in which a second peroxide was not added (curve a, inset to Fig. 7). Thus, only the 1:1.3 ratio of enzyme and m-Cl PBA were reacted. The results were in good agreement with the intercept value obtained in Fig. 7. The term “spontaneous” can be explained by the reduction of PGH synthase compound I by the stabilizing agent DDC to compound II (31.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 68: 965-972Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17649-17657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Small amounts of DDC are required for enzyme stability. The linear kinetics and finite intercept for the reaction of PGH synthase compound I with EtOOH, t-BuOOH, and m-Cl PBA in the presence of DDC can be explained by a single mechanism in which both the hydroperoxide and DDC serve as hydrogen atom donors and reduce PGH synthase compound I to compound II (E-II) as in and and: E-I+ROOH→E-II+ROO⋅REACTION 2 E-I+DDC→E-II+DDC⋅REACTION 3 −d[E-I]/dt=k2,app[ROOH][E-I]+k2,sp[DDC][E-I](Eq. 3) kDDC=k2,sp[DDC](Eq. 4) k2,obs=k2,app[ROOH]+kDDC(Eq. 5) where k1,obs is the second-order spontaneous rate constant for the reduction of compound I by DDC and k1,obs is the corresponding first order rate constant (the intercept of the plots in Fig. 7. is in full agreement with the experimental data depicted in Fig. 7. The bimolecular rate constants for compound II formation (k1,obs) obtained from the transient state experiments were calculated from the slopes of the straight-line plots of k1,obsversus [ROOH], and the results are shown in Table 2. For comparison, the values obtained form the pre-steady state method are also shown in Table 2. Thus, for two different kinetic methods, the rate constants for compound II formation with EtOOH and m-Cl PBA are remarkably similar. For t-BuOOH, however, the rate constant k1,obs was slightly higher from the classical stopped-flow experiments than from the sequential mixing experiments (Table 2). Transient state experiments with compound I and PGG2 were performed at 3°C for comparison with results of the previously published single-mixing (pre-steady state) experiments(23.Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The increase in absorbance at 426 nm was a saturation function of [PGG2]. An example is shown in Fig. 8. The results imply the formation of an intermediate complex, E-I-PGG2, between compound I and PGG2 before the actual hydrogen atom transfer occurs, as shown in and: E-I+PGG2{E-I-PGG2}→E-II+PGG2⋅REACTION 4 k2,obs=kcat[PGG2]/(Km+[PGG2])(Eq. 6) The parameters k1,obs (69 ± 6 s−1) and Km (70 ± 10 μM) were obtained from the plot of k1,obsversus [PGG2] in Fig. 8. No corrections for the DDC spontaneous reaction (k1,obs) were made. At 3°C, k1,obs was 4 s−1. Since an excellent fit of the theoretical curve to the experimental data was obtained, it appears that the formation of the E-I-PGG2 complex () prevented the reaction of compound I with the small amount of DDC. For [PGG2] ≪ Km, the k1,obs value approximates the pseudo-first order rate constant for the bimolecular reaction of compound I and PGG2 as in and: k2,obs=(kcat/Km)[PGG2])(Eq. 7) k2,obs=kcat/Km(Eq. 8) The apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of compound I and PGG2, k1,obs, obtained from, is (1.0 ± 0.2) × 106M−1 s−1 (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, the k1,obs values decreased in the order PGG2 > m-Cl PBA > EtOOH > H2O2 > t-BuOOH. Fig. 9 shows that the second intermediate, spontaneously formed from compound I when the stoichiometric amounts of the native enzyme and m-Cl PBA reacted, returned to the native enzyme within 2 s. However, if an excess of EtOOH or m-Cl PBA were present, the steady state spectra of intermediate II (similar to spectrum a in Fig. 9A) were stable for more than 20 s, followed by a slow rate of decay that was independent of [ROOH]. The results for the decay of intermediate II in the presence of EtOOH are shown in Fig. 9B. Within experimental error, the observed pseudo-first order rate constant for the decay of intermediate II, k1,obs, was the same for EtOOH"

In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 has recently been found to be a potent inhibitor of proliferation of cancer cells(5.Colston K.W. Berger U. Coombes R.C. Lancet. 1989; 1: 188-191Google Scholar), for example, Calcipotriol, a synthetic analog of 1,25(OH)2D3, is currently available as a drug for treating psoriasis(6.Kragballe K. Gjertsen B.T. De Hoop D.

Coombes R.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 693-702Google Scholar). These diverse biologic properties of 1,25(OH)2D3 are manifested by its high affinity binding to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (VDR) in the nucleus of the target cell(9.Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Komm B.S. Terpening C.M. Yamaoka K. Allegretto E.A. Baker A.R. Shine J. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 263-305Google Scholar). After the initial binding, the ligand-receptor complex, in association with a nuclear factor, interacts with the vitamin D-controlled genes with a resulting change in the transcription/gene regulation leading toward protein synthesis and changes in cellular functions(10.Darwish H. DeLuca H.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 89-116Google Scholar, 11.MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Haussler M.R. Semin. Nephrol. 1994; 14: 101-118Google Scholar). In essence, VDR, a ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factor, is responsible for various physiological properties of 1,25(OH)2D3. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-3β-bromoacetate high performance liquid chromatography human VDR calf thymus VDR rat VDR. VDR, in terms of its mechanism of action, closely resembles receptors for all of the members of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfaminly (11.MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Haussler M.R. Semin. Nephrol. 1994; 14: 101-118Google Scholar). In general, these proteins consist of a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding region and a relatively large C-terminal hormone-binding area. During the past few years, structure-functional studies of VDR (12.Allegretto E. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10139-10145Google Scholar, 13.Allegretto E.A. Pike J.W. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1312-1319Google Scholar, 14.Allegretto E.A. Pike J.W. Haussler M.R. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 479-485Google Scholar) have shown that the N-terminal boundary of the ligand-binding domain lies between 114 and 166(15.McDonnell D.P. Scott R.A. Kerner S.A. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 635-644Google Scholar), while C-terminal boundary is considered to be between 403 and 427(16.Nakajima S. Hsieh J. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Google Scholar). A sequence comparison among various members of the steroid receptor superfamily has revealed that the C-terminal sequence is unique for each receptor (17.Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1301Google Scholar). Since the transcription-regulatory role of VDR is triggered by the highly specific-binding of its ligand, i.e. 1,25(OH)2D3, determination of the topography of ligand-binding domain of VDR, which includes identification of “contact points,” is crucial for the proper understanding of the diverse physiological properties of 1,25(OH)2D3, particularly in relation to other steroid hormones. This information will also aid in the development of agonists and antagonists of the ligand with potential pharmacological importance. Affinity/photoaffinity labeling studies have been used to covalently label and identify an enzyme or a receptor in a heterogenous sample (18.Sweet F. Murdock G.L. Endocrinol. Rev. 1987; 8: 154-184Google Scholar). These methods have also been successfully applied to map the binding sites of several enzymes and receptors including those of estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors(19.Carlstedt-Duke J. Stromstedt P. Persson B. Cederlund E. Gustafsson J. Jornvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6842-6846Google Scholar, 20.Katzenellenbogen B.S. Bharadwaj B. Fang H. Ince B.A. Pakdel F. Reese J.C. Schodin D. Wrenn C.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 39-48Google Scholar). During the past several years, efforts from our laboratory and others to covalently label VDR in chick and pig intestinal cytosol by photoaffinity labeling with either radiolabeled 1,25(OH)2D3 or with a radiolabeled photoaffinity analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 have met with very limited success (21.Brown T.A. DeLuca H.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 466-472Google Scholar, 22.Brown T.A. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 324-328Google Scholar, 23.Ray R. Ray S. Holick M.F.

This led us to synthesize 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-3β-bromoacetate (1,25(OH)2D3-BE), a potential affinity labeling reagent for VDR(27.Ray R. Ray S. Holick M.F. Bioorganic Chem. 1994; 22: 276-283Google Scholar). In a recent publication, we have demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3-BE functions as a substrate-analog for chick intestinal VDR(27.Ray R. Ray S. Holick M.F. Bioorganic Chem. 1994; 22: 276-283Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we synthesized 1α,25-dihydroxy[26(27)-3H]vitamin D3-3-deoxy-3β-bromoacetate (1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE) of high specific activity (175 Ci/mmol) and carried out affinity labeling studies of baculovirus-expressed recombinant human VDR. We, however, were unsuccessful in affinity labeling naturally occurring VDRs from calf thymus and rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells, possibly due to the low detection limit of 3H in 1,25(OH)2[3H] D3-BE. To circumvent this problem we synthesized 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE and affinity labeled VDRs in cytosols from calf thymus and ROS 17/2.8 cells. Results of these studies are presented in this communication. 1,25(OH)2D3 was a generous gift from Dr. Milan Uskokovic (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). All other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, E. Merck Science, Gibbstown, NJ (HPLC solvents). 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3] (specific activity, 175 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp., and [14C]bromoacetic acid (specific activity, 18.65 mCi/mmol) was from Sigma. HPLC analysis of the samples (Econosil silica columns (Altech Associates, State College, PA), 5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane; flow rate, 2 ml/min) were carried out in a Waters HPLC system consisting of a M660A solvent delivery pump, a U6K injector, and a 440 UV (254 nm) detector. In some cases effluents from HPLC were directly introduced into a Radiomatic FloOne Radioactivity detector (Radiomatic Corp., Tampa, FL). A partially enriched recombinant human VDR (hVDR) sample was obtained by using the baculovirus expression system according to the procedure by MacDonald et al.(28.MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Terpening C.M. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18808-18813Google Scholar). Briefly, two cytosol samples were prepared by infecting S. frugiperda ovarian cell cultures (Sf9 cultures) with wild-type virus AcMNPV, and mutant-type virus pVDR1392. Both cytosol samples, prepared in KTED buffer containing 0.1 mmol of zinc sulfate and 20% glycerol, pH 7.4, were enriched with hVDR by blue dextran-chromatography (28.MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Terpening C.M. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18808-18813Google Scholar) however, without the addition of any 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3. Competitive 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 binding assays were carried out according to the published procedure(29.Pike J.W. Haussler M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 67: 508-522Google Scholar). Calf thymus cytosol was prepared according to the procedure described by Reinhardt et al.(30.Reinhardt T.A. Horst R.L. Orf J.W. Hollis B.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 58: 91-98Google Scholar). Rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) were grown in roller bottles at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml)(31.Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Bone Miner. Res. 1983; 2: 244Google Scholar). The cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence and harvested by trypsinization. The nuclear extract of the cells was prepared by a method by Shapiro et al.(32.Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahly W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Google Scholar). A standard sample of 1,25(OH)2D3-BE was prepared according the method developed by us(27.Ray R. Ray S. Holick M.F. Bioorganic Chem. 1994; 22: 276-283Google Scholar). Toluene solutions of vitamin D3 (100 μg), bromoacetic acid (59 μg), 4,4′-dimethylaminopyridine (3.47 μg), and 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 (1 μCi; specific activity, 175 Ci/mmol) were mixed and dried under argon. To this mixture was added a solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (117 μg) dissolved in 200 μl of anhydrous dichloromethane. The reaction mixture was stored in a stoppered vial under argon for 24 h followed by the removal of solvent under argon. The reaction mixture was redissolved in 5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane and chromatographed (HPLC), where fractions were collected at 0.25-min intervals. The fractions corresponding to an authentic sample of 1,25(OH)2D3-BE were pooled. Radioactive counting of an aliquot of the pooled sample indicated that the total yield of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE was 0.27 μCi (27%). Radiochemical purity of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE was determined by HPLC-analysis of a sample containing 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE and 1,25(OH)2D3-BE-standard. (a) A toleune solution of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-1,25-di-t-butyldimethylsilyl ether (1.3 mg) (24.Ray R. Holick M.F. Steroids. 1988; 51: 623-630Google Scholar) and 14C-bromoacetic acid] (specific activity, 18.65 mCi/mmol, 25 μCi) and 4,4′-dimethylaminopyridine (0.5 μg) was dried under argon, and a solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.4 mg) in 200 μl of anhydrous dichloromethane was added to it. The solution was stored in a stoppered vial under argon atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the reaction mixture was applied to a 1000-μm silica plate, which was eluted with 1% ethyl acetate in hexane. The UV active band, corresponding to a standard sample of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-1,25-di-t-butyldimethylsilyloxy-3-bromoacetate (24.Ray R. Holick M.F. Steroids. 1988; 51: 623-630Google Scholar) was isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate (9.9 μCi, 39.6%). (b) The product from the above step was dissolved in 0.4 ml of acetonitrile, and 40 μl of aqueous hydrofluoric acid (48%) was added to it. The solution was stirred at 25°C for 20 h followed by careful neutralization with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution to a pH of approximately 8. The aqueous solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and solvent was removed under argon. The resulting reaction mixture was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography on a 1000-μm silica plate (33.3% ethyl acetate in hexane), and the UV active band corresponding to an authentic sample of 1,25(OH)2D3-BE was isolated. The yield of the desired product (1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE) was 4.48 μCi (18% overall). HPLC analysis (as described in the case of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE) of 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE, mixed with an authentic sample of 1,25(OH)2D3-BE, indicated that this material was radiochemically homogeneous. Samples of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE (22,500 cpm, 0.13 pmol), dissolved in 7.5 μl of ethanol, were added to each of 90-μl aliquots (9 μg of protein) of the wild-type and mutant-type previously frozen extracts. The solutions were incubated on ice for 3 h followed by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer containing SDS and dithiothreitol (90 μl) to each sample. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and 100-μl aliquots were loaded on to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Also loaded on the gel were 100-μl aliquots each of wild-type and mutant-type cytosol samples diluted 1:2000, 1:200, and 1:20 with KTED buffer. A sample containing a mixture of 14C-labeled protein molecular weight marker (Amersham Corp.) was also loaded onto the gel. After the electrophoretic run, one-half of the gel was fixed, enhanced (sodium salicylate solution), dried, and exposed to a Kodak X-Omat film at −70°C for 115 h. The other half of the gel was transferred to Immobilon membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis using 9A7γ monoclonal antibody for hVDR(28.MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Terpening C.M. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18808-18813Google Scholar). In another experiment, 30-μl samples of mutant-type cell extract were incubated with either 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE (100,000 cpm, 0.57 pmol) or 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE (100,000 cpm, 0.57 pmol) and 1,25(OH)2D3 (1 μg, 2.4 nmol) at 0°C for 3 h. After the incubation, the samples were electrophoresed and autoradiographed as described earlier. Two samples (50 μl) each of calf thymus cytosol and nuclear extract from ROS 17/2.8, diluted with phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were incubated for 3 h at 0°C with 10 μl of ethanolic solutions of either 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE (specific activity, 18.65 Ci/mmol; 10,000 cpm; 0.33 nM) alone or 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE (10,000 cpm, 0.33 nM, and 20 μg of 1,25(OH)2D3, 48 nM). Following the incubation, the samples were boiled briefly with electrophoresis sample buffer containing SDS and dithiothrieotol, and electrophoressed on an SDS gel along with molecular weight markers. After the elctrophoretic run, the gel was dried and subjected to radioactivity scanning in a PhosphorImager. α-Halo ester derivatives of biomolecules, particularly steroids, have been popular in designing affinity analogs due to their relative ease of synthesis and their high reactivity toward nucleophilic amino acid residues in the ligand-binding pocket(18.Sweet F. Murdock G.L. Endocrinol. Rev. 1987; 8: 154-184Google Scholar). We have recently described a multistep procedure to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D3-BE, an α-bromo ester derivative of 1,25(OH)2D3(27.Ray R. Ray S. Holick M.F. Bioorganic Chem. 1994; 22: 276-283Google Scholar). This synthetic procedure, however, was useless in the case of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE due to practical infeasibility of starting with nanogram quantity of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 of very high specific activity (175 Ci/mmol), and carry out several synthetic steps. Alternatively, we coupled commercially available 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 (specific activity, 175 Ci/mmol) with bromoacetic acid in the presence of a large excess of vitamin D3 as a carrier (Fig. 1). HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture (Fig. 2, left panel) demonstrated that, although it consisted of several UV-absorbing peaks including that of vitamin Ds-3β-bromoacetate (I) (Fig. 2, left panel, top), there were only three radioactive peaks (Fig. 2, left panel, bottom). These radioactive peaks represented the 1,3-diester derivative (IV) and 3- and 1-monoester derivatives (II and III, respectively) of 1,25(OH)2[3H]Ds (retention times, 4.6, 10.2, and 11.3 min, respectively). 21α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3-1-bromoacetate (Fig. 1, III) was synthesized by treating 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-3-t-butyldimethylsilyl ether (25.Ray, R., Holick, S. A., Holick, M. F. (1985) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 702-703Google Scholar) with bromoacetic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and 4,4′-dimethylaminopyridine in anhydrous dichloromethane followed by the removal of the silylether protecting group with aqueous hydrofluoric acid/acetonitrile. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3-1,3-dibromoacetate (Fig. 1, IV) was synthesized by treating 1α,25(OH)2D3 with an excess of bromoacetic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4,4′-dimethylaminopyridine in anhydrous dichloromethane. All the unknown compounds were characterized by NMR. Prior to the HPLC-purification of the radioactive mixture, compounds II, III, and IV were analyzed by HPLC (under the same conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures”) to determine their relative retention times. By careful fractionation, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” our desired compound, i.e. 1,25(OH)2[3H]Ds-BE (II) was separated to the base line from other isomers and products of the reaction. HPLC analysis of a mixture containing 1,25(OH)2[3H]Ds-BE (II) and a standard sample of 1,25(OH)2Ds-BE (27.Ray R. Ray S. Holick M.F. Bioorganic Chem. 1994; 22: 276-283Google Scholar) confirmed that 1,25(OH)2[3H]Ds-BE was radiochemically homogeneous (Fig. 2, right panel).Figure 2:Left panel, HPLC-analysis of the reaction mixture depicted in Fig. 1(Silica column, 5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane, 1.3 ml/minute).

In the latter sample, however, a low molecular weight protein band was labeled to a minor extent, possibly due to nonspecific labeling. In a Western blot analysis, the 50-kDa protein band strongly cross-reacted with the monoclonal antibody for hVDR in VDR-positive sample (Fig. 4, lane 2), while immunoreactivity was completely absent in VDR-negative sample (Fig. 4, lane 1). When the protein content of the samples was increased 10-fold, several immunoreactive bands were observed for the mutant-type (Fig. 4, lane 4), indicating some degradation of the VDR. Intact VDR, however, represented greater than 90% of the immunoreactive products in the extract. For the wild-type, there was no observable cross-reactivity even with 500 ng of protein (Fig. 4, lane 3). Finally, when the incubation was carried out in the presence of a large excess of 1,25(OH)2D3, the labeling of 50-kDa hVDR band was drastically reduced (Fig. 5, lane 2), compared with the sample without 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 5, lane 1). The results of all the experiments described above strongly suggested that 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE specifically and covalently labeled the 1,25(OH)2D3-binding site in hVDR. If we consider a simple competition between 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3-BE for the binding site on VDR, 4000-fold molar excess of 1,25(OH)2D3 is expected to eliminate the labeling completely. This was, however, not the case in reality (Fig. 5, lane 2). A possible explanation would be that if the interaction between 1,25(OH)2D3-BE and VDR is rapid and irreversible, covalently labeled VDR would accumulate with time, even in the presence of a reversible competition between 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3-BE. Thus, certain amount of covalently labeled VDR will always contaminate the mixture. Alternatively, binding characteristics of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3-BE with VDR could be different, so that the latter could be a pure agonist, a pure antagonist, or anything in between. For example, a whole spectrum of estradiol-agonists and antagonists are known. They share a common binding site in the estrogen receptor but bring about different conformational changes in the apoprotein(33.McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Google Scholar). In a recent preliminary study, we observed that 1,25(OH)2D3-BE is a potent agonist of 1,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting the nuclear uptake of [3H]thymidine in cultured human keratinocytes(34.Ray S. Ray R. Holick M.F. Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Vitamin D, Orlando, FL, May 28 to June 2. Walter de Gruyter, New York1994: 598-599Google Scholar). Further research is required to determine the exact mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)2D3-BE. Once successful labeling of the partially enriched recombinant hVDR was achieved, we began a study to label naturally occurring VDR. Incubation of cVDR with 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE produced no labeled protein band, and almost all the radioactivity appeared at the bottom of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (results not shown). We were, however, encouraged by the fact that there was very little “random labeling” indicating the specificity of the reagent. We also realized that low-energy tritium nucleide (as in 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE) is not suitable for the very low level detection of radioactivity (due to extremely low natural abundance of VDR in mammalian tissues). This observation prompted us to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE (Fig. 6). Although specific activity of 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE (18.65 mCi/mmol) was much lower than that of 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-BE (175 Ci/mmol), we reasoned that the higher energy β-particles in [14C]radionucleide may be enough to detect any labeled band in the gel. Incubation of nuclear extracts from calf thymus and ROS 17/2.8 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE produced a labeled protein band (Mr 50,000) (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). When the incubation was carried out in the presence of 145-times molar excess of 1,25(OH)2D3, the intensity of labeling was significantly reduced (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). In calf thymus cytosol, cVDR represented the only distinctly labeled protein band (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2); but in, ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract, there were several minor labeled protein bands including a band (Mr 25,000) possibly representing a proteolytic digestion product of rVDR. (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4). In both cases, most of the radioactivity appeared at the dye-front of the gel, possibly representing the free label. These results strongly indicated that 1,25(OH)2D3-binding sites in cVDR and rVDR were covalently modified by 1,25(OH)2D3-[14C]BE. We are currently in the process of developing a bacterial overexpression system to obtain substantial quantity of hVDR (35.Swamy N. Ray R.

We are also in the process of synthesizing next generation affinity analogs containing affinity probes at sites other than the 3-hydroxyl group of 1,25(OH)2D3 (as in the case of 1,25(OH)2D3-BE). These analogs will allow us identify several contact points within the 1,25(OH)2D3-binding cavity in VDR. Identification of these important “recognition markers” in the 1,25(OH)2D3-binding domain of VDR will be crucial for developing next generation 1,25(OH)2D3-based drugs with broad spectrum anticancer activities. In general, these studies will provide important structural information about VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3 in relation to their functions. We thank Dr. Tai C.

https://openalex.org/W2024301573,"Rat intestinal mucosa contains high diacylglycerol-synthesizing activity (monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) activity) due to monoacylglycerol and fatty acid, independently of coenzyme A and ATP. MGAT activity was purified from rat intestinal mucosa by successive chromatography separations on DEAE-cellulose, CM- Sephadex, and anti-IgG-Sepharose against rat pancreatic lipase. The enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous, and its molecular weight was 49,000, which is identical with that of rat pancreatic lipase. Immunoblotting analysis with antibody against rat pancreatic lipase showed one immunoreactive protein with an estimated molecular weight of 49,000. The activity of the purified enzyme was completely inhibited by addition of the antibody. Using immunocytochemical techniques, it was found that immunoreactive protein against rat pancreatic lipase was uniformly distributed within the absorptive cells of the intestine but was absent from the microvillar membrane. The MGAT activity of intestinal mucosal homogenate was inhibited by about 65% by addition of antibody against rat pancreatic lipase. Trioleoylglycerol- and dioleoylglycerol-hydrolyzing activities of the purified enzyme and pancreatic lipase were inhibited by addition of intestinal mucosa extract.These results suggest that pancreatic lipase is present in intestinal absorptive cells and that it may contribute to resynthesis of diacylglycerol from monoacylglycerol and fatty acids in these cells.

These results suggest that pancreatic lipase is present in intestinal absorptive cells and that it may contribute to resynthesis of diacylglycerol from monoacylglycerol and fatty acids in these cells. Dietary fat (triacylglycerol) is digested by pancreatic lipase to 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids prior to its absorption in the intestinal lumen(1.Carriere F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Unlike esterases, pancreatic lipase develops its full activity only with emulsified substrates; i.e. it is activated at lipid-water interfaces(2.Verger R. Brogstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipase. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 83-150Google Scholar). The adsorbed 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids are resynthesized to triacylglycerol by enterocytes. Triacylglycerols are synthesized by two pathways, the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway and the monoacylglycerol pathway(3.Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. The Enzymes. 1983; 16: 87-111Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During fat absorption in monogastric animals, the monoacylglycerol pathway is the major route of triacylglycerol synthesis(4.Mattson F.H. Volpenhein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway involves the stepwise acylation of 2-monoacylglycerols absorbed from the intestinal lumen. Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) 1The abbreviation used is: MGATmonoacylglycerol acyltransferase. is a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols from 2-monoacylglycerols and long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A(5.Coleman R.A.

Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acyl coenzyme A is synthesized from free fatty acid and coenzyme A by fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, a reaction which requires energy (ATP). Because the main purpose of eating fat diets is to gain energy, it is comprehensible that ATP is required in the fat adsorption process. Therefore, we examined a newly discovered pathway which does not require energy. monoacylglycerol acyltransferase. Previously, we reported that, under physiological conditions, lipases/esterases catalyze the synthesis of acyl-alcohol ester from free fatty acids and alcohols(7.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5884-5889PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These reactions do not require ATP or coenzyme A. Pancreatic cholesterol esterase, which is known to hydrolyze cholesterol ester, catalyzes its resynthesis from cholesterol and free fatty acids within intestinal cells(10.Hyun Y. Herm K.E.

In this paper, we report the purification and characterization of diacylglycerol synthesizing enzyme prepared from rat intestinal mucosa. We compare the molecular and catalytic properties of this enzyme and pancreatic lipase prepared from rat pancreas. It is concluded that the two enzymes are either identical or very similar. From these results, we demonstrate that pancreatic lipase digests dietary fats to 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids in the intestinal lumen and then resynthesizes diacylglycerols from these compounds in the intestinal adsorption cells. The sources of the enzyme substrates and reagents used were as follows: [1-14C]oleic acid (2.1 GBq/mmol), [9,10-3H]trioleoylglycerol (991.6 GBq/mmol), [1-14C]trioleoylglycerol (3.95 GBq/mmol), and [9,10-3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1554 GBq/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. [3H]Dipalmitoylglycerol was prepared from [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine by phospholipase C treatment as described previously(12.Tsujita T. Muderhwa J.M. Brockman H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8612-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]Monooleoylglycerol was prepared from [14C]trioleoylglycerol by pancreatic lipase treatment. After a 2-h incubation, lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer(13.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (40887) Google Scholar), and 2-monooleoylglycerol was isolated by preparative thin layer chromatography. Trioleoylglycerol and sodium cholate were from Sigma. Oleic acid and dioleoylglycerol were from NuChek Prep., Inc. (Elysian, MN). Monoacylglycerols and monooleoylglycerol ethers were from Serdary Research Laboratories (London, Ontario, Canada). Peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light) was from Daiichi Kayaku (Tokyo, Japan). Bovine serum albumin was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) and was extracted by the method of Chen (14.Chen R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove free fatty acid. Wistar strain male rats, weighing 150-180 g, were killed, and their intestines (the first 15 cm) were excised and rinsed with 0.9% NaCl. Intestinal mucosa were obtained by scraping the lumenal surface and homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Switzerland) with 9 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM benzamidine (buffer 1). The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g. Powdered ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant, and the active protein, precipitated with 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate, was dissolved in buffer 1. This enzyme solution was dialyzed against the same buffer and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a column of DEAE-cellulose (1.9 × 23 cm) equilibrated with buffer 1. Most enzyme activity was recovered in the nonadsorbed fraction. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, and applied to a CM-Sephadex C-50 column (1.9 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of phosphate buffer (40 to 400 mM), pH 6.1. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 150 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 100 mM NaCl, and loaded on to a column of anti-pancreatic lipase IgG equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein and the gel were incubated together overnight at 4°C under gentle agitation. Then, the column was washed successively with equilibrated phosphate buffer, Triton X-100 buffer (150 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.2) and then again with the original buffer. The active protein was eluted with a 200 mM glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.8. Each fraction was immediately neutralized with 0.1 N NaOH. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and stored at −80°C. Pancreatic lipase was purified from rat pancreas by the procedure of Gidez (15.Gidez L.I. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 794-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The purified enzyme gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from which its molecular weight was estimated to be 49,000. MGAT activity was determined at 37°C in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The assay system contained the following components: 40 nmol of [14C]oleic acid (240,000 dpm), 50 nmol of 2-monooleoylglycerol in acetone (2.5 μl), 10 μmol of potassium phosphate, and 50 μl of enzyme solution. Incubation was carried out at pH 7.0 for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of a mixture of 2-propanol, heptane, and water (80:20:20, v/v) containing [3H]diacylglycerol (0.3 μmol, 100,000 dpm). The mixture was shaken for 15 s, then 1.0 ml of heptane and 0.5 ml of water were added, and the mixture was shaken for an additional 15 s. The upper phase was washed twice with 2 ml of a mixture of ethanol, water, and 0.5 N NaOH (50:50:10, v/v). The radioactivity of the upper heptane phase (0.7 ml) was counted in 8 ml of ACS-II (Amersham Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Values were adjusted for yield, determined from the recovery of 3H. In studies on the effect of fatty acid chain length, the activity was also determined using [14C]monooleoylglycerol. Incubations were carried out at pH 7.0 for 30 min, and diacylglycerols were extracted by the method described above. The upper heptane phase (1 ml) was dried with a stream of nitrogen, solubilized in 50 μl of hexane, and separated by thin layer chromatography (Whatman K-5 silica gel plates) with a hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (60:40:1, v/v). Lipids were located with iodine vapor, and spots of diacylglycerol were scraped off for measurement of their radioactivity. Trioleoylglycerol- and dioleoylglycerol-hydrolyzing activities were determined by measuring the rate of release of [3H]oleic acid. The assay mixture consisted of 0.2 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 μmol of [3H]trioleoylglycerol (120,000 dpm) or 0.3 μmol of [3H]dioleoylglycerol (80,000 dpm) and 1 mg of gum arabic. Incubations were carried out at 37°C for 30 min, and the free oleic acid was extracted and determined by the method of Belfrage and Vaughan (16.Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum against purified rat pancreatic lipase was raised in rabbits. Anti-IgG was purified by the procedure described previously(9.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Anti-IgG (25 mg) was coupled to 10 ml of swollen CNBr-activated Sepharose 6B gel as described previously(7.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, more than 60% of the initial protein was covalently coupled to the gel. Male rats (Wistar strain; 150-180 g) were killed under anesthesia, and their intestines were excised. At a distance of about 7 cm below the common duct entry, a 1.0-cm length of intestine was excised and embedded in paraffin wax by standard procedures. Cross-sections (4 μm thick) were prepared on silanized slides, deparaffinized, and hydrated by standard procedure. After a rinse in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.05% Triton X-100, the sections were incubated with 3% H202 for 10 min at 37°C, for inhibition of internal peroxidase activity. The sections were incubated for 15 min with 10% normal goat serum and then incubated with anti-IgG overnight at 4°C. The specimens were treated by the linked streptavidin-biotin method employing a DAKO LSAB-2 kit (DAKO Japan, Kyoto, Japan). The immunological reaction was visualized by 0.05% 3,3diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride containing 0.01% H2O2. After rinsing with water, sections were stained by Myer's hematoxylin. SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed in 10% gel under reducing conditions as described by Laemmli(17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204272) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting analysis, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and stained using an antibody against rat pancreatic lipase as described previously(7.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. MGAT activity was determined in the absence of coenzyme A and ATP. The tissue distribution of MGAT activity in the rat was measured by homogenizing and centrifuging the tissue at 1,000 × g and assaying the supernatant (Table 1). The highest MGAT activity was observed in the intestinal mucosa, 34-120-fold that found in other tissues. The MGAT activity of intestinal mucosa extract was proportional to the amount of protein and the incubation time (data not shown). The enzyme concentration dependence was not changed by addition of coenzyme A and ATP (data not shown). Over a 15-min incubation period, the activity decreased slightly with time when coenzyme A and ATP were added.Tabled 1 Rat intestinal mucosa (78 g) were homogenized, extracted, fractionated by ammonium sulfate, and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column. The enzyme did not adsorb to the column, and the active wash fraction was pooled and applied to a CM-Sephadex C-50 column (Fig. 1A). The MGAT activity was completely bound and eluted a single peak, developed with a linearly increasing gradient of phosphate concentration. Active fractions (tubes 11-17) were pooled, dialyzed, and applied to an anti-IgG Sepharose column. The enzyme was completely bound and eluted with glycine buffer, pH 2.8 (Fig. 1B). The enzyme purification steps and the enzyme yield at each step are summarized in Table 2. At the final step of purification, the specific MGAT activities was 3,210 nmol/mg of protein/min. Purified enzyme hydrolyzed trioleoylglycerol and dioleoylglycerol, whose specific activities for trioleoylglycerol and dioleoylglycerol were 35,900 and 43,500 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively. The purified enzyme gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from which its molecular weight was estimated to be 49,000 (Fig. 2). Pancreatic lipase purified from rat pancreas also gave a single band, having the same molecular weight. Immunoblotting analysis with antibody against rat pancreatic lipase showed one immunoreactive protein with an estimated molecular weight of 49,000 (Fig. 2). The purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of pH 6.8, which was identical with that found for rat pancreatic lipase (data not shown).Tabled 1Figure 2:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of MGAT from rat intestinal mucosa protein obtained from CM-Sephadex (approximately 37 μg) (lanes 1 and 4) and anti-IgG Sepharose (approximately 3.8 μg) (lanes 2 and 5) columns and purified rat pancreatic lipase (approximately 17 μg) (lane 3). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (lanes 1, 2, and 3) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-IgG against rat pancreatic lipase (lanes 4 and 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purified enzyme was mixed with various amounts of anti-IgG prepared with rat pancreatic lipase, left to stand overnight at 4°C, centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the residual enzyme activities in the supernatant measured. MGAT activity in the supernatant decreased as the amount of anti-IgG increased (Fig. 3). Similar profiles were observed for the inhibition of trioleoylglycerol- and dioleoylglycerol-hydrolyzing activities (data not shown). All three activities were unaffected by nonimmune IgG, which was used as a control (data not shown). The incorporation of 2-monooleoylglycerol and oleic acid into dioleoylglycerol were determined. With a constant 2-monooleoylglycerol level of 0.5 mM, dioleoylglycerol formation increased with the concentration of oleic acid (Fig. 4A). With oleic acid constant at 0.4 mM, the enzyme activity increased with the concentration of 2-monooleoylglycerol up to 0.5 mM and then decreased (Fig. 4B). Table 3 shows the effect of fatty acid chain length on diacylglycerol synthesis by the purified enzyme. With the saturated fatty acid tested, its activity was maximal with myristic acid and fell with decreasing fatty acid chain length. The MGAT activity for caproic acid was not detected. The activity for oleic acid was 8-fold that for stearic acid. The enzyme activity for 2-monoacylglycerol was about 3 to 6 times that for 1-monoacylglycerol (Table 4). With ether analogs of monoacylglycerol as substrates, the MGAT activity for glycerol ether substituted at position 2 was essentially identical with that for glycerol ether substituted at position 1.Tabled 1Tabled 1 Photomicrography revealed a brown reaction on the anti-pancreatic lipase IgG-treated sections of small intestine. The reaction product was consistently visualized within adsorptive cells (Fig. 5A). The submucosa of these sections were also stained strongly by 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (data not shown). On adjacent sections treated with nonimmune IgG, little or no reaction was observed with absorptive cells (Fig. 5B) or other components (data not shown). Anti-IgG against rat pancreatic lipase blocked the MGAT activity of rat intestinal mucosa extract in a dose-dependent manner; about 65% activity was inhibited by addition of the antibody (data not shown). Control nonimmune IgG did not affect MGAT activity in the intestinal mucosa (data not shown). Trioleoylglycerol-hydrolyzing activity of the purified enzyme and pancreatic lipase was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by addition of intestinal mucosa extract (data not shown). Dioleoylglycerol-hydrolyzing activity was also inhibited by the addition of intestinal mucosa extract (data not shown). In this paper, we purified MGAT from rat intestinal mucosa and found that its activity did not depend on coenzyme A and ATP. The purified enzyme might be identical with rat pancreatic lipase, as concluded from the following observations: (a) the purified enzyme had MGAT activity and triacylglycerol- and diacylglycerol-hydrolyzing activities; (b) antibody against rat pancreatic lipase inhibited the activity of MGAT prepared from rat intestinal mucosa (Fig. 3); (c) the band of purified enzyme on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was identical with that of rat pancreatic lipase, and it was detected by immunoblotting analysis using antibody against rat pancreatic lipase (Fig. 2); (d) immunoreactive protein against rat pancreatic lipase was distributed within intestinal cells (Fig. 5). We have previously reported that lipase(s) and esterase(s) synthesize fatty acyl esters. Carboxylesterase from rat adipose tissue can synthesize fatty acid ethyl esters from free fatty acid and ethanol (7.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23489-23494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase and carboxyl ester lipase also synthesize their esters from fatty acid and ethanol(8.Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5884-5889PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Tsujita T. Okuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism of fatty acid ethyl ester formation by the enzyme is as follows. When the enzyme was incubated with fatty acid and ethanol, an acyl-enzyme intermediate was formed and fatty acid ethyl ester was synthesized though nucleophilic displacement by ethanol. Exchange of fatty acid carboxyl oxygens with water oxygens was demonstrated by Muderhwa et al.(18.Muderhwa J.M. Schmid P.C. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using 18O water. They suggested that fatty acids are good “substrates” for lipase(s). Mechanistic studies indicated that reactions catalyzed by the enzyme proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The primary structure of these enzymes contains Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly, which is the common active site sequence of a serine enzyme(19.Kissel J.A. Fontaine R.N. Turck C.W. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of these enzymes resembles that of serine proteinase catalysis, which proceeds via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Pancreatic lipase is also a serine enzyme(20.Winkler F.K. D'arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the synthesis of fatty acid ethyl ester from fatty acid and ethanol(21.Riley D.J.S. Kyger E.M. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3848-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrated that pancreatic lipase catalyzed the synthesis of diacylglycerol from free fatty acid and 2-monoacylglycerol. In this reaction, it was supposed that diacylglycerol was also synthesized through nucleophilic displacement by monoacylglycerol via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The lipase(s) is reported to synthesize some esters in organic or alcohol media. Porcine pancreatic lipase catalyzes transesterification between tributyl glycerol and various primary and secondary alcohols in a 99% organic medium(22.Zaks A. Klibanov A.M. Science. 1984; 224: 1249-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Microbial lipase(s) also synthesize oleoylglycerols from oleic acid and glycerol in an 80% glycerol medium (23.Tsujisaka Y. Okumura S. Iwai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 489: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Proteases also catalyze the synthesis of peptide bonds in organic media(24.Fruton J.S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 239-306PubMed Google Scholar). These serine enzymes are used industrially for ester or peptide synthesis in organic media. In an organic medium, which contains a very low concentration of water, the enzyme also forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate, and the esters are easily synthesized by nucleophilic displacement by alcohols instead of water. In other word, “alcoholysis” rather than “hydrolysis” of the acyl-enzyme intermediate took place. Usually, the reaction site of lipase is the lipid-water interface, such as the plasma membrane or lipoprotein surface in an aqueous medium. Alcohols such as ethanol or monoacylglycerol might more easily approach the lipid-water interface than water because alcohols are more hydrophobic than water. Therefore, lipase(s) might be able to synthesize the esters in an aqueous medium at the lipid-water interface. In this study, we demonstrated that pancreatic lipase catalyzes diacylglycerol synthesis in an aqueous medium. Dietary fat (triacylglycerol) is hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids prior to its absorption by the intestinal villus cells. In enterocytes, these products enter the monoacylglycerol pathway, the predominant route for acylglycerol biosynthesis in the absorptive cells. The sequential intracellular re-esterification of 2-monoacylglycerol to triacylglycerol is catalyzed by a triacylglycerol synthetase complex(25.Rao G.A. Johnston J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 125: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26.Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which distributes intestinal microsomes and consists of MGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and acyl-coenzyme A synthetase. MGAT (monoglyceride acyltransferase, Enzyme Nomenclature EC 2.3.1.22) catalyzes the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols from 2-monoacylglycerols and long chain fatty acyl-coenzymes A. High levels of activity were observed in intestinal mucosa and liver microsomes of suckling rats(4.Mattson F.H. Volpenhein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 224-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that pancreatic lipase might be distributed within intestinal cells and that it had MGAT activity independently of coenzyme A and ATP. The specific MGAT activity (3.21 μmol/mg of protein/min) of pancreatic lipase was about three times that of purified MGAT from rat liver (1.22 μmol/mg of protein/min) (27.Bhat B.G. Bardes E.S.-G. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of ester-synthesizing activity as a reverse catalytic activity of lipase is well known. The specific activity of the forward reaction (diacylglycerol hydrolysis, 43.5 μmol/mg of protein/min) was about 14 times that of the reverse reaction (MGAT activity). However, the diacylglycerol-hydrolyzing activity of the lipase was inhibited by addition of intestinal mucosa extract. Indeed, when free fatty acid and 2-monooleoylglycerol were incubated with rat intestinal mucosa extract, diacylglycerols were formed to an extent depending on dose and time. These activities were not activated by the addition of ATP and coenzyme A. Furthermore, these activities were inhibited in intestinal mucosa extract by addition of the antibody against rat pancreatic lipase. Bosner et al.(28.Bosner M.S. Gulick T. Riley D.J.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20261-20264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that human pancreatic lipase bound to intestinal cell membranes and modulated the uptake of fatty acid derived from triacylglycerols cleaved by the lipase. They also suggested that the binding site was composed of a heparin which is a component of the brush-border membrane. However, MGAT activity in the intestinal mucosa was not changed by washing it with heparin (100 units/ml) or high concentrations of NaCl (2 M) (data not shown). Furthermore, in an immunocytochemical study using antibody against rat pancreatic lipase, immunoreactive product was not observed on the microvillar surface (Fig. 5), although it was observed within absorptive cells. Similar distribution was observed for another pancreatic enzyme, cholesterol esterase. Gallo et al.(29.Gallo L.L. Chiang Y. Vahouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. J.

They proposed two roles for pancreatic cholesterol esterase in the process of adsorption of dietary cholesterol in the intestine; catalysis of the hydrolysis of dietary cholesterol ester and maybe the catalysis of cholesterol ester re-esterification after being taken up by the villus cell. In this study, we propose two roles for pancreatic lipase in the process of dietary fat adsorption, like a cholesterol esterase; the digestion of dietary fats to 2-monoacylglycerols and fatty acids in the intestinal lumen, and possibly the catalysis of diacylglycerol resynthesis from 2-monoacylglycerol and free fatty acid in the intestinal absorptive cells."

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 645-651Google Scholar, 3.Horiuchi K.Y. Miyata H. Chacko S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 962-968Google Scholar, 6.Dabrowska R. Gouch A. Galazkiewicz B. Osinska H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 842: 70-75Google Scholar). CaD is thought to be a protein involved in the thin filament-mediated regulation that complements the myosin-mediated regulation of smooth muscle myosin via myosin light chain phosphorylation and dephosphorylation ((8.Sobieszek A. Small J.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 559-576Google Scholar, 9.Gorecka A. Aksoy M.O. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 325-331Google Scholar, 10.Chacko S.

Biochem. 1980; 49: 921-956Google Scholar)).Structurally, CaD is a long asymmetric monomeric (80 × 2 nm) molecule that is localized along the actin filament, covering 7-14 actin monomers(12.Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Google Scholar, 13.Marston S.B. Lehman W. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 517-522Google Scholar, 14.Lehman W. Moody C.J. Craig R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 75-84Google Scholar). While the CaD C terminus binds to actin, the N-terminal region of CaD binds to the S-2 regions of the myosin(15.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3055-3058Google Scholar, 16.Southerland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 578-583Google Scholar). An understanding of the structural and functional domains on the CaD molecule, responsible for its interaction with myosin, actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin, is essential to elucidate the mechanism by which CaD down-regulates actomyosin ATPase activity. Previous studies (17.Szpacenko A. Dabrowska R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 182-186Google Scholar, 18.Fujii T. Imai M. Rosenfeld G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2757-2763Google Scholar, 19.Horiuchi K.Y. Samuel M. Chacko S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 712-717Google Scholar) have demonstrated an actin- and a calmodulin-binding region on the C-terminal proteolytic fragment of ∼38 kDa (as determined by SDS-PAGE). The 38-kDa fragment possesses the ability to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity, but it fails to cross-link myosin to actin (19.Horiuchi K.Y. Samuel M. Chacko S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 712-717Google Scholar, 20.Dobrowolski Z. Borovikov Y.S. Nowak E. Galazkiewicz B. Dabrowska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 140-150Google Scholar). Using a bacterial expression system, Redwood and Marston (21.Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Google Scholar) made several CaD fragments containing the sequences for actin- and calmodulin-binding sites and for the region responsible for the inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin. Since CaD fragments, either derived from proteolysis or produced by a bacterial expression system, lack a major portion of the molecule, they do not produce the structural association between actin and caldesmon that is likely to be associated with the thin filament-mediated regulation in smooth muscle.Recombinant CaD produced using the baculovirus expression system is functionally and structurally similar to the native molecule(22.Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Jacob S.S. Gopalakurup S. Chacko S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 646-658Google Scholar). In this study, we utilize caldesmon mutants made in a baculovirus expression system to characterize the actin-, tropomyosin-, and calmodulin-binding domains and the ATPase inhibitory domain on the CaD C terminus. Deletion of specific sequences from the C-terminal region, without affecting the major portion of the molecule responsible for the structural association with the actin filament, enabled us to delineate the calmodulin-, actin-, and tropomyosin-binding domains and to study the effect of these domains on the actin-activated ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin. We demonstrate that the sequence that is present in the proteolytic CaD fragment of 7.3 kDa (residues between Leu597 and Phe665), thought to contain the region responsible for the inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase of myosin S-1(12.Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Google Scholar), is not important for the inhibition of the actin activation of smooth muscle myosin ATPase in either the presence or absence of tropomyosin. The region between residues 690 and 756 contains the high affinity actin-binding site(s) and the domain that is important for the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. We also show that deletion of a sequence (residues 718-725) previously reported to be important for calmodulin binding to CaD, based on experiments using a bacterially expressed CaD fragment(23.Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Google Scholar, 24.Huber P.A.J. Grabarek Z. Slatter D.A. Levine B.A. Marston S.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A59Google Scholar), has no effect on calmodulin binding.DISCUSSIONOur data utilizing these truncated CaD proteins reveal some important differences from the data obtained from studies using bacterially expressed or proteolytic CaD fragments, presumably due to the lack of structural association present in protein-protein interaction. The major myosin-binding site is located in the N terminus of CaD(15.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3055-3058Google Scholar, 39.Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19672-19678Google Scholar), and a recent study shows that the residues between positions 235 and 531 of rat nonmuscle CaD coprecipitate with smooth muscle myosin in an in vitro binding assay(40.Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Google Scholar). This finding is further supported by Marston and co-workers(41.Huber P.A.J. Redwood C.S. Avent N.D. Tanner M.J.A. Marston S.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 385-391Google Scholar), who showed that a bacterially produced fragment composed of the 288 residues at the C-terminal region of human nonmuscle CaD bound to myosin. But the ability of this fragment to bind to myosin was not compared with that of CaD containing the central helical region and parts of the C terminus. In the present study, a slight decrease (6, 11, and 13% for CaD-(1-717), CaD-(1-627), and CaD-(1-597), respectively) in the binding of caldesmon mutants to myosin was observed when compared with the full-length molecule. This is probably caused by the conformational change in the rest of the CaD molecule. Maximal binding of CaD to myosin seems to require the C-terminal region of CaD to be intact.Studies using chymotryptic peptides of CaD have demonstrated that the C-terminal region of CaD contains a calmodulin-binding site, presumably in the region between residues 629 and 666(37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar). Zhan et al.(42.Zhan Q. Wong S.S. Wang C.L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21810-21814Google Scholar) showed that a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence homologous to CaD between residues 658 and 666 bound to calmodulin. A recent report showed that a synthetic peptide spanning the residues between positions 675 and 695 bound to calmodulin-Sepharose and was eluted with EGTA(43.Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Google Scholar). These data indicate the possibility that another calmodulin-binding site exists in the C-terminal end of CaD. Data from the present study reveal that the C-terminal high affinity calmodulin-binding site of chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD is located in the last 129 amino acids, probably involving two or more discontinuous epitopes. The residues between positions 690 and 717 and positions 658 and 689 play a major role in maintaining high affinity binding to calmodulin since deletion of either of these regions results in a significant decrease in calmodulin binding when compared with that of full-length CaD. These data further confirmed the results from analyses of synthetic peptides(42.Zhan Q. Wong S.S. Wang C.L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21810-21814Google Scholar, 43.Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Google Scholar), which determined that the last 99 amino acid residues contained two calmodulin-binding determinants. It has been proposed that the core regions of the two calmodulin-binding determinants more likely involve residues 658-666 (calmodulin-binding motif 1) (42.Zhan Q. Wong S.S. Wang C.L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21810-21814Google Scholar) and residues 675-695 (calmodulin-binding motif 2)(43.Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Google Scholar), respectively. Based on the information from the data in the present study and on comparison with data from published reports(43.Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Google Scholar), the core region of calmodulin-binding motif 2 can be further defined to a 5-amino acid stretch from Asn690 to Lys695 (Fig. 11). Our results also show that the residues between positions 628 and 657, part of the sequence included in the region indicated by Wang et al.(37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar) as the partial sequence for calmodulin binding on the CaD molecule, do not contain a region responsible for the high affinity binding of CaD to calmodulin. However, CaD-(1-657) binds weakly to calmodulin, but CaD-(1-627) does not (Figure 4:, Figure 5:), indicating that the region between residues 628 and 657 contains a sequence responsible for weak calmodulin binding. In addition, our data rule out a calmodulin-binding site in the region between residues 718 and 756, a region suggested by Marston and co-workers (23.Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Google Scholar, 24.Huber P.A.J. Grabarek Z. Slatter D.A. Levine B.A. Marston S.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A59Google Scholar) to be important for calmodulin binding. The difference in the conformation between the truncated proteins containing the N-terminal and central helical regions used in the present study and the caldesmon fragments used in previous studies may account for this discrepancy. Calmodulin binding is similar for truncated CaD-(1-717) and full-length CaD (Fig. 5). However, in the presence of CaM, the dissociation of full-length CaD and CaD-(1-717) from actin is the same, despite the weak binding of the latter to actin. This suggests that calmodulin dissociates the bound CaD from actin by inducing a similar conformational change in the regions between residues 690 and 717 and residues 718 and 756.It is well known that tropomyosin, a coiled-coil thin filament-associated protein, can directly bind to CaD with a stoichiometry of 1-2 mol of tropomyosin/mol of CaD(13.Marston S.B. Lehman W. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 517-522Google Scholar, 14.Lehman W. Moody C.J. Craig R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 75-84Google Scholar, 44.Graceffa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 139-142Google Scholar). Electron microscopic observations of reconstituted thin filament revealed that CaD fixes tropomyosin in a particular position on actin filaments(45.Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 313-321Google Scholar). However, there is very little information on the tropomyosin-binding sites on CaD. Based upon sequence alignment analysis with the tropomyosin-binding site on troponin T, the tropomyosin-binding site on chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD is proposed to lie between residues 508 and 565(35.Bryan J. Imai M. Lee R. Moore P. Cook R.G. Lin W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13873-13879Google Scholar, 37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar). Our data with truncated CaD show that the deletion of 39 residues at the C-terminal end of CaD remarkably reduces the binding of CaD to tropomyosin (Fig. 6), in contrast to the report by Redwood and Marston (21.Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Google Scholar) showing that there is no tropomyosin-binding site between residues 658 and 756. Further removal of up to 120 residues from Asn598 to Gly717 (as in CaD-(1-597), CaD-(1-627), CaD-(1-657), and CaD-(1-689)) caused only a slight decrease in the binding to tropomyosin. These results suggest strongly that CaD contains two or more tropomyosin-binding sites; the major tropomyosin-binding site apparently resides in the C-terminal 39 amino acids. It appears that the region between amino acids 627 and 717 of CaD is not involved in the binding of tropomyosin since only a small difference is observed between CaD-(1-627) and CaD-(1-717) in tropomyosin binding.This study is in agreement with our previous finding that tropomyosin can enhance the binding of CaD to actin via a triggering of conformational changes on these thin filament-associated proteins(33.Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8388-8393Google Scholar). The binding of full-length CaD and CaD-(1-717) or CaD-(1-689) to actin was higher in the presence of tropomyosin than in its absence (Fig. 7A). It should be noted that the actin binding of CaD-(1-657), CaD-(1-627), and CaD-(1-597) can be slightly enhanced by tropomyosin (Fig. 7B), indicating that a tropomyosin-binding site present in the region between residues 1 and 597, perhaps in the region between residues 230 and 419 of CaD shown to bind to tropomyosin(21.Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Google Scholar), is also responsible for the tropomyosin-enhanced binding of CaD to actin.The major actin-binding site(s) on the CaD molecule has been traced to the C-terminal region of CaD, perhaps between residues 659 and 665 (12.Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Google Scholar) or involving two independent binding motifs that are separated by residues 629-666(37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar). Our cosedimentation binding assays reveal that there are a number of actin-binding motifs present within the last 159 amino acids at the C terminus of chicken gizzard CaD. CaD-(1-717), which lacks 39 amino acids, shows diminished binding to actin, suggesting that the residues between positions 718 and 756 contributed to the high affinity actin-binding site as postulated by Wang et al.(37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar). However, another crucial actin-binding determinant has been found to lie between residues 690 and 717 (Fig. 7A). It is possible that these sequences are components of one binding site with more than one determinant. The observation that CaD-(1-657) weakly bound to actin rules out the possibility that the region between residues 597 and 629 (37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar) is attributable to the high affinity actin binding of CaD. As described in our previous report(22.Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Jacob S.S. Gopalakurup S. Chacko S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 646-658Google Scholar), CaD-(1-597), which lacks 156 residues at the C terminus of CaD, weakly binds to actin. However, the apparent Kd value for CaD-(1-597) was 5-fold higher than that for full-length CaD, indicating that the region between amino acids 1 and 597 contains an additional low affinity actin-binding site. Interestingly, an actin-binding site in residues 483-508 has been proposed by Wang et al.(37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar), and a recent electron microscopic image (46.Mabuchi K. Lin J.J.C. Wang C.L.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 54-64Google Scholar) also provides direct evidence that both ends of CaD interact with actin filaments.It has been well established that CaD inhibits the actin-activated or tropomyosin-actin-activated ATPase activity of both myosin I and myosin II(1.Sobue K. Takahash K. Wakabayash I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 645-651Google Scholar, 2.Marston S.B. Smith C.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1985; 6: 669-708Google Scholar, 3.Horiuchi K.Y. Miyata H. Chacko S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 962-968Google Scholar, 4.Lash J.A. Sellers J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16155-16160Google Scholar, 5.Velaz L. Hemric M.E.

Several lines of evidence show that the inhibitory region is located in the last 99 amino acids at the C terminus of CaD (19.Horiuchi K.Y. Samuel M. Chacko S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 712-717Google Scholar, 21.Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Google Scholar). Our present study reveals that there are at least two ATPase inhibitory determinants in the C-terminal region of chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD. These determinants are between residues 718 and 756 and residues 690 and 717 (Fig. 9, A and B). The residues between positions 658 and 689, which contain most of the amino acid sequence of the 7.3-kDa chymotryptic fragment(12.Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Google Scholar), cause only a very weak ATPase inhibition (see inhibition by CaD-(1-689) and CaD-(1-657) in Fig. 9). In contrast, the domain between residues 718 and 756 contains the critical determinants for the ATPase inhibition since CaD-(1-717), lacking the residues between positions 718 and 756, displays 30% of the ATPase inhibition produced by full-length CaD (Fig. 9). As expected, both CaD-(1-627) and CaD-(1-597) did not elicit any effect on the actin-activated ATPase activity, consistent with previous reports(21.Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Google Scholar, 22.Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Jacob S.S. Gopalakurup S. Chacko S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 646-658Google Scholar, 37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar). These data indicate that the sequences between residues 690 and 717 and residues 718 and 756 contain the essential regulatory motifs for the actin-activated ATPase activity, and these regulatory motifs are functionally independent or separate. Our present results are in agreement with the observation of Wang et al.(37.Wang C.L.A. Wang L.W.C. Xu S. Lu R.C. Saavedra-Alanis V. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Google Scholar) that the last 39 amino acid residues of CaD are mainly responsible for the inhibition of the actin activation of myosin ATPase. These findings conflict with the observation of Chalovich et al.(12.Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Google Scholar) that the residues between positions 597 and 665 encompass the major inhibitory sequences for actomyosin ATPase. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear; interestingly, this proteolytic fragment bound to actin at a 1:1 molar ratio, and the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase required a very high CaD fragment (7.3 kDa) to actin molar ratio, although the intact CaD molecule covers between 7 and 14 actin monomers.Tropomyosin-dependent ATPase inhibition was also tested in our study. The ATPase inhibition caused by CaD-(1-717), but not by CaD-(1-689), was potentiated by tropomyosin, suggesting that the region between residues 690 and 756 is related to the tropomyosin-dependent ATPase inhibition. At the same molar ratio of CaD to actin, the percent inhibition in the presence of tropomyosin is higher than that in its absence (Fig. 10, A and B).In conclusion, as shown in Fig. 11, the last 66 amino acid residues at the C terminus of CaD contain two or more major motifs for actin binding, a tropomyosin-binding determinant, and one high affinity calmodulin-binding determinant, of which the last 39 amino acid residues are involved in both actin binding and tropomyosin binding. The tropomyosin-binding motif in the region consisting of the last 39 amino acids can be further defined to a 10-amino acid stretch between residues 718-727 using a C-terminal deletion mutant that lacks residues between positions 728 and 756(47.Horiuchi K.Y. Wang Z. Chacko S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16815-16820Google Scholar). This region is also responsible for the major inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin. The 28-amino acid stretch (residues 690-717) encompasses both low affinity actin binding and high affinity calmodulin binding. These results suggest that the calmodulin-, actin-, and tropomyosin-binding motifs on the CaD molecule are overlapping or are closely juxtaposed with each other. The localization of these important motifs at the C terminus of CaD helps add to the basic understanding of the structural and functional domains on the CaD molecule involved in the regulation of actin-activated ATP hydrolysis by myosin. INTRODUCTIONThe thin filament-associated protein caldesmon (CaD) 1The abbreviations used are: CaDcaldesmonPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albuminMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. binds to actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin, and the binding of this protein to actin or tropomyosin-actin inhibits the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin(1.Sobue K.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13656-13659Google Scholar). Furthermore, tropomyosin amplifies the caldesmon-induced inhibition of actin-activated myosin ATPase activity (1.Sobue K. Takahash K. Wakabayash I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 645-651Google Scholar, 3.Horiuchi K.Y. Miyata H. Chacko S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 962-968Google Scholar, 6.Dabrowska R. Gouch A. Galazkiewicz B. Osinska H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 842: 70-75Google Scholar). CaD is thought to be a protein involved in the thin filament-mediated regulation that complements the myosin-mediated regulation of smooth muscle myosin via myosin light chain phosphorylation and dephosphorylation ((8.Sobieszek A. Small J.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 559-576Google Scholar, 9.Gorecka A. Aksoy M.O. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 325-331Google Scholar, 10.Chacko S.

Biochem. 1980; 49: 921-956Google Scholar)).Structurally, CaD is a long asymmetric monomeric (80 × 2 nm) molecule that is localized along the actin filament, covering 7-14 actin monomers(12.Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Google Scholar, 13.Marston S.B. Lehman W. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 517-522Google Scholar, 14.Lehman W. Moody C.J. Craig R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 75-84Google Scholar). While the CaD C terminus binds to actin, the N-terminal region of CaD binds to the S-2 regions of the myosin(15.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3055-3058Google Scholar, 16.Southerland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 578-583Google Scholar). An understanding of the structural and functional domains on the CaD molecule, responsible for its interaction with myosin, actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin, is essential to elucidate the mechanism by which CaD down-regulates actomyosin ATPase activity. Previous studies (17.Szpacenko A. Dabrowska R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 182-"
https://openalex.org/W2086990011,"Abstract Substance P (SP) is a peptide neurotransmitter that is involved in multiple responses in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems through a G-protein-coupled receptor. The primary structure of the rat SP receptor contains a number of conserved cysteine residues. To localize and identify the cysteine residues that participate in receptor binding, intact Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the SP receptor were treated with various sulfhydryl reagents and the effect of these reagents on radioiodinated SP binding affinity and dissociation rate was determined. We used a series of amphiphilic maleimide derivatives in which the reactive maleimide group penetrates to different depths within the plane of membrane. Only the maleimide derivatives with intermediate chain lengths modified receptor binding properties, indicating that the reactive sulfhydryl group is located within a transmembrane domain of the receptor close (within 1.7 nm) to the extracellular border. Since peptide binding to a mutant receptor C199S, in which Cys-199 was replaced by a serine, was found to be insensitive to modulation by sulfhydryl reagents, this reactive sulfhydryl group is on Cys-199 of the receptor. Receptor occupancy by SP protects Cys-199 from modification and thus this residue is either located at or conformationally linked to the SP binding site."

Cell growth and function are regulated through the action of a variety of extracellular ligands binding to specific receptors, initiating intracellular signaling mediated by sequentially activated protein kinases. Serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase C are critically important enzymes modulating cellular function(1.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). Platelets are the progeny of bone marrow megakaryocytes that circulate in blood to effect hemostasis and thrombosis. They are not only critically important for human physiology and pathology, but have also been used to study basic principles of cell signaling.

Angiotensin II (AII) is a potent effector octapeptide that mediates cardiovascular, neuronal, and renal function(3.Timmermans P.B.M.W. M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251Google Scholar). Biological effects of AII are mediated by two distinct receptors, termed AT1 and AT2. AT1 receptors have been cloned from several mammalian sources(4.Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Google Scholar, 5.Sasaki K. Yamano Y.

AII signaling in adult tissues is almost exclusively mediated by the AT1 receptor(3.Timmermans P.B.M.W. M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M.

The amphibian AII receptors that have been cloned are functionally similar to AT1 receptors, but do not bind the non-peptide AII-binding antagonist losartan(12.Hong J. Sandberg K. Zhang Y. Catt K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 756-762Google Scholar, 13.Bergsma D.J. Ellis C. Nuthulaganti P. Nambi K. Scalfe C. Kumar C. Alyar N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 277-284Google Scholar). All AT1 receptors and the amphibian AII receptors have several Ser/Thr residues in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail that may serve as substrates for phosphorylation by protein kinase C(14.Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Google Scholar). This phosphorylation may drive the agonist-induced internalization of AT1 receptors (as well as other G protein-coupled receptors), resulting in cellular desensitization(15.Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Google Scholar). This report describes the isolation of a novel cDNA clone coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 8110 Da. This protein shows significant homology to the regulatory C-terminal domains of the amphibian AII and mammalian AT1 receptors (59 and 45%, respectively, over a 40-amino acid stretch). This homology includes four consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and a receptor internalization signal(14.Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Google Scholar, 15.Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with an anti-peptide antiserum demonstrates that the native protein is expressed in human platelets and cultured cells of human megakaryocytic lineage. A 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated HEL cell line cDNA library in λgt10 (CLONTECH) was oligoscreened simultaneously with two 30-mer oligoprobes (probe 1, 5′-GATGAACCICTICAGTCICCICCIGACCGI-3′; and probe 2, 5′-GACGAGCCICTICAGAGCCCICCIGACAGA-3′). The oligoprobes were based on the N-terminal sequence of a protein purified from shear-activated platelets(16.Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. Guo Z. Durante W. Razdan K. Hrbolich J.K. Schafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3520-3524Google Scholar). Phages (105) were screened, and one clone showed strong hybridization to the oligoprobes. Hybridization was done overnight at 55°C in 6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, and 100 μg/ml sonicated denatured salmon sperm DNA. The final wash was performed in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55°C for 30 min. Plaques were lifted on Colony/PlaqueScreen hybridization transfer membranes (DuPont NEN) and were treated as described by the manufacturer. Methods for bacterial and phage plating, labeling of oligoprobes, and purification were as described by Wallace and Miyada(17.Wallace R.B. Miyada C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 432-442Google Scholar). Techniques for prehybridization and hybridization and other routine molecular biology methods were as described by Sambrook et al.(18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One phage that showed the strongest hybridization to the oligoprobes was plaque-purified. Phage DNA was isolated by the method of Elliot and Green(19.Elliot R.M. Green C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 89-93Google Scholar). This DNA was digested with EcoRI, and a 1.8-kilobase insert was cloned in pcDNAI (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing with purified recombinant plasmid (RP15a) was done with T7 and SP6 promoter primers and with internal sequence primers. A Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was used for plasmid sequencing. Synthesis of all oligonucleotides was done by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). Homology searches were done using EUGENE software at the Molecular Biology Computational Resource Center at Baylor College of Medicine. The BLAST program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information was used for data base comparisons. Total RNA was isolated from platelets and 100 ng/ml 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated HEL and DAMI cell cultures using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel Test “B” Inc., Houston, TX). Platelets were purified from 250 ml of freshly drawn human blood by the albumin density gradient method as described(20.Razdan K. Hellums J.D. Kroll M.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 681-686Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out with a Gene-Amp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). RT reactions were done using random hexamers as primers. Two primers were used for PCR amplification (forward primer, 5′-GTGACTGGTTAAGGTGTGTGCCACTGTACATA-3′ (nucleotides 57-86); and reverse primer, 5′-GGCTCTGGGCTGTGCTCAGTGTCTTTGGCC-3′ (nucleotides 1761-1790)). PCRs were carried out at 95°C for 2 min (one cycle), 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min (35 cycles) and with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose, transferred to GeneScreen Plus (DuPont NEN), and hybridized to a RNA probe generated from pRP15a using T7 RNA polymerase, [32P]CTP (DuPont NEN), and an in vitro transcription kit (Promega). A human multiple tissue Northern blot panel was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and probed with labeled antisense RNA generated using SP6 RNA polymerase, [32P]CTP, and the in vitro transcription kit. Prehybridization and hybridization were done in 6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, and 100 μg/ml sonicated denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65°C. Unincorporated label was removed using a Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad). A polyclonal antiserum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide comprising putative amino acid residues 5-19 (FCSLGDRAACSVITA), a region without homology to any known proteins or cDNAs. The synthetic peptide and antiserum were prepared by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). Lysates from albumin gradient-washed platelets and from 100 ng/ml 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated HEL and DAMI cells were prepared by adding to cells a solution containing 50% glycerol, 10% dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, and trace bromphenol blue, followed by immediate boiling for 10 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separations of 200 μg of lysate protein were performed on 10-20% gradient slab gels, and proteins were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously(20.Razdan K. Hellums J.D. Kroll M.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 681-686Google Scholar). Protein detection was carried out by established methods (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline as the blocking buffer. Goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody. In the competition experiments, 200 μg/ml peptide was added to the primary antibody-containing solution. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned HEL cell cDNA (Fig. 1) shows that the putative synthesis of a 71-amino acid protein (pRP15a) begins at an initiation codon following the Kozak rules for eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation(21.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). The 1815-base pair cDNA has the consensus polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) 19 bases from the 3′-end and a selective mRNA destabilization signal (ATTTA) in the 3′-untranslated region(22.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar). This signal is also present in the AII receptor 3′-untranslated sequences (see below). Comparison of amino acid residues 21-60 of pRP15a with the C-terminal domain of angiotensin receptors reveals significant homology (Table 1). pRP15a shares 34% identity and 59% homology (identical plus chemically similar amino acids) with the amphibian AII receptor. pRP15a shares an average identity of 26% and an average homology of 45% with members of the family of mammalian AT1 receptors. The homology between pRP15a and AII receptors involves four potential consensus sequences for phosphorylation by Ser/Thr kinases such as protein kinase C(23.Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Google Scholar). Hunyady et al.(15.Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Google Scholar) have hypothesized that in the rat AT1 receptor and other G protein-coupled receptors, phosphorylation at these Ser/Thr residues drives ligand-induced receptor internalization. More specifically, they have identified the sequence Ser-Thr-Leu in the C-terminal domain of the rat AT1 receptor as crucial for receptor internalization. pRP15a has the sequence Ser-Phe-Leu (residues 32-34) (Table 1) at these positions. The amphibian AII receptor also lacks the central Thr residue (Table 1). Paxton et al.(24.Paxton W.G. Marrero M.B. Klein J.D. Delafontaine P. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 260-267Google Scholar) have shown that the C-terminal 54 amino acids of the overexpressed rat AT1 receptor serve as a substrate in vitro for the Src family of tyrosine kinases, and this tyrosine phosphorylation might regulate AT1 receptor-induced activation of phospholipase C-γ (25.Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Google Scholar). pRP15a has tyrosine residues at positions 45 and 49, which are potential sites for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases (Table 1). The C-terminal 50 amino acids of the rat AT1 receptor may also be required for receptor interactions with heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins(26.Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Google Scholar). The functional significance of the homology between pRP15a and the regulatory cytoplasmic C terminus of AII receptors remains to be established.Tabled 1 RT-PCR demonstrates that the transcript is present in platelets and in cultured platelet progenitor cell lines (Fig. 2). These results indicate that pRP15a gene expression occurs in cells of hematopoietic lineage(27.Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Google Scholar). High stringency Northern hybridization of a human multiple tissue blot (Fig. 3) shows that there is a tissue-specific distribution of transcripts of varying size. A transcript of ≈1.3 kilobases is predominant in skeletal muscle, and pancreas shows two transcript species of ≈1.65 and ≈1 kilobases. Brain and liver also have low level expression of these transcripts (data not shown). These three transcript sizes do not correspond to the length of the 1815-base pair cDNA clone and may therefore represent either alternative processing of a common RNA precursor or four different gene products with a high degree of homology. In vitro translation of pRP15a using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [35S]methionine produces a band with a molecular mass of ≈8 kDa as well as a series of smaller internal peptides that often mask the 8-kDa protein (data not shown). Immunoblotting of protein lysates shows an intense narrow band of ≈8 kDa in platelets and HEL cells and a faint band of identical size in DAMI cells. These bands are not seen on immunoblots performed in the presence of 200 μg/ml immunizing peptide (Fig. 4). pRP15a is likely to be a membrane-associated protein because this protein could not be expressed in bacteria using a vector under the control of a prokaryotic promoter (pBlueScript). This necessitated the cloning of the 1.8-kilobase insert in a eukaryotic expression vector like pcDNAI. Hydropathy analysis revealed a single N-terminal hydrophobic domain, thereby providing additional evidence that pRP15a is membrane-associated (data not shown). In summary, pRP15a appears to represent a novel protein that may serve as a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinases. Its homology to the regulatory carboxyl-terminal regions of mammalian AT1 and amphibian AII receptors supports the hypothesis that pRP15a may have some signaling function. Further experiments are in progress to test this hypothesis by determining the location and phosphorylation state of the protein in resting and stimulated platelets, HEL cells, and DAMI cells and by examining the location and signaling function in heterologous cells overexpressing the recombinant protein."
