https://openalex.org/W2029405287,"ε-(γ-Glutamyl)lysine has been isolated from enzymatic hydrolyzates of cross-linked human fibrin. This compound was not detected in ""non-cross-linked"" fibrin prepared with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which inhibits factor XIII; intermediate amounts were observed when the fibrin was prepared with glycine ethyl ester, which inhibits factor XIII competitively. These and ancillary experiments furnish conclusive evidence that ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links form in human fibrin during polymerization catalyzed by factor XIII."
https://openalex.org/W1548938191,"Ethylenediaminetetraacetate added to washed cells in tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffer increases the surface permeability of all coliforms tested, including nine strains of Escherichia coli, one strain of Aerobacter aerogenes, and four species of Salmonella. Although this treatment increases passive permeability, two transport systems tested were unaffected. The permeability change is complete within 15 sec after EDTA addition at both 4° and 37°. Mg++ and metals of greater affinity than Mg++ for EDTA prevent the permeability change; Na+ and K+ do not. Those ions that prevent EDTA action cannot immediately reverse it. As treated cells metabolize, they repair their permeability barrier, restoring it completely in a period equivalent to two-thirds of a doubling time. Tests of the conditions necessary to permit repair suggest that repair requires energy metabolism but does not require protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, or surface mucopeptide synthesis. The results support the hypothesis that EDTA causes the permeability change by binding a metal, probably Mg++, and that the cell surface then undergoes a steric or chemical change that requires energy metabolism for its reversal."
https://openalex.org/W1524703060,"The properties of purified preparations of the internal and external invertases of yeast, designated by their location relative to the cell membrane, show similarities and marked disparities. The molecular weight and the specific activity of the internal enzyme are similar to those of the protein moiety of the external, but their amino acid compositions differ. The external invertase contains cystine or cysteine, and the internal enzyme does not, but neither is activated by cysteine. If the disparities in amino acid composition reflect enzymes that are aggregates of different subunits, at least one of which is identical in the two enzymes, the close similarities of all the other properties would then suggest a precursor-product relationship. The internal enzyme contains little or no carbohydrate, whereas the external invertase is a glycoprotein containing 50% mannan and 3% glucosamine. The latter probably links the protein with the carbohydrate moiety. Both invertases have the same Km for sucrose and raffinose, and neither shows an appreciable transferase activity. The pH optimum for enzymatic activity is the same, but their pH-stability curves differ, the internal invertase showing reversible inactivation at acid pH. The internal invertase has a higher mobility than the external in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.8 and 8.6. The enzymes are immunologically related, and sucrose-negative mutants lack both external and internal invertase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1588380766,"A procedure is described for the purification and crystallization of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from p-hydroxybenzoate-induced cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall purification was about 30-fold, with 23% yield. Crystallization of the enzyme was achieved when it was incubated with a sulfhydryl reagent such as mercaptoethanol for over 1 week prior to the addition of ammonium sulfate. The crystalline enzyme was homogeneous as judged by ultracentrifugation, starch gel electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis. The molecular weight was estimated to be approximately 700,000 and the molecular activity was calculated to be 45,500 at 24°. The enzyme had a deep red color with a broad absorption between 400 and 650 mµ, and contained about 7 g atoms of nonheme iron per mole of enzyme. Crystallization was also achieved by treating the enzyme with iodoacetamide prior to the addition of ammonium sulfate, or by dialyzing it against distilled water. Crystalline enzyme obtained by these methods showed the same enzymic activity and physicochemical properties as described above. Polymerization of the enzyme appeared to occur under certain conditions and to prevent the formation of crystals. The mode of polymerization and certain other properties of the crystalline enzyme are also reported."
https://openalex.org/W1569056628,"Abstract The growth of cells of Escherichia coli has been studied in media with varying amounts of magnesium. Experiments in which the content of magnesium in the medium and in the cell have been directly measured reveal that the growth rate of magnesium-limited wild type cells is half-maximal at extracellular concentrations of 1 to 3 x 10-6 m. Mutants have been isolated which require 100 times this concentration for half-maximal rate of growth. Supplementation of the medium with calcium or strontium enables the mutants to grow on the same low levels of magnesium as the wild type even though calcium or strontium cannot replace magnesium as an essential growth factor. Cells harvested in the exponential phase of growth from medium not limited in magnesium lose one-third to two-thirds of their total magnesium upon treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate. In contrast, magnesium-starved cells retain nearly all of their magnesium when treated with EDTA. In a sonic extract of magnesium-starved cells, 15% of the total magnesium is not sedimentable at 100,000 x g. When such an extract is passed over Sephadex G-25 or G-50, 75 to 80% of the magnesium is free to diffuse into the gel."
https://openalex.org/W1919531388,"Abstract The interaction of concanavalin A with α-mannans from several species of microorganisms has been studied by the techniques of quantitative precipitation and hapten inhibition. Similar to concanavalin A-dextran precipitation, the reaction between concanavalin A and yeast mannan (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is optimal near neutrality (pH 5.7 to 6.7). Among the polysaccharides which form a precipitate with concanavalin A, i.e. glycogens, amylopectins, mannans, dextrans, and levans, mannans appear to be the most reactive. This is illustrated by hapten inhibition studies conducted on the concanavalin A-mannan system wherein relatively larger amounts of inhibitors are required to effect the same percentage inhibition as concanavalin A-dextran or concanavalin A-levan precipitation. The inhibition of a number of mannose-containing oligosaccharides has been examined, and data are presented which suggest that the concanavalin A-combining sites may be more extensive than hitherto believed, and may, in fact, be complementary to a sequence of several α-(1 → 2)-d-mannopyranosyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1712467530,"Evidence is presented for the complete amino acid sequence of subtilisin Carlsberg. The protein consists of a single peptide chain of 274 residues. Comparison with subtilisin BPN' shows 84 amino acid differences and 1 additional residue in BPN'. The 84 differences can be accounted for on the basis of single or double nucleotide replacements. Within the subtilisins, there are a number of distinct repetitions of sequence; this suggests that the proteins may have evolved from shorter peptide chains by some process of extension of the sequence. The subtilisins differ in structure from other proteinases sensitive to diisopropyl fluorophosphate, as well as from proteinases of other types."
https://openalex.org/W1560540497,"Abstract The enzyme, serine dehydratase (l-serine hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.13), has been purified by a previously unpublished method involving heat denaturation, ammonium sulfate treatment, Sephadex gel filtration, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Antibodies to the pure enzyme have been prepared in rabbits and have been shown to be antigenically homogeneous. Utilizing the technique of pulse labeling of the enzyme in vivo with 14C-valine, it has been shown that administration of mixtures of amino acids dramatically increases the rate of synthesis of this enzyme in vivo without appreciably enhancing the synthesis of total soluble proteins. The amino acid, l-tryptophan, as well as the hormone, glucagon, also effects an increased rate of synthesis of the enzyme. Administration of glucose results in a complete cessation of enzyme synthesis whether administered from zero time or at a time interval thereafter at which the synthesis of the enzyme is completely resistant to the antibiotic, actinomycin D. Amino acid induction and glucose repression as well as hormonal induction by both glucagon and hydrocortisone occur in adrenalectomized animals. The effects of glucose administration on protein synthesis are not general since serum protein synthesis was not affected by this treatment. By prelabeling the enzyme and administering glucose with and without amino acids, it has been shown that glucose appears to effect primarily a cessation of enzyme synthesis and an increase of degradation of the enzyme. Studies of the composition of amino acid pools in the intact animal have shown that the different rates of synthesis seen in rats fed amino acids with respect to those fed glucose are not the result of differential labeling of the labeled precursor pool. The studies reported here show that the synthesis of rat liver serine dehydratase may be regulated by amino acids and glucose as well as by the hormones, hydrocortisone and glucagon, the latter being the most efficient inducer of the enzyme of those compounds studied. The repression of serine dehydratase synthesis in vivo by glucose appears in a number of ways to be analogous to catabolite repression seen in microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1573792998,"Abstract By means of an improved Millipore filtration technique, a very rapid, atractyloside-sensitive exchange of adenine nucleotides between intact rat liver mitochondria and the medium has been studied. The uptake of ADP or ATP has a rapid phase with a half-time of the order of 6 sec at 0°, followed by a slower phase resulting in a plateau level of 8 to 10 nmoles of exchangeable nucleotide per mg of mitochondrial protein. The uptake system has a very high affinity for ADP (Km l 30 µm) and is highly specific for adenine nucleotides (ADP g ATP >> AMP). Other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides are inactive and, in addition, fail to inhibit the uptake of 14C-ADP. The uptake of adenine nucleotide occurs by an obligatory exchange diffusion process, i.e. the entrance of 1 molecule of external nucleotide was found to be coupled to the exit of 1 molecule of internal nucleotide, resulting in a constant internal pool size, even when external ADP concentration was varied over a wide range. Adenine nucleotide uptake is insensitive to thiol reagents and to uncouplers and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation; however, it may be completely inhibited by very low levels of atractyloside (Ki = 1 µm). Maximum atractyloside inhibition requires Mg++ when ADP is the external nucleotide but not when ATP is present. However, Mg++ is not required for the uptake of either ADP or ATP in the absence of atractyloside. The internal pool of labeled nucleotides consists of a mixture of ATP, ADP, and AMP; its composition is about the same after equilibration with either 14C-ADP or 14C-ATP. Since rat liver mitochondria stripped of their outer membranes showed atractyloside-sensitive adenine nucleotide uptake very similar to that of the intact mitochondria, it is concluded that the atractyloside-sensitive sites are in the inner membrane. The data support the general conclusion that the nucleotide exchange process is brought about by a catalytic carrier in the membrane acting between external and internal nucleotide pools, rather than by stoichiometric binding of the nucleotide to a large number of mitochondrial sites."

https://openalex.org/W2062874418,"Both dl-Delta(8)- and dl-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol produced marked alterations of behavior in rhesus and squirrel monkeys. Squirrel monkeys appeared to have visual hallucinations. Continuous avoidance behavior of squirrel monkeys was stimulated by both drugs, but high doses of dl-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol also caused depression after the stimulant phase. Complex behavior involving memory and visual discrimination in rhesus monkeys was markedly disrupted by both drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1976438953,"Squirrel monkeys trained to respond under a schedule in which each response postponed the delivery of electric shock developed a steady rate of responding. When a schedule in which an electric shock was presented following the first response occurring after 10 minutes (10-minute fixed-interval schedule) was programed concurrently, there was little effect on the pattern of responding. When the shock-postponement schedule was eliminated, the fixed-interval schedule of shock-presentation maintained a pattern of positively accelerated responding that is characteristic of fixed-interval schedules of reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W1611707636,"By accurately measuring the difference infrared spectrum of CO2-equilibrated bovine carbonic anhydrase against the ethoxzolamide- or azide-inhibited enzyme, we have been able to obtain the absorption maximum at 2341 cm-1 that is due to the asymmetric stretching of the CO2 molecule loosely bound to a hydrophobic surface at the active site of the enzyme. CO2 dissolved in water absorbs at 2343.5 cm-1. The observed small shift for bound CO2 can be attributed to a solvent effect. The absence of a larger spectral shift shows that this substrate is not appreciably distorted upon binding by the enzyme. The binding constant of carbonic anhydrase for CO2 may be estimated directly from the difference spectra taken at various CO2 pressures. Nitrous oxide is found to compete with CO2 for binding to this enzyme with approximately the same affinity. In addition to ethoxzolamide, we found that nitrate, bicarbonate, azide, and the other sulfonamide inhibitors also prevent the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Azide ion, both free and bound to metal-ion complexes, also absorbs strongly in this infrared range. A comparison between the infrared spectra of azide bound to the diethylenetriamine Zn(II) and Co(II) complexes or to the cobalt-enzyme and the corresponding spectrum for the native enzyme shows that the azide ion is coordinate to the Zn(II) atom of the native enzyme. Examination of the difference spectra in the presence of both azide and CO2 shows that the bound azide sterically interferes with the binding of CO2 in the hydrophobic cavity adjacent to the Zn(II). Infrared data on the competition of bicarbonate and hydroxide with azide for Zn(II), when combined with the results on CO2 binding, lead to the formulation of a detailed but extremely simple molecular mechanism for the catalytic action of carbonic anhydrase, i.e. attack of the bound CO2 by the OH- group coordinated to the zinc ion."
https://openalex.org/W1518564811,"Abstract β-Hydroxydecanoyl-thioester dehydrase is known to be the enzyme responsible for the introduction of the double bond into the unsaturated fatty acids of Escherichia coli, and is known to be vital for bacterial growth. The powerful inhibitor in vitro of the dehydrase, 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, possesses antibacterial activity in vivo; at 10-5 m, it completely inhibits the growth of E. coli. The following evidence suggests that this growth inhibition is due to the inactivation of β-hydroxydecanoyl-thioester dehydrase. (a) Only those acetylenic compounds which block the activity of the isolated dehydrase are effective in vivo. (b) The growth inhibition is reversible by oleic but not by palmitic acid. (c) The inhibitor causes a rapid and total cessation of the formation of unsaturated acids, well before the first noticeable decline in the growth rate. (d) The inhibitor is not active against yeast or mammalian cells, cells, which form their olefinic acids by a mechanism not involving the dehydrase."

https://openalex.org/W1549269955,"Abstract The l-amino acid oxidase of Crotalus adamanteus is inactivated by storage in the frozen state at temperatures between -5° and -60°, with maximal inactivation being observed at approximately -20°. The rate of inactivation is dependent on the pH of storage and on the ionic composition of the medium. The inactivation is accompanied by changes in the visible absorption spectrum and by a decrease in the rate of photoreduction with ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The frozen, inactivated enzyme in most cases (depending on the conditions of storage) can be reactivated completely by heating at pH 5, with a full return of the spectrum of native enzyme. The reactivation process is extremely dependent on temperature, with a calculated ΔH of approximately 40,000 cal per mole. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the inactivation is due to a limited conformational change of the enzyme structure, particularly in the vicinity of the flavin prosthetic group. The similarities and differences between this type of inactivation and the reversible heat inactivation of this enzyme observed by previous workers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1531774396,"Abstract The activities of Carlsberg and Novo subtilisins towards a number of N-acetylamino acid esters and amino acid esters have been examined. The enzymes were also compared with respect to their efficiency in catalyzing aminolysis reactions, their rates of inactivation by certain aromatic sulfonyl halides, and the rates of deacylation of their N-trans-cinnamoyl derivatives. The enzymes were found to be qualitatively indistinguishable from the standpoint of substrate specificity. However, significant quantitative differences were observed. The results obtained suggest that the substrate-binding site of Carlsberg subtilisin is less polar than that of the Novo enzyme, and that the groups in the catalytic site of Carlsberg subtilisin show a somewhat higher reactivity than the corresponding groups in Novo subtilisin."
https://openalex.org/W1487729566,"Abstract The 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharide from Mycobacterium phlei has been resolved into four components. These differ from each other in total charge owing to the presence of 0, 1, 2, or 3 monoesterified succinate residues. In addition, each component contains four other acyl groups. These have been identified as acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, and octanoate. Preliminary evidence suggests that they are present in the molar ratios of 3:1:1:1. The same lipopolysaccharides have been isolated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and Mycobacterium smegmatis. However, M. tuberculosis (Lederle) yielded a single form of the lipopolysaccharide, which contained only one acyl group, octanoate. The possibility exists that this latter finding is an artifact, resulting from the method of preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1554516859,"Abstract The binding of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) to several enzymes has been determined by measuring cofactor-dependent activity after passage of each enzyme through a column of Sephadex G-25 to remove non-protein-bound cofactors. TPP was found to be bound irreversibly to yeast and Zymomonas pyruvate decarboxylases, Aerobacter α-acetolactate synthetase, and Escherichia glyoxylate carboligase. Cofactors were lost when Proteus pyruvate oxidase, Escherichia pyruvate dehydrogenase, and Micrococcus diacetyl carboligase were gel-filtered; the binding of TPP was strongest for diacetyl carboligase. A procedure has been devised for efficient resolution of enzymes for TPP and divalent cations. Resolved enzymes reconstituted for cofactors had properties similar to those of native enzymes. Resolved pyruvate decarboxylases from both yeast and Zymomonas mobilis failed to bind Mg++ in the absence of TPP. Cofactor reconstitution for yeast pyruvate decarboxylase was shown to be a slow process for low concentrations of TPP. TPP alone, in high concentrations, was able to activate and partially reconstitute TPP enzymes in the absence of added divalent cations. Zymomonas pyruvate decarboxylase, Aerobacter α-acetolactate synthetase, and Escherichia glyoxylate carboligase appear to be heterogeneous, in that part of each enzyme can bind TPP irreversibly; this cofactor dissociates reversibly for the remainder of the enzyme. When yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, saturated for cofactors, was gel-filtered at pH 8.0, 50% of the enzyme-bound TPP dissociated from the enzyme, the remainder being irreversibly bound. Thiazole pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of resolved yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, acts by binding to coenzyme sites on the enzyme. Unlike TPP, thiazole pyrophosphate was shown to be bound reversibly to the enzyme and could be displaced by high concentrations of TPP. The results obtained question the validity of calculating dissociation constants for cofactors which do not dissociate from their enzymes."

The products of the reaction are uridine diphosphate N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate. The other optical isomers of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid, and l-lysine, fail to act as substrates. In addition to Mg++ or Mn++, K+ or NH4+ is required in this reaction.

By immunohistological techniques, it was shown that fluorescent antibody, prepared against the basic protein, reacted specifically with the nuclei of neurons and spermatogonia and did not react with the cell populations in kidney, liver, ovary, and spleen of the same animal.

The compositions and properties of these peptides are reported."
https://openalex.org/W1523361073,"Abstract Avian erythrocytes retain their nuclei throughout cellular development, and it has been suggested that the nucleus is the site of hemoglobin synthesis. It was the goal of this work to re-examine the role of the nucleus in the synthesis of chicken hemoglobins, and to analyze the synthesis of hemoglobin polypeptides at the ribosomal level. The two chicken hemoglobins, Hb1 and Hb2, were studied by column chromatography, by electrophoresis, by immunodiffusion analysis, and by tryptic peptide mapping; they are very similar according to these criteria, and they appear to share many common amino acid sequences. Autoradiographic tryptic peptide maps of cytoplamic ribosomes pulse-labeled with [14C]leucine show the presence on ribosomes of nascent globin chains. Nascent growing polypeptide chains were isolated from ribosomes following pulses to erythrocytes of [3H]leucine and were fractionated according to size by gel filtration; the growing chains are heterogenous in size, ranging from complete globin polypeptides down to single amino acids. The kinetics of labeling these various-sized peptides shows that they are synthesized by sequential addition of amino acids to one growing end; the synthesis time of a globin chain at 37° was estimated from these kinetics as 1 min. Only a small fraction of the nascent polypeptides are the size of completed globin chains, which implies that the release of completed chains from ribosomes occurs in a period of time which is much shorter than the time required to synthesize the whole chain. An autoradiographic study of erythrocytes submitted to short pulses of [3H]leucine establishes conclusively that the hemoglobins are synthesized in the cytoplasm; the newly synthesized hemoglobin molecules subsequently become distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, presumably passing through open pores in the nuclear membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1516773489,"A ribonuclease has been purified about 140-fold from extracts of Salmonella typhimurium through ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The optimum pH for the hydrolytic breakdown of RNA is 7. The enzyme hydrolyzes polyadenylic acid (poly A), polycytidylic acid (poly C), and polyuridylic acid (poly U) at much faster rates than transfer RNA. Polyinosinic acid (poly I) was not hydrolyzed at all. Higher concentrations of poly A and poly U (above 200 µg per ml) were inhibitory. A mixture of poly A and poly U in the proportion 1:2, which is known to produce maximum secondary interaction, is also inhibitory. These results indicate that the secondary structures of nucleic acids interfere with the action of the nuclease. The first product of hydrolysis is a 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide which is poorly hydrolyzed to the 3′-nucleotide. The enzyme behaves as an endonuclease.

https://openalex.org/W1520506526,"Abstract Bromoacetazolamide effects rather quickly a partial, and more slowly an almost complete, irreversible inactivation of bovine carbonic anhydrase B (EC 4.2.1.1). Under identical conditions, the enzyme is not inactivated by bromoacetic acid or iodoacetamide, nor does it react significantly with these compounds. The zinc-free enzyme does not undergo irreversible binding with 14C-bromoacetazolamide and can be fully reactivated by zinc after exposure to bromoacetazolamide. At low inhibitor concentrations 1 eq of 14C-bromoacetazolamide reacts with the native enzyme. It is postulated that the enzyme at first forms a complex with the inhibitor. This rapid step is followed by a slower formation of a covalent bond between bromoacetazolamide and an amino acid at or close to the active site of the enzyme resulting in irreversible inactivation. Amino acid analysis of the native and inhibited enzymes revealed that, as a consequence of irreversible inactivation, the 3 nitrogen of 1 eq of histidine had reacted with bromoacetazolamide. At higher inhibitor concentrations, 2 eq of 14C-bromoacetazolamide combined with the enzyme. It is suggested that the initial formation of a complex or covalent bond by 1 molecule of bromoacetazolamide alters the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme so as to make a second combining site available."
https://openalex.org/W1671701193,"Abstract The binding of SCN- with bovine plasma albumin has been studied at 4° by equilibrium dialysis in ethylenediaminetetraacetate and N-(carboxymethyl)-N',-2-hydroxyethyl-N,N'-ethylenediglycine solutions. These two supporting electrolytes were used to minimize Donnan effects. At low ionic strengths (0 to 0.04), the association constants of SCN- were found to increase with decreasing concentrations of supporting electrolyte. At high ionic strengths (0.1 to 0.8), binding was independent of supporting electrolyte concentration. In the pH region 4.5 to 10, the binding data were best fitted by two sets of binding constants: k10 = 700, n1 = 7, k20 = 10, n2 = 90. The electrostatic interaction factor, w, followed the Linderstrφm-Lang model in this pH region. In the pH regions below 4.5 and above 10, binding changed in a manner consistent with a marked reduction in w. Binding at the primary sites was unaltered in 2 m urea and slightly reduced in 4 m urea, but was destroyed in 8 m urea. Binding at the primary sites was reduced in 20% dioxane. The n2 sites were not much affected by urea or dioxane. Oleate inhibited binding at one of the primary sites. Several binding studies were also conducted with I- and Cl-. Our results from dialysis equilibrium in solutions with the supporting electrolytes do not agree in many respects with those reported by Scatchard and co-workers from electromotive force measurements in systems free of supporting electrolytes."

https://openalex.org/W1546861061,"Abstract The NH2-terminal residues of Bacillus subtilis soluble and ribosomal proteins were determined by the dinitrophenyl method. A nonrandom distribution of amino acids was observed. Alanine occurred most frequently, followed by methionine, serine, threonine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid; smaller quantities of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and glycine were also found at the terminal position. A marked difference between these results and those obtained for Escherichia coli was noted. A slight difference in the frequency of distribution of the amino acids was also detected between log and stationary phase soluble proteins. An analysis of radioactive proteins newly synthesized by B. subtilis cells also indicated a preferential incorporation of alanine into the NH2-terminal residues."

https://openalex.org/W1916612959,Amino acid sequence studies were performed on most of the 44 peptides available from the chymotryptic hydrolysate of subtilisin Carlsberg. Sufficient work was carried out to define precisely either the complete sequence or the position of each peptide within the tryptic peptides.
https://openalex.org/W1496964703,"Abstract The protein moiety of purified dog pancreatic ribosomes has been examined by starch gel electrophoresis in formate buffers, pH 3, containing 6 m urea. Densitometric tracings of the complex but reproducible electrophoretograms disclosed a minimum of 21 cationic components. Identical patterns were obtained with protein prepared by alternative extraction procedures, and these were not significantly altered by preparation of the ribosomes from a single dog pancreas or by the inclusion of puromycin during isolation of the ribosomes. Treatment of the protein from canine pancreatic ribosomes with dithiothreitol in urea resulted in very minor changes in electrophoretic properties, the suggestion being that most of the half-cystine residues of the protein are already in the reduced state. Protein from microsomal and postmicrosomal canine pancreatic ribosomes presented similar but not identical patterns. Electrophoretograms of protein moieties of purified ribosomes from dog and rabbit pancreas were compared. Most components were common to both species, but a few were characteristic of one species only. The species-specific bands are reproducible and independent of the method of preparation of the protein. Of the protein present in the 80 S monoribosome of dog pancreas, three components are localized exclusively or predominately in the large subunit, and five exclusively or predominately in the small subunit. One disappears upon dissociation and the remainder appear to be common to both subunits. Of the dog-specific bands, one appears only in the small subunit, one appears only in the large subunit, and one is present in both subunits."

When these livers were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, the Ca++ and Pi concentrations of the mitochondria subsequently harvested were elevated several fold, reflecting the higher levels of these ions in the whole tissue. The K+ concentration usually declined in the whole tissue and decreased in the mitochondria. In these mitochondria, respiratory rate and respiratory control were markedly depressed. If, on the other hand, the liver samples were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing the Ca++ chelator, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (or EGTA or DCTA), the mitochondria often contained much lower amounts of Ca++ and Pi, and the respiratory rate and respiratory control were closer to normal levels. Whether a chelator was used or not, the changes in Ca++ and K+ concentration in the whole tissue or mitochondria did not appear to be closely related to each other. The effect of the chelators on ionic composition appeared to result from the prevention of accumulation of Ca++ and Pi by the mitochondria subsequent to the homogenization of the tissue. It is concluded that the major portion of the changes in content of Ca++ of isolated liver mitochondria following CCl4 poisoning which have been reported by others occurred during the isolation of these organelles and must be considered to be artifacts of the isolation procedure. The residual chelator-resistant changes in respiratory function and ionic composition may reflect actual qualitative changes in the mitochondria extant in these organelles in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1844347900,"From a chymotryptic digest of diisopropylphosphoryl subtilisin Carlsberg, 44 peptides were isolated by fractionation on a column of Dowex 50, followed by purification by various methods. The amino acid compositions of these peptides are reported. The peptides account for 272 of the 274 residues present in the single peptide chain of this protein. Six of the peptides represented segments of incomplete hydrolysis by chymotrypsin."

https://openalex.org/W2067751827,"Seeds of four species of Polygonaceae were tested for lectins that precipitate human and animal serums. Rumex crispus, Polygonum convolvulus, and Polygonum pennsylvanicum developed specific precipitate bands on double diffusion on agar gel plates. These bands were enhanced and increased in number when extracts were tested against serums from patients with certain diseases. When tested against lyophilized serum, no precipitate bands developed. The active substance cannot be dialyzed through cellulose membrane against running tap water for 16 hours, and it is heat stable. Extracts from Fagopyrum esculentum developed no precipitate bands."
