https://openalex.org/W2121836743,"As new drugs are developed, it is essential to appropriately translate the drug dosage from one animal species to another. A misunderstanding appears to exist regarding the appropriate method for allometric dose translations, especially when starting new animal or clinical studies. The need for education regarding appropriate translation is evident from the media response regarding some recent studies where authors have shown that resveratrol, a compound found in grapes and red wine, improves the health and life span of mice. Immediately after the online publication of these papers, the scientific community and popular press voiced concerns regarding the relevance of the dose of resveratrol used by the authors. The animal dose should not be extrapolated to a human equivalent dose (HED) by a simple conversion based on body weight, as was reported. For the more appropriate conversion of drug doses from animal studies to human studies, we suggest using the body surface area (BSA) normalization method. BSA correlates well across several mammalian species with several parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization, caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, circulating plasma proteins, and renal function. We advocate the use of BSA as a factor when converting a dose for translation from animals to humans, especially for phase I and phase II clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2063210874,"The neural underpinnings of sleep involve interactions between sleep-promoting areas such as the anterior hypothalamus, and arousal systems located in the posterior hypothalamus, the basal forebrain and the brainstem. Hypocretin (Hcrt, also known as orexin)-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus are important for arousal stability, and loss of Hcrt function has been linked to narcolepsy. However, it is unknown whether electrical activity arising from Hcrt neurons is sufficient to drive awakening from sleep states or is simply correlated with it. Here we directly probed the impact of Hcrt neuron activity on sleep state transitions with in vivo neural photostimulation, genetically targeting channelrhodopsin-2 to Hcrt cells and using an optical fibre to deliver light deep in the brain, directly into the lateral hypothalamus, of freely moving mice. We found that direct, selective, optogenetic photostimulation of Hcrt neurons increased the probability of transition to wakefulness from either slow wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. Notably, photostimulation using 5-30 Hz light pulse trains reduced latency to wakefulness, whereas 1 Hz trains did not. This study establishes a causal relationship between frequency-dependent activity of a genetically defined neural cell type and a specific mammalian behaviour central to clinical conditions and neurobehavioural physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2033078279,"Brain regions in the mammalian cerebral cortex are linked by a complex network of fiber bundles. These inter-regional networks have previously been analyzed in terms of their node degree, structural motif, path length and clustering coefficient distributions. In this paper we focus on the identification and classification of hub regions, which are thought to play pivotal roles in the coordination of information flow. We identify hubs and characterize their network contributions by examining motif fingerprints and centrality indices for all regions within the cerebral cortices of both the cat and the macaque. Motif fingerprints capture the statistics of local connection patterns, while measures of centrality identify regions that lie on many of the shortest paths between parts of the network. Within both cat and macaque networks, we find that a combination of degree, motif participation, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality allows for reliable identification of hub regions, many of which have previously been functionally classified as polysensory or multimodal. We then classify hubs as either provincial (intra-cluster) hubs or connector (inter-cluster) hubs, and proceed to show that lesioning hubs of each type from the network produces opposite effects on the small-world index. Our study presents an approach to the identification and classification of putative hub regions in brain networks on the basis of multiple network attributes and charts potential links between the structural embedding of such regions and their functional roles."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been associated with a higher incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD). High fat diets promote AD-like pathology in mice. It is not known whether consumption of excess sugar as in calorically sweetened beverages with an otherwise normal diet affects the development of AD. In the present study, we provided 10% sucrose-sweetened water to a transgenic mouse model of AD with a normal rodent diet. Compared with the control mice with no sucrose added in the water, the sucrose group gained more body weight and developed glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypercholesterolemia. These metabolic changes were associated with the exacerbation of memory impairment and a 2–3-fold increase in insoluble amyloid-β protein levels and deposition in the brain. We further showed that the levels of expression and secretase-cleaved products of amyloid-β precursor protein were not affected by sucrose intake. The steady-state levels of insulin-degrading enzyme did not change significantly, whereas there was a 2.5-fold increase in brain apoE levels. Therefore, we concluded that the up-regulation of apoE accelerated the aggregation of Aβ, resulting in the exacerbation of cerebral amyloidosis in sucrose-treated mice. These data underscore the potential role of dietary sugar in the pathogenesis of AD and suggest that controlling the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages may be an effective way to curtail the risk of developing AD.

Added sugars, mainly sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, are major components of a modern human diet. Compelling evidence indicates that excess consumption of sweet foods, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages, plays an important role in the epidemic of obesity around the world (1Bray G.A.

Pathological hallmarks of the AD brain include intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and deposits of aggregated amyloid-β protein (Aβ) in neuritic plaques and cerebral vessels. The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the development of AD, however, are not fully understood. One of the main hypotheses is that β-amyloidosis (production and deposition of Aβ) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD (6Selkoe D.J. Neurol. Clin. 2000; 18: 903-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Aβ (39–43 amino acids) is derived from a large transmembrane glycoprotein, amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), via proteolytic processing by secretases (6Selkoe D.J. Neurol. Clin. 2000; 18: 903-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by discoveries of causative mutations in the gene encoding APP and in genes of presenilin (PS)-1 and -2 in early onset familial AD (7Hardy J.

Several lines of evidence indicate that insulin itself and metabolic abnormalities pertinent to diabetes may affect the generation and degradation of Aβ (11Craft S. Watson G.S.

Insulin resistance may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the effects of high fat diets on AD (17Ho L. Qin W. Pompl P.N. Xiang Z. Wang J. Zhao Z. Peng Y. Cambareri G. Rocher A. Mobbs C.V. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 902-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Whether excess consumption of simple sugars as in calorically sweetened beverages with an otherwise normal diet affects the development of AD has not been investigated experimentally. In the present study, we provided sucrose-sweetened water to APP/PS1 double transgenic mice (18Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 19Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L.

Our results showed that intake of sucrose-sweetened water induced insulin resistance and exacerbated AD-like memory impairment and cerebral amyloidosis. Animals and Diets—APP/PS1 double transgenic mice used in this study were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (strain name B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J; stock number 004462). These mice express a chimeric mouse/human amyloid-β precursor protein containing the K595N/M596L Swedish mutations and a mutant human presenilin 1 carrying the exon 9-deleted variant under the control of mouse prion promoter elements, directing transgene expression predominantly to central nervous system neurons (18Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 19Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M.

The two transgenes co-segregate in these mice. APP/PS1 mice were maintained as double hemizygotes by crossing with wild-type mice on a B6C3F1/J background strain (Jackson Laboratories stock number 100010) and were genotyped by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from tail biopsies. APP/PS1 mice develop AD-like memory deficits and amyloid plaques in the brain by 6 months of age. In this study, 2-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were provided with either a solution of 10% sucrose or water (control) ad libitum. These mice were kept on a normal rodent diet (Harlan Teklad mouse diet 7012: 19% protein, 5% fat, and 60% complex carbohydrate). Main ingredients of this diet are ground corn, soybean meal, ground oats, wheat middlings, soybean oil, alfalfa meal, and corn gluten meal with supplements of minerals, amino acids, and vitamins. Sucrose and food intake of mice were determined by monitoring the volumes of water/sucrose solution and amounts of food consumed. After 25 weeks of the experiment, the mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests followed by assessments of metabolic changes and AD-related neuropathology as discussed below. All animal procedures used for this study were prospectively reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Assessment of Behavioral Functions—Three AD-related behavioral functions (spatial learning and memory, exploration of environmental stimuli, and anxiety) were assessed. The testing schedule included exploration of the T-maze (days 1–10), the open field (days 1–3), the elevated plus-maze test for anxiety levels (days 4 and 5), and spatial learning in the Morris water maze (days 6–11). All equipment and software were purchased from SD Instruments (San Diego, CA). All testing procedures have been described in detail previously (20Li L. Cao D. Kim H. Lester R. Fukuchi K. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Cao D. Fukuchi K. Wan H. Kim H. Li L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, spatial learning and memory were evaluated in the Morris water maze consisting of a round basin filled with water with abundant extra-maze visual cues. The acquisition of the spatial task consisted of placing the mice next to and facing the wall successively in north (N), east (E), south (S), and west (W) positions, with the escape platform hidden 1 cm beneath water level in the middle of the NE quadrant. In each trial, the mouse was allowed to swim until it found the hidden platform, or until 60 s had elapsed, at which point the mouse was guided to the platform. The mouse was then allowed to sit on the platform for 10 s before being picked up. The escape latency and swim path length were recorded by the SMART system for four trials daily for 5 days. The day after the acquisition phase, a probe trial was conducted by removing the platform and placing the mouse next to and facing the N side. The time spent in the previously correct (target) quadrant was measured in a single 60-s trial. Two hours later, the visible platform version of the test was performed with the escape platform lifted 1 cm above water level and shifted to the SE quadrant. A pole was inserted on top of the escape platform as a viewing aid. Assessment of Metabolic Changes—An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was conducted as previously described (17Ho L. Qin W. Pompl P.N. Xiang Z. Wang J. Zhao Z. Peng Y. Cambareri G. Rocher A. Mobbs C.V. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 902-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, fasted mice were given a single dose of intraperitoneal injection of glucose (2 g/kg body weight), and blood samples were obtained from the tail vein periodically over a 2-h period. Blood glucose content was determined by using the Accu-Chek Advantage System (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's instructions. Fasting plasma insulin levels were determined by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (LINCO Research, St. Charles, MO). Fasting plasma total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were determined colorimetrically with commercial reagents (Infinity™ cholesterol reagent; Thermo Electron Corp., Melbourne, Australia). Fasting plasma triglyceride levels were determined with the triglyceride determination kit (Sigma). Brain Tissue Preparation—Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and blood was collected via cardiac puncture with heparin as an anticoagulant. Following transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), brains were cut sagittally into left and right hemispheres. The right hemisphere was fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin for histological analysis. After removing the olfactory lobe and cerebellum, the left hemisphere was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for biochemical analysis. Brain Aβ ELISA, Cholesterol, and Immunoblot Analysis—To measure carbonate soluble and insoluble (guanidine soluble) fractions of Aβ, frozen brain samples were Dounce-homogenized first in carbonate buffer (100 mm Na2CO3, 50 mm NaCl, pH 11.5) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). An aliquot of homogenate was centrifuged at 18,300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was transferred to another tube and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. The pellet was then subjected to further homogenization in the guanidine solution (5 m guanidine HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The homogenate was rocked for 3–4 h at room temperature. Following centrifugation at 18,300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (insoluble fraction) was transferred to another tube and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the soluble and insoluble fractions were determined with Aβ40- and Aβ42-specific ELISA kits (BioSource International) using the manufacturer's protocol. The cholesterol content in the brain homogenate was determined with the Infinity™ cholesterol reagent (Thermo Electron). For immunoblot analysis, another aliquot of carbonate homogenate was subjected to further homogenization with the SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and processed as we described in detail previously (20Li L. Cao D. Kim H. Lester R. Fukuchi K. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Cao D. Fukuchi K. Wan H. Kim H. Li L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used for immunoblot analysis included 6E10 (a monoclonal antibody raised against amino acids 1–16 of Aβ; Signet, Dedham, MA), goat polyclonal antibody M-20 against mouse apoE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal antibody CT695 against the C terminus of APP (Invitrogen), and rabbit polyclonal antibody PC730 against insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). For a loading control, the blots were stripped and reprobed with a mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immunohistochemical Analysis and Quantification of Cerebral Aβ Deposition—Protocols for immunohistochemical analysis have been described previously (20Li L. Cao D. Kim H. Lester R. Fukuchi K. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections were subjected to immunostaining using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). The primary antibody used for immunohistochemical analysis of Aβ deposition was 6E10. The amyloid load in the cortex and hippocampus of mouse brain were quantified using a histomorphometry system. Multiple images were captured and analyzed from serial sections of each mouse brain. A total area of 50 mm2 giving the highest total Aβ immunoreactivity was chosen to calculate the amyloid load expressed as a percentage of total area covered by Aβ immunoreactivity. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Comparison of different genotype groups was performed by two-tailed Student's t test (for normally distributed data), Mann-Whitney rank sum test (for nonnormally distributed data), and repeated measures analysis of variance. SigmaStat software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Characteristics of APP/PS1 Mice—The APP/PS1 mice used in this study co-overexpress a chimeric mouse/human APP containing the K595N/M596L Swedish mutations and a mutant human PS1 with the exon 9 deletion under the control of mouse prion promoter elements (18Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 19Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L. Younkin S.G. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The two transgenes co-segregate in these mice. APP/PS1 mice were maintained as double hemizygotes. They develop AD-like memory deficits and amyloid plaques in the brain by 6 months of age. In this study, 2-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were fed a normal rodent diet and provided with either a solution of 10% sucrose or water (control) ad libitum. After 25 weeks of treatment at an age of ∼8 months, the mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests followed by assessments of metabolic changes and AD-related neuropathology. Intake of Sucrose-sweetened Water Led to Increased Body Weight, Glucose Intolerance, Hyperinsulinemia, and Hypercholesterolemia in APP/PS1 Mice—Food and water intake of the mice were monitored during the experiment. When given the sucrose-sweetened water, the mice drank significantly more. Although the sucrose group decreased their food intake, total daily caloric intake was 15% higher (p < 0.001) in the sucrose group (20.5 ± 0.4 kcal/mouse, 43% of which was supplied by sucrose) than in the water control group (17.8 ± 0.4 kcal/mouse). Consistently, weekly body weight monitoring showed that the mice with free access to sucrose-sweetened water started to gain significantly more body weight than the mice without the sucrose supplement at 5 weeks, and this trend was observed for the rest of the experiment (Fig. 1A). At the end of the experiment, the body weight of the sucrose group was 17% higher than that of the control group (47.1 ± 2.0 versus 40.3 ± 1.9 g, p < 0.05). To assess glucose tolerance in these mice, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was conducted in which blood glucose content was monitored following an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (2 g/kg body weight) in fasted mice. The sucrose group displayed an impaired glucose tolerance response (analysis of variance; p < 0.05, F1,48 = 5.7 for different groups; p < 0.001, F4,48 = 57.1 for glycemic content over time; Fig. 1B). In agreement with these findings, fasting plasma insulin levels were elevated by about 3-fold in the sucrose group (Fig. 1C). Plasma lipid analyses showed that sucrose intake caused a 30% increase in plasma total cholesterol levels but had no significant effect on levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that intake of sucrose-sweetened water led to increased body weight and induced insulin resistance in APP/PS1 mice fed a normal diet. Exacerbation of Spatial Learning and Memory Deficits in APP/PS1 Mice Taking Sucrose-sweetened Water—To assess whether sucrose intake affects behavioral functions in APP/PS1 mice, a battery of behavioral tests was conducted. The Morris water maze test was performed to assess the spatial learning and memory of the mice. To serve as a normal control, a group of age-matched nontransgenic mice (non-Tg, littermates of APP/PS1 mice) were included in the test. As shown in Fig. 2A, non-Tg mice learned to locate the submerged platform (analysis of variance, p < 0.001). Compared with non-Tg mice, untreated APP/PS1 control mice showed learning deficits but retained some learning ability over the 5-day testing (analysis of variance, p < 0.01). The sucrose-treated APP/PS1 mice, however, failed to learn the task at the end of 5-day training (Fig. 2A). The concurrent longer path length traveled by the sucrose group indicates a spatial learning deficit as opposed to a decreased swimming speed (data not shown). Indeed, there was no difference in swimming speed between groups (16–18 cm/s). In a 60-s probe trial 24 h after the acquisition, although non-Tg mice spent 46.1 ± 5.0% of their time in a previously platform-containing quadrant, the time spent by APP/PS1 mice (untreated and sucrose-treated) was not longer than the random 25% level (31.6 ± 4.8 and 18.2 ± 3.0%, respectively). Although the untreated APP/PS1 mice crossed over the previous platform location less often than non-Tg mice, the sucrose-treated APP/PS1 mice showed no memory of the platform location (Fig. 2B). In the visible platform version of the Morris water maze, all groups performed similarly, indicating that there were no changes of visual acuities and swimming abilities associated with sucrose consumption. In addition, sucrose intake had no significant effects on motor activity in an open field, on exploration in a T-maze, or on anxiety in an elevated plus-maze (Table 1). These data further indicate that impairment of learning and memory by sucrose intake was not caused by other noncognitive behavioral changes.TABLE 1Exploratory activities and anxiety levels of APP/PS1 miceTestsTreatment grouppControl (n = 8)Sucrose (n = 7)Spontaneous alternation (T-maze) Rate (%)70.0 ± 5.069.0 ± 7.00.87 Latency (s)17.8 ± 2.213.5 ± 1.90.17Motor activity (open field) Path length (cm)Day 12108.9 ± 200.01616.2 ± 110.70.06Day 21851.0 ± 213.61604.9 ± 213.80.43Day 31377.0 ± 231.71339.3 ± 256.10.92 Percentage of time in the central zoneDay 16.4 ± 1.04.6 ± 1.20.27Day 24.4 ± 1.23.2 ± 0.80.42Day 36.0 ± 2.33.2 ± 1.50.35Anxiety (elevated plus-maze) Entries to open armsDay 112.8 ± 2.811.0 ± 2.10.63Day 25.1 ± 1.97.7 ± 2.30.40 Percentage of time in open armsDay 141.1 ± 9.847.8 ± 9.30.63Day 212.1 ± 4.324.5 ± 8.80.54 Open table in a new tab Aggravation of Cerebral β-Amyloidosis in APP/PS1 Mice Taking Sucrose-sweetened Water—To determine the effect of sucrose-sweetened water intake on cerebral APP/Aβ metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, Aβ contents in the carbonate soluble and insoluble (guanidine-soluble) fractions in the cerebrum were quantified by ELISA. Although no difference in soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 was found between the two groups (Fig. 3A), insoluble Aβ42 contents were increased significantly (about 2-fold) in the cerebrum of mice taking sucrose-sweetened water (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analyses also showed that total Aβ level was increased by 3.6-fold in the sucrose group (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses showed that there was a 2.9-fold increase in Aβ deposition in the brain of mice in the sucrose group (Fig. 4, C–E).FIGURE 4Aggravation of cerebral amyloidosis in APP/PS1 mice taking sucrose-sweetened water.

The results showed that there were no differences in the amount of full-length APP, α-CTF, and β-CTF (Fig. 5), indicating that the expression of the APP transgene and the processing of APP by α- and β-secretases were not affected by excess intake of sucrose-sweetened water in APP/PS1 mice. Effect of Sucrose Intake on the Steady-state Levels of IDE, ApoE, and Cholesterol in the Brain of APP/PS1 Mice—With no significant changes observed in the production of Aβ from APP, we next examined the factors that are involved in Aβ degradation and aggregation. IDE, originally recognized for its ability to degrade insulin, has been identified as one of the enzymes to degrade Aβ (22Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the increase of Aβ in the brain of mice in the sucrose group might be caused by a decrease of cerebral IDE, which has been associated with insulin resistance and AD pathology (17Ho L.

The results showed that the level of IDE in the sucrose group was decreased by about 30% compared with that of the control group (Fig. 6). However, this decrease did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10). We next determined the level of apoE in the brain. ApoE plays a critical role in the development of AD-like amyloid pathology in mouse models of AD (24Bales K.R. Verina T. Dodel R.C. Du Y. Altstiel L. Bender M. Hyslop P. Johnstone E.M. Little S.P. Cummins D.J. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Paul S.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Mouse endogenous apoE is strongly amyloidogenic and promotes aggregation and fibril formation of Aβ (25Holtzman D.M. Fagan A.M. Mackey B. Tenkova T. Sartorius L. Paul S.M. Bales K. Ashe K.H.

Our results demonstrated that the level of apoE was elevated about 2.5-fold in the brain of mice in the sucrose group compared with that in the control group (Fig. 6). The brain total cholesterol content, however, was not altered between the two groups (14.0 ± 0.5 versus 15.2 ± 0.6 ng/mg cerebrum wet weight). In this study, we showed that long term consumption of sucrose-sweetened water led to increased body weight, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hypercholesterolemia in APP/PS1 mice fed a normal low fat rodent diet.

By using a comparative analysis of two hepatitis C virus genomes (JFH1 and Jc1) differing in their level of virus production in cultured human hepatoma cells, we demonstrate that the core of the genotype 2a isolate J6 that is present in Jc1 mediates efficient assembly and release of infectious virions. Mapping studies identified a single amino acid residue in D2 as a major determinant for enhanced assembly and release of infectious Jc1 particles. Confocal microscopy analyses demonstrate that core protein in JFH1-replicating cells co-localizes perfectly with LDs and induces their accumulation in the perinuclear area, whereas no such accumulation of LDs and only a partial co-localization of core and LDs were found with the Jc1 genome. By using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay, we found that green fluorescent protein-tagged D2 variants are mobile on LDs and that J6- and JFH1-D2 differ in their mobility. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the binding strength of the D2 domain of core for LDs is crucial for determining the efficiency of virus assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2016948206,"Background Although bycatch of industrial-scale fisheries can cause declines in migratory megafauna including seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles, the impacts of small-scale fisheries have been largely overlooked. Small-scale fisheries occur in coastal waters worldwide, employing over 99% of the world's 51 million fishers. New telemetry data reveal that migratory megafauna frequent coastal habitats well within the range of small-scale fisheries, potentially producing high bycatch. These fisheries occur primarily in developing nations, and their documentation and management are limited or non-existent, precluding evaluation of their impacts on non-target megafauna. Principal Findings/Methodology 30 North Pacific loggerhead turtles that we satellite-tracked from 1996–2005 ranged oceanwide, but juveniles spent 70% of their time at a high use area coincident with small-scale fisheries in Baja California Sur, Mexico (BCS). We assessed loggerhead bycatch mortality in this area by partnering with local fishers to 1) observe two small-scale fleets that operated closest to the high use area and 2) through shoreline surveys for discarded carcasses. Minimum annual bycatch mortality in just these two fleets at the high use area exceeded 1000 loggerheads year−1, rivaling that of oceanwide industrial-scale fisheries, and threatening the persistence of this critically endangered population. As a result of fisher participation in this study and a bycatch awareness campaign, a consortium of local fishers and other citizens are working to eliminate their bycatch and to establish a national loggerhead refuge. Conclusions/Significance Because of the overlap of ubiquitous small-scale fisheries with newly documented high-use areas in coastal waters worldwide, our case study suggests that small-scale fisheries may be among the greatest current threats to non-target megafauna. Future research is urgently needed to quantify small-scale fisheries bycatch worldwide. Localizing coastal high use areas and mitigating bycatch in partnership with small-scale fishers may provide a crucial solution toward ensuring the persistence of vulnerable megafauna."
https://openalex.org/W1999950622,"CPEB (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein) is an important regulator of translation in oocytes and neurons. Although previous studies of CPEB in late Xenopus oocytes involve the eIF4E-binding protein maskin as the key factor for the repression of maternal mRNA, a second mechanism must exist, since maskin is absent earlier in oogenesis. Using co-immunoprecipitation and gel filtration assays, we show that CPEB specifically interacts, via protein/protein interactions, with the RNA helicase Xp54, the RNA-binding proteins P100(Pat1) and RAP55, the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T, and an eIF4E protein. Remarkably, these CPEB complex proteins have been characterized, in one or more organism, as P-body, maternal, or neuronal granule components. We do not detect interactions with eIF4E1a, the canonical cap-binding factor, eIF4G, or eIF4A or with proteins expressed late in oogenesis, including maskin, PARN, and 4E-BP1. The eIF4E protein was identified as eIF4E1b, a close homolog of eIF4E1a, whose expression is restricted to oocytes and early embryos. Although eIF4E1b possesses all residues required for cap and eIF4G binding, it binds m7GTP weakly, and in pull-down assays, rather than binding eIF4G, it binds 4E-T, in a manner independent of the consensus eIF4E-binding site, YSKEELL. Wild type and Y-A mutant 4E-T (which binds eIF4E1b but not eIF4E1a), when tethered to a reporter mRNA, represses its translation in a cap-dependent manner, and injection of eIF4E1b antibody accelerates meiotic maturation. Altogether, our data suggest that CPEB, partnered with several highly conserved RNA-binding partners, inhibits protein synthesis in oocytes using a novel pairing of 4E-T and eIF4E1b.

Altogether, our data suggest that CPEB, partnered with several highly conserved RNA-binding partners, inhibits protein synthesis in oocytes using a novel pairing of 4E-T and eIF4E1b. Selective protein synthesis in oocytes, eggs, and early embryos of many organisms drives several critical aspects of early development, including meiotic maturation and entry into mitosis, establishment of embryonic axes, and cell fate determination. Protein synthesis is usually regulated at the initiation stage, mediated by the 5′ m7GpppN mRNA cap structure bound by the translation initiation complex eIF4F, composed of eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and the large scaffold protein eIF4G, which has a consensus binding site YXXXXLϕ for eIF4E, and additional sites for eIF3 and the poly(A)-binding protein. eIF3 recruits the small ribosomal subunit, whereas the eIF4E-eIF4G-poly(A)-binding protein relay results in the so-called “closed loop” model, responsible for the synergistic enhancement of translation by capped and polyadenylated mRNAs. A hallmark of translational control mechanisms is the role of mRNA-binding proteins, which recognize specific (and usually) 3′-UTR 2The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionMSmass spectrometryGSTglutathione S-transferaseRNPribonucleoprotein cis-elements and influence the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to the 5′ cap (reviewed in Refs. 1Colegrove-Otero L.J.

Probably, the best studied mRNA-binding protein is CPEB1 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation-binding protein 1), characterized in flies, worms, clams, Aplysia, Xenopus, and mammals, which in its conserved C terminus contains two tandem RNA recognition motif domains followed by two zinc finger domains, responsible for binding 3′-UTR cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, consensus U4–6A1–3U (reviewed in Refs. 1Colegrove-Otero L.J.

Activated maternal mRNAs contain one or more cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements near the nuclear polyadenylation hexanucleotide, AAUAAA, whereas mRNAs lacking cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements are deadenylated upon meiotic maturation and concomitantly exit from polysomes. Unusually, deadenylated mRNAs are stable in eggs and early embryos, reflecting the absence of decapping activity. In Xenopus, cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements and hexanucleotide elements mediate poly(A) length control by a complex, including CPEB and the recently identified cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, GLD-2, as well as cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, symplekin, and the deadenylase PARN (8Wang L.

Wilczynska A. Thampi P. Cox L.L. Macnicol A.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When CPEB functions as a repressor, on the other hand, it has been reported to interact with maskin (TACC3), an eIF4E-binding protein, an interaction that precludes the productive binding of eIF4E to eIF4G (15Stebbins-Boaz B. Cao Q. de Moor C.H. Mendez R. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1017-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Maskin is phosphorylated in response to progesterone, a modification that releases eIF4E (16Barnard D.C. Cao Q. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7605-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This paradigm example of a repressed “closed loop” form of mRNA may, however, be confined to late stage Xenopus laevis oocytes, since maskin is absent early in oogenesis (17Groisman I. Huang Y.-S.

Nevertheless, maskin serves as a prototype of a protein that bridges an RNA-binding protein bound to the 3′-UTR and eIF4E bound to the cap to inhibit translation initiation. Other examples include two regulators of posterior patterning in the Drosophila oocyte and embryo, Bruno and Smaug, which repress oskar and nanos mRNAs respectively, and the eIF4E-binding protein Cup (19Wilhelm J.E.

Alternatively, a repressive “closed loop” form of mRNA may form directly, without an intermediary protein such as maskin or Cup, using a homolog of the canonical eIF4E1a (class I) initiation factor. Thus caudal and hunchback mRNAs, which establish opposing morphogen gradients in Drosophila embryos, are repressed by Bicoid and the Nos-Pum-Brat NRE complex, respectively, in conjunction with d4E-HP, a class II eIF4E, which binds the cap but not eIF4G (23Cho P.F.

Previously, we showed that in clam and Xenopus oocytes, CPEB interacts with a DDX6 RNA helicase called Xp54 and that Xp54 tethered to the 3′-UTR of a reporter RNA represses its translation (30Minshall N.

Here we report an extensive analysis of proteins that interact with CPEB in Xenopus oocytes, enabled by a recently described monoclonal CPEB antibody (40Wilczynska A. Aigueperse C. Kress M. Dautry F. Weil D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and gel filtration analyses show that in early stage oocytes, CPEB interacts with Xp54, P100 (S. cerevisiae Pat1, Drosophila melanogaster HPat), RAP55B (S. cerevisiae Scd6, D. melanogaster Trailer Hitch, Caenorhabditis elegans CAR-1, and Lsm14), eIF4E-Transporter (4E-T, D. melanogaster Cup), and an eIF4E protein, all P-body components, in an RNA-independent manner. The eIF4E protein was identified as eIF4E1b, a close homolog of the canonical eIF4E1a cap-binding protein. Although eIF4E1b possesses all residues known to be required for cap- and eIF4G-binding, it binds m7GTP weakly, and rather than binding eIF4G, it binds 4E-T, in a YSKEELL-independent manner. Wild type and Y-A mutant 4E-T tethered to a reporter mRNA represses its translation in a cap-dependent manner, and injection of eIF4E1b antibody accelerates meiotic maturation. Our data point to a conserved translational complex operating in early Xenopus oocytes, which represses cap-dependent translation not by severing the eIF4E1a-eIF4G link but by using an alternative eIF4E-binding protein and an alternative eIF4E protein.

Translations were performed in reticulocyte lysate also containing 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, a 2 mm concentration of each amino acid, and mRNA. In eIF4E mRNA translations, Met and Cys were substituted by [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. For all other translations, only Met was substituted. Translation was allowed to proceed for 90 min at 30 °C before RNase A was added for termination. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Xenopus Oocyte Lysate Preparation and Gel Filtration—Isolation, staging, handling, lysate preparation, and enucleation of Xenopus oocytes was as previously described (31Minshall N. Standart N.

Stage I/II oocyte lysate was gel-filtered using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 34.2 mm Na2HPO4, 15.8 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl. To calibrate the column, a protein standard sample was used containing thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa) (31Minshall N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Alternate fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blot. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates prepared from oocytes injected with MS2 fusion protein mRNAs with mouse monoclonal MS2 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose were described previously (31Minshall N. Standart N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins was performed in a similar manner, using mouse monoclonal CPEB antibodies (40Wilczynska A. Aigueperse C. Kress M. Dautry F. Weil D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or rabbit eIF4E1b antibody, 40 μl of stage I–V lysate prepared in 1 ml of NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% NaN3) was incubated, with gentle mixing, with 1 μl of CPEB antibody, 0.2 μl control MS2 antibody, or 0.5 μl of eIF4E1b/preimmune control antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of 10 μlof protein G-Sepharose (mouse monoclonal antibodies) or protein A-Sepharose beads (rabbit polyclonal antibodies) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed in NET buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of protein sample buffer. Ten μl of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by silver staining or Western blot. When RNase A-treated, Xenopus extracts were supplemented with RNase A to 20 pg/μl extract and incubated at 20 °C for 20 min prior to clarification by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation reactions for the isolation of proteins for peptide sequencing were performed essentially as described above by scaling up reaction volumes 10–25-fold. RNA was extracted from scaled up immunoprecipitation reactions and aliquots of whole cell lysate as follows. Bound beads or extracts were incubated in 500 μl of TNES (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS) with the addition of 200 μg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of tRNA and was resuspended in 12.5 μl of H2O. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Reverse transcription-PCRs were performed using 1 μl of purified RNA and 0.5 μl of random hexamers (Promega) in a 20-μl reaction volume using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs were performed using 1 μl of cDNA template in a 20-μl reaction volume with the following oligonucleotide pairs: actin (1:2) and cyclin B1 (3:4; see supplemental Table 1) with Taq DNA polymerase. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Proteins within the gel-excised bands were sequenced by MS/MS in the Cambridge Centre for Proteomics, as described previously (31Minshall N. Standart N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fragmentation data were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base using the MASCOT search engine (available on the World Wide Web). Probability-based MASCOT scores were used to evaluate identifications. Only matches with p < 0.05 for random occurrence were considered significant. 4E-T peptides were YDSDGVWDPEK, ATGR, and VISVDELEYR, and the P100(Pat1) peptides were WTDTVFLVAK, LSEEEFLGER, EEEPEALQPVK, VSTYATGQILEDK, AIDAVSYAMPDEAIK, and VFLMFLEVEELAR; the eIF4E1a/b peptides are shown in Fig. 3. Preparation of Antibodies—The P100(Pat1) antibody was raised against an N-terminal peptide DQESDEEPVKLEDD[C], and the eIF4E1b antibody was raised against an N-terminal peptide LSREKLDNEKRRKK[C] (Sigma). 4E-T antibody was raised against recombinant Xenopus 4E-T (Eurogentec). The X. laevis 4E-T expression plasmid is described in the supplemental materials. A culture of transformed BL21-CodonPlus-RIL cells was induced at 37 °C using an Overnight Express autoinduction system (Novagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested and resuspended in nitrilotriacetic acid buffer (300 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8). Following French pressing, pellets were resuspended in nitrilotriacetic acid buffer, and aliquots were run on SDS-PAGE preparative gels. Coomassie-stained 4E-T containing gel slices were excised and used for immunization. Antiserum was subsequently purified against 10 μg of 4E-T recombinant protein isolated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Protein Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on either 10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels and then used for Coomassie Blue staining, silver staining, or Western blot analysis using ECL (31Minshall N.

The columns were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with agitation and then washed with HKE buffer. Proteins were eluted from the resin with 0.1 mm GTP and then with 70 μm m7GpppG in HKE buffer and finally with 1× SB (SDS). For peptide sequencing, 1 ml of stage III/IV lysate was applied to 100 μl of cap-Sepharose beads in a 15-ml final volume. Columns were processed as above. Bound fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and the appropriate bands were excised for sequencing. For binding of in vitro translated eIF4E1a or eIF4E1b, 100 μl of translation mix was applied to 10 μl of cap-Sepharose beads equilibrated with HKE buffer. After binding and elutions as above, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. GST Binding Assays—GST-eIF4E1a- and GST-eIF4E1b-carrying plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli and transformed into expression-competent BL21 CodonPlus-RIL cells. Proteins were expressed as described for recombinant X4E-T and purified from the insoluble fraction essentially following the protocol described by Joshi et al. (25Joshi B. Cameron A. Jagus R. Eur.

Control GST proteins were expressed as described above but were present in the soluble fraction following French pressure cell lysis and centrifugation. GST proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). 1-ml aliquots of beads were incubated with the GST or GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Beads were washed with buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100) and finally in buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine) followed by elution in 1 ml of buffer C supplemented with 10 mm glutathione. Three μg of GST or 6 μg GST-eIF4E1a or eIF4E1b was bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer BB (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). 50 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled protein was added and allowed to bind for 2 h at 25°C.

https://openalex.org/W2098646008,"As a multifunctional protein, KRAB domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1) is reportedly subjected to multiple protein posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and sumoylation. However, gaps exist in our knowledge of how KAP1 phosphorylation cross-talks with KAP1 sumoylation and what the biological consequence is. Here, we show that doxorubicin (Dox) treatment induces KAP1 phosphorylation at Ser-824 via an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent manner, correlating with the transcriptional de-repression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and Gadd45α. A S824A substitution of KAP1, which ablates the ATM-induced phosphorylation, results in an increase of KAP1 sumoylation and repression of p21 transcription in Dox-treated cells. By contrast, a S824D mutation of KAP1, which mimics constitutive phosphorylation of KAP1, leads to a decrease of KAP1 sumoylation and stimulation of p21 transcription before the exposure of Dox. We further provide evidence that SENP1 deSUMOylase is involved in activating basal, but not Dox-induced, KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation, rendering a stimulation of p21 and Gadd45α transcription. Moreover, KAP1 and differential sumoylation of KAP1 were also demonstrated to fine-tune the transcription of three additional KAP1-targeted genes, including Bax, Puma, and Noxa. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role for ATM that selectively stimulates KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation to repress its sumoylation, leading to the de-repression of expression of a subset of genes involved in promoting cell cycle control and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stresses.

The Krüppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFP) comprise approximately one-third of the 799 different zinc finger proteins, constituting the largest single-family transcriptional regulators in mammals (1Urrutia R. Genome Biology 2004. 2003; 4: 231Google Scholar). KRAB domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1) 3The abbreviations used are:KAP1KRAB domain-associated protein 1DoxdoxorubicinATMataxia telangiectasia mutatedATRAT Rad3-relatedEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinkdkinase-deadRTreverse transcriptionshshort hairpinSUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifier. functions as transcriptional corepressor for ZBRK1, a KRAB-ZFP member, by acting as a transcription intermediary factor to connect KRAB-ZFPs to transcriptional repression machinery. Because KAP1 itself cannot bind DNA directly, the specificity of transcriptional repression is dictated by its interaction with ZBRK1 through protein-protein interaction. The RING finger-B box-coiled-coil domain of KAP1 associates with the KRAB domain of ZBRK1, repressing the transcription of DNA damage-responsive gene Gadd45α (2Zheng L. Pan H. Li S.

Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). KAP1 can recruit and coordinate several components of gene silencing machinery. For example, KAP1 interacts with histone deacetylase complex NuRD and N-CoR1 and binds to histone methyltransferase SETDB1 to modify the configuration of chromatin structures (4Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Negorev D. Maul G.G. Rauscher F.J. II I Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 5Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher F.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). KAP1 also recruits heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to histones through a PXVXL motif (7Lechner M.S. Begg G.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher F.J. II I Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6449-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Sripathy S.P. Stevens J. Schultz D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8623-8638Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, KAP1 is identified as a Mdm2-binding protein that inactivates p53 (9Okamoto K. Kitabayashi I. Taya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Wang C. Ivanov A. Chen L. Fredericks W.J. Seto E. Rauscher F.J. II I Chen J.

KRAB domain-associated protein 1 doxorubicin ataxia telangiectasia mutated AT Rad3-related enhanced green fluorescent protein kinase-dead reverse transcription short hairpin small ubiquitin-like modifier Emerging evidence supports the idea that post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and sumoylation, play a pivotal role in regulating transcriptional control in response to different extracellular milieu. As a multifunctional protein, KAP1 is reportedly subjected to multiple post-translational modifications, and we have recently reported that sumoylation, a post-translational Lys modification, plays a major role in mediating KAP1 transcriptional co-repressor function and attenuating doxorubicin (Dox)-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 transcriptional activation in breast cancer MCF-7 cells (3Lee Y.K. Thomas S.N. Yang A.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There are at least three Lys residues, 554, 779, and 804, that serve as the major sumoylation targets for KAP1, and the overall sumoylation capacity of KAP1 is transiently decreased upon Dox exposure. Moreover, the differential sumoylation status of KAP1 functions to modulate p21 transcription by switching the histone His-3–Lys-9 methylation and His-3–Lys-9 and -Lys-14 acetylation statuses without affecting the occupancy of the p21 proximal promoter by KAP1/ZBRK1 in MCF-7 cells. The KAP1 sumoylation-mimetic, SUMO-1-KAP1, desensitizes MCF-7 cells to Dox-induced cell death. Collectively, the KAP1 sumoylation/desumoylation switch suppresses KAP1 transcriptional co-repressor function by down-regulating histone His-3–Lys-9 methylation and fostering His-3–Lys-9 and -Lys-14 acetylation. However, it remains unclear what signal regulates the KAP1 sumoylation/desumoylation switch in response to Dox-induced DNA damage. A major response to DNA damage insults, such as DNA double-strand breaks by x-ray irradiation or Dox treatment, is the activation of the nuclear protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (11Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 12Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Patients with the genome instability syndrome ataxia telangiectasia are very sensitive to ionization radiation due to the lack of proper DNA damage response (11Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Upon the occurrence of double-strand breaks, ATM is rapidly phosphorylated, and ATM's own kinase activity subsequently phosphorylates a number of substrates, including H2AX, TopBP1, NBS1, and BRCA1 etc., resulting in the activation of cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair machinery (13Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). ATM belongs to a conserved protein family termed nuclear phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein-like kinases. Most members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein-like kinase family possess serine/threonine kinase activity and a domain that is characteristic of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (14Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar). Besides ATM, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), hSMG-1, mTOR, and the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK are the four other protein kinases of this family identified so far. Numerous studies have established that the biological response to genotoxic stresses in mammalian cells is to trigger a complex network of transcriptional activation by the checkpoint signaling kinases ATM and ATR and their effector kinases Chk2 and Chk1, respectively (for review, see Ref. 15Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). One of the key consequences is cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, mediated by the induction of proteins involved in cell cycle control (p21WAF1/CIP1 and Gadd45α) and proapoptosis (Bax, Puma, and Noxa) (16el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The balance of the combined induction of these genes leads to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis when proapoptotic genes are transcribed at a level above threshold, depending on the severity of DNA damage. Very recently, O'Geen at al. (19O'Geen H. Squazzo S.L. Iyengar S. Blahnik K. Rinn J.L. Chang H.Y. Green R. Farnham P.J. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e89Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have identified ∼7000 KAP1 target sites by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays coupled with a human 5-kilobase promoter array or a complete genomic tiling array. In light of the recent evidence for the multifunction of KAP1 (4Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Negorev D. Maul G.G. Rauscher F.J.

PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e89Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the identified Dox-stimulated KAP1 desumoylation (3Lee Y.K. Thomas S.N. Yang A.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) could have a profound effect on the regulation of global gene expression in response to genotoxins. Moreover, KAP1 is demonstrated to be phosphorylated at Ser-824 by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein-like kinase family member of kinases after DNA damage insult (20White D.E. Negorev D. Peng H. Ivanov A.V. Maul G.G. Rauscher F.J. II I Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11594-11599Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Ziv Y. Bielopolski D. Galanty Y. Lukas C. Taya Y. Schultz D.C. Lukas J. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Shiloh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Despite extensive literature investigating KAP1 function, little is known regarding the coordinated relieving of KAP1-mediated repression on p21, Gadd45α and other ZBRK1-binding element-containing genes by its multiple post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation and phosphorylation, in response to DNA damaging stimuli. Given that ATM regulates many aspects of DNA damage responses, including the induction of p21, we were intrigued by the possibility that ATM functions upstream of KAP1 SUMO-1 conjugation/deconjugation in response to DNA damage. Our results indicate that Dox treatment induces KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation and de-repression of Gadd45α and p21 transcription mainly via ATM, whereas the basal transcriptional co-repressor potential and sumoylation of KAP1 are coordinately regulated by SENP1 deSUMOylase. Finally, we demonstrate that the basal and DNA damage-induced transcription of a subset of KAP1-targeted genes, such as p21, Gadd45α, Bax, Puma, and Noxa, is coordinately regulated by the interplay of KAP1 sumoylation and phosphorylation. Our results could further unveil the role of a previously unnoticed ATM and KAP1 sumoylation switch in DNA damage responses. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and MCF-7 cells were cultured in the same medium with an addition of 0.01 mg/ml recombinant human insulin in a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C and 5% CO2. The stable KAP1 knockdown cell line K928-cI10 was grown as above with the addition of 10 μg/ml puromycin (8Sripathy S.P. Stevens J. Schultz D.C. Mol. Cell.

Western Analyses—Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% sodium azide, pH 8.0) plus Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4 and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies for FLAG-KAP1 (M2, Sigma-Aldrich), tubulin (D-10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), phospho-Ser-824-KAP1 (A300–767A, Bethyl Laboratories), and EGFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Blots were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL-Plus, Amersham Biosciences) and a Versadoc 5000 Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric data were obtained and analyzed with Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Results of Western analyses shown in this report are representative of two to four independent experiments. Luciferase Assays—The p21-Luc reporter construct was made by subcloning a 2.3-kilobase p21 promoter into pGL3-Basic as previously described (3Lee Y.K. Thomas S.N. Yang A.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Gadd45α-Luc reporter was a gift from Dr. Wen-Hwa Lee at the University of California, Irvine. The luciferase reporters were co-transfected with a firefly control reporter, pRL-TK, for the purpose of normalization. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase assays were carried out with DualGlo Luciferase assay kit (Promega), and the desired luciferase activity was calculated after normalization against the co-transfected firefly luciferase activity. In Vivo Sumoylation Assays—The in vivo sumoylation assay was carried out with co-transfection of FLAG-KAP1 or its mutants and EGFP-SUMO-1 in a 1:4 ratio into HEK293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. SUMOylated KAP1 was detected by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates against FLAG or EGFP tag. Immunoprecipitation of KAP1—Transfection of FLAG-KAP1 or FLAG-KAP1 with EGFP-SUMO-1 expression constructs into HEK293 or MCF-7 cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich). For each sample, 5 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody was mixed with 1 mg of whole cell lysates and incubated on ice for 2 h. Then Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) was added, and the sample was rotated at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was then washed with 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline three times. Immunoprecipitates were then eluted in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and half of the elution was subjected to immunoblotting analyses. Total RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total RNA from Dox-treated and control MCF-7 cells was then treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) and extracted again with phenol-chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR of p21, Gadd45α, Bax, Puma, and Noxa mRNA were performed with iTaq SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), a fraction of each total RNA sample, and specific pairs of gene-specific primers (Table 1). PCR amplification and fluorescence detection were done with MyIQ real-time PCR detection system, and the threshold cycles were determined by iCycler program with its default setting. -Fold inductions were determined by the ΔΔCt method against 18 S rRNA.TABLE 1Primer pairs used in the real-time RT-PCR experimentsPrimerPurposeSequence (5′ to 3′)18 S rRNA FPReal-time PCRCGGCGACGACCCATTCGAAC18 S rRNA RPRT and real-time PCRGAATCGAACCCTGATTCCCCGTCp21 FPReal-time PCRTTTCTCTCGGCTCCCCATGTp21 RPRT and real-time PCRGCTGTATATTCAGCATTGTGGGGadd45α FPReal-time PCRAGGAAGTGCTCAGCAAAGCCGadd45α RPRT and real-time PCRGCACAACACCACGTTATCGGBax FPReal-time PCRCCGATTCATCTACCCTGCTGBax RPRT and real-time PCRCAATTCCAGAGGCAGTGGAGNoxa FPReal-time PCRATTACCGCTGGCCTACTGTGNoxa RPRT and real-time PCRGTGCTGAGTTGGCACTGAAAPuma FPReal-time PCRCTGTGAATCCTGTGCTCTGCPuma RPRT and real-time PCRAATGAATGCCAGTGGTCACA Open table in a new tab Constructs—Human SENP1 cDNA was amplified from testis cDNA library (Clontech) and cloned into EcoRI and EcoRV sites of pCMV-HA vector, yielding hemagglutinin-SENP1. Hemagglutinin (HA)-SENP1C603S mutant was constructed from HA-SENP1 plasmid by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides corresponding to SENP1 nucleotide sequence 413ACCATCACTGCCATGTATC431 and 520ACTCAGAGGCGACATGTTA538 were inserted into pSuper vector (Oligoengine) to generate sh-SENP1-1 and sh-SENP1–2, respectively. FLAG-KAP1(S824D), FLAG-KAP1(S824A), and SUMO-1-KAP1(L306P) mutants were engineered using FLAG-KAP1 and SUMO-1-KAP1 (3Lee Y.K. Thomas S.N. Yang A.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol.

Inducible sh-KAP1—Tet-inducible sh-KAP1 was constructed according to van de Wetering et al. (24van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C.

Sense and antisense oligos (100 pmol of each) were annealed in 50 μl of annealing buffer (10 mm potassium acetate, 3 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mm magnesium acetate). One microliter of this oligos mixture and 100 ng of purified pTER+ backbone were used per ligation. Clones expressing pTER+-shKAP1 were selected with ampicillin resistance. To test the effect of sh-KAP1 knockdown, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with p21-Luc, Tet-repressor plasmid pCDNA6/TR (Invitrogen), and pTER+-sh-KAP1 or pTER+-sh-Control. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 2 μm doxycycline for 4 or 24 h to induce the expression of their respective short hairpin RNA. Then the luciferase activity was measured and normalized against pRL-TK. pCDNA4-TO-Luc (Invitrogen) was used as positive control for doxycycline induction. Statistical Analysis—The error bar represents the S.D. of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc comparisons based on a modified Newman-Keuls-Student procedure with p < 0.05 considered significant. Where appropriate, unpaired Student's t tests were also performed to determine the difference between two data groups. Differential Activation of ATM and ATR in Response to Dox and UV Treatment—We have recently demonstrated that the transcription of p21WAF1/CIP1 is distinctly regulated by KAP1 sumoylation status; sumoylation-mimetic KAP1 (SUMO-1-KAP1, Fig. 1A, left panel) enhances transcriptional repression by increasing the methylation of histone His-3–Lys-9 and decreasing the acetylation of His-3–Lys-9 and -Lys-14, whereas sumoylation-defective KAP1 (KAP1(3K/R), Fig. 1A, left panel) relieves transcriptional repression in an opposite manner (3Lee Y.K. Thomas S.N. Yang A.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, we report that Dox-treatment also activated the transcription of the DNA damage response gene Gadd45α (growth arrest and DNA damage clone 45) in a way similar to that of p21, whereas transfected KAP1 repressed the Dox-induced Gadd45α transcription in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel, second lane 2 versus first lane). Consistent with a previous report (3Lee Y.K. Thomas S.N. Yang A.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), sumoylation-mimetic SUMO-1-KAP1 abolished the ability of Dox to induce Gadd45α expression (Fig. 1A, right panel, third lane). Notably, a L306P mutation of SUMO-1-KAP1 (SUMO-1-KAP1(L306P); Fig. 1A, left panel), which disrupts the interaction between coil-coiled domain of SUMO-1-KAP1 and KRAB domain with ZBRK1, almost completely relieved the repressive effect by SUMO-1-KAP1 (Fig. 1A, right panel, second lane). Our results support the notion that sumoylation of KAP1 enhances KAP1's function as a transcriptional co-repressor to attenuate Gadd45α transcription. Because both ATM and ATR function as both the sensors for and activators of DNA break repair, we set to examine whether ATM, ATR, or both are involved in mediating Dox-induced relief of KAP1 transcriptional co-repressor function. ATM-deficient fibroblast cells (pEBS7) and their counterparts (YZ5, in which the expression of wild-type ATM is restored by stable transfection of ATM in pEBS7 cells) were employed to explore the mechanism underlying KAP1/ZBRK1-mediated gene expression regulation in response to Dox treatment. As shown in Fig. 1B, ATM was rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on Ser-1981 after Dox treatment in MCF-7 cells with comparable kinetics to that observed in ATM-proficient YZ5 cells. The ATM-deficient pEBS7 cells served as a control to ensure the validity of the antibody against Ser-1981-phosphorylated ATM (Fig. 1B). We next compared the inducibility of Gadd45α-Luc in response to UV and Dox treatment in pEBS7 and YZ5 cells. In ATM-deficient pEBS7 cells, the Gadd45α transcription was induced by UV radiation (Fig. 1C, lanes 5–7), consistent with the idea that UV-induced DNA damage responses are mainly not ATM-dependent. Notably, Dox-induced Gadd45α transcription in pEBS7 cells was modest (Fig. 1C, lane 13), implying that ATM is required for Dox-mediated transcriptional activation. By contrast, Dox treatment induced Gadd45α-Luc activation (Fig. 1D, lane 13 versus lane 5), which was compromised by the expression of SUMO-1-KAP1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D, lanes 14 and 15 versus lane 13) in ATM-proficient YZ5 cells. Although UV radiation activated a comparable induction in Gadd45α transcription (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 5 versus lanes 9 and 13), SUMO-1-KAP1 conferred a negligible effect on UV-induced Gadd45α promoter activation in YZ5 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 7). Collectively, our results suggest that Dox and UV radiation induce Gadd45α transcription in distinct manners, and the sumoylation-mimetic SUMO-1-KAP1 only represses ATM-mediated Gadd45α transactivation. GK41 cells, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible ATR-kd, were used to assess the role of ATR in KAP1-dependent Gadd45α transcriptional de-repression by Dox exposure. As shown in Fig. 1E, Dox treatment induced Gadd45α transcription by 2.4-fold (lane 4 versus lane 1), and the expression of SUMO-1-KAP1 repressed both basal (lanes 2 and 3) and Dox-inducible Gadd45α transcription (lanes 5 and 6) in the absence of doxycycline (such that the expression of ATR-kd is negligible) in GK41 cells. The expression of ATR-kd (by adding doxycycline (1 μg/ml) to medium) did not affect the basal and Dox-inducible Gadd45α transcription under the same experimental protocol (Fig. 1E, lanes 7 and 10–12 versus lanes 1 and 4–6). Taken together, we conclude that Dox treatment induces Gadd45α transcriptional activation via an ATM-dependent pathway to relieve KAP1-mediated trans-repression. However, it appears that SUMO-1-KAP1 had a lesser effect in repressing Dox-induced Gadd45α transcription in GK41 cells than in YZ5 cells. The exact mechanism underlying this discrepancy remains to be elucidated. Dox Treatment Induces KAP1 Phosphorylation at Ser-824 via ATM—To further examine the role of KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation in governing KAP1 function, we next engineered KAP1 mutants containing S824A or S824D substitutions. The S824D mutant was expected to mimic Ser-824-phosphorylated KAP1, whereas the S824A mutant reflected non-phosphorylated KAP1. By using KAP1(wt)-, KAP1(S/A)-, or KAP1(S/D)-transiently transfected MCF-7 cells, we then confirmed the specificity of antibody for Dox-induced KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, left panel, lanes 4 and 7). The anti-KAP1-Ser-824 antibody has been used by Ziv et al. (21Ziv Y. Bielopolski D. Galanty Y. Lukas C. Taya Y. Schultz D.C. Lukas J. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Shiloh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates KAP1 at Ser-824 in response to double-strand breaks. By using the level of tubulin to normalize for equal loading and the level of KAP1 to normalize for transfection efficiency, the quantitative analysis of Dox-induced KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells was summarized in Fig. 2A (right panel). The phospho-Ser-824 signals detected in KAP1(S/A)- and KAP1(S/D)-transfected cells after treatment with Dox (1 μm) for 3 h represented the Ser-824-phosphorylated endogenous KAP1 (Fig. 2A, left panel, lanes 8 and 9). Our previous data suggest that ATM may be the key phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein-like kinase that induces Gadd45α transcriptional de-repression in Dox-treated cells, as Dox-induced Gadd45α-Luc activity was significantly reduced in ATM-deficient pEBS7 cells (Fig. 1C) as compared with that of ATM-complemented YZ5 cells (Fig. 1D). The possible role of ATM in mediating Dox-induced KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation was further analyzed in pEBS7 and YZ5 cells. Western analyses showed that Dox-induced endogenous and transfected KAP1 phosphorylation at"

In an in vitro investigation of the contributions of decorin to tissue organization and material behavior, model tissues were engineered by seeding embryonic fibroblasts, harvested from 12.5-13.5 days gestational aged decorin null (Dcn(-/-)) or wild-type mice, within type I collagen gels. The resulting three-dimensional collagen matrices were cultured for 4 weeks under static tension. The collagen matrices seeded with Dcn(-/-) cells exhibited greater contraction, cell density, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus than those seeded with wild-type cells. Ultrastructurally, the matrices seeded with Dcn(-/-) cells contained a greater density of collagen. The decorin-null tissues contained more biglycan than control tissues, suggesting that this related proteoglycan compensated for the absence of decorin. The effect of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which is normally sequestered by decorin, was also investigated in this study. The addition of TGF-beta1 to the matrices seeded with wild-type cells improved their contraction and mechanical strength, whereas blocking TGF-beta1 in the Dcn(-/-) cell-seeded matrices significantly reduced the collagen gel contraction. These results indicate that the inhibitory interaction between decorin and TGF-beta1 significantly influenced the matrix organization and material behavior of these in vitro model tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2007749893,"Biologists are gaining an increased understanding of the genetic bases of phenotypic change during evolution. Nevertheless, the origins of phenotypes mediated by novel protein-protein interactions remain largely undocumented.Here we analyze the evolution of opsin visual pigment proteins from the genomes of early branching animals, including a new class of opsins from Cnidaria. We combine these data with existing knowledge of the molecular basis of opsin function in a rigorous phylogenetic framework. We identify adaptive amino acid substitutions in duplicated opsin genes that correlate with a diversification of physiological pathways mediated by different protein-protein interactions.This study documents how gene duplication events early in the history of animals followed by adaptive structural mutations increased organismal complexity by adding novel protein-protein interactions that underlie different physiological pathways. These pathways are central to vision and other photo-reactive phenotypes in most extant animals. Similar evolutionary processes may have been at work in generating other metazoan sensory systems and other physiological processes mediated by signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2053811769,"Paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) is a mammalian gene that is essential for embryonic development in mice. The gene contains two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) and is derived from a retroelement that acquired a cellular function.

In this study the frameshifting activity of PEG10 was analyzed in vivo, and a potential role for ORF2 was investigated. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that PEG10 is highly conserved in therian mammals, with all species retaining the elements necessary for frameshifting as well as functional motifs in each ORF. The frameshift site of PEG10 was highly active in cultured cells and produced the ORF1-2 protein. In mice, endogenous ORF1 and an ORF1-2 frameshift protein were detected in the developing placenta and amniotic membrane from 9.5 days post-coitus through to term with a very high frameshift efficiency (>60%). Mutagenesis of the active site motif of a putative protease within ORF2 showed that this enzyme is active and participates in post-translational processing of PEG10 ORF1-2. Both PEG10 proteins were also detected in first trimester human placenta. By contrast, neither protein expression nor frameshifting was detected in adult mouse tissues.

The phenotype of a mouse PEG10 deletion knock-out was embryonic lethal by 10.5 days post-coitus (dpc) due to defects in placental formation (16Ono R. Nakamura K. Inoue K. Naruse M. Usami T. Wakisaka-Saito N. Hino T. Suzuki-Migishima R. Ogonuki N. Miki H. Kohda T. Ogura A. Yokoyama M. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This suggests that a functional PEG10 protein is expressed during development but does not address whether both reading frames are important. PEG10 also shows significant oncogenic function in both solid tumors and B cell acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia through its apparent ability to prevent apoptosis and promote cell proliferation (17Okabe H. Satoh S. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Hasegawa S. Nakajima Y. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3043-3048PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chunsong H. Yuling H. Li W. Jie X. Gang Z. Qiuping Z. Qingping G. Kejian Z. Li Q. Chang A.E. Youxin J. Jinquan T. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6713-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is still unknown whether PEG10 frameshifts in vivo and whether ORF2 has a function. This study answers these questions, with PEG10 as the first example of an endogenous mammalian gene utilizing –1 frameshifting within specific tissues. ORF2 encodes an active protease and is, therefore, likely to be important for the function of PEG10. Phylogenetic Analysis—PEG10 homologues were identified by BLASTN searches (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) on the non-redundant expressed sequence tag and high genomic throughput sequence databases available on the NCBI server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Accession numbers of sequences used in this study are: AB049834 (human), XR025065 (chimpanzee), AC092529 (baboon), AC148261 (marmoset), AC149024 (bat), AC108197 (cat), AC113572 (dog), AC144997 (cow), AC148354 (shrew), DQ779285 (pig), NM130877 (mouse), AAHX01028329 (rat), and AB260975 (wallaby). In the pig PEG10 geneaTat position 2431 introduced a premature stop codon, whereas multiple pig expressed sequence tags covering this region (CF788450, DN101021, DN101372, DY434608) haveaCat that position. Therefore, a T-C change was introduced in the gene sequence for our analysis. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) accessible at the EBI server. Alignments were annotated using JalView (21Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Full-length alignments can be obtained from the corresponding author. Vector Construction and Cloning of PEG10—Human and mouse PEG10 constructs were created and cloned into the vector pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Human PEG10 was supplied as the cDNA KIAA1051 (AB028974) in the pBluescript II SK(+) vector (12Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The mouse PEG10 sequence was a gift from Dr. Ian Brierley (22Manktelow E. Shigemoto K. Brierley I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and is the same sequence utilized in Shigemoto et al. (11Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Walls E. Watson C.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Reith A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This clone contains nucleotides (nt) 350-3501 of a mouse PEG10 cDNA cloned into pSP64T and lacks a portion of the repeat-rich insertion. Sequencing analysis in this study revealed it was missing 114 nt of the insertion due to in-frame deletions of 90 and 24 nt. In addition, the clone lacks the initiation codon, which was at nt 266–268 in the original cDNA clone. For this study, to maximize the amount of mouse PEG10 sequence, a new start site was introduced where protein homology between mouse and human begins at nt 491 on the GenBank™ mouse consensus sequence (NM130877) creating a mouse PEG10 construct without codons 2–40. PEG10 ORF1, PEG10 ORF2, and the full-length PEG10 coding sequence were constructed by PCR from mouse and human PEG10 placed within vectors. A two-step amplification protocol added an N-terminal FLAG tag and C-terminal His tag to all human sequences, and an N-terminal FLAG tag to mouse sequences. An initiation codon was added to the PEG10 ORF2 constructs. PCR primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. PCR products were cloned into pcDNA 3.1(+) after enzyme restriction with HindIII and XbaI and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science) before transformation into ultracompetent DH5α Escherichia coli cells using a heat-shock method (23Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Clones were sequenced as appropriate. As noted in Shigemoto et al. (11Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Walls E. Watson C.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Reith A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), mouse PEG10 ORF2 is highly liable to mutations and, indeed, the OF2 clone contained a mutation corresponding to nucleotide 876 (numbering from the full-length clone). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Two PEG10 frameshift mutants (fs mutants 1 and 2) and a protease “active site motif” mutant were created by two-step PCR (24Scarlett D.J. McCaughan K.K. Wilson D.N. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15095-15104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers used are listed in supplemental Table 1. The PEG10 fs mutant 1 contained an insertion (A) two nucleotides downstream of the end of the heptanucleotide slippery sequence at position 1441 (NM_015068). The PEG10 fs mutant 2 contained a substitution (A to G) in the heptanucleotide sequence at position 1436. The conserved catalytic aspartic acid in human PEG10 protease was changed to alanine. Step one used a mutagenic forward primer and either the reverse PEG10 ORF2 XbaI primer (fs mutants) or the reverse pcDNA 3.1(+) vector primer (protease mutant). The ∼1-kb purified product was used as a reverse “megaprimer” in step two in combination with the PEG10 ORF1/ORF2 HindIII forward primer (fs mutants) or the forward pcDNA 3.1(+) vector primer (protease mutant). Cell Cultures and Cell Transfection—Human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) and African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) kidney (COS-7) cells sourced from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC®) (Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C and in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Passaged COS-7 cells were seeded (1.5 × 105 cells in 2 ml) into 6-well plates and grown for ∼24 h before transfection (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science) using a 1:3 ratio of DNA: FuGENE 6 with 500 ng to 2 μg of DNA. Cells were cultured for 48 h then washed in 1× PBS before lysis in 400 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with the appropriate dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Mouse Tissue Collection—The mice studied were strain C57BL/6. All organs and tissues were dissected out immediately after death, washed in ice-cold 1× PBS, and frozen on dry ice. Pregnant females were studied at dpc 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, 15.5, and 21.5. Uterine horns were removed from earlier time points, whereas single products of conception (poc) were removed individually from later time points and washed in ice-cold 1× PBS before the poc (whole embryo/fetus, placenta, and amniotic membrane) were dissected out in 1× PBS. Human Tissue Collection—Human placental tissue was obtained from first trimester terminations between the fourth and tenth week. Embryonic gestational ages were determined before termination by ultrasonographic measurement and using the Carnegie Stages of embryo development (26O'Rahilly R. Muller F. Developmental Stages in Human Embryos. Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar) where possible. Sections through the entire thickness of developing placenta were selected, washed in 1× PBS, and snap-frozen on dry ice. Protein Extraction—Protein was extracted from frozen tissue in ice-cold protease protective extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (BDH), 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Tissue was rapidly homogenized on ice using micro-pestles, cells were disrupted for 10 min in a sonication bath (Soniclean), and membranes were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against each reading frame of the human PEG10 protein. Human PEG10 ORF1 and PEG10 ORF2 were cloned individually into pQE-80L (Qiagen) and the recombinant His-tagged protein expressed in E. coli. His tag-purified ORF1 and ORF2 were injected into rabbits. Generation of the PEG10-specific antibodies was determined by comparing PEG10 recognition between preimmune sera and sera obtained after inoculation and by testing antibody reactivity on untransfected and PEG10-transfected COS-7 cell lysates. Antibody sensitivity was determined by testing the antibody reactivity to a dilution series of purified PEG10 ORF1 or ORF2 protein. Immunoblotting—Cell culture and tissue lysates were prepared in protein denaturing buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide gels (7–12.5% (w/v)). Proteins were transferred to Protran® nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman) and blocked in 5% (w/v) milk powder in 1× TBST (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 (USB Corp.)) overnight. Then membranes were hybridized with PEG10 ORF1 or ORF2 antibody or a mouse monoclonal antibody against FLAG (Sigma) or rabbit anti-actin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody, and detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western-blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples to be examined were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. One lane of sample was subjected to Western blot analysis to identify the position of target proteins. Thin gel slices (∼2 mm wide) of the respective molecular weight range were then excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion as previously described (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Proteins were fragmented by overnight tryptic digestion using a 1:10 ratio of μg of trypsin to μg of substrate protein. Tryptic peptides were fractionated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography on a nanoflow C18 column (PepMap C18, Dionex Co.) using an UltiMate™ 3000 LC system (Dionex) and eluted with a 1.6–72% acetonitrile gradient over 60 min. Eluted fractions were automatically mixed with matrix (3 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 75% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and spotted onto the MALDI plate (Opti-TOF LC/MALDI Insert, Applied Biosystems) using a Probot Micro-fraction Collector (Dionex). Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed using a 4800 MALDI tandem time of flight analyzer (Applied Biosystems). MS data were acquired on each sample and subjected to a peptide mass fingerprint analysis against a short sequence data base containing the amino acid sequences derived from PEG10 ORF1 and PEG10 ORF1-2 using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science). MASCOT search parameters allowed carboxyamidomethyl cysteine as a variable modification, two missed trypsin cleavage sites, a precursor tolerance of 50 ppm, and a default charge state of 1+. Collision-induced dissociation mass spectra were then acquired on the 5 strongest precursor ions per sample spot including a list of 50 preferred ions that matched PEG10-derived peptides in the peptide mass fingerprint analysis. These potential PEG10 peptide ions were selected for collision-induced dissociation MS analysis if they were detected with a signal to noise threshold of 40. MS/MS data were analyzed with the MASCOT search engine, which searched the SwissProt data base with PEG10 ORF1 and PEG10 ORF1-2 protein sequences integrated into it. MASCOT search parameters were as given for the peptide mass fingerprint analysis and with a mass tolerance of 0.3 Da for fragment ions. Peptides identified by MASCOT as having a significant individual ion score at a threshold of p < 0.05 were considered significant peptide identifications. Bioinformatic Analysis of PEG10—To investigate the phylogenetic distribution and conservation of PEG10, BLASTN searches were performed on the GenBank™ databases using the full-length ∼6.2-kilobase cDNA of human PEG10 (8Ono R. Kobayashi S. Wagatsuma H. Aisaka K. Kohda T. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Genomics. 2001; 73: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as a query. The search focused on sequences containing homology to both reading frames, allowing inspection of the frameshift site as well as avoiding the selection of distantly related retrotransposons with partial homologies. Genes orthologous to full-length PEG10 were identified in 11 other mammalian species (see “Experimental Procedures” for accession numbers). Most of these orthologs have been listed by previous studies (28Ono R. Shiura H. Aburatani H. Kohda T. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Brandt J. Schrauth S. Veith A.M. Froschauer A. Haneke T. Schultheis C. Gessler M. Leimeister C. Volff J.N.

Those studies focused on the analysis of the Ty3-Gypsy or Mart family of retrotransposons. The present study undertook a more in-depth investigation of the phylogenetic conservation within the PEG10/Mart2 orthologs. An ortholog of PEG10 has recently been identified in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), extending the existence of PEG10 orthologs from the eutherians into the metatherians (31Suzuki S. Ono R. Narita T. Pask A.J. Shaw G. Wang C. Kohda T. Alsop A.E. Marshall Graves J.A. Kohara Y. Ishino F. Renfree M.B. Kaneko-Ishino T. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e55Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The provided sequence was included in the analysis. A possible opossum homologue (29Brandt J. Schrauth S. Veith A.M. Froschauer A. Haneke T. Schultheis C. Gessler M. Leimeister C. Volff J.N. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 345: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has not been annotated as yet and, therefore, was not included. Within all of the identified PEG10 orthologs two overlapping ORFs were predicted (Fig. 1A) with a very high level of conservation over the entire length of both reading frames and within regions of the 3′-untranslated region. Most importantly, there was extremely high conservation of the sequence elements required for functional frameshifting. The G GGA AAC consistent with the consensus heptanucleotide slippery sequence X XXY YYZ was completely conserved in all species, and the sequence of a downstream pseudoknot (22Manktelow E. Shigemoto K. Brierley I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was completely conserved except for one point mutation in the rodent sequence that strengthens the pseudoknot structure (22Manktelow E. Shigemoto K. Brierley I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and two mutations in the wallaby sequence at the bottom of stem two that would be expected to impair stem two formation (Fig. 1B). This conservation strongly suggests that all species containing PEG10 have retained the ability to express both reading frames of PEG10 via a frameshift mechanism. The conclusion is further supported by the analysis of conserved motifs found in both reading frames. Structures typical for LTR retrotransposons such as the major homology region, the CX2CX4HX4C zinc finger, and the DSG aspartic protease active site motif have been identified previously in both human and mouse PEG10 (9Butler M. Goodwin T. Simpson M. Singh M. Poulter R. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Walls E. Watson C.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Reith A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On closer investigation of the 12 protein orthologs, a highly conserved major homology region and zinc-finger motif were identified in ORF1 (Fig. 1C). Analysis of PEG10 ORF2 revealed that all PEG10 orthologs lack motifs required for retrotransposition including the reverse transcriptase, RNase H, or integrase. In contrast, they show complete conservation of the DSG protease active site motif (Fig. 1, A and D). In addition, a striking polyproline stretch of 12–16 amino acids in length was identified at the C terminus of ORF2 in all eutherian species, whereas it was missing in the wallaby PEG10, which terminates immediately upstream of the stretch (Fig. 1D). Proline-rich motifs are found in signaling proteins and are commonly phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues within or immediately adjacent to the motif (32Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). A conserved SYST (SYSA in cow and rat, SCSA in mouse) motif was found immediately downstream of the proline stretch (Fig. 1D). The conservation of the protease despite the loss of the remaining protein domains commonly found in Pol proteins of retrotransposons implies the second ORF is functionally important and may have retained its protease activity. This would allow post-translational proteolytic processing of the full-length fusion product. Within the group of eutherian PEG10 orthologs, mouse and rat PEG10 are the most divergent from the others and contain small and large insertions within both reading frames. A large insertion within the second reading frame of the mouse gene was also previously noted (29Brandt J. Schrauth S. Veith A.M. Froschauer A. Haneke T. Schultheis C. Gessler M. Leimeister C. Volff J.N. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 345: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, the translation initiation site appears to have been translocated ∼120 nt upstream of the human start codon. These changes may alter the protein function in rodents. The human PEG10 ORF1 start codon, which is preceded by a strong Kozak sequence (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar), is conserved within the primate species (human, chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset), whereas a CTG is found at this position in laurasiatheria (bat, cat, dog, cow, shrew, pig) (34Springer M.S. Stanhope M.J. Madsen O. de Jong W.W. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2004; 19: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Translation initiation from CTG codons is possible and has been reported for a small number of vertebrate genes (35Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Translation of pig PEG10 has been reported to start ∼240 nt upstream of the human ATG (36Zhang F.W. Cheng H.C. Jiang C.D. Deng C.Y. Xiong Y.Z. Li F.E. Lei M.G. J. Anim. Sci. 2007; 85: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but this putative start codon has not been conserved within the remaining laurasiatherian species. By contrast, the PEG10 termination site and codon have been conserved for both reading frames between all species. The TAG stop codon of ORF1 is located within the predicted pseudoknot structure (Fig. 1B), whereas the ORF2 stop codon has been conserved after a proline-rich stretch of amino acids at the end of ORF2 in all eutherian species. In contrast, the wallaby PEG10 terminates directly before the start of the proline-rich stretch (see Fig. 1B). This analysis of PEG10 orthologs identified a strikingly high c"

In this study, we show that Rage mRNA and protein levels were stimulated in the mouse brain after experimental stroke and systemic hypoxia. In both cases, RAGE expression was primarily associated with neurons. Activation of RAGE-dependent pathway(s) post-ischemia appears to have a neuroprotective role because mice genetically deficient for RAGE exhibited increased infarct size 24 h after injury. Up-regulation of RAGE expression was also observed in primary neurons subjected to hypoxia or oxygen-glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemia. Treatment of neurons with low concentrations of S100B decreased neuronal death after oxygen-glucose deprivation, and this effect was abolished by a neutralizing antibody against RAGE. Conversely, high concentrations of exogenous S100B had a cytotoxic effect that seems to be RAGE-independent. As an important novel finding, we demonstrate that hypoxic stimulation of RAGE expression is mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1. This conclusion is supported by the finding that HIF-1α down-regulation by Cre-mediated excision drastically decreased RAGE induction by hypoxia or desferrioxamine. In addition, we showed that the mouse RAGE promoter region contains at least one functional HIF-1 binding site, located upstream of the proposed transcription start site. A luciferase reporter construct containing this RAGE promoter fragment was activated by hypoxia, and mutation at the potential HIF-1 binding site decreased hypoxia-dependent promoter activation.

In the central nervous system, the expression of RAGE has been described in several cell types. During the embryonic and early postnatal period, RAGE is highly expressed by hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar neurons (4Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M.

Several RAGE ligands are produced in the brain under normal and pathological conditions; interactions of these ligands with RAGE can lead to multiple molecular and cellular consequences, depending on the cell type involved and the nature and concentration of the ligand. S100B is one such ligand. In addition to its intracellular function, when secreted S100B can exert autocrine and paracrine effects that have trophic or toxic impact depending on its concentration. It has been proposed that activation of RAGE can mediate both sets of effects (9Huttunen H.J. Kuja-Panula J. Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Donato R. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

In vitro studies using primary neurons or neuroblastoma cells showed that stimulation of RAGE by low levels of S100B leads to neurite outgrowth, and activation of pro-survival pathways during stress conditions like trophic factor deprivation, glutamate, N-methyl-d-aspartate, or amyloid-β toxicity (9Huttunen H.J.

On the other hand, treatment of primary neurons, astrocytes, or microglia with relatively high doses of S100B leads to oxidative stress, NF-κB activation, expression of proinflammatory mediators, and cytotoxicity (9Huttunen H.J.

Little is known about the in vivo synergistic or inhibitory effects of S100B and the other RAGE ligands, and for some of these proteins (i.e. high-mobility group box 1, S100B, and amyloid-β) other cell surface interaction sites besides RAGE have been postulated (15Park J.S.

Kaneko M. Ananthakrishnan R. Harja E. Lee L.K. Hwang Y.C. Lerner S. Bakr S. Li Q. Lu Y. Song F. Qu W. Gomez T. Zou Y.S. Yan S.F. Schmidt A.M. Ramasamy R.

In addition, it is well established that the production of the glial-derived protein S100B is substantially enhanced upon activation in response to cerebral ischemia (19Matsui T. Mori T. Tateishi N. Kagamiishi Y. Satoh S. Katsube N. Morikawa E. Morimoto T. Ikuta F. Asano T. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Yasuda Y. Tateishi N. Shimoda T. Satoh S. Ogitani E. Fujita S. Brain Res. 2004; 1021: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These reports support the possibility of an effective activation of RAGE-mediated signaling in the ischemic brain, the consequences of which have not been explored. Regulation of many cellular responses to ischemia requires the concerted activation of various transcription factors including hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits; HIF-1α is the regulatory component of this complex and its expression is exquisitely regulated by an oxygen-dependent post-translational modification that targets HIF-1α for proteosomal degradation (for review, see Ref. 21Ratcliffe P.J. Clin. Med. 2006; 6: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During hypoxia, HIF-1α is stabilized, translocates into the nucleus where it binds HIF-1β and forms the active HIF-1 complex. Interaction of HIF-1 with its consensus DNA binding site is required for the hypoxia-induced expression of a vast array of target genes, which are involved in various cellular and systemic adaptive responses to hypoxia, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, vasomotor regulation, cell proliferation and survival, cell death, and matrix metabolism, among others (22Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 23Wenger R.H. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : re12Google Scholar). HIF-1α is up-regulated in the hypoxic-ischemic brain (24Baranova O. Miranda L.F. Pichiule P. Dragatsis I. Johnson R.S. Chavez J.C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6320-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 25Bergeron M. Yu A.Y. Solway K.E. Semenza G.L. Sharp F.R. Eur. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8922-8931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, potential interactions with S100B or RAGE have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate this potential signaling pathway in hypoxia-ischemia. We confirm earlier findings of neuronal RAGE up-regulation after cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in the mouse and further demonstrate that RAGE activation in the ischemic brain may have a neuroprotective role because RAGE-null mice displayed exacerbated brain damage when subjected to HI. In addition, by using a loss-of-function approach, we show that HIF-1 is required for RAGE expression during hypoxia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that hypoxia induces the association of endogenous HIF-1α to the RAGE promoter. Finally, we show that activation of RAGE in primary neurons by low concentrations of S100B improves neuronal survival after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Conversely, high concentrations of S100B have a RAGE-independent cytotoxic effect. Together, our results indicate that HIF-1 mediates the transcriptional activation of RAGE expression in neurons, and activation of this receptor can be viewed as part of the glianeuron communication system that might be important for the neuronal response to ischemic insults, and explain the basis for the biphasic effects of S100B in the brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—The generation of RAGE-null mice has been described in detail elsewhere (27Constien R. Forde A. Liliensiek B. Grone H.J. Nawroth P. Hammerling G. Arnold B. Genesis. 2001; 30: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28Liliensiek B. Weigand M.A. Bierhaus A. Nicklas W. Kasper M.

Schmidt, these animals have been backcrossed into the C57Bl/6J strain for >10 generations at the Columbia University animal facility. Age-matched wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were used as controls (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). RAGE-null mice are viable, and display normal development and reproductive capacity. We found no differences in pre-ischemic body weight and blood glucose levels among RAGE-null and control animals. Toth et al. (29Toth C. Schmidt A.M. Tuor U.I. Francis G. Foniok T. Brussee V. Kaur J. Yan S.F. Martinez J.A. Barber P.A. Buchan A. Zochodne D.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 445-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) recently described normal brain weight and no white matter abnormalities in RAGE-null mice. Mice carrying conditional Hif-1α floxed alleles (Hif-1αF/F) were generously provided by Dr. Randal Johnson (University of California, San Diego). These animals (C57Bl/6 genetic background) were generated by engineering loxP sites flanking exon 2 of the Hif-1α gene as described previously (30Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar).Induction of Unilateral Cerebral Hypoxia-ischemia Damage—Hypoxia-ischemia was induced in male RAGE-null or wild-type mice (12–15 weeks) as described previously (31Vannucci S.J. Willing L.B. Goto S. Alkayed N.J. Brucklacher R.M. Wood T.L. Towfighi J. Hurn P.D. Simpson I.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Zhang L. Nair A. Krady K. Corpe C. Bonneau R.H. Simpson I.A. Vannucci S.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% induction, 1.5% maintenance), and the right common carotid artery was isolated and double ligated with 4-0 surgical silk. The incision was sutured, and animals were allowed to recover with access to food and water for 2 h. Then, animals were exposed to hypoxia (30 min) in custom-designed plexiglass chambers individually equipped with oxygen and temperature sensors (OxyCycler A-series, BioSpherix, Redfield, NY). Oxygen levels during hypoxic exposure were monitored and controlled at a constant concentration of 8% O2 balanced with nitrogen. Chamber temperature was maintained at 35 °C; preliminary experiments showed that at this temperature, the animals rectal temperature was 37 °C. After hypoxia, animals were allowed to recover at normoxia for 30 min in the chambers, and then returned to their cages. Animals were euthanized at 6 h to 5 days of recovery. The duration of systemic hypoxia was chosen to assure consistent injury in 80% of the animals and low mortality rate by 48 h of recovery. Animals with right common carotid artery ligation without hypoxia were used as sham-operated controls.Systemic Hypoxia—C57Bl6J male mice (12 weeks old) were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (10% O2 balanced with nitrogen) for 24 and 48 h (BioSpherix) with access to food and water. Littermate controls were kept under normoxia in a similar chamber for the duration of the experiment. Animals were sacrificed immediately after hypoxia.Infarct Volume and Immunohistochemistry—Brains were quickly removed from the skull and frozen in dry ice-chilled isopentane (–30 °C). Coronal sections (25 μm) were cut serially in a Leica cryostat and mounted on superfrost slides (VWR). The extent of brain infarction was identified using cresyl violet staining; the infarcted area was determined indirectly by subtracting the area of healthy tissue in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the area of the contralateral hemisphere. Infarction volume was calculated by integration of infarct areas measured in 12 equidistant sections (at 250-μm intervals) encompassing the entire lesion. For immunohistochemistry, sections were fixed with ice-cold methanol (–80 °C), incubated with PBS containing 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10% (w/v) normal serum for 2 h. Subsequently, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rat polyclonal antibody against RAGE (1:100; R&D Systems). RAGE-positive cells were visualized with secondary biotinylated anti-rat antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Molecular Probes). Sections were subsequently double-stained for the neuronal specific nuclear protein NeuN (1:200, Chemicon) using the Vector M.O.M. Immunodetection kit. An additional group of sections were double stained with the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, using a polyclonal rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (1:400; Dako) and a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with fluorescein (1:100; Invitrogen). Staining was analyzed and documented using an Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with AxioVision software. The specificity of RAGE immunohistochemistry was confirmed by showing negligible staining in the ischemic RAGE-null mouse brain (not shown).Cell Culture and Treatments—Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of wild-type C57Bl/6J or homozygote conditional floxed HIF-1α (HIF-1αF/F) mouse embryos (E15), according to the protocol described by Chavez et al. (33Chavez J.C. Baranova O. Lin J. Pichiule P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9471-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected cortices were dissociated in Earl's balance salt solution containing papain (50 units/ml) and DNase I (100 units/ml). Cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated plates under serum-free conditions using Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, glutamine (2 mm), glutamate (25 μm), and β-mercapthoethanol (25 mm) (Invitrogen). On the fourth day of plating, one-half of the medium was replaced with glutamate-free B27/Neurobasal medium, and subsequently cultures were fed every 4 days with glutamate-free medium. These cultures contain >90% neurons as determined by microtubule-associated protein-2 cytochemistry. Experiments were performed in neurons at days 10–15 in vitro unless otherwise indicated. 3T3 NIH cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum. Primary neurons were stimulated with bovine brain S100B protein (Calbiochem), desferrioxamine (Sigma), or dimethyloxalglycine (Sigma) freshly dissolved in PBS at the indicated concentrations. RAGE-blocking antibody (Ab-RAGE) was provided by Dr. A. M. Schmidt (Columbia University, New York).Hypoxia and Oxygen Glucose Deprivation—A custom-made temperature controlled hypoxic/anaerobic glove-box system was used (Coy Laboratories, MI). This system is equipped with an inverted microscope that allows visual inspection of cell viability before terminating each experiment. For hypoxia treatments, the system was set up at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 0.5% O2, 5%CO2, and 94% N2, and all solutions were pre-equilibrated for at least 12 h before each experiment. Cells were transferred into the chamber, washed with PBS, and incubated with fresh media for up to 24 h in a humidified internal incubator. At the end of hypoxia, cell harvesting and lysis were performed within the chamber. In agreement with a previous report (33Chavez J.C. Baranova O. Lin J. Pichiule P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9471-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), this degree of hypoxia did not produce cell death (data not shown). For oxygen-glucose deprivation, the glovebox system was set up at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% H2, 90% N2 (anaerobic). Neurons were transferred into the chamber, washed with PBS, and incubated with a pre-equilibrated glucose-free balance salt solution for up to 60 min. At the end of the procedure, cells were removed from the chamber, fresh Neurobasal media was added (reperfusion), and cultures were returned to a regular incubator. At different periods of reperfusion, neurons were harvested for immunoblot analysis, and cell death was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay following the manufacturer's protocol (CellTiter 96® Assay, Promega, Madison, WI). For experimental controls, cultures were subjected to the same procedures but maintained at normoxia with glucose-containing media in a standard cell culture incubator.Adenoviral Vector Construction and Transduction—A nonreplicative adenovirus in which the Cre recombinase gene is under the regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter was obtained from Vector Biolabs. Reporter adenovirus encoding green fluorescence protein (AdGFP) was used as control. For adenoviral transduction, cortical neurons derived from homozygous Hif-1αF/F mice were prepared as described above. At day 6 in vitro, cells were infected with AdCre or AdGFP at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Significant deletion of floxed HIF-1α alleles by AdCre infection was accomplished at 7 days post-infection as determined by Western blot. Adenoviral infection with either AdCre or AdGFP did not affect neuronal viability (data not shown).Preparation of Tissue and Whole Cell Lysates—Right and left hemispheres were dissected from ischemic brains and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer using ice-cold lysis RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C), and supernatants were collected for immunoblots. For the preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min). The resulting cell pellet was subsequently processed as described above. In all cases, protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by standard procedures. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-RAGE (Santa Cruz), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz), anti-HIF-1α (R&D), and anti-HIF-1β (Novus Biologicals Littleton, CO). After washing, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Results were visualized and quantified with Kodak Image Station 4000. Membranes were stripped and reprobed as needed.Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA from cell cultures or brain samples was extracted using RNgents® Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript III system with oligo(dT) (18Ma L. Carter R.J. Morton A.J. Nicholson L.F. Brain Res. 2003; 966: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) primer (Invitrogen, CA). Real time PCR analysis was performed using 0.5 μl of the final cDNA synthesis mixture and mouse specific TaqMan-based gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). The following assays were employed: Advanced glycation end products (Ager) (Mm00545815_m1), vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) (Mm00437304_m1), erythropoietin (Epo) (Mm00433126_ m1), and β-actin (Mn00607939_s1). The PCR was carried out in an ABI 7500 real time PCR thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, CA). All reactions were performed in duplicate and independently repeated at least three times. Results were normalized to β-actin, and expressed as -fold increase relative to control.DNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Crude nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (33Chavez J.C. Baranova O. Lin J. Pichiule P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9471-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and used for EMSA to detect HIF-1 binding activity. All probes were commercially generated (Invitrogen), annealed, and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. After incubation of probes with nuclear extracts (5 μg of proteins), DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide gels, and the signal was visualized using a phosphorimager (FujiFilm). Supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear extract with 1 μg of monoclonal HIF-1α antibody on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. The sequences of the sense strands of the oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-gcctggacacgtgggtttcttagcct-3′ (RAGE-Wt, –1071/–1052, contains a putative HIF-1 binding site), 5′-gcctggacaaaagggtttcttagcct-3′ (RAGE-Mut), 5′-gccctacgtgctgtctca-3′ (Epo-Wt), and 5′-gccctaaaagctgtctca-3′ (Epo-Mut).Generation of Promoter Constructs, Transient Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assays—A fragment containing the 5′-flanking region (∼2000 bp) of the mouse Rage gene was generated from mouse genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-attgctagcgggaggtcagatatacagtc-3′ and reverse, 5′-attaagcttccatctcccatctcgttc-3′. This product was cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega), and the generated plasmid was designated pRAGE-luc1. Three additional RAGE promoter constructs (pRAGE-luc2, pRAGE-luc3, and pRAGE-luc4) were generated using the same downstream primer as for pRAGE-luc1 and the following NheI site-containing upstream primers: F2 (attgctagcccagagatgccaaaaatgg), F3 (attgctagcttgagaagtaagagccaaa), and F4 (attgctagctgaactcagtgattttgaa). In the pRAGE-mutHRE construct, the putative HRE of pRAGE-luc1 was replaced from 5′-ACGTG-3′ to 5′-AAAAG-3′ using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. 3T3 NIH cells at about 90% confluence in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid (0.5 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. To correct for variable transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with the pRL-SV40 vector (0.05 μg) encoding the Renilla luciferase gene. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in fresh medium, and then treated with desferrioxamine (DFO) (100 μm), dimethyloxalglycine (DMOG) (300 μm), or subjected to 0.5% O2. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined with a multiwell luminescence reader (Molecular Devices), by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin"
https://openalex.org/W2107927699,"Recent identifications of associations between novel variants in inflammation-related genes and several common diseases emphasize the need for systematic evaluations of these genes in disease susceptibility. Considering that many genes are involved in the complex inflammation responses and many genetic variants in these genes have the potential to alter the functions and expression of these genes, we assembled a list of key inflammation-related genes to facilitate the identification of genetic associations of diseases with an inflammation-related etiology. We first reviewed various phases of inflammation responses, including the development of immune cells, sensing of danger, influx of cells to sites of insult, activation and functional responses of immune and non-immune cells, and resolution of the immune response. Assisted by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we then identified 17 functional sub-pathways that are involved in one or multiple phases. This organization would greatly increase the chance of detecting gene-gene interactions by hierarchical clustering of genes with their functional closeness in a pathway. Finally, as an example application, we have developed tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) arrays for populations of European and African descent to capture all the common variants of these key inflammation-related genes. Assays of these tSNPs have been designed and assembled into two Affymetrix ParAllele customized chips, one each for European (12,011 SNPs) and African (21,542 SNPs) populations. These tSNPs have greater coverage for these inflammation-related genes compared to the existing genome-wide arrays, particularly in the African population. These tSNP arrays can facilitate systematic evaluation of inflammation pathways in disease susceptibility. For additional applications, other genotyping platforms could also be employed. For existing genome-wide association data, this list of key inflammation-related genes and associated subpathways can facilitate comprehensive inflammation pathway- focused association analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2134406194,"The use of platinum complexes for the therapy of breast cancer is an emerging new treatment modality. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in breast cancer, we used estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells as a model system. We generated cisplatin-resistant MCF-7 cells and determined the functional status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways by phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase and phospho-MAPK arrays. The cisplatin-resistant MCF-7 cells are characterized by increased EGFR phosphorylation, high levels of AKT1 kinase activity, and ERK1 phosphorylation. In contrast, the JNK and p38 MAPK modules of the MAPK signaling pathway were inactive. These conditions were associated with inactivation of the p53 pathway and increased BCL-2 expression. We investigated the expression of genes encoding the ligands for the ERBB signaling cascade and found a selective up-regulation of amphiregulin expression, which occurred at later stages of cisplatin resistance development. Amphiregulin is a specific ligand of the EGFR (ERBB1) and a potent mitogen for epithelial cells. After exposure to cisplatin, the resistant MCF-7 cells secreted amphiregulin protein over extended periods of time, and knockdown of amphiregulin expression by specific short interfering RNA resulted in a nearly complete reversion of the resistant phenotype. To demonstrate the generality and importance of our findings, we examined amphiregulin expression and cisplatin resistance in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and found a highly significant correlation. In contrast, amphiregulin levels did not significantly correlate with cisplatin resistance in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. We have thus identified a novel function of amphiregulin for cisplatin resistance in human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087231535,"Background Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is usually asymptomatic and associated with high mortality. Adverse clinical outcome of TAA is preventable by elective surgical repair; however, identifying at-risk individuals is difficult. We hypothesized that gene expression patterns in peripheral blood cells may correlate with TAA disease status. Our goal was to identify a distinct gene expression signature in peripheral blood that may identify individuals at risk for TAA. Methods and Findings Whole genome gene expression profiles from 94 peripheral blood samples (collected from 58 individuals with TAA and 36 controls) were analyzed. Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) identified potential signature genes characterizing TAA vs. normal, ascending vs. descending TAA, and sporadic vs. familial TAA. Using a training set containing 36 TAA patients and 25 controls, a 41-gene classification model was constructed for detecting TAA status and an overall accuracy of 78±6% was achieved. Testing this classifier on an independent validation set containing 22 TAA samples and 11 controls yielded an overall classification accuracy of 78%. These 41 classifier genes were further validated by TaqMan® real-time PCR assays. Classification based on the TaqMan® data replicated the microarray results and achieved 80% classification accuracy on the testing set. Conclusions This study identified informative gene expression signatures in peripheral blood cells that can characterize TAA status and subtypes of TAA. Moreover, a 41-gene classifier based on expression signature can identify TAA patients with high accuracy. The transcriptional programs in peripheral blood leading to the identification of these markers also provide insights into the mechanism of development of aortic aneurysms and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The classifier genes identified in this study, and validated by TaqMan® real-time PCR, define a set of promising potential diagnostic markers, setting the stage for a blood-based gene expression test to facilitate early detection of TAA."
https://openalex.org/W2034184190,"One of the major hurdles of cellular therapies for the treatment of liver failure is the low availability of functional human hepatocytes. While embryonic stem (ES) cells represent a potential cell source for therapy, current methods for differentiation result in mixed cell populations or low yields of the cells of interest. Here we describe a rapid, direct differentiation method that yields a homogeneous population of endoderm-like cells with 95% purity. Mouse ES cells cultured on top of collagen-sandwiched hepatocytes differentiated and proliferated into a uniform and homogeneous cell population of endoderm-like cells. The endoderm-like cell population was positive for Foxa2, Sox17, and AFP and could be further differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells, demonstrating hepatic morphology, functionality, and gene and protein expression. Incorporating the hepatocyte-like cells into a bioartificial liver device to treat fulminant hepatic failure improved animal survival, thereby underscoring the therapeutic potential of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981401922,"Background/Purpose Genetic variation in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene has been recently identified as an important determinant of plasma LDL-cholesterol and severity of coronary heart disease. We studied whether the PCSK9 gene is linked to the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) and with the development of intracranial atherosclerosis. Methods/Results The pivotal E670G polymorphism, tagging an important haplotype of the PCSK9 gene, was genotyped in two independent studies. The Belgium Stroke Study included 237 middle aged (45–60) Belgian patients, with small-vessel occlusion (SVO) and large-vessel atherosclerosis stroke (LVA), and 326 gender and ethnicity matched controls (>60 yrs) without a history of stroke. In multivariate analysis the minor allele (G) carriers appeared as a significant predictor of LVA (OR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.25–9.85; p = 0.017). In a Finnish crossectional population based consecutive autopsy series of 604 males and females (mean age 62.5 years), G-allele carriers tended to have more severe allele copy number-dependent (p = 0.095) atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis and in its branches. Conclusion Our findings in this unique combination of clinical and autopsy data, provide evidence that PCSK9 gene associates with the risk of LVA stroke subtype, and suggest that the risk is mediated by the severity of intracranial atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985836613,"Toxicity in amyloid diseases is intimately linked to the nature of aggregates, with early oligomeric species believed to be more cytotoxic than later fibrillar aggregates. Yet mechanistic understanding of how aggregating species evolve with time is currently lacking. We have explored the aggregation process of a chimera composed of a globular protein (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein, CRABP) and huntingtin exon 1 with polyglutamine tracts either above (Q53) or below (Q20) the pathological threshold using Escherichia coli cells as a model intracellular environment. Previously we showed that fusion of the huntingtin exon 1 sequence with >40Q led to structural perturbation and decreased stability of CRABP (Ignatova, Z., and Gierasch, L. M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 12959-12967). Here we report that the Q53 chimera aggregates in cells via a multistep process: early stage aggregates are spherical and detergent-soluble, characteristics of prefibrillar aggregates, and appear to be dominated structurally by CRABP, in that they can promote aggregation of a CRABP variant but not oligoglutamine aggregation, and the CRABP domain is relatively sequestered based on its protection from proteolysis. Late stage aggregates appear to be dominated by polyGln; they are fibrillar, detergent-resistant, capable of seeding aggregation of oligoglutamine but not the CRABP variant, and show relative protection of the polyglutamine-exon1 domain from proteolysis. These results point to an evolution of the dominant sequences in intracellular aggregates and may provide molecular insight into origins of toxic prefibrillar aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1970706410,"Background Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites is a leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate. Protection of Aotus monkeys after vaccination with AMA1 correlates with antibody responses. Study Design/Results A randomized, controlled, double-blind phase 1 clinical trial was conducted in 54 healthy Malian adults living in an area of intense seasonal malaria transmission to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the AMA1-C1 malaria vaccine. AMA1-C1 contains an equal mixture of yeast-expressed recombinant proteins based on sequences from the FVO and 3D7 clones of P. falciparum, adsorbed on Alhydrogel. The control vaccine was the hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax). Participants were enrolled into 1 of 3 dose cohorts (n = 18 per cohort) and randomized 2∶1 to receive either AMA1-C1 or Recombivax. Participants in the first, second, and third cohorts randomized to receive AMA1-C1 were vaccinated with 5, 20 and 80 µg of AMA1-C1, respectively. Vaccinations were administered on days 0, 28, and 360, and participants were followed until 6 months after the final vaccination. AMA1-C1 was well tolerated; no vaccine-related severe or serious adverse events were observed. AMA1 antibody responses to the 80 µg dose increased rapidly from baseline levels by days 14 and 28 after the first vaccination and continued to increase after the second vaccination. After a peak 14 days following the second vaccination, antibody levels decreased to baseline levels one year later at the time of the third vaccination that induced little or no increase in antibody levels. Conclusions Although the AMA1-C1 vaccine candidate was well-tolerated and induced antibody responses to both vaccine and non-vaccine alleles, the antibody response after a third dose given at one year was lower than the response to the initial vaccinations. Additionally, post-vaccination increases in anti-AMA1 antibody levels were not associated with significant changes in in vitro growth inhibition of P. falciparum.

Although the maximal peak amplitude of the Ca2+ transients during K+ depolarization was similar for WT and MH in both external buffers, the rate of decay of the sustained phase of the transient during K+ depolarization (decay rate) in Ca+ was 50% slower for MH. This difference was eliminated in Ca–, and the relative decay rates were faster for both genotypes than in Ca+. The integrated Ca2+ transient in Ca–compared with Ca+ was reduced by 50–60% for MH and 20% for WT. The decay rate was not affected by [K+] × [Cl–] product or NiCl2 (2 mm) supplementation of Ca–. The addition of La2+ (0.1 mm), or SKF 96365 (20 μm) to Ca+ significantly accelerated decay rates for both WT and MH, but their effect was significantly greater in MH. Nifedipine (1 μm) had no effect, suggesting that the mechanism for this difference was not a reduction in L-type Ca2+ channel Ca2+ current. These data strongly suggest: 1) the decay rate in skeletal myotubes is related in part to Ca2+ entry through the ECCE channel; 2) the MH mutations enhance ECCE compared with wild type; and 3) the increased Ca2+ entry might play a significant role in the pathophysiology of MH.

These two proteins align during development at the junction of the t-tubule with the terminal cisternae of the SR (1Flucher B.E. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The DHPR is responsible for activating RyR1 causing Ca2+ release from the SR (5Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; 242: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 6Marty I. Robert M.

Although the exact signal transduction mechanisms between DHPR and RyR1 are still unknown, it is generally accepted that intramembrane charge movements and conformational changes in the DHPR II-III loop couple the T tubule depolarization and Ca2+ release from the SR (orthograde conformational coupling) (5Schneider M.F.

It is this massive release of Ca2+ from the SR into the cytosol, and not a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, that is conventionally thought to initiate a series of Ca2+-dependent events that results in force generation (10Anderson K.

However, the role of extracellular Ca2+ on EC coupling in mammalian skeletal muscle has been re-examined (15Berridge M.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Several groups have demonstrated that stimuli that deplete Ca2+ in the SR enhance Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane by a mechanism referred as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (16Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Ma J. Pan Z. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ entry through SOCE is easily seen, identification of the channel(s) responsible still awaits discovery. It is highly likely that the mechanism for this entry is at least partially if not completely derived from current passing though Orai 1, 2, and/or 3, which is activated by translocation of Stim 1 or Stim 2 from the SR (18Huang G.N.

In addition to SOCE, a new mechanism for Ca2+ entry has recently been described in skeletal myotubes (24Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc.

Activation of this Ca2+ entry pathway depends on interaction among three different Ca2+ channels: the DHPR, RyR1, and an unidentified Ca2+ influx pathway through the plasma membrane that was termed excitation-coupled Ca2+ entry (ECCE) (24Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15793-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal pharmacogenetic syndrome in which exposure to volatile anesthetics or depolarizing neuromuscular blockers triggers a robust intracellular Ca2+ release through RyR1 from the SR, inducing a cascade of biochemical events that if untreated results in muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and lethal hyperthermia (26Nelson T.E. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Treves S. Anderson A.A. Ducreux S. Divet A. Bleunven C. Grasso C. Paesante S. Zorzato F. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2005; 15: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This syndrome has been associated with a dysfunction of resting intracellular Ca2+ regulation. To date, about 112 mutations within the gene that codes for type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) have been found on chromosome 19 (28Robinson R. Carpenter D. Shaw M.A. Halsall J. Hopkins P. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and two mutations in the α1s subunit of the DHPR found on chromosome 1 have been associated with MH (29Jurkat-Rott K. McCarthy T. Lehmann-Horn F. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 4-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To examine the possible role of abnormal sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry during MH, myotubes expressing mutations R615C, R2163C, and T48261, (collectively termed MHRyR1s) were exposed to supermaximal concentrations of KCl (60 mm K+) in the presence (Ca+) and absence (Ca–) of extracellular Ca2+. In addition, we also conducted experiments in the presence or absence of Ca2+ after the addition of NiCl2, nifedipine, La3+, or SKF 96365 in an attempt to identify, or if not to identify at least to characterize, the entry pathway. The results strongly suggest that the accentuated Ca2+ transients seen in myotubes expressing MHRyR1s after KCl depolarization that we previously reported (30Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were the result of a more robust sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry and not an increased SR Ca2+ release in response to depolarization. This difference potentially plays a role in the pathophysiology of the MH syndrome. Construction and Expression of MHRyR1 cDNAs—A detailed explanation of construction and expression of the MHRyR1s (R615C, R2163C, and T48261) used in the present study has been previously described (30Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All of the mutated and WTRyR1 cDNAs were packaged into HSV1 virions using a helper virus-free packaging system (31Fraefel C. Song S. Lim F. Lang P. Yu L. Wang Y. Wild P. Geller A.I. J.

Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Calcium Imaging of Myotubes—Differentiated myotubes were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) at 37 °C, for 20 min in imaging buffer. The cells were then washed three times with imaging buffer (IB), transferred to a Nikon TE2000 microscope. Fluo-4 was excited at 494 nm with an argon light source, and fluorescence emission was measured at 516 nm using a 40 × 1.3na objective. The data were collected with an intensified 12-bit digital intensified CCD at 30 fps (Stanford Photonics, Stanford, CA) from regions consisting of 2–12 individual cells and analyzed using QED software (QED, Pittsburgh PA). We used the average fluorescence of the calcium transient (area under the curve) to compare responses. Individual response amplitudes were calculated in the following way: the cumulative fluorescence during the 30 s challenge (Ar) minus the average base-line fluorescence for the 10 s immediately prior to the challenge (Ab) was divided by Ab and then multiplied by 100. To compare different experiments, individual response amplitudes were normalized to the peak amplitude of the transient obtained in the same cell. The peak amplitude of a transient refers to the highest fluorescence value during the stimulation time minus the average base-line fluorescence for the 10 s immediately prior to the challenge. Solutions—Ionic compositions of Ca2+-replete imaging buffer (Ca+) with and without K+ (40 or 60 mm) are shown in Table 1. In KCl solutions, NaCl concentrations were adjusted to maintain a total ionic strength (Na+ concentration ([Na+]) + K+ concentration ([K+]) at 130 mm, but the product of [K+] × [Cl–] changes with different concentrations of KCl. In K2SO4 solutions, K2SO4 was used to increase [K+], and Na2SO4 was used to replace NaCl to maintain the [K+] × [Cl–] product at 670 and [Na+] + [K+] at 130 (the same values as Ca+). All nominally Ca2+-free buffers (Ca–) were prepared using the same protocol as the corresponding regular solutions but without CaCl2 added. Caffeine, NiCl2, nifedipine, LaCl3, and SKF96365 solutions were prepared by adding these compounds directly into either of the external buffers as well as the corresponding KCl solutions. Because of frequent trace Ca2+ contamination in other chemicals, residual free Ca2+ concentrations in Ca–(same composition as Ca+, but no Ca2+ added) and 60 mm Ca2+-free KCl solution (60KCl–Ca) were measured using Ca2+-selective microelectrodes and were ∼0.8 and ∼1.0 μm, respectively.TABLE 1Composition of buffer solutionsCa2+ replete buffer (Ca+)40 mm KCl (40KCl)60 mm KCl (60KCl)60 mm Ca2+-free KCl (60KCl-Ca)20 mm K2SO4 (20K2SO4)30 mm K2SO4 (30K2SO4)NaCl (mm)12590707012.757.17KCl (mm)5406060MgSO4 (mm)1.21.21.21.21.21.2Hepes (pH 7.4) (mm)252525252525Glucose (mm)666666CaCl2 (mm)22222Na2SO4 (mm)38.62531.415K2SO4 (mm)2030[Na+] + [K+]130130130130130130[K+] × [Cl-]670536080408040670670 Open table in a new tab Determination of Threshold for Maximum Ca2+ Transient in Response to KCl—From our previous studies we had determined that 50 mm [K+]o was sufficient to produce the maximum peak Ca2+ transient in myotubes (30Yang T.

However, to make certain that our previous observations did not diverge from the measurements performed in the present study, we measured the magnitude of Ca2+ transients in myotubes expressing WT RyR1 produced by challenges with 40, 60, 80, and 100 mm [K+]o applied in a random order. Statistics—All of the values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Prism software (version 4.0b) was used for statistical analysis (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA; www.graphpad.com). Student's t tests, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey's multiple comparison tests were used to compare the response sizes and peak amplitudes. Effect of Extracellular Ca2+ on KCl-induced Ca2+ Transients—A significant observation in our previous study (30Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was that dyspedic 1B5 myotubes expressing MHRyR1s consistently exhibited Ca2+ transients (area under the curve) in response to 60 mm KCl (60KCl) that were greater than those in myotubes expressing WTRyR1. The selection of 60 mm [K+]o to induce Ca2+ transients in WTRyR1 and MHRyR1 myotubes for this study was based both on our results obtained from the dose-response relationship measured in WT myotubes (Fig. 1) and previously published data (33Hodgkin A.L. Horowicz P. J. Physiol. 1960; 153: 386-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 34Caputo C. Bolanos P. J. Physiol. 1994; 481: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The collective results from these studies show that in muscle fibers the amount of membrane depolarization caused by >50 mm [K+]o will elicit an elevation of myoplasmic [Ca2+] above the level required to saturate the contractile apparatus. Closer examination of data from our previous study revealed differences in the shapes of the Ca2+ transients induced by K+ between WTRyR1 and each of the seven MHRyR1s. Although there was no difference in the peak amplitude between the two groups, all MHRyR1 Ca2+ transients had a slower rate of decay than WTRyR1 Ca2+ transients (Fig. 1A, inset) and accounted for the greater areas under the Ca2+ transients elicited by 60KCl in myotubes expressing MHRyR1s. To determine whether Ca2+ entry contributed to the slower decline of the Ca2+ transient in myotubes expressing MHRyR1s during KCl depolarization, we increased the duration of depolarization from 10 s as it was in the previous study (30Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to 30 s to record their rates of decay of the sustained phase of the transient and increased the interval between two 60KCl challenges from 50 s (30Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to 3 min to permit the myotubes to return to their original resting intracellular free Ca2+ concentration between responses. As shown in Fig. 2A, the 1B5 myotubes expressing WTRyR1 or each of three common MHRyR1s (R615C, R2163C, and T4826I from RyR1 gene “hot spots” I, II, and III, respectively) were sequentially exposed to 60KCl, 60KCl–Ca, and 60KCl using the protocol described above. Consistent with our previous observation (2Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), all three types of MH myotubes demonstrated transients with much slower decay rates of the sustained phase of the transient during 60KCl depolarization compared with those expressing WTRyR1. Prior to exposure to 60KCl, the Ca+ replete buffer was exchanged with nominally Ca2+-free (Ca–) buffer for 5 s. The decay rate of the sustained phase of the Ca2+ transient during exposure to 60KCl–Ca was accelerated for all four types (one WT and three MH) of myotubes and was more rapid in all groups than the rate obtained from WTRyR1 depolarized in Ca+ buffer. On the other hand, the peak amplitude of the response was not significantly different for all three KCl exposures. In addition the ratio of the peak amplitude to the amplitude at 30 s in Ca2+-free medium (pure RyR1 Ca2+ release) was not different between cells expressing WTRyR1 compared with those expressing any of the three MHRyR1s. After 3 min of rest, the rate of decay of the sustained phase of the Ca2+ transient after the third 60KCl exposure was essentially the same as the first 60KCl response in both WTRyR1 and MHRyR1 myotubes. Therefore, the increased rate of decay seen during the 60KCl–Ca response was not the result of progressive store depletion in either group. Superimposing the first 60KCl response with the 60KCl–Ca response in the same myotube clearly showed the pronounced difference in their decay rate in the presence and the absence of external Ca2+. Importantly the relative increase in the decay rate in Ca–was much greater for all MHRyR1s than for WTRyR1. Comparison of the response sizes (Fig. 2B) demonstrated that 1) all three groups of MH myotubes had significantly larger total Ca2+ responses (p < 0.01) to 60KCl compared with WTRyR1, 2) the response sizes to 60KCl–Ca were significantly smaller than those to 60KCl in both WT and MH myotubes, and 3) the peak and total response sizes to 60KCl–Ca for WTRyR1 and MHRyR1 myotubes was the same. The ratio of the 60KCl–Ca response size to the 60KCl (Fig. 2C) response size for each of the three MHRyR1s was significantly (p < 0.01) less than that for WTRyR1 (42.6 ± 3.9, 48.6 ± 1.6, and 52.0 ± 3.3% for R615CRyR1, R2163CRyR1, and T4826IRyR1, respectively, versus 80.5 ± 4.6%, for WTRyR1), reflecting the difference in the rate of decay during depolarization for MHRyR1s (for superimposed normalized responses, see Fig. 2A). Because of the similarity in the ratios of these three MH mutations in their slower rate of decay compared with WTRyR1, we randomly picked T4826I for further investigation for the possible mechanisms for this difference. It is well known that extracellular [Cl–] also contributes to the membrane potential of frog muscle fibers when extracellular [K+] and [Cl–] were changed reciprocally to keep a constant product (35Hodgkin A.L. Horowicz P. J. Physiol. 1959; 148: 127-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In our 60 mm KCl solution both [K+] and [Cl–] were increased, substantially increasing the product of [K+] × [Cl–], compared with Ca+ buffers without KCl (Table 1). Thus it was theoretically possible that the responses to 60KCl we observed could have been affected by a Cl– overload. To rule this in or out, we exposed WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1 myotubes to 60 mm KCl, whose [K+] × [Cl–] product in the buffer was the same as Ca+ buffer. Comparison of the shape and response sizes after depolarization with these two K+ solutions ([K+] × [Cl–] not constant versus [K+] × [Cl–] constant) showed that they were not significantly different from one another (Fig. 3A). It has also been demonstrated in single frog muscle fibers that removing extracellular Ca2+ to levels identical with that used for our Ca–experiments resulted in a slight membrane depolarization (9 ± 2 mV) and potentiation of twitch responses (12Caputo C. Gimenez M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 2177-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ni2+ for missing Ca2+ in extracellular solutions resolved this problem (36Fischman D.A. Swan R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 1709-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To examine this as a possible mechanism for the differences we observed between WTRyR1 and MHRyR1, we prepared 60KClNi solution by adding 2 mm NiCl2 to the 60KCl–Ca solution. Myotubes expressing T4826IRyR1 were exposed to 60KCl, 60KCl–Ca, 60KClNi and 60KCl sequentially (Fig. 3B). As observed before, the rate of decay of the Ca2+ transient in response to 60KCl–Ca depolarization was accelerated compared with the 60KCl response. Addition of 2 mm NiCl2 (60KCl–Ca+Ni) did not slow the accelerated rate of decay. However, the slow rate of decay of the sustained phase of KCl responses in T4826IRyR1 myotubes was restored in Ca+ buffer (Fig. 3B). Effects of Ca2+ Entry Blockers on Depolarization-induced Ca2+ Entry—To better define the mechanism for the enhanced Ca2+ entry caused by depolarization of cells with MHRyR1 mutations, we used a pharmacologic library to attempt to block the response. To do this, we chose (0.1 mm) lanthanum chloride (La3+; a nonspecific Ca2+ entry blocker (37Goodman F.R. Weiss G.B. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1974; 209: 14-25PubMed Google Scholar)), 20 μm SKF 96365 (a SOCE and TRP channel blocker (38Leung Y.M. Kwan C.Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 81: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that has also been shown to block cation influx attributable to ECCE (24Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15793-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)), and 1 μm nifedipine (the selective L-type Ca2+ channel blocker (39Chen W. Hui C.S. J. Physiol. 1991; 444: 579-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, La3+ (0.1 mm) added 10 s after 60KCl exposure immediately accelerated the decay rate of the sustained phase of the Ca2+ transients for both WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1 myotubes (responses labeled #2 for WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1). The 60KCl responses (responses labeled #3) with La3+ (0.1 mm) added 5 s before KCl exposure demonstrated a more significantly accelerated decay rate of the sustained phase for both WT and T4826IRyR1 myotubes, which is better illustrated by superimposed normalized traces on the right side of Fig. 4A. The last 60KCl responses (responses labeled #4) in the absence of extracellular La3+ partially restored the slower decay rate of the sustained phase in both WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1 myotubes, although the recovery was not complete compared with the #1 responses. The ratio of response sizes of 60KCl + La3+ (responses labeled #3) to 60KCl (responses labeled #1) (Fig. 4B) is significantly smaller (p < 0.01) for T4826I (64.7 ± 3.1%) compared with WT (85.3 ± 3.6%), indicating that a significantly larger portion of the 60KCl response in T4826IRyR1 myotubes was diminished by La3+ compared with WTRyR1. Of note, no change in the peak amplitude of the KCl responses was observed with the sequential KCl stimulations. The decay rate of the sustained phase of the Ca2+ transient during KCl depolarization was drastically accelerated in both WT and T4826I myotubes by 20 μm SKF 96365 (responses labeled #2 in Fig. 5A). Removing SKF 96365 prior to the next 60KCl stimulation restored the slower decay of sustained phase to pre-exposure rates in T4826I myotubes. 20 μm of SKF 96365 appears to accelerate the decay rate instantaneously (Fig. 5A, inset), and the ratios of response #2 to response #1 sizes for WT and T4826I are 72.8 ± 3.2 and 49.0 ± 3.9%, respectively, which suggests a more significant effect (p < 0.01) of SKF 96365 on T4826I myotubes compared with WT myotubes (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the response #2 to response #1 ratios for the SKF 96365 effect tended to be smaller than even those for 60KCl–Ca shown in Fig. 2 (80.5 ± 4.6 and 52.0 ± 3.3% for WT and T4826I, respectively). Nifedipine administered 5 s before 60KClNif (60KCl containing 1 μm nifedipine) stimulation (#2 responses in Fig. 6A) had no significant effect on the sustained phase in either WT or MH myotubes compared with the corresponding control #1 responses. Caffeine-induced Ca2+ Transient Is Not Mediated by Sarcolemmal Ca2+ Entry—To investigate whether the presence of extracellular Ca2+ has any effect on the Ca2+ transient elicited by direct RyR1 activators, 20 mm caffeine was used to stimulate Ca2+ release from SR from myotubes expressing WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1, using the same experimental protocol (Fig. 7A). In contrast to the KCl responses shown before, the responses to regular 20 mm caffeine (20caff) and Ca2+-free 20 mm caffeine (20caff–Ca) were identical in both WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1 myotubes. These similarities were clearly illustrated when the normalized data were superimposed. Interestingly, the peak amplitude of the caffeine responses decreased significantly with sequential caffeine successive caffeine challenges and was independent of external Ca2+ (Fig. 7B). As a result, the response sizes showed a similar decrease in both WTRyR1 and T4826IRyR1 myotubes (Fig. 7C). When the peak amplitudes and response sizes for the first 20caff response and the 20caff–Ca response were superimposed (Fig. 7D), the decreases in peak amplitude were coincident with the decrease in response size (area under the curve) for both genotypes, suggesting that the decreased response size to 20caff–Ca resulted from decreased peak amplitude rather than a change in the sustained phase. These observations are also born out when the cells are stimulated with caffeine in the presence of SKF 96365. (Fig. 7E). Neither W"

Aim: to determine if factors mediating proposed mechanisms for severe bronchiolitis differ with severity of disease. Methodology/Principle Findings 197 infants admitted to hospital with hRSV bronchiolitis were recruited and grouped according to no oxygen requirement (n = 27), oxygen dependence (n = 114) or mechanical ventilation (n = 56). We collected clinical data, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and if ventilated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), substance P (SP), interleukin 9 (IL-9), urea and hRSV load, were measured in cell free supernatant from NPA and BAL. Multivariate analysis compared independent effects of clinical, virological and immunological variables upon disease severity. IFN-γ and SP concentrations were lower in NPA from infants who required oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Viral load and IL-9 concentrations were high but did not vary with severity of disease. Independent predictors of severe disease (in diminishing size of effect) were low weight on admission, low gestation at birth, low NPA IFN-γ and NPA SP. Nasal airway sampling appears to be a useful surrogate for distal airway sampling since concentrations of IFN-γ, SP, IL-9 and viral load in NPA correlate with the same in BAL. Conclusions Our data support two proposed mechanisms for severe hRSV disease; reduced local IFN-γ response and SP mediated inflammation. We found large amounts of hRSV and IL-9 in airways secretions from the upper and lower respiratory tract but could not associate these with disease severity."

To understand the role of Ctsl in the maintenance of regular heart morphology and function, it is critical to determine whether the DCM in Ctsl-/- mice is primarily because of the lack of Ctsl expression and activity in the cardiomyocytes or is caused by the additional extracardiac pathologies. Cardiomyocyte-specific expression of Ctsl in Ctsl-/- mice, using an α-myosin heavy chain promoter-Ctsl transgene, results in improved cardiac contraction, normal mRNA expression of atrionatriuretic peptide, normal heart weight, and regular ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes. Epithelial expression of cathepsin L2 (CTSL2) by a K14 promoter-CTSL2-transgene resulted in rescue of the Ctsl-/- hair loss phenotype. In these mice, cardiac atrionatriuretic peptide expression and end systolic heart dimensions were also significantly attenuated. However, cardiac contraction was not improved, and increased heart weight as well as the typical changes in lysosomal ultrastructure of Ctsl-/- hearts persisted. Myocardial fibrosis was detected in all Ctsl-/- mice irrespective of transgene-mediated cardiac Ctsl expression or extracardiac CTSL2 expression. Expression of collagen 1 was not enhanced in Ctsl-/- hearts, but a reduced collagenolytic activity suggests a role for Ctsl in collagen turnover by cardiac fibroblasts. We conclude that the DCM of Ctsl-/- mice is primarily caused by absence of the protease in cardiomyocytes, whereas the complex gross phenotype of Ctsl-deficient mice, i.e. the fur defect, results in additional stress to the heart.

Cardiomyopathies represent a heterogeneous group of heart diseases characterized by progressive myocardial remodeling that results in impaired pump function of the heart (1Towbin J.A. Bowles N.E. Nature. 2002; 415: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Among other etiologic factors, abnormality of lysosomes and lysosomal hydrolases have been shown to cause myocardial heart disease. Thus, cardiomyopathies have been described in hereditary deficiencies of lysosomal glycosidases, like in mucopolysaccharidoses and glycogenoses (2Guertl B. Noehammer C. Hoefler G. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 349-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Strauch O.F. Stypmann J. Reinheckel T. Martinez E. Haverkamp W. Peters C. Pediatr.

Deficiency of LAMP-2 (lysosome-associated membrane protein-2) has been shown to induce accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and to cause Danon disease, leading to severe myopathy of cardiac and skeletal muscles (4Nishino I.

Furthermore, LAMP-2-deficient mice manifest a Danon disease-like vacuolar cardioskeletal myopathy (6Tanaka Y. Guhde G. Suter A. Eskelinen E.L. Hartmann D. Lullmann-Rauch R. Janssen P.M.

The human lysosomal cysteine cathepsins represent a family of 11 papain-like proteolytic enzymes (clan CA, family C1) with a principal subcellular localization in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Seven of these peptidases, the cathepsins B, C, F, H, L, O, and X/Z, exhibit ubiquitous but nevertheless differential expression in mammalian tissues. Other papain-like cysteine peptidases are known to exhibit cell type-specific expression, e.g. cathepsin K is mainly found in osteoclasts and cathepsin S is predominantly expressed in peripheral antigen-presenting cells (9Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 10Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Traditionally, lysosomal cysteine peptidases are considered to execute unspecific bulk proteolysis inside the lysosome, which supports a homeostatic function of these enzymes (11Barrett A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, there is growing evidence for specific intra- and extracellular functions of these papain-like enzymes (12Reinheckel T. Deussing J. Roth W. Peters C. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 13Turk V. Turk B. Turk D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). For their extracellular actions, lysosomal peptidases are secreted in considerable amounts (14Linke M. Jordans S. Mach L. Herzog V. Brix K. Biol.

Interestingly, it was shown that 1-year-old cathepsin L (Ctsl) knock-out mice develop heart disease that resembles many features of human dilated cardiomyopathy (22Stypmann J. Glaser K. Roth W. Tobin D.J. Petermann I. Matthias R. Monnig G. Haverkamp W. Breithardt G. Schmahl W. Peters C. Reinheckel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6234-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Complete deficiency of Ctsl in these mice causes interstitial fibrosis in the myocardium and pleomorphism of cardiomyocyte nuclei, histological alterations characteristic of human cardiomyopathies, as well as cardiac chamber dilation, and impaired cardiac contraction at 12 months of age. Recently it was confirmed that deficiency of Ctsl in the heart primarily affects the lysosomal system, particularly by increasing the number and changing the morphology of acidic organelles, although without the accumulation of specific lysosomal storage materials (23Petermann I. Mayer C. Stypmann J. Biniossek M.L. Tobin D.J. Engelen M.A. Dandekar T. Grune T. Schild L. Peters C. Reinheckel T. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1266-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these defects in the acidic compartments of Ctsl-deficient cardiomyocytes result in complex biochemical and cellular alterations leading to loss of cytoskeletal proteins and mitochondrial impairment, which contribute to cardiomyocyte dysfunction (23Petermann I. Mayer C. Stypmann J. Biniossek M.L. Tobin D.J. Engelen M.A. Dandekar T. Grune T. Schild L. Peters C. Reinheckel T. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1266-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the skeletal muscles of Ctsl-/- mice are not pathologically altered. However, Ctsl-deficient mice develop spontaneous phenotypes in addition to DCM. Most prominent are periodic hair loss and epidermal thickening (24Roth W. Deussing J. Botchkarev V.A. Pauly-Evers M. Saftig P. Hafner A. Schmidt P. Schmahl W. Scherer J. Anton-Lamprecht I.

It has been shown that these phenotypes are caused by a critical role of Ctsl in endosomal/lysosomal termination of growth factor signaling in keratinocytes (26Reinheckel T. Hagemann S.

Furthermore, Ctsl-deficient mice show a reduced number of CD4+-T-cells because of a reduced positive selection in the thymus and decreased volume of trabecular bones (27Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P.

Because of this complex phenotype of Ctsl knock-out mice, we set out to investigate whether their cardiomyopathy is primarily caused by defective Ctsl activity in the myocardium or secondary to the other extracardiac phenotypes. Here we address this question by transgenic expression of murine Ctsl in the heart of Ctsl-/- mice and by transgenic expression of human CTSL2 (the ortholog of mouse Ctsl) in keratin 14-expressing epithelia of Ctsl-/- mice. Generation and Maintenance of Tg(αMHC-Ctsl) Transgenics and Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- Mice—The full-length murine Ctsl cDNA (1.1 kb), including the stop codon, was inserted into an expression cassette that included the cloning vector pBSKII SK+ (Stratagene), a murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter (provided by J. Gulick), and a transcription termination/polyadenylation fragment (poly(A), 0.63 kb) of the human growth hormone gene (30Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was injected into fertilized oocytes from FVB/n inbred mice. The oocytes were subsequently transferred into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant recipient females. Mouse tail DNA was analyzed for integration of the transgene (founder analysis and routine genotyping) by PCR with transgene-specific primers 5′-TGTAACGGAGGCCTGATGGATTTT-3′ and 5′-CCCGGTCTTTGGCTATTTTGATGT-3′. The resultant founder animals were mated with Ctsl+/- mice (24Roth W. Deussing J. Botchkarev V.A. Pauly-Evers M. Saftig P. Hafner A. Schmidt P. Schmahl W. Scherer J. Anton-Lamprecht I. Von Figura K.

Transgene-positive and transgene-negative Ctsl knock-out (Ctsl-/-) or wild-type (Ctsl+/+) mice with the genotypes Ctsl+/+, Ctsl-/-, Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl+/+, and Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- were obtained. Littermate controls were used for all experiments. The generation, maintenance, and breeding of the mice as well as animal experiments were reviewed and performed in accordance with the German law for animal protection (Tierschutzgesetz). Generation of Tg(K14-CTSL2);Ctsl-/- Mice—Ctsl knockout mice with transgenic expression of human CTSL2 (synonym cathepsin V) under the epithelial cytokeratin K14 promoter have been generated as described previously (31Hagemann S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and are named Tg(K14-CTSL2);Ctsl-/- mice here. These mice are incipient congenic (N7) for the FVB/n-background. Morphometry, Histology, and Immunohistochemistry—The body and heart weights were determined by weighing the body immediately after death and the heart after removal of both atria. The myocardium was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 h. The fixed hearts were embedded in paraffin, and 7-μm thick serial sections were cut, deparaffinized, and rehydrated, and extracellular matrix glucosaminoglycans were stained with Mowry staining (32Mowry R.W.

Mouse anti-human CTSL2 antibody (R & D Systems; 1:2000 dilution at 4 °C for 16 h) was used for the detection of CTSL2. Detection of the primary antibody was performed using the EnVision™ kit (Dako Cytomation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. High Resolution Light Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy—The hearts were removed and immediately fixed in half-strength Karnovsky's fixative as 3-mm3 tissue cubes. The tissues were postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide and embedded in araldite resin. Semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue/borax, examined by light microscopy, and photographed (Leitz). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, examined, and photographed using a Jeol 1200EX transmission electron microscope (Jeol, Japan). Multiple blocks were examined from each heart, and 3-mm long and 1-μm thick sections were examined by light microscopy from each block. These tissue blocks were further examined by transmission electron microscopy using ultrathin sections. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA from myocardium was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Five micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed by the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). PCR amplification and quantification of the reverse-transcribed cDNA was performed using the intercalating SYBR Green dye, cDNA/RNA/H2O, Taq polymerase, and specific primers (β-actin, 5′-ACCAACTGGGACGATATGGAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-TACGACCAGAGGCATACAGGGACAA-3′; Ctsl, 5′-GCACGGCTTTTCCATGGA-3′ and 5′-CCACCTGCCTGAATTCCTCA-3′; ANP, 5′-CCTGGGCTTCTTCCTCGTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CCTCATCTTCTACCGGCATCTTCTC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ and 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′; Col1a1, 5′-GCCAAGAAGACATCCCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TCATTGCATTGCACGTCATC-3′) under the following conditions: 1 cycle for 15 min at 95 °C, 50 cycles (94 °C for 15s, 60 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s) in the MyiQ™ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Measurement of Proteolytic Activities—Myocardial tissue was Dounce-homogenized in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.6), and postnuclear supernatants (PNS) were obtained by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Assay for DQ-Collagen and DQ-Gelatin (both from Invitrogen) degradation in the PNS was according to the manufacturer's protocol. Organelles were isolated by centrifuging the PNS for 20 min at 17,000 × g and resuspension of the organelle pellet in 100 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Brij 35 (pH 5.5). Ctsl proteolytic activity was determined by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic dipeptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-4-methylcoumarin-7-amide (25 μm; Bachem) in the presence of the CTSB-specific inhibitor CA-074 (150 nm; Bachem). The release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was continuously monitored for 20 min by spectrofluorometry at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively. Labeling of Cysteine Protease-active Sites with DCG-04—DCG-04 binds covalently to the active site of cysteine cathepsins and contains a biotin tag (33Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). 10 μg of protein from heart organelles was incubated with DCG-04 (10 μm; courtesy of M. Bogyo, University of California, San Francisco) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the lysates were diluted in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min at 95 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and blotted on Hybond-P-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase complex for 2 h, and protease-bound DCG-04 was visualized by the SuperSignal™ chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Echocardiography and Cardiac Doppler Examination—Echocardiographic examination was performed under inhalation anesthesia with 0.8–1.0% isoflurane. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was performed with a digital cardiac ultrasound machine equipped with a 15-MHz linear phased-array transducer and a 12-MHz short focal length-phased array transducer (SONOS 5500, C1 software package, Philips Medical Systems, The Netherlands). Both the parasternal long axis and short axis views were obtained. M-mode and Doppler recordings were performed at a sweep speed of 150 mm/s. Left ventricular septal and posterior wall thickness at the end of diastole as well as end diastolic and end systolic dimensions of the left ventricle were measured using leading edge to leading edge rule with the electronic caliper in M-mode (34Sahn D.J. DeMaria A. Kisslo J. Weyman A. Circulation. 1978; 58: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (7143) Google Scholar). The percentage of fractional shortening and ejection fraction was calculated with conversion formulas as described before (35Stypmann J. Engelen M.A. Epping C. van Rijen H.V. Milberg P. Bruch C. Breithardt G. Tiemann K. Eckardt L. Int. J. Cardiovasc. Imaging. 2006; 22: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For determination of systolic outflow of the left ventricle and pulsed wave, Doppler signals were obtained by placing the sample volume parallel to flow during long axis view into the left ventricular outflow tract and the ascending aorta. Diastolic inflow was detected apical to the mitral valve within the left ventricle (35Stypmann J. Engelen M.A. Epping C. van Rijen H.V. Milberg P. Bruch C. Breithardt G. Tiemann K. Eckardt L. Int. J.

Cardiomyocyte-specific Expression of Ctsl in Ctsl-/- Mice Using an αMHC-Ctsl Transgene—The α-myosin heavy chain promoter regulates cardiomyocyte-specific gene expression (36Aikawa R. Huggins G.S. Snyder R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18979-18985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ctsl-mRNA is expressed in the heart but not in skeletal muscle of Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice (Fig. 1A), and no Ctsl-mRNA was detected by real time PCR in liver or kidney of either Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- or Ctsl-/- mice (supplemental Fig. 1). Quantification of myocardial Ctsl-mRNA expression revealed more than 100-fold Ctsl-mRNA overexpression in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- and Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl+/+ mice as compared with Ctsl+/+ controls (Fig. 1B). However, this αMHC-Ctsl transgene-induced overexpression of Ctsl-mRNA in the heart did not result in the substantial elevation of Ctsl activity. Rather, the level of Ctsl protein and its activity in the hearts of Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice resembled that in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, C and D). Correspondingly, the pro-Ctsl band (with its active site labeled by DCG-04) was markedly prominent in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- hearts. This presumably represents a stage in Ctsl maturation between complete translation and incomplete processing (Fig. 1D). In summary, Ctsl is expressed selectively in myocardium resulting in near normal Ctsl activity levels in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- hearts. Heart Function in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- Mice—The expression level of the ANP represents a marker for sheer stress in the myocardial wall. Myocardial ANP-mRNA expression was significantly increased in Ctsl-/- mice versus Ctsl+/+ controls at 55 weeks (Fig. 2A). Echocardiography revealed elevated left ventricular end systolic diameters with normal end diastolic diameters of Ctsl-/- hearts compared with Ctsl+/+ controls at 55 weeks (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table), which lead to a decrease in fractional shortening indicating a systolic pump failure with reduced ventricular contraction in Ctsl-/- mice (Fig. 2C). Moreover, significant dilation of Ctsl-/- atria (supplemental Table) was noticed, matching well the clinical picture of a dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocyte-specific Ctsl expression in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice resulted in normal myocardial ANP-mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), normal end systolic, and end diastolic diameters of the left ventricle (Fig. 2B, supplemental Table) leading to improved fractional shortening (Fig. 2C). Atrial dilation was not seen in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice (supplemental Table). These results suggest a rescue of Ctsl-/- heart function by cardiomyocyte-specific expression of Ctsl (Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mouse). Heart Morphology and Histology of Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- Mice—Heart weights were significantly increased in Ctsl-/- versus Ctsl+/+ mice. Cardiomyocyte-specific Ctsl expression in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice normalized the heart weight to wild-type levels (Fig. 3A). However, hearts of both Ctsl-/- and Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice showed more prominent staining of extracellular matrix when compared with Ctsl+/+ hearts, indicating the presence of interstitial fibrosis. No fibrosis was observed in hearts of Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl+/+ mice showing that the expression of the αMHC-Ctsl transgene does not, in itself, cause interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 3B). Investigation of myocardial ultrastructure in Ctsl+/+ hearts revealed regular muscle fiber morphology with normal mitochondria and only few, small, electron-dense lysosomes (Fig. 3C). This normal morphology was also detected in the hearts of Tg(αMHC-Ctsl); Ctsl+/+ mice. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed nuclear degeneration (Fig. 3C), considerable lysosomal accumulation (Fig. 3C and Fig. 5C), and mitochondrial degeneration with vacuolization (Fig. 5C) in cardiomyocytes of Ctsl-/- mice aged 37 or 60 weeks. As cellular vacuolization and signs of lysosomal accumulation were considerably more predominant in Ctsl-/- hearts at 60 weeks compared with 37 weeks of age (data not shown), age-associated progression of cardiomyopathy seems conceivable. Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- heart ultrastructure showed similar morphology as age-matched Ctsl+/+ control hearts. No nuclear dysmorphism or degeneration and only occasional vacuolization of cardiomyocytes were observed (Fig. 3C). Thus, the characteristic changes of the Ctsl-/- cardiac ultrastructure were prevented by the expression of the αMHC-Ctsl-transgene. In summary, heart weight and cardiomyocyte ultrastructure is rescued by cardiomyocyte-specific expression of Ctsl in Tg(αMHC-Ctsl);Ctsl-/- mice, whereas myocardial fibrosis persists (Table 1).FIGURE 5Cardiac morphology and histology of the Tg(K14-CTSL2); Ctsl-/- mouse.

Thus, the cardiomyopathy of Ctsl-/- mice might be aggravated by the metabolic stress associated with heat loss.

We investigated whether the characteristic cardiac changes of Ctsl-deficient mice persist in Tg(K14-CTSL2);Ctsl-/- mice with normal hair growth.

https://openalex.org/W2129404826,"Background Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are associated with inappropriate protein deposition and ordered amyloid fibril assembly. Molecular chaperones, including αB-crystallin, play a role in the prevention of protein deposition. Methodology/Principal Findings A series of site-directed mutants of the human molecular chaperone, αB-crystallin, were constructed which focused on the flexible C-terminal extension of the protein. We investigated the structural role of this region as well as its role in the chaperone function of αB-crystallin under different types of protein aggregation, i.e. disordered amorphous aggregation and ordered amyloid fibril assembly. It was found that mutation of lysine and glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal extension of αB-crystallin resulted in proteins that had improved chaperone activity against amyloid fibril forming target proteins compared to the wild-type protein. Conclusions/Significance Together, our results highlight the important role of the C-terminal region of αB-crystallin in regulating its secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure and conferring thermostability to the protein. The capacity to genetically modify αB-crystallin for improved ability to block amyloid fibril formation provides a platform for the future use of such engineered molecules in treatment of diseases caused by amyloid fibril formation."

Valerian is an herbal over-the-counter drug that is widely used for insomnia. Systematic reviews have found inconsistent and inconclusive results about its effects.Participants were recruited through a weekly nationally televised health program in Norway. Enrolment and data collection were over the Internet. 405 participants who were 18 to 75 years old and had insomnia completed a two week diary-keeping run-in period without treatment and were randomised and mailed valerian or placebo tablets for two weeks. All participants and investigators were blind to treatment until after the analysis was completed.For the primary outcome of a minimally important improvement in self-reported sleep quality (> or = 0.5 units on a 7 point scale), the difference between the valerian group (29%) and the placebo group (21%) was not statistically significant (difference 7.5%; 95% CI-0.9 to 15.9; p = 0.08). On the global self-assessment question at the end of the treatment period 5.5% (95% CI 0.2 to 10.8) more participants in the valerian group perceived their sleep as better or much better (p = 0.04). There were similar trends favouring the valerian group for night awakenings (difference = 6.0%, 95% CI-0.5 to 12.5) and sleep duration (difference = 7.5%, 95% CI-1.0 to 16.1). There were no serious adverse events and no important or statistically significant differences in minor adverse events.Based on this and previous studies, valerian appears to be safe, but with modest beneficial effects at most on insomnia compared to placebo. The combined use of television and the Internet in randomised trials offers opportunities to answer questions about the effects of health care interventions and to improve public understanding and use of randomised trials.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN72748991."
https://openalex.org/W1995299841,"Adaptation to constant stimulation has often been used to investigate the mechanisms of perceptual coding, but the adaptive processes within the proprioceptive channels that encode body movement have not been well described. We investigated them using vibration as a stimulus because vibration of muscle tendons results in a powerful illusion of movement.We applied sustained 90 Hz vibratory stimulation to biceps brachii, an elbow flexor and induced the expected illusion of elbow extension (in 12 participants). There was clear evidence of adaptation to the movement signal both during the 6-min long vibration and on its cessation. During vibration, the strong initial illusion of extension waxed and waned, with diminishing duration of periods of illusory movement and occasional reversals in the direction of the illusion. After vibration there was an aftereffect in which the stationary elbow seemed to move into flexion. Muscle activity shows no consistent relationship with the variations in perceived movement.We interpret the observed effects as adaptive changes in the central mechanisms that code movement in direction-selective opponent channels."
https://openalex.org/W2064924372,"Here we report the unexpected finding that specific human ANK2 variants represent a new example of balanced human variants. The prevalence of certain ANK2 (encodes ankyrin-B) variants range from 2 percent of European individuals to 8 percent in individuals from West Africa. Ankyrin-B variants associated with severe human arrhythmia phenotypes (eg E1425G, V1516D, R1788W) were rare in the general population. Variants associated with less severe clinical and in vitro phenotypes were unexpectedly common. Studies with the ankyrin-B(+/-) mouse reveal both benefits of enhanced cardiac contractility, as well as costs in earlier senescence and reduced lifespan. Together these findings suggest a constellation of traits that we term ""ankyrin-B syndrome"", which may contribute to both aging-related disorders and enhanced cardiac function."

Tuberculosis is a global threat to human health, with one-third of the world's population infected with the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. With the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, novel therapeutic agents are urgently required. This will be best achieved by developing a better understanding of the molecular biology of this pathogen. In this context, signaling systems play an important role in the continued survival of the organism and are central to the way M. tuberculosis responds to environmental stress, especially that generated by the host immune system. The predominant signaling system for adaptive gene expression changes in bacteria is called a two-component system (TCS). 3The abbreviations used are: TCStwo-component system(s)SKsensor kinaseRRresponse regulatorSAXSsmall angle X-ray scatteringMMmolecular masswHTHwinged-helix-turn-helixr.m.s.root mean square TCS are found in eubacteria, archaea, and eukarya; however, they are rare in eukarya. As the name implies, the system typically consists of two proteins: a sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a response regulator (RR) (1Stock A.M. Wylie D.C. Mottonen J.M. Lupas A.N. Ninfa E.G. Ninfa A.J. Schutt C.E. Stock J.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SKs are usually membrane-anchored proteins with a characteristic core consisting of a histidine-containing dimerization domain and a catalytic domain with ATPase activity. In response to extracellular conditions, and in some cases intracellular conditions, the SK autophosphorylates at a histidine residue within the dimerization domain. This autophosphorylation occurs upon dimerization through a phosphate transfer from the catalytic domain (annotated as a HATPase_c domain by the SMART server (2Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar, 3Letunic I. Copley R.R. Pils B. Pinkert S. Schultz J. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D257-D260Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar)) of the adjacent protomer to the conserved histidine in the dimerization domain (HisKA domain). The activated SK may then function as a phosphate donor to a universally conserved aspartic acid residue in the RR. RRs typically consist of two domains, a receiver and an effector domain, although a large family of σ54 activators also contain a central AAA+ domain. The N-terminal receiver domain acts as the phosphoacceptor, whereas the C-terminal effector domain is usually a DNA-binding domain involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes required to respond to the sensed environment. Phosphorylation of the receiver domain results in the activation of the effector domain in a manner that is not yet completely understood, in part due to the lack of structural information on full-length RRs in the activated state. Dimerization is a proposed method of regulation (4Toro-Roman A. Mack T.R. Stock A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 349: 11-26Google Scholar). This is based upon structures of the receiver domain alone in both active and inactive states (4Toro-Roman A. Mack T.R. Stock A.M. J. Biol.

TCS are therefore considered attractive targets for the development of novel agents that could alter the response of the bacterium to its detriment. More than 180 different TCS have been identified in bacteria (5Kadner R.J. Webber C.A. Island M.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 637-645PubMed Google Scholar); however, the number varies enormously between species. M. tuberculosis contains 30 genes encoding TCS proteins (6Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J.

Rev. 2001; 72: 449-461PubMed Google Scholar). The TCS SenX3-RegX3 is one of the five conserved TCS, emphasizing its importance for the survival of mycobacteria (not just the virulent strains) in hostile environments. Previous studies carried out on this TCS have revealed that both SenX3 and RegX3 communicate in the normal fashion, with His167 of SenX3 being the active histidine residue that is phosphorylated and Asp52 being the corresponding phosphorylation target in RegX3, the cognate RR (9Himpens S. Locht C. Supply P. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The production of M. tuberculosis strains with a compromised senX3-regX3 operon (through the removal of the 3′ end of the senX3 gene, the intergenic repeats, and the 5′ end of the regX3 gene) has shown that an intact SenX3-RegX3 TCS is required for a progressive infection (10Parish T. Smith D.A. Roberts G. Betts J. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Microarray experiments comparing M. tuberculosis strains with and without the senX3-regX3 operon revealed 50 possible regulon members (10Parish T. Smith D.A. Roberts G. Betts J. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). One operon in particular, Rv0096-Rv0101, appears to be directly, negatively regulated with expression found to be 5-17-fold increased in the absence of the SenX3-RegX3 TCS (10Parish T. Smith D.A. Roberts G. Betts J. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Further experiments using M. tuberculosis strains with a compromised senX3-regX3 operon displayed significant attenuation in active and resting macrophages as well as in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice, thus demonstrating that the senX3-regX3 operon is involved in the virulence of M. tuberculosis (10Parish T. Smith D.A. Roberts G. Betts J. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).

Kriakov J. Garforth S.J. Baughn A.D. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In E. coli, these genes are regulated by another TCS, PhoR-PhoB (12Torriani A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Wanner B.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Through DNA-binding experiments, it was shown that phosphorylated RegX3 directly regulates phoA and pstS, in M. smegmatis, by binding to their promoter regions. Previously, RegX3 has only been demonstrated to have DNA-binding properties with the promoter region of senX3 (9Himpens S. Locht C. Supply P. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A putative “pho-box” for RR binding has been derived for M. smegmatis consisting of an inverted repeat (GTGAAC) separated by seven nonconserved nucleotides (11Glover R.T. Kriakov J. Garforth S.J. Baughn A.D. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most RRs are multidomain proteins. All RRs contain structurally similar receiver domains with a characteristic β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-α4-β5-α5 topology and a conserved aspartic acid that is phosphorylated. They can be subdivided into families based upon similarities in their (output) effector domains. The three largest families are named after their founding members: OmpR/PhoB, FixJ/NarL, and NtrC/DctD. The RR studied here belongs to the OmpR/PhoB family. This family is characterized by a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding domain (14Brennan R.G. Cell. 1993; 74: 773-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 15Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of DNA. Currently, four full-length structures of OmpR/PhoB type response regulators exist in the Protein Data Bank. A comparison of these structures suggests that the DNA binding domain can exist in two types of conformations, closed and open. MtrA (20Friedland N. Mack T.R. Yu M. Hung L.W. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Stock A.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6733-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and PrrA (21Nowak E. Panjikar S. Konarev P. Svergun D.I. Tucker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9659-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) exist as very compact structures with the recognition helix completely inaccessible to DNA. By comparison, the structures of DrrD (22Buckler D.R. Zhou Y. Stock A.M. Structure. 2002; 10: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and DrrB (23Robinson V.L. Wu T. Stock A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4186-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) exhibit very open conformations with the DNA recognition helix of the effector domain completely accessible. In other RR families, the recognition helix is occluded in the unphosphorylated state, becoming accessible only upon phosphorylation (24Djordjevic S. Goudreau P.N. Xu Q. Stock A.M. West A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Anand G.S. Goudreau P.N. Lewis J.K. Stock A.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This was recently suggested to be the effect of signal transduction by phosphorylation in PrrA (21Nowak E. Panjikar S. Konarev P. Svergun D.I. Tucker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9659-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PrrA is one of the closed, compact structures of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily. Dimerization has been suggested as important for signal transduction in other OmpR/PhoB members. This is based upon several biochemical experiments and the two full-length crystal structures of DrrD (22Buckler D.R. Zhou Y. Stock A.M. Structure. 2002; 10: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and DrrB (23Robinson V.L. Wu T. Stock A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4186-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which are both open structures with accessible recognition helices. The α4-β5-α5 face of the receiver domain of a RR is the region most affected by phosphorylation and is the proposed site of dimerization in the OmpR/PhoB family. This site in this family displays high residue conservation as compared with other RR families (4Toro-Roman A. Mack T.R. Stock A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 349: 11-26Google Scholar), consistent with the importance of this region as a dimerization interface. However, dimerization is not only restricted to activated RRs. ArcA, for instance, exists as a dimer in the inactive state and forms an octamer upon activation (26Jeon Y. Lee Y.S. Han J.S. Kim J.B. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40873-40879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PmrA is also known to exist as a dimer in both states (27Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27185-27190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and PhoB has been shown to undergo a transition that involves changing the dimerization interface from the α1-α5 region in the inactive form to the α4-β5-α5 region in the active form (28Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Serrano L. Gonzalez A. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Bachhawat P. Swapna G.V.T. Montelione G.T. Stock A.M. Structure. 2005; 13: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional domain swapping is becoming increasingly more evident in the Protein Data Bank as more structures are deposited. Three-dimensional domain swapping describes the formation of a symmetry interaction between two molecules via the exchange of identical regions. The region that is swapped can be a single element of secondary structure or an entire globular domain (30Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Friedler A. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although many proteins display this phenomenon, the functional and physiological relevance is often not understood. Some potential advantages attained through domain swapping include higher local concentrations of active sites, larger binding surfaces, new active sites at subunit interfaces, the possibility of allosteric control, and an economic way to produce a large protein interaction network (31Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Here we present the structure of the full-length RR, RegX3, stabilized in what we believe to be an active form that exhibits three-dimensional domain swapping. As such, it would represent the first full-length RR to be captured in an activated dimeric state and to display three-dimensional domain swapping. We also present an analysis of the solution structure of RegX3 in an inactive form as both a monomer and dimer. Cloning and Expression—The gene sequence encoding RegX3 was cloned by PCR from genomic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) DNA. Flanking DNA primers 5′-TATACCATGGCAACCAGTGTGTTGATTGTGGAGG-3′ and 5′-CAGAAGCTTATTACTAGCCCTCGAGTTTGTAGCCCAGCCCGCGC-3′ were engineered to provide melting temperatures of ∼65 °C with extensions encoding NcoI and HindIII (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) restriction sites. The corresponding PCR product was ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) into a pETM11 (EMBL) expression vector with an N-terminal His6 tag. The forward primers inserted a GCA codon immediately following the start codon to preserve the reading frame. Following sequence confirmation, the plasmid was transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.7 and grown for 5 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and two tablets of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was spun down and loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A. The protein was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 10-250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The fractions containing RegX3 were pooled and diluted to a final imidazole concentration of 50 mm. The protein was then mixed with (His-tagged) tobacco etch virus protease in a 1:20 ratio and incubated at 4 °C overnight in order to cleave the His6 tag. The digested protein was applied to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column previously equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. The flow-through fractions were collected, concentrated to a final volume of 5 ml, and further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B). The peak fractions were concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off Centricon (VIVASPIN) to a final concentration of 10 mg·ml-1 as measured by Bradford's assay (Bio-Rad) (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Crystallization of RegX3 was carried out at 19 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The initial conditions (0.2 m calcium acetate, 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0) were identified using the Crystal Screen from Hampton Research. Following optimization, the best crystals were obtained after 5 days in a mixture containing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir buffer. The reservoir buffer consisted of 0.2 m calcium acetate, 2-4% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 6.5. These crystals diffracted to a maximum resolution of 6.0 Å. To obtain better quality crystals, it was necessary to mix the protein drop with LaCl3 to obtain a final concentration in the crystallization drop of 0.01 m La3+. For data collection, the crystals were transferred to a drop-containing reservoir solution mixed with 2-methyl-2,4-pentendiol to a final concentration of 20% and then flash-cooled to 100 K in a cold nitrogen gas stream. Two data sets were collected: one at λ = 1.5 Å, to a resolution of 2.6 Å, on the BW7A beamline in order to increase the anomalous signal from the La3+ ions and the second at shorter wavelength and higher resolution (2.03 Å) on the X11 beamline. All measurements were carried out on EMBL beamlines at DESY, Hamburg, using MAR165 CCD detectors. The data were indexed and integrated using DENZO (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALEPACK (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The precision-indicating merging R factor was calculated using the program RMERGE (34Weiss M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 130-135Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to structure amplitudes using the program TRUNCATE within the CCP4 program suite (35Collaborative Computational Project 4 (1994) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D, 50, 760-763Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P4212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure was solved to a resolution of 2.6 Å in the P4212 space group using the single anomalous diffraction protocol of AUTO-RICKSHAW, an automated crystal structure determination platform (36Panjikar S. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Weiss M.S. Tucker P.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Within this procedure, the structure factors were calculated from the measured intensities by employing TRUNCATE, and the five lanthanide positions were located using SHELXD (37Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The positions of these ions were refined using the program MLPHARE (35Collaborative Computational Project 4 (1994) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D, 50, 760-763Google Scholar), and the resultant phases were subjected to density modification using DM (38Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 148-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the maximum resolution was 2.6 Å, the solvent content (63%) was relatively high, and model building was performed using the program ARP/wARP (39Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The resultant model contained 184 residues of 228. In the last cycle of the ARP/wARP, 144 residues were docked with the correct sequence. The model was completed with manual building using COOT (40Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) alternating with additional REFMAC5 (41Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) refinement cycles. The refinement cycles included a bulk solvent correction and anisotropic scaling and used the entire molecule as a single rigid body for TLS refinement. The resultant refined coordinates were then used to refine against the 2.03 Å data set using REFMAC5. The overall geometric quality of the model was assessed using the program PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The refined coordinates and the structure factors for RegX3 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 2OQR). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The superimpositions and r.m.s. deviation calculations were carried out using the programs COOT and SSM (44Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). All molecular images were generated using PYMOL (45DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Small Angle Scattering—Synchrotron x-ray scattering data from solutions of RegX3 were collected at the X33 EMBL beamline using an MAR345 image plate detector (46Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: s190-s194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The scattering patterns were measured with a 3-min exposure time for multiple solute concentrations ranging from 2.7 to 15.3 mg·ml-1. No indication of radiation damage was detected. This was checked by the comparison of duplicate scattering patterns from 2-min exposures. Using a sample-detector distance of 2.7 m, the momentum transfer range, 0.009 < s < 0.5 Å-1, was covered (where s = 4πsin(θ)/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.5 Å is the x-ray wavelength). The data were processed using standard procedures by the program package PRIMUS (47Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radii of gyration Rg were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (48Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar), assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg), the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0)exp(-(sRg)2/3). The maximum particle dimensions (Dmax) and the interatomic distance distribution function p(r) were computed using the program GNOM (49Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The molecular mass (MM) of the solute at various concentrations was evaluated by a comparison of the forward scattering with that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin (MM = 66 kDa). Particle shape at low resolution was reconstructed ab initio using the program DAMMIN (50Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar), which represents the particle as a collection of M ≫ 1 densely packed beads inside a sphere with the diameter Dmax. Each bead belongs either to the particle or to the solvent, and the shape is described by a binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, simulated annealing is employed to search for a compact model that fits the experimental data Iexp(s) to minimize the discrepancy χ, χ2=1N-1∑JIexp(sj)-clcalc(sj)σ(sj)2(Eq. 1) where N is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor, Iexp(sj) and Icalc(sj) are the experimentally determined and calculated intensities, respectively, and σ(sj) is the experimental error of Iexp(sj) at the momentum transfer sj.

https://openalex.org/W2036712677,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in initiating adaptive immunity. Murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), like many persistent viruses, infects DCs during normal host colonization. It therefore provides a means to understanding what host and viral genes contribute to this aspect of pathogenesis. The infected DC phenotype is likely to depend on whether viral gene expression is lytic or latent and whether antigen presentation is maintained. For MHV-68, neither parameter has been well defined. Here we show that MHV-68 infects immature but not mature bone marrow-derived DCs. Infection was predominantly latent and these DCs showed no obvious defect in antigen presentation. Lytically infected DCs were very different. These down-regulated CD86 and MHC class I expression and presented a viral epitope poorly to CD8(+) T cells. Antigen presentation improved markedly when the MHV-68 K3 gene was disrupted, indicating that K3 fulfils an important function in infected DCs. MHV-68 infects only a small fraction of the DCs present in lymphoid tissue, so K3 expression is unlikely to compromise significantly global CD8(+) T cell priming. Instead it probably helps to maintain lytic gene expression in DCs once CD8(+) T cell priming has occurred."

However, in a different LNCaP human PCa progression model opposing results were obtained where TMEFF2 expression was highest in low grade disease and down-regulated in aggressive metastatic C4-2 xenografts (4Chen Q.

However, it is unlikely that the TMEFF2-ECD is able to induce ErbB4 phosphorylation in PCa as this receptor tyrosine kinase is not expressed in PCa cell lines (11Grasso A.W. Wen D. Miller C.M.

This finding implied to us that TMEFF2 release may be the result of proteolytic processing by membrane-anchored metalloproteinases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family as these enzymes are major regulators of protein ectodomain shedding (for a review, see Ref. 14Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). An increasing number of transmembrane proteins are released from the cell surface by ectodomain shedding, which is mainly but not exclusively mediated by members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases (14Blobel C.P.

Therefore the biological spectrum of ADAM function is currently rapidly expanding as these enzymes play important roles in regulating signaling, cell adhesion or repulsion, migration, proliferation, and cell death. ADAMs play fundamental roles in regulating development, morphogenesis, and diseases such as arthritis and cancer. The proteolytic activity of ADAMs is regulated in part by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) with TIMP3 displaying the broadest range of inhibitory capability toward various ADAM family members, such as ADAM10, ADAM17, or the soluble ADAM12 variant (32Amour A.

These initial in vitro findings are now increasingly corroborated by interesting phenotypes from the TIMP3-null mice demonstrating a broad range of activities linking TIMP3 loss with increased ADAM or ADAM with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) activity in affected tissues, such as heart, joints, and the immune system among others (35Fedak P.W.

In cancer, a major function of ADAMs is to regulate the bioavailability of the ErbB ligands, thereby triggering signal transmission through the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase network (14Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 26Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J.

Development. 2005; 132: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Some ligands are able to convey signals in juxtacrine mode when still attached to the cell membrane (43Dong J. Opresko L.K. Chrisler W. Orr G. Quesenberry R.D. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2984-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but there is now ample evidence that ectodomain release from the cell surface is a prerequisite for most ligands to signal via their appropriate ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (44Dong J.

Aberrant ErbB signaling has been identified as a contributor to malignant transformation where these proteins contribute to aggressive cancer phenotypes (47Mosesson Y. Yarden Y. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therapeutic approaches now target breast cancer with anti-ErbB2 antibodies in overexpressing tumors, and small synthetic ErbB1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to block aggressive growth of lung cancer (40Hynes N.E.

We hypothesized that the release of the TMEFF2-ECD would result in downstream signaling events that may drive proliferation in cells expressing this protein and possibly activate ErbB signaling due to the amount of homology between TMEFF2 and the EGF-like/neuregulin family of growth factors. Here we present evidence that TMEFF2 is a new ADAM17 and γ-secretase substrate and demonstrate for the first time that the TMEFF2-ECD has growth promoting activity in an HEK293 TMEFF2 overexpression model system by activating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in an ErbB1-dependent manner. Our work implies that ADAM17 and TMEFF2 targeting would benefit PCa sufferers. Reagents—Synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-TMEFF2 antibody was from R&D Systems, and anti-V5 epitope antibody was from Invitrogen. Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The protease inhibitor cocktail and the ErbB1 inhibitor tyrphostin (AG1478) were from Sigma. The generation of TMEFF2 expression constructs, overexpression cell lines, and shedding conditions are detailed in the supplemental information. Expression constructs are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Analysis of TMEFF2 Shedding by Western Blotting—Cells were seeded at the indicated cell densities in 6-well plates (see figure legends) and grown overnight. Serum-containing growth medium was removed, and monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to treatment with various compounds in serum-free medium for variable periods of time as indicated in the respective figure legends. Medium was removed, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 250 μg/ml sodium vanadate). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and protein content was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) prior to equal loading of lysates for 12.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Proteins were detected using anti-TMEFF2 (1:1,000), or anti-V5 (1:5,000) primary antibodies with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000 or 1:10,000) allowing visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Equal loading was verified using a mouse monoclonal GAPDH antibody (at 1:20,000; Advanced Immunochemical). Quantifiable Shedding of Alkaline Phosphatase (AP)-tagged TMEFF2 (AP-TMEFF2)—To be able to sensitively follow TMEFF2 shedding we used the AP-TMEFF2-expressing cell line to detect release of AP activity into the medium during PMA-induced shedding. The assay was performed as described by Sahin et al. (26Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 50Sahin U. Weskamp G. Zheng Y. Chesneau V. Horiuchi K. Blobel C.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 327: 99-113PubMed Google Scholar) for AP-tagged ErbB ligands. Knockdown of ADAMs by siRNA—The following siRNA oligonucleotides were used to ablate ADAM-9, -10, and -17 gene expression: control, UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU; ADAM-17, GAGGAAGCAUCUAAAGUUUUU; ADAM-10, GGACAAACUUAACAACAAUUU; and ADAM-9, AAUGUACAAGAGAUACCUGUA. The siRNA transfections were performed according to Dharmacon's protocol. Briefly cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/well in polylysine-coated 6-well dishes and grown overnight. 4 μlof Dharmafect transfection reagent was diluted in 200 μl of serum-free medium prior to addition of prediluted 100 nm siRNA and incubation for 20 min. Spent growth medium was removed and replaced with 1.6 ml of fresh medium and 400 μl of the siRNA transfection mixture. Transfections were repeated 48 h later prior to induction of TMEFF2 shedding following a total of 4 days of siRNA treatment. Results shown are representative for two independent experiments performed in duplicate. Knockdown of TMEFF2 in LNCaPs and TMEFF2-overexpressing HEK293 Cells Using siRNA and Analysis of Cell Proliferation—TMEFF2-overexpressing HEK293 cells and LNCaP cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well using a 96-well plate. The next day siRNA transfections were carried out using Dharmacon SmartPool siRNA (M-010654-00-0020). The SmartPool siRNA targets the coding sequences for the extracellular domain of TMEFF2. A dose of 100 nm was used. For each cell line two independent experiments with 15 repeats for each treatment were analyzed using the MTT assay 4 days later. Alternatively TNF-α-induced shedding was analyzed in siRNA-treated LNCaP and HEK293 cells expressing TMEFF2 by Western blot analysis of conditioned medium. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells overexpressing full-length TMEFF2 or TMEFF2-ECD were seeded at 2,500 cells/well in a 96-well plate and grown overnight. The next day the medium was removed and replaced with 1% serum-containing medium supplemented with solvent or TNF-α protease inhibitor (TAPI-1) to prevent shedding in case of full-length TMEFF2. Following a 4-day growth period, 30 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml; Sigma) was added to each well prior to addition of 100 μl of lysis solution 4 h later. Following a 1-h incubation period, plates were read at 570 nm. Alternatively experiments were performed using non-transfected HEK293 cells and purified recombinant TMEFF2-ECD. Analysis of ErbB1-dependent ERK1/2 Phosphorylation by TMEFF2-ECD and EGF-TMEFF2—Cells grown in 24-well plates were serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation with the indicated amounts of TMEFF2-ECD in the appropriate growth medium in the presence or absence of AG1478. Cells were harvested into SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above but using 1% Blocking Agent (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were probed overnight with mouse antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204; 1:5,000; Cell Signaling Technologies) in Blocking Agent (Roche Applied Science). Washed membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antimouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate in Blocking Agent and developed as described above. To test for uniform gel loading and transfer to the membrane, the blots were then reprobed with an anti-GAPDH antibody diluted 1:20,000 in Blocking Agent for 1 h and detected as above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with post-test Tukey analysis for experiments with more than one variable. Student's t test was performed for experiments with one variable only. Proliferation experiments were repeated twice. To confirm that the introduction of an IgG secretion sequence, N-terminal HA tag, and C-terminal V5/His tags had no consequences on TNF-α-induced TMEFF2 shedding we compared TMEFF2-ECD release in LNCaPs, which naturally express this protein, with shedding of tagged TMEFF2 from stably transfected HEK293 cells. Cells were grown to 90% confluency prior to TNF-α stimulation of TMEFF2 shedding in serum-free conditions for 12 h. These conditions allowed accumulation of sufficient soluble TMEFF2-ECD into the medium. Concentrated medium was analyzed by Western blotting using a commercial TMEFF2 antibody that recognizes the ectodomain of the protein. As shown in Fig. 2A TNF-α treatment of both LNCaPs and HEK293 cells expressing tagged TMEFF2 resulted in a dramatic increase of soluble TMEFF2-ECD in conditioned medium (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4) when compared with non-stimulated controls (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). This is in good agreement with data published previously (3Glynne-Jones E. Harper M.E. Seery L.T. James R. Anglin I. Morgan H.E. Taylor K.M. Gee J.M. Nicholson R.I. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we will refer to HA- and V5/His-tagged TMEFF2 as TMEFF2 from now on for simplicity. Additional experiments were performed to analyze shedding in these two cell lines using the phorbol ester PMA. As shown in Fig. 2B (lane 6) PMA-induced TMEFF2 shedding in the TMEFF2 overexpression HEK293 cell model. LNCaP cells showed similar results but started to undergo apoptotic changes in the presence of PMA (not shown), and thus further PMA shedding experiments were performed with TMEFF2-overexpressing HEK293, Chinese hamster ovary, or PC3 cell model systems. To test the hypothesis that TMEFF2 is shed from the cell surface by members of the metalloproteinase family we analyzed constitutive and PMA-induced processing in the presence and absence of the synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 or the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT in HEK293 cells expressing TMEFF2 or AP-TMEFF2 (see Fig. 1 for details). Cells were stimulated for 1 h with PMA in serum-free conditions followed by removal of PMA to prevent toxic effects and a further 7-h incubation period in the presence or absence of the inhibitors to allow accumulation of TMEFF2-ECD in the medium. As shown in Fig. 2B (Medium panel) PMA strongly induced release of TMEFF2-ECD (Fig. 2B, lane 6), which was inhibited in the presence of GM6001 (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In contrast, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT had no effect on the release of TMEFF2-ECD into the medium (Fig. 2B, Medium panel, lane 4). To be able to quantitate TMEFF2-ECD release we compared AP-TMEFF2 shedding with TMEFF2 release from the cell surface following PMA stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2C AP-TMEFF2 was processed in a manner similar to that of TMEFF2 but released a 140-kDa fragment into the medium corresponding to AP-TMEFF2-ECD following a 7-h accumulation period. We then used the AP-TMEFF2-expressing cells to quantify AP-TMEFF2-ECD release in single well shedding assays described by Sahin et al. (50Sahin U. Weskamp G. Zheng Y. Chesneau V. Horiuchi K. Blobel C.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 327: 99-113PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm the effects of inhibitor treatment as described above using only a 1-h PMA stimulation. These experimental conditions were sensitive enough to allow us to monitor constitutive as well as PMA-induced AP-TMEFF2-ECD release, which was not possible by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2D PMA-induced or constitutive release of AP-TMEFF2-ECD into the medium was inhibited by GM6001 treatment (56% of constitutive release). In contrast, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT was unable to block TMEFF2-ECD release as expected. Additional experiments were performed using a combination of GM6001 and DAPT, which also inhibi"
https://openalex.org/W1977083964,"Concentration gradients inside cells are involved in key processes such as cell division and morphogenesis. Here we show that a model of the enzymatic step catalized by phosphofructokinase (PFK), a step which is responsible for the appearance of homogeneous oscillations in the glycolytic pathway, displays Turing patterns with an intrinsic length-scale that is smaller than a typical cell size. All the parameter values are fully consistent with classic experiments on glycolytic oscillations and equal diffusion coefficients are assumed for ATP and ADP. We identify the enzyme concentration and the glycolytic flux as the possible regulators of the pattern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first closed example of Turing pattern formation in a model of a vital step of the cell metabolism, with a built-in mechanism for changing the diffusion length of the reactants, and with parameter values that are compatible with experiments. Turing patterns inside cells could provide a check-point that combines mechanical and biochemical information to trigger events during the cell division process."
https://openalex.org/W2153867794,"G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is involved in a wide range of physiological processes and diseases, and around one-half of currently used drugs target GPCRs. Assays for the signaling of GPCRs have suffered from drawbacks, including low signal-to-noise, temporally transient signals, and difficulty in applying a single assay to a wide range of GPCRs. We have developed a set of assays for G-protein-coupled receptor signaling based on beta-galactosidase enzyme complementation in live mammalian cells. We previously described an assay for GPCR activation by monitoring the binding of beta-arrestin to the receptor. Here we describe a second assay that monitors the internalization of GPCRs to endosomes, an event that follows receptor activation and is critical in desensitizing and resensitizing the receptor. We show that both assays display high signal-to-noise ratios with low variability and are quantitative for a wide range of GPCRs. EC50s obtained with these assays closely match results reported in the literature. Finally, we show that these assays are readily adapted to high-throughput chemical screens. Thus, these two assays for monitoring G-protein-coupled receptor activation and internalization should prove valuable in basic biological studies as well as in high-throughput screens."
https://openalex.org/W2164824914,"Yeast two-hybrid experiments identified α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (human fetuin A) as a binding partner for calpain domain III (DIII). The tandem DIIIs of calpain-10 interacted under the most selective culture conditions, but DIIIs of m-calpain, calpain-3, and calpain-5 also interacted under less stringent selection. DIIIs of μ-calpain, calpain-6, and the tandem DIII-like domains of the Dictyostelium Cpl protein did not interact with α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein in the yeast two-hybrid system. Bovine fetuin A stabilized proteolytic activity of purified m-calpain incubated in the presence of mm calcium chloride and prevented calcium-dependent m-calpain aggregation. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid studies, fetuin A neither stabilized μ-calpain nor prevented its aggregation. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of scratch-damaged L6 myotubes demonstrated accumulation of m-calpain at the wound site in association with the membrane repair protein, dysferlin. m-Calpain also co-localized with fluorescein-labeled fetuin A at the wound site. The effect of fetuin A on calpain-mediated plasma membrane resealing was investigated using fibroblasts from Capns1-/- and Capns1+/+ mouse embryos. Capns1 encodes the small noncatalytic subunit that is required for the proteolytic function of m- and μ-calpains. Thus, Capns1-/- fibroblasts do not express these calpains in active form. Fetuin A increased resealing of scrape-damaged wild-type fibroblasts but not Capns1-/- fibroblasts.

These studies identify fetuin A as a potential extracellular regulator of m-calpain at nascent sites of plasma membrane wounding. Calpains, cytoplasmic cysteine proteinases found in all mammalian cells, appear to contribute to a variety of cell functions by producing limited, calcium-dependent proteolysis of key regulatory proteins (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar, 2Franco S.J. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous, typical calpains, μ- (micro) and m- (milli) calpains (calpains 1 and 2, respectively), are heterodimers comprised of unique large, catalytic subunits (Capn1 and Capn2, respectively) combined with a small subunit (the Capns1 gene product). Although the role of the small subunit has not been clearly established, it is thought to function as a regulatory, targeting, or stabilizing component for the catalytic subunit (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). Twelve other calpain genes are expressed in the human and mouse genomes. Some of these genes are ubiquitously expressed, but many have a tissue-selective expression pattern (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar, 3Ono, Y., Sorimachi, H., and Suzuki, K. (1999) in Calpain: Pharmacology and Toxicology of Calcium-Dependent Protease (Wang, K. K. W., and Yuen, P.-W., eds) pp. 1-23, Taylor and Francis, New YorkGoogle Scholar). For example, Capn3 is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, and inactivating mutations in human Capn3 result in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (4Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V.

Because the current work deals predominantly with μ- and m-calpain, we will refer to these generically as calpain hereafter, with the understanding that properties of the other calpain family members, when they come to be known, may differ substantially. The calpain large subunit domain structure is well known from crystallographic studies (6Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z.

DIII is similar in three-dimensional structure to C2 calcium, phospholipid, and protein-binding domains previously identified in conventional protein kinase C isozymes, phospholipases, and several other proteins (9Bai J. Chapman E.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Nalefski E.A. Wisner M.A. Chen J.Z. Sprang S.R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K.

FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DIV is a penta-EF hand domain that binds calcium and undergoes conformational alterations that facilitate calpain activation and its interaction with calpastatin, an endogenous calpain-specific inhibitor protein. Calpastatin, is a highly efficient regulator of the ubiquitous, typical calpains, producing complete inhibition at ∼1:1 ratios of calpain to calpastatin inhibitory domain (12Mellgren R.L. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13Mellgren R.L. Mericle M.T. Lane R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Depending on the splice variant produced in a particular cell, there are three or four functionally independent calpain inhibitory domains/calpastatin molecule (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar, 14Maki M. Takano E. Mori H. Sato A. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to calpastatin, other factors are thought to tightly control calpain activity in healthy cells, consistent with the observation that uncontrolled proteolysis by calpains leads to cell death (15Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 16Liu X. Van Vleet T. Schnellmann R.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Of paramount importance is the near absence of calpain activity at basal free calcium concentrations in cells. Supraphysiologic intracellular calcium concentrations would be required for half-maximum proteolytic activity (∼5–50 μm for μ-calpain, and 200–1000 μm for m-calpain). Moreover, the activation of calpains by calcium is a highly cooperative process (17Coolican S.A. Haiech J. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4170-4176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and neither isozyme would appear to have significant activity at cell volume-averaged levels of free calcium ion in healthy cells. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that μ-calpain is, however, active in cells (18Matsumura Y. Saeki E. Otsu K. Morita T. Takeda H. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Kusuoka H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Niapour M. Berger S.

Res. 2007; 100: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is probably because transient free calcium gradients reach concentrations necessary for activation of this calpain isozyme at discrete subcellular locations. In other studies, m-calpain was found to be activated in cells following its growth factor-mediated phosphorylation (21Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which may substantially decrease or abolish its requirement for calcium ion. An obvious mechanism for calpain activation would be exposure to the extracellular space, where mm free calcium ion concentrations would allow nearly maximal activity of either μ- or m-calpain. Indeed, over the years there have been reports of extracellular calpain, for example in arthritic bone joints (22Yamamoto S. Shimizu K. Suzuki K. Nakagawa Y. Yamamuro T. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and in the serum of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura patients (23Furlan M. Lammle B. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2001; 14: 437-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 24Pavord S. Kelton J.G. Warner M.N. Moore J.C. Warkentin T.E. Hayward C.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). There is evidence that calpain released from injured hepatocytes can produce extended damage of surrounding liver cells (25Mehendale H.M. Limaye P.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Limaye P.B. Apte U.M. Shankar K. Bucci T.J. Warbritton A. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 191: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, calpains have been associated with repair of mechanically damaged plasma membrane, functioning to remodel cortical cytoskeleton at the interface between the intracellular and extracellular environment (27Mellgren R.L. Zhang W. Miyake K. McNeil P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2567-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A catalytic function for extracellular calpains assumes that they will remain active for a significant period of time after their release from cells. In fact, in vitro studies with purified calpains raise doubts about this assumption. Calpains undergo rapid autoproteolytic inactivation (28Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also aggregate and precipitate within a few minutes (29Mellgren R.L. Renno W.M. Lane R.D. Revis. Biol. Celular. 1989; 20: 139-159PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in the presence of mm calcium ion. Neither autoproteolysis nor aggregation is influenced by the addition of large stoichiometric excesses of various other proteins, implying a marked tendency of calpains to self-associate in the presence of mm calcium ion. These properties would tend to rapidly limit the proteolytic activity of calpains that escape the intracellular environment. Here we show that a major blood plasma protein, fetuin A, markedly stabilizes m-calpain while having no apparent effect on the stability or solubility of μ-calpain, in millomolar concentrations of calcium-containing buffer. Moreover, fetuin A facilitated calpain-mediated membrane repair of scrape-damaged fibroblasts. These findings represent to our knowledge the first example of a blood-borne factor enhancing plasma membrane repair. Extracellular m-calpain, stabilized by fetuin A, would have the potential to affect extracellular matrix and neighboring cells. Materials—Fetuin A isolated from bovine serum was obtained from Sigma (product number F-3385). For immunofluorescence localization studies, it was labeled with FITC, using an established procedure (31Harlow, E., and Lane, D. (1999) Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 85-87, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar), and purified by Sephadex G25 chromatography. BSA (product number A-6003) and Poloxamer 188 (Pluronic F-68®, a product of BASF), were obtained from Sigma. Vitamin-free bovine casein, chicken egg lysozyme, and whale muscle myoglobin were purchased from Sigma. Human erythrocyte μ-calpain and bovine myocardial m-calpain were purified to near homogeneity by established procedures (32Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13920-13924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were stored at -20 °C as 50% glycerol solutions in 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. Prior to use in experiments, they were diluted 5-fold in buffer A (20 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2), incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then kept overnight on ice. Unless this procedure was followed, full recovery of calpain activity was not achieved. Capns1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and wild-type fibroblasts from littermates, both transformed with SV40 large T-antigen, were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Greer (Queen's University, Kingston, Canada). HFL-1 normal human lung fibroblasts and L6 rat myoblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals). ECL extracellular matrix preparation was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Insulin-transferrin-selenium 100× stock solution was obtained from Invitrogen, and FM1–43FX, a fixable fluorescent membrane probe, was obtained from Molecular Probes. The following first antibodies were used in confocal microscopic immunolocalization studies. Mouse anti-talin clone 8d4 (Sigma) at 40-fold dilution; mouse anti-dysferlin clone Ham1/7B6 (Vector) at 20-fold dilution; goat anti-annexin-A2 (Santa Cruz SC-1924) at 20-fold dilution; and a chicken IgY developed against rat m-calpain at 50-fold dilution. Second antibodies were: TRITC goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma T-7782) at 200-fold dilution; Cy5 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc. 81-6716) at 100-fold dilution; TRITC rabbit anti-goat (Sigma T-7028) at 100-fold dilution; and Alexa 633 goat anti-chicken IgY (Molecular Probes A21103) at 200-fold dilution. Yeast Two-hybrid Studies—Matchmaker® Two-Hybrid System 3 was utilized for our studies. In general, the methods recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech) were followed. For identification of calpain-10-interacting proteins, DIIIX2 was cloned into the pGBKT7 bait vector. AH109 strain yeast bearing the bait vector was mated with yeast bearing the Matchmaker® fetal human liver cDNA library in the pGADT7 vector, and blue colonies were selected following plating on the highest stringency medium (SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside). Plasmids from initially positive clones were rescued in Escherichia coli, and those shown to recapitulate interaction with DIIIX2 in yeast were studied further. The following criteria were used to select positive clones from within this population: 1) failure to grow in highest stringency medium in the absence of the bait construct or when mated with yeast bearing negative control lamin C or p53 bait constructs; 2) the presence of multiple identical clones in the initial screen, as determined by Alu I digestion of plasmids; and 3) verification that the inserts were in-frame and represented at least part of the cDNA coding sequence. Four unique clones satisfied these criteria, out of the 3 × 106 copy library screen. One of them was the ∼80% full-length AHSG clone that is the subject of this report. To investigate the specificity of DIIIX2 association with AHSG, the DIIIs of human μ-calpain (calpain-1), rat m-calpain (calpain-2), mouse calpain-3, mouse calpain-5, human calpain-6, and Dictyostelium discoideum Cpl were amplified from the corresponding cDNAs by PCR and inserted into the pGADT7 vector in-frame. Vectors bearing cDNAs for the individual DIIIa and DIIIb of mouse calpain-10 were also constructed. Yeast transformed with these vectors were mated with yeast bearing the prey vector containing the AHSG insert, and growth was assessed on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp (low stringency) or SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp (moderate stringency) plates. Mating efficiency was confirmed for all experiments by demonstrating vigorous growth on SD/-Leu/-Trp plates. Calpain Stability and Aggregation in the Presence of Calcium—To study the effect of fetuin A on calpain stability, purified μ- or m-calpain were incubated with or without added fetuin A at 37 °C in 20 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. In different experiments, as indicated in the figure legends, calpain concentration varied between 25 and 100 μg/ml. At various times, aliquots of reaction mixture were removed to ice and diluted 2-fold in buffer A containing 0.2 mg BSA/ml and 5 mm EGTA. When all of the samples were collected, they were assayed for calpain activity in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, using the standard caseinolysis assay and [14C]methylcasein as substrate (28Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maximum carry-over of fetuin A in the assay was 50 μg/ml. At this concentration, fetuin A did not significantly affect the assay results. Aggregation and precipitation of calpains was carried out in 20 mm MOPS, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm leupeptin, pH 7.2, at 37 °C, with or without the addition of 1 mg/ml fetuin A. After 10 min, the samples were placed on ice and immediately centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in an equivalent volume of MOPS buffer with 5 mm EGTA in place of CaCl2. The samples were heated in SDS sample preparation buffer, and equivalent volumes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The same procedure was employed to investigate fetuin cleavage by calpains, except that leupeptin was omitted, and samples of incubation mixture were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. Calpain Assay and Kinetic Analysis—Calpain proteolytic activity was assayed using [14C]methylcasein as substrate. Inhibition by fetuin A was analyzed using the Woolf-Hanes kinetic plot (33Cressie N.A. Keightley D.D. Biometrics. 1981; 37: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this graphical representation, competitive inhibition is reflected by intersection of plots at a positive Y value when substrate (the x axis) is zero. In noncompetitive inhibition, plots intersect at the negative x axis (-Km) when the y axis (substrate/velocity) is zero. Confocal Immunofluoresence Microscopy—Confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP5 multi-photon laser scanning confocal microscope housed in the Advanced Microscopy and Imaging Center, University of Toledo Health Science Campus. Except where noted, the microscope was focused through the middle of the cells. Emission and excitation wavelengths were chosen from the provided software for each fluorophore utilized in the studies, and we confirmed that settings used in co-localization studies did not produce overlapping fluorescent signals. Identical instrument sensitivity settings were used for all samples within a given experiment. Image manipulation using Corel PhotoPaint® was limited to alteration of intensity, contrast, and brightness settings, all of which were identical for data sets to be compared with each other. L6 myoblasts were grown on acid-washed, ECL-coated microscope coverslips to confluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS and then switched to differentiation medium: DMEM without serum, supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium from a commercial 100× stock solution (Invitrogen). After 4 days, most of the myoblasts had differentiated, as determined by the presence of large, multinucleated myotubes that stained positive for desmin (not shown). Four-day-old myotubes were washed once with PBS and incubated in Dulbecco's PBS containing 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2.8 mm d-glucose, and 0.33 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C. In some experiments 2 μm FM1–43FX or 1 mg/ml FITC-fetuin A was included in the scraping buffer. The coverslips were scratched twice in a cross-pattern with a 23-gauge needle and aspirated after 1 min to remove buffer. The myotubes were then immediately fixed for 10 min with 0.5 ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The samples were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy by a standard protocol (31Harlow, E., and Lane, D. (1999) Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 85-87, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar) without detergent permeabilization. First antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 2% BSA, and second antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% nonimmune serum derived from the same species used to develop the antibody. Control immunostains using nonrelevant monoclonal first antibodies or without first antibody treatment were routinely employed and did not produce significant signals (data not shown). In some experiments, relative fluorescence intensities of FM1–43FX in damaged myotubes were calculated using imagej software. The total fluorescence intensity was measured for all myotubes within the field of a 60× objective micrograph spanning both sides surrounding a needle-denuded zone of myotubes. All of the readings were corrected for background fluorescence determined from an area within the cell-free scratched zone. Cell Damage Protocols—HFL-1 human lung fibroblasts or SV-40 large T-antigen transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS in 12-well plates until ∼50% confluent. The cells were subjected to cell scrape damage as previously described (27Mellgren R.L. Zhang W. Miyake K. McNeil P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2567-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly the cells were transferred to 37 °C Dulbecco's PBS containing 1.5 mm CaCl2 and other additions where indicated. A cell scraper was used to produce membrane damage as previously described (27Mellgren R.L. Zhang W. Miyake K. McNeil P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2567-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with a minor modification when HFL-1 fibroblasts were employed. To minimize cell clumping after the scrape protocol, the HFL-1 cells were allowed to recover for 10 min, collected by centrifugation, and then trypsinized (Sigma #T-4174 trypsin-EDTA solution, diluted 2-fold with PBS). After 10 min, 10 volumes of growth medium was added, the cells were replated, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reductase cell viability assay (34Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar) was performed after 12 h of culture. The percentage of survival was determined by comparison with cells in wells of the same culture dish that were not scraped but carried through all other steps of the procedure. Plasma membrane resealing was determined by assessing cellular uptake of trypan blue dye added 10 s after scrape-induced damage. Capns1-/- or Capns1+/+ fibroblasts were scraped in the presence of 150 μl Dulbecco's PBS containing 1.5 mm CaCl2 and other additions where indicated. Ten seconds later, 150 μl of 0.4% trypan blue dye in 0.85% saline (Invitrogen) was added. The cells were introduced into a hemacytometer and scored as trypan blue-positive or -negative within 2 min after the addition of dye. For zero time samples, trypan blue was included in the buffer before cell scraping. The percent of recovery of membrane impermeability 10 s after scraping was determined by subtracting the percentage of zero time impermeant (colorless) cells from the percentage of impermeant cells in the 10-s samples. Statistical Analysis—Except where otherwise indicated, statistical analyses were performed using Student's unpaired t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to reflect a statistically significant difference. All of the error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation. Yeast Two-hybrid Studies Identify AHSG as a DIII-interacting Protein—Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human fetal liver library, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” identified a clone expressing an insert comprising amino acids 69–366 of AHSG (human fetuin A) as a binding partner for the tandem DIIIs of calpain-10 (DIIIX2) (Fig. 1A). Interaction of AHSG with various calpain DIIIs was assessed using moderate stringency (Fig. 1B) or low stringency (Fig. 1C) plates. The amino-terminal DIIIa appeared to interact more strongly with AHSG than the carboxyl-terminal DIIIb (Fig. 1B). At less stringent selection, several other calpain DIIIs appeared to interact with AHSG. In addition to the DIIIs of calpain-10, DIIIs of m-calpain (C2 in Fig. 1C), calpain-3 (C3), and calpain-5 (C5) interacted with AHSG. The DIIIs of μ-calpain (C1), and calpain-6 (C6) did not interact; neither did the tandem DIII-like domains of the Dictyostelium Cpl protein (35Huang X. Czerwinski E. Mellgren R.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fetuin A Stabilizes m-Calpain—Consistent with the weak interaction suggested by the yeast two-hybrid studies, co-precipitation studies, using either immobilized fetuin A or m-calpain as bait, failed to reproducibly demonstrate association of the two purified proteins (data not shown). However, because fetuin A is a major serum protein (36Kazi J.A. Nakamura O. Ohnishi T. Arakaki N. Kajihara T. Nakagawa S. Daikuhara Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 37Cartellieri S. Hamer O. Helmholz H. Niemeyer B. Biotechnol. Appl.

Genet. 2005; 116: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that a relatively weak interaction with m-calpain could still have important physiologic consequences. Therefore, other studies were initiated to assess weak interactions between m-calpain and fetuin A. We exploited the rapid autoproteolysis of calpains to investigate their potential interaction with fetuin A. The caseinolytic activity of m-calpain decays with a half-life of only a few minutes when incubated at 37 °C in the presence of mm calcium ion (Ref. 28Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2A, left panel, open circles). However, in at least three independent experiments, m-calpain was remarkably stable when incubated in the presence of 1.5 mm calcium chloride and 1 mg of fetuin A/ml (Fig. 2A, left panel, filled circles), whereas the stability of μ-calpain was not affected by fetuin A (Fig. 2A, right panel). Exposure to fetuin A also decreased calcium-mediated m-calpain aggregation and precipitation (Fig. 2B), whereas μ-calpain precipitation was not altered. Preservation of m-calpain activity was dependent on fetuin A concentration, with significant protection observed at the average physiologic concentration range of fetuin A (AHSG) in human serum, 0.5–0.7 mg/ml (39Brown W.M. Saunders N.R. Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Previous studies had shown that m-calpain autoproteolytic inactivation was not protected by the presence of added proteins (28Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, neither lysozyme nor myoglobin significantly protected m-calpain from calcium-mediated inactivation (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Effect of fetuin A concentration on m-calpain sta"
https://openalex.org/W1964532976,"The FK506-binding protein 38 (FKBP38) affects neuronal apoptosis control by suppressing the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2. The direct interaction between FKBP38 and Bcl-2, however, requires a prior activation of FKBP38 by the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM). Here we demonstrate for the first time that the formation of a complex between FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+ involves two separate interaction sites, thus revealing a novel scenario of target protein regulation by CaM-Ca2+. The C-terminal FKBP38 residues Ser290–Asn313 bind to the target protein-binding cleft of the Ca2+-coordinated C-terminal CaM domain, thereby enabling the N-terminal CaM domain to interact with the catalytic domain of FKBP38 in a Ca2+-independent manner. Only the latter interaction between the catalytic FKBP38 domain and the N-terminal CaM domain activates FKBP38 and, as a consequence, also regulates Bcl-2. The FK506-binding protein 38 (FKBP38) affects neuronal apoptosis control by suppressing the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2.

Only the latter interaction between the catalytic FKBP38 domain and the N-terminal CaM domain activates FKBP38 and, as a consequence, also regulates Bcl-2. FKBP38 is a member of the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) 3The abbreviations used are:PPIasepeptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomeraseFKBPFK506-binding proteinCaMcalmodulinTPRtetratricopeptide repeatMBPmaltose-binding proteinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidITCisothermal titration calorimetryHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. family that belongs to the FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs). Its active form was found to inhibit Bcl-2-controlled neuronal cell death (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The PPIase activity of FKBP38 is induced by the formation of a FKBP38/CaM-Ca2+ complex, which apparently affects the conformation of FKBP38. Thereby the active site of FKBP38 becomes accessible for substrate proteins, such as Bcl-2. Active site-directed ligands of FKBP38, on the other hand, can prevent the interaction between active FKBP38 and Bcl-2. As a consequence, active site-directed inhibition of FKBP38/CaM-Ca2+ (i) significantly increases cell survival rates of neuroblastoma cells after apoptosis induction by different apoptotic stimuli and (ii) shows substantial neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in the rat ischemia model of endothelin-1-induced cerebral middle artery occlusion (2Edlich F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FKBP38 plays a role in cell size regulation (3Rosner M. Hofer K. Kubista M. Hengstschlager M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4786-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and participates in the development of murine neuronal tissues by regulating sonic hedgehog signaling (4Bulgakov O.V. Eggenschwiler J.T. Hong D.H. Anderson K.V. Li T. Development. 2004; 131: 2149-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FKBP38 also interacts with the HIF1 prolyl-4-hydroxylase PHD2 and Hsp90 (5Barth S. Nesper J. Hasgall P.A. Wirthner R. Nytko K.J. Edlich F. Katschinski D.M. Stiehl D.P. Wenger R.H. Camenisch G. Mol.

The PPIase domain folds to a FKBP12-like structure consisting of five anti-parallel β-strands and an α-helix (7Maestre-Martínez M. Edlich F. Jarczowski F. Weiwad M. Fischer G. Lücke C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to the prototypic FKBP12, the rim of the FKBP38 active site is more negatively charged, the bulge in β-strand D is shortened, and the flexible loop between β-strands E and F is slightly extended (7Maestre-Martínez M. Edlich F. Jarczowski F. Weiwad M. Fischer G. Lücke C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The TPR domain in the closely related proteins FKBP51 and FKBP52 comprises three TPR motifs (8Sinars C.R. Cheung-Flynn J. Rimerman R.A. Scammell J.G. Smith D.F. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Wu B. Li P. Liu Y. Lou Z. Ding Y. Shu C. Ye S. Bartlam M. Shen B. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8348-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Compared with FKBP51 and FKBP52, whose sequences end with an α-helix following the TPR motifs, FKBP38 additionally contains a membrane anchor that localizes the protein to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although several FKBP family members share the same domain composition, FKBP38 is the only CaM-Ca2+-regulated PPIase known to date. The small Ca2+-sensing protein CaM consists of two globular domains connected by a linker that is rather flexible in solution (10Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Each domain contains two helix-loop-helix elements, referred to as EF-hand motifs, that can bind Ca2+ among other positively charged ions (11Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ binding, each CaM domain undergoes structural changes that lead to a concerted exposure of hydrophobic groups in a methionine-rich cleft (12Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 13Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Each EF-hand in the C-terminal domain binds one calcium ion with a KD value of about 0.2 μm, whereas the EF-hand motifs of the N-terminal domain show 10-fold lower Ca2+ affinities (14Potter J.D. Strang-Brown P. Walker P.L. Iida S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conformational change between the Ca2+-free and -complexed form of CaM mediates the signal of high cellular Ca2+ concentration for a plethora of target proteins, which participate in physiological processes such as control of muscle contraction, fertilization, cell proliferation, vesicular fusion, and apoptosis. In response to increased cellular Ca2+ concentrations, for example, CaM usually interacts with short amphiphatic helices of ∼20 residues that are exposed in the target protein structures, as is the case for CaM kinases such as the CaM kinase II and myosine light chain kinases (15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In many target enzymes, like CaM kinase II and calcineurin A, the interaction with CaM displaces autoinhibitory elements from their active sites (16Griffith L.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8394-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In contrast to proteins that interact only with CaM-Ca2+, the Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor 1 binds CaM in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+ (13Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 18Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Neuromodulin and neurogranin, on the other hand, have a higher affinity for Ca2+-free CaM (18Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, CaM can also interact with nonhelical sites in target proteins. For instance, the edemia factor from Bacillus anthracis not only binds to the Ca2+-coordinated C-terminal domain but also forms a complex with the surface of the Ca2+-free N-terminal CaM domain, thereby restructuring the active site of the edemia factor (21Drum C.L.

In the present study we show that two distinct binding sites exist between FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+: (i) a helical motif, located in the FKBP38 sequence between the TPR motifs and the membrane anchor, forms a complex with the C-terminal CaM domain only in the presence of Ca2+, and (ii) the catalytic domain of FKBP38 binds to the N-terminal CaM domain in a Ca2+-independent manner. Hence, these results reveal a hitherto unknown scenario of Ca2+-independent enzyme activation by CaM. Human FKBP38 lacking the membrane anchor (FKBP381–336), the PPIase domain of FKBP38 (FKBP3835–153), human FKBP12, human CaM, the N-terminal domain of human CaM (CaM1–75), the C-terminal domain of human CaM (CaM76–148), and human Bcl-2 were all expressed by using a pET28a vector in Escherichia coli Rosetta™ cells, with the C-terminal CaM domain His6-tagged. The maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Bcl-2 fusion protein was purchased from Sigma. An affinity-purified section 4 polyclonal antibody from rabbit against the purified FKBP38 domain (FKBP381–165) was employed. Additional antibodies used were monoclonal hamster anti-Bcl-2 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and polyclonal rabbit anti-CaM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Peptide substrates (succinyl-ALPF-p-nitroanilide and succinyl-AFPF-p-nitroanilide) were obtained from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). The FKBP38290–313 peptide representing the CaM-binding site of FKBP38 was produced by solid phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy. The peptide array was prepared using the standard SPOT synthesis protocol (35Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (929) Google Scholar), with the peptides synthesized stepwise by an Abimed Asp 222 synthesizer on a cellulose membrane derivatized with two β-Ala residues as linker. Before Western blot screening, the dry peptide array membranes were rinsed for 10 min in methanol and for 3×20 min in TBS buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mm NaCl, 6.4 mm KCl). CaM solution (100 nm) in TBS buffer was allowed to react with peptide array membranes in the presence of either 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA for 4 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. The membrane was subsequently washed three times with TBS buffer before bound protein was blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed using rabbit CaM antibodies. PPIase activity was determined using a protease-coupled assay, with the oligopeptide succinyl-AFPF-4-nitroanilide as substrate (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Typically, the PPIase activity of FKBP38 was measured in a reaction mixture containing 1 μm of either FKBP381–336 or FKBP3835–153, with 1.5 or 15 μm recombinant human CaM, respectively, and 1 mm CaCl2. Insensitivity of CaM to proteolytic digestion by α-chymotrypsin was verified in the time range of the kinetic experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation—The cells were grown in flasks, incubated for 16 h with 50 μm etoposide, and finally harvested. The cell lysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed according to manufacturer protocols of the immunoprecipitation starter kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Prior to incubation, 0.5 μm EGTA was added to the samples. In addition, 1 μm CaCl2 was added to those samples incubated in the presence of Ca2+. CaM Binding Assay—CaM-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of either 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Subsequently, 30 μg of recombinant FKBP381–336 was incubated with CaM-Sepharose. The Sepharose was washed, and the bound proteins were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit anti-FKBP38 antibodies. Competing CaM variants were applied in 5-fold excess. Bcl-2 Binding Assay—40 μl of 6 μm MBP-Bcl-2 fusion protein was subjected to 40 μl of amylose-resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and incubated for 30 min. Thereafter, the beads were washed twice with 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subsequently incubated for 1 h with 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 200 μm of a CaM variant and either 50 μm FKBP381–336 or 100 μm FKBP3835–153. After three washing steps with 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Binding of FKBP381–336 was analyzed using polyclonal rabbit anti-FKBP38 antibodies. According to a competition model using Dynafit software, the presence of 1 mm EGTA causes the content of CaM-Ca2+ complex in the sample to drop below 0.6% of the CaM concentration under any chosen condition and is thus referred to as Ca2+-free. ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. FKBP38 and CaM variants were dialyzed in 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% NaN3) with either 1 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2. The FKBP381–336 solutions ranged in concentration from 35 to 70 μm; FKBP3835–153 was applied in a concentration range from 0.1 to 1.0 mm; the concentrations of the various CaM variants ranged from 0.2 to 2.0 mm in different experiments. The 24-mer peptide (0.25 mm) was applied in 10 mm MES buffer with 2 mm CaCl2. Usually the FKBP38 solution was placed in the calorimeter cell, and the CaM solution was loaded into the syringe injector. The titrations were carried out in 5–10-μl aliquots, with a 240-s delay between each injection. Calorimetric titration data were fitted using the Origin 5.0 program supplied with the Microcal VP-ITC instrument, to obtain the stoichiometry (N), the association constant (K), the binding enthalpy (ΔH), and the binding entropy (ΔS). The reported binding constants are an average of duplicate measurements. As a control, the protein or peptide solutions were titrated into buffer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences FluoroMax2 fluorescence spectrometer, using a 1 × 1-cm cuvette, an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, and excitation and emission slit widths of 5 and 3 nm, respectively. The protein samples were applied in 10 mm MES buffer with either 2 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. The binding constant (KD) was calculated from the fluorescence intensity by using the equation, P0·α=C0·αn(1-α)-KDn(Eq. 1) where P0 = total protein concentration, α = (Fmax - F)/(Fmax - F0), Fmax = fluorescence intensity at saturation, F0 = initial fluorescence intensity, n = number of independent binding sites, C0 = total CaM concentration at each addition, and KD = dissociation constant. All of the NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C, using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer as previously described (7Maestre-Martínez M. Edlich F. Jarczowski F. Weiwad M. Fischer G. Lücke C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NMR sample contained 0.5 mm15N-labeled CaM in 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 6 mm CaCl2, 0.05% NaN3). FKBP38290–313 was added to the sample in 3-fold excess (1.5 mm). The backbone amide peaks were picked with the program Felix 2000 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and assigned via 15N-edited three-dimensional spectra with the help of a previously reported assignment of CaM-Ca2+ (36Ikura M. Kay L.E. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The backbone amide assignments are listed in supplemental Table S1. The FKBP38 Segment Ser290–Asn313 Interacts with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent Manner—The interaction between FKBP38 and CaM is dependent on the Ca2+ concentration both in vivo and in vitro (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A peptide scan was performed to identify the CaM-binding site of FKBP38; CaM bound to two clusters of peptides in the presence of Ca2+, whereas in the absence of Ca2+, no binding of CaM to the array of FKBP38 peptides was detected (Fig. 1A). The two clusters of peptides, which interact with CaM-Ca2+ indicate minimal binding motifs corresponding to the FKBP38 segments Ile285–Ala298 and Glu303–Arg316 (Fig. 1B). Both segments are located in the C-terminal FKBP38 domain between the TPR motifs and the membrane anchor. The sequences of both segments consist largely of positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids and may therefore constitute an amphipathic α-helix. Interestingly, the putative CaM-binding site predicted by the CaM Target Data Base covers both segments nearly completely (Fig. 1B). Because the matrix-bound peptides (i) exhibit the best accessibility and (ii) adopt the correct secondary structure generally in the central positions, we focused on the middle section of the identified motif. As a consequence, the peptide biotinyl-SKLVKKHAAQRSTETALYRKMLGN-NH2, which corresponds to FKBP38 residues Ser290–Asn313 (FKBP38290–313), was immobilized on streptavidin beads and subsequently tested for binding to endogenous CaM from SH-SY5Y cell lysate. CaM bound to the loaded affinity matrix only in the presence of Ca2+, as confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis and Western blot (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the FKBP38290–313 peptide competed with FKBP381–336 for binding to CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 1D). To quantify the interference of the peptide with the activity of FKBP381–336/CaM-Ca2+, FKBP38290–313 was applied in a PPI-ase activity assay. The peptide competed with FKBP381–336 for CaM-Ca2+ binding, thus dissociating the FKBP381–336/CaM-Ca2+ complex into the PPIase-inactive constituents with an IC50 value of 1.4 ± 0.13 μm (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate a Ca2+-dependent complex formation between CaM and FKBP38290–313. The Catalytic Domain of FKBP38 Features a Second CaM-binding Site—Given the interaction between FKBP38290–313 and CaM-Ca2+, we furthermore examined whether CaM interacts with an FKBP38 construct that lacks the C-terminal CaM-binding site. To this end, the PPIase activity of the catalytic FKBP38 domain (FKBP3835–153) was examined in the presence of CaM. Surprisingly, FKBP3835–153 showed PPIase activity when 10 μm CaM was added, although residues Ser290–Asn313, which form the CaM-binding site in FKBP38, were not present (Fig. 2A). Hence, CaM interacts with a second CaM-binding site located in the catalytic domain of FKBP38. Moreover, the presence of CaM induced the activity of FKBP3835–153 to the same extent in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+, as demonstrated by similar kcat/KM values, which amends the previously reported Ca2+-dependent activation of FKBP38 (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The fact that this second binding site was not detected in the peptide array suggests a nonlinear binding motif. These results reveal a Ca2+-independent interaction between CaM and the catalytic domain of FKBP38, which apparently induces the active conformation of FKBP38. Remarkably, the dose response curves do not adopt hyperbolic character, as one might expect. This effect is due to the adsorption of FKBP38 and CaM variants at the cuvette surface and was successfully suppressed in the fluorescence assays described below. The fluorescence measurements were performed to investigate the CaM interaction with FKBP3835–153 in the absence of Ca2+. Fig. 2B shows the fluorescence spectra of both proteins in the absence of Ca2+ ions. The spectrum of the FKBP3835–153/CaM complex is red-shifted by 4 nm, and its amplitude is reduced by 8.5% compared with the combined spectrum of the isolated proteins. A titration experiment shows the changes in the protein fluorescence of FKBP3835–153 in dependence of the CaM concentration, revealing a KD value of 6.63 ± 0.95 μm for this interaction (Fig. 2C). These data again indicate a Ca2+-independent, specific binding of FKBP3835–153 to CaM. In contrast, the combined fluorescence spectrum of separately measured FKBP12 and CaM is nearly identical to the spectrum of FKBP12 in the presence of CaM (supplemental Fig. S1). To further investigate the consequences of this interaction between the catalytic FKBP38 domain and CaM on the binding of Bcl-2, we analyzed the binding of either FKBP381–336 or FKBP3835–153 to a Bcl-2 loaded affinity matrix. Fig. 2D shows that FKBP3835–153 bound to Bcl-2 both in presence and absence of Ca2+ whenever CaM was present, whereas no binding of FKBP3835–153 to Bcl-2 was detected in the absence of CaM. FKBP381–336 and FKBP3835–153 competed for Bcl-2 binding in the presence of Ca2+-free CaM, but when Ca2+ was present the FKBP381–336/CaM-Ca2+ complex prevented the binding of FKBP3835–153 to the Bcl-2 matrix. Taken together, these results (i) demonstrate the existence of a Ca2+-independent CaM-binding site in the catalytic domain of FKBP38 and (ii) indicate a higher affinity between the two proteins when both binding sites of FKBP38 are present. The N-terminal Domain of CaM Interacts with the Catalytic Domain of FKBP38—To analyze the respective counterparts in CaM that interact with the two binding sites in FKBP38, a tryptic digest was performed to separate both CaM domains and analyze their interactions with FKBP38. The digest resulted in two fragments with a cleavage site between the CaM residues Lys75 and Met76, according to Edman digest analysis (data not shown). Therefore, two CaM fragments were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The fragment of the N-terminal CaM domain comprised residues Ala1–Lys75 (CaM1–75), whereas the fragment corresponding to the C-terminal CaM domain consisted of the sequence Met76–Lys148 (CaM76–148). First, we used an affinity matrix loaded with the peptide that corresponds to FKBP38290–313 to bind endogenous CaM from SH-SY5Y cell lysate. Endogenous CaM was sequestered to the matrix and thus removed from the cell lysate (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to analyze the interactions of endogenous FKBP38 and Bcl-2 in the presence of different CaM variants. When Ca2+ was present, FKBP38 interacted with Bcl-2 in the lysate of SH-SY5Y cells, but in CaM-depleted cell lysate no such interaction was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). The addition of full-length CaM to the CaM-depleted cell lysate restored the ability of endogenous FKBP38 to interact with Bcl-2. Upon the addition of the separate CaM domains, however, FKBP38/Bcl-2 interactions were restored only in the presence of CaM1–75, whereas no interactions between FKBP38 and Bcl-2 occurred in the presence of CaM76–148. These results indicate that it is the N-terminal domain of CaM that interacts Ca2+-independently with the catalytic FKBP38 domain. Thus, we subsequently also investigated the interaction of FKBP381–336 with a Bcl-2 affinity matrix in the presence of different CaM variants. FKBP381–336 interacted with Bcl-2 in the presence of full-length CaM or CaM1–75, but no FKBP381–336 bound to the Bcl-2 affinity matrix when only CaM76–148 was present (Fig. 3C). Hence, the N-terminal CaM domain mediates the interactions with the catalytic FKBP38 domain, as is further evidenced by a decrease of the protein fluorescence amplitude by 17.8 ± 0.1% and a 1-nm red shift observed in the spectrum of FKBP3835–153 in the presence of CaM1–75 (Fig. 3D). Fluorescence measurements of the FKBP3835–153/CaM1–75 complex in the presence and absence of Ca2+ demonstrated that (i) the interaction between these two protein variants occurs both with and without Ca2+ and (ii) the spectral changes in the catalytic FKBP38 domain are identical under both conditions (supplemental Fig. S3). Further, we tested the influence of the two separate CaM domains on the PPIase activity of the catalytic FKBP38 domain (Fig. 3E). Consistent with the previous data, only CaM1–75 caused an increase in the PPIase activity of FKBP3835–153, thus demonstrating that this interaction between the N-terminal domains is required and sufficient for the activation of FKBP38. In contrast, the addition of the C-terminal CaM domain did not alter the catalytic activity of FKBP3835–153. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with FKBP3835–153 and CaM1–75 yielded nearly identical results in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+. In both cases, the data revealed 1:1 stoichiometries with KD values of 6.9 ± 0.92 and 7.0 ± 0.55 μm, respectively, according to a one-binding-site model (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S4).TABLE 1Parameters for FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+ interaction Parameters for this interaction between FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+ at two different binding sites, measured in 10 mm MES (pH 6.8), 100 mm KCl at 20 °C in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2.

Therefore, we analyzed the influence of different CaM variants on the interaction between FKBP381–336 and CaM-Sepharose, because FKBP38 binds in a Ca2+-dependent manner to CaM-Sepharose. Fig. 4A shows that in addition to full-length CaM also CaM76–148 competed with CaM-Sepharose for FKBP381–336 binding, whereas the presence of CaM1–75 did not significantly reduce the amount of matrix-bound FKBP381–336. Hence, the C-terminal CaM domain interacts with FKBP38290–313. Furthermore, PPIase activity measurements were performed to test whether CaM76–148 interferes with the activation of FKBP38 by CaM-Ca2+. Indeed, CaM76–148 lowered the activity of the FKBP381–336/CaM-Ca2+ complex, thus demonstrating a competition with full-length CaM for binding to FKBP381–336 (Fig. 4B). Thereby, CaM76–148/Ca2+ bound to FKBP381–336 with a Ki value of 2.01 ± 0.71 μm. Both CaM domains were subsequently used in ITC experiments to determine binding to FKBP38290–313. Only CaM76–148 interacted with the peptide that corresponds to FKBP38290–313, revealing a 1:1 complex with a KD value of 2.2 ± 0.24 μm according to a one-binding site model fit (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S5). The interaction between FKBP38290–313 and CaM76–148 on the one hand and the interaction between the catalytic FKBP38 domain and the N-terminal CaM domain on the other hand were also detected when ITC measurements were performed with FKBP381–336 and CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S6). These measurements revealed two binding sites, each with a 1:1 molar ratio between both binding partners according to a two-binding-site model (Table 1). Thereby, one binding site interacted with a KD of 2.2 ± 0.22 μm, whereas the other binding site showed a KD value of 4.9 ± 0.97 μm. Both binding constants are similar to those derived from measurements with the single domains, although the interaction between the isolated N-terminal domains shows slightly lower affinity than the second binding site of the full-length proteins (Table 1). Finally, NMR spectra were collected to locate the site where FKBP38290–313 binds to CaM. [1H/15N]-HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled CaM-Ca2+ (Fig. 4C), collected both in absence and presence of FKBP38290–313, revealed significant chemical shift perturbations for several residues in the C-terminal CaM domain, comprising segments Val91–Phe92, Glu104–Val108, Ala128–Asn129, and Met145–Lys148, which are located within or near the cleft where peptide ligands generally bind to CaM (Fig. 4, D and E). As shown previously, FKBP38 is the only enzyme catalyzing protein folding that is regulated by the Ca2+-sensing protein CaM (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between both proteins remained puzzling. Using separate CaM domains, it was now possible to demonstrate that the FKBP38 regulation is mediated by two distinct interaction sites in both proteins, revealing a novel scenario of CaM target activation. One interaction involves a short sequence in the C-terminal FKBP38 domain that comprises residues Ser290–Asn313 between the TPR motifs and the membrane anchor. It binds to the C-terminal CaM domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Both the FKBP38290–313 peptide and the isolated C-terminal CaM domain proved sufficient to (i) prevent interactions between FKBP381–336 and a CaM-loaded affinity matrix and (ii) inhibit PPIase activity of the FKBP381–336/CaM-Ca2+ complex. Heteronuclear two-dimensional [1H, 15N]-HSQC experiments showed an interaction between the FKBP38290–313 peptide and the target protein-binding cleft in the C-terminal domain of CaM-Ca2+, suggesting binding site recognition of FKBP38290–313 by CaM76–148 that is comparable with the previously described CaM complexes (15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 24Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Hence, the interaction between the C-terminal domains of FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+ is in good agreement with previous observations of the Ca2+-dependent interaction between FKBP38 and CaM (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, our study discovered a second interaction in the FKBP38/CaM-Ca2+ complex that occurs between the N-terminal domains of both proteins. PPIase measurements revealed enzymatic activity of the catalytic FKBP38 domain in the presence of either Ca2+-free CaM or CaM-Ca2+. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using CaM-depleted lysate from SH-SY5Y cells confirmed that interactions between FKBP38 and Bcl-2 are induced only in the presence of either full-length CaM or CaM1–75, whereas CaM76–148 did not cause Bcl-2/FKBP38 interactions. These results clearly demonstrate that only CaM1–75 is responsible for the activation of FKBP38, independent of Ca2+. This interaction between the catalytic FKBP38 domain and the N-terminal CaM domain is therefore crucial for the participation of FKBP38 in the regulation of programmed cell death via its interaction with Bcl-2. These results suggest a novel scenario where the two CaM domains bind to separate interaction sites in FKBP38, one of which requires Ca2+, whereas the other does not. Many CaM-regulated proteins, such as myosine light chain kinases or CaM-dependent kinases, interact with CaM only in presence of Ca2+ (25Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), whereas Ca2+-free CaM has only a low affinity for these particular target proteins (13Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). In the CaM-Ca2+ complex of the edemia factor from B. anthracis, only the C-terminal CaM domain coordinates Ca2+, whereas no calcium ions are found in the N-terminal CaM domain (22Collier R.J. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 45-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 23Ulmer T.S. Soelaiman S. Li S. Klee C.B. Tang W.J. Bax A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29261-29266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CaM binds with its Ca2+-free N-terminal domain to the Ca2+-ATPase in the membrane of erythrocytes (26Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, several CaM-binding partners are regulated by CaM in a Ca2+-independent fashion (18Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For instance, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase is regulated by CaM, but the presence or absence of Ca2+ does not influence the regulation of this enzyme (27Yamaki T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. Commun. 1980; 94: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Such a Ca2+-independent regulation by CaM was also identified for the adenylyl cyclase from Bordetella pertussis (28Greenlee D.V. Andreasen T.J. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The interaction of FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+ therefore shares certain properties previously described for other CaM-binding partners but features a novel combination of both a Ca2+-dependent and a Ca2+-independent interaction to regulate enzymatic activity. The interaction between FKBP3835–153 and CaM was also detected by protein fluorescence. Moreover, ITC measurements revealed a 1:1 complex for the interaction between the catalytic FKBP38 domain and the N-terminal CaM domain, with a KD value of 7.0 ± 0.55 μm. The binding between the C-terminal interaction sites of both proteins, however, increases the affinity significantly to a KD of 1.4 μm (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results apparently favor a 1:1 stoichiometry between FKBP38 and CaM-Ca2+, because FKBP38 is activated in cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner with higher affinity than the binding constants of the single interaction sites (Fig. 5). However, a 1:2 stoichiometry could theoretically also be possible, if allosteric effects induced by the C-terminal interaction assist the interaction of the N-terminal binding sites or other as yet unknown factors facilitate the binding of two CaM molecules to FKBP38. The interaction between FKBP38290–313 and CaM76–148 is entropically driven, as also found for other CaM-Ca2+-binding sites, because of the dehydration of the binding interface caused by the dominant role of hydrophobic interactions (29Brokx R.D. Lopez M.M. Vogel H.J. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14083-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The higher affinity of the C-terminal interaction is essential for the regulation of FKBP38 under physiological conditions, because the availability of free CaM-Ca2+ limits the activation of target proteins in the cell (30Black D.J. Tran Q.K. Persechini A. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Tran Q.K. Black D.J. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24247-24250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Considering the high cellular abundance of CaM, reaching 0.5% of the total protein content in the brain (32Teshima Y. Kakiuchi S. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 4: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar), this appears surprising, but the cellular concentration of free CaM-Ca2+ does not exceed 1 pm (13Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Thus, the CaM-Ca2+ concentration is far below the concentration of cellular CaM-Ca2+ target proteins, implying a coupling of CaM-dependent enzyme activities by the competition for the limiting CaM-Ca2+ species (33Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This competition with other CaM target proteins apparently results in a Ca2+-dependent interaction between FKBP38 and CaM, as indicated by the increased affinity of the full-length proteins. Interestingly, in neuronal cells large amounts of CaM are sequestered to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria by proteins such as neuromodulin and neurogranin, which exhibit a higher CaM affinity in the absence of Ca2+, thus forming a CaM reservoir (19Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chapman E.R. Au D. Alexander K.A. Nicolson T.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This CaM pool is released in the presence of Ca2+, resulting in particularly high concentrations of free CaM-Ca2+ at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria membranes of neuronal cells, where FKBP38 is located in the cell (1Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghänel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore we propose that a cellular increase in the Ca2+ concentration initially induces the formation of a complex between the C-terminal domains of FKBP38 and CaM, subsequently leading to an activation of FKBP38 as a result of the interaction between the N-terminal CaM domain and the catalytic FKBP38 domain. Hence, a high cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is presumably favorable for the activation of FKBP38 by CaM and thus also for the regulation of Bcl-2 by FKBP38/CaM-Ca2+ in neuronal apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2014602540,"Background This study examines the surface activity and resistance to phospholipase degradation of a fully-synthetic lung surfactant containing a novel diether phosphonolipid (DEPN-8) plus a 34 amino acid peptide (Mini-B) related to native surfactant protein (SP)-B. Activity studies used adsorption, pulsating bubble, and captive bubble methods to assess a range of surface behaviors, supplemented by molecular studies using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and plasmon resonance. Calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE) was used as a positive control. Results DEPN-8+1.5% (by wt.) Mini-B was fully resistant to degradation by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in vitro, while CLSE was severely degraded by this enzyme. Mini-B interacted with DEPN-8 at the molecular level based on FTIR spectroscopy, and had significant plasmon resonance binding affinity for DEPN-8. DEPN-8+1.5% Mini-B had greatly increased adsorption compared to DEPN-8 alone, but did not fully equal the very high adsorption of CLSE. In pulsating bubble studies at a low phospholipid concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, DEPN-8+1.5% Mini-B and CLSE both reached minimum surface tensions <1 mN/m after 10 min of cycling. DEPN-8 (2.5 mg/ml)+1.5% Mini-B and CLSE (2.5 mg/ml) also reached minimum surface tensions <1 mN/m at 10 min of pulsation in the presence of serum albumin (3 mg/ml) on the pulsating bubble. In captive bubble studies, DEPN-8+1.5% Mini-B and CLSE both generated minimum surface tensions <1 mN/m on 10 successive cycles of compression/expansion at quasi-static and dynamic rates. Conclusions These results show that DEPN-8 and 1.5% Mini-B form an interactive binary molecular mixture with very high surface activity and the ability to resist degradation by phospholipases in inflammatory lung injury. These characteristics are promising for the development of related fully-synthetic lipid/peptide exogenous surfactants for treating diseases of surfactant deficiency or dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2029072492,"NRAMP-1 (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-1) has been associated with innate resistance to unrelated intracellular pathogen infections, up-regulation of proinflammatory phagocyte functions, and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. It is still unclear how the divalent cation transport function of NRAMP-1 accounts for the associated pleiotropic effects.

In the context of intracellular infections, NRAMP-1 expression prevents full macrophage PTP induction by Leishmania infection, correlating with higher nitric oxide production and lower parasite survival. We suggest that NRAMP-1 divalent cation transport leads to transient inhibition of PTPs via direct PTP-metal interaction and/or by reactive oxygen species-dependent PTP oxidation, consequently promoting positive signal transduction, as a backbone for the induction of proinflammatory phagocyte functions.

Results from the present study reveal that NRAMP-1 expression has an effect on Mϕ PTP activity, in turn modulating the phosphorylation/activation of signaling proteins associated with LPS- and IFN-γ-dependent NO production and the Mϕ response to Leishmania infection. Our data and ongoing research suggests that the mechanism underlying this regulation involves a metal-dependent reversible inhibition of PTP activity. Materials—4-Nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt hexahydrate (pNPP), LPS (Escherichia coli, serotype 0111:B4), catalase, superoxide dismutase, poly(Glu,Tyr), phosphotyrosine peptide substrate (TRDIpYETDYYRK), N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), and deferoxamine (DFO) were purchased from Sigma.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), infected and noninfected Mϕs were collected, lysed in PTP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Igepal, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin) and kept on ice for 45 min.

Briefly, poly(Glu,Tyr) substrate was tyrosine-phosphorylated by overnight (ON) incubation with 10 μg of purified glutathione S-transferase-FER protein kinase and 150 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP. The radiolabeled phosphorylated substrate was incorporated in a 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel mixture at a concentration of 2 × 105 cpm/ml of gel solution. Mϕ protein extracts were prepared as described above, denatured by standard SDS-PAGE procedures, and loaded onto the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated ON in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% isopropyl alcohol). Gels were washed twice with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol), followed by full protein denaturation in Buffer B containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were washed twice in Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% Tween 20). Final renaturation was obtained after an ON incubation in Buffer C.

Briefly, nuclear extracts were incubated with binding buffer containing 1.0 ng of [γ-32P]dATP radiolabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotides used were the DNA binding consensus sequences for NF-κB(5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and GAS/ISRE (5′-AAGTACTTTCAGTTTCATATTACTCTA-3′). Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide was used as unspecific control (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were plated ON in glass cover slips, washed with cold PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 4 °C, and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After blocking in 5% nonfat evaporated milk in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with α-phosphotyrosine antibody. Slides were washed with PBS incubated with AlexaFluor 488 α-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclear stain was performed with propidium iodide. After mounting, cells were visualized by confocal microscopy (×63), using a Zeiss LSM 510 system. NO Production—Mϕs were seeded in 12-well plates and cultured in the presence or absence of purified E. coli LPS for 24 h or IFN-γ for 48 h. NO production was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium by the Griess reaction, as previously described (46Matte C. Marquis J.F. Blanchette J. Gros P. Faure R.

Difference between groups was considered statistically significant when p was <0.05 or <0.01. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. NRAMP-1 Regulation of NO Production Is Associated with Modulation of Signaling Pathways—One of the major Mϕ functions associated with NRAMP-1 expression and the successful control of intracellular pathogens is NO production (13Barrera L.F.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 1994-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By using the Mϕ cell line RAW 264.7 (naturally deficient in a functional NRAMP-1) and NRAMP-1-transfected RAW cells (RAW Nramp-1) (36Govoni G. Canonne-Hergaux F. Pfeifer C.G. Marcus S.L. Mills S.D. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Malo D. Finlay B.B. Gros P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have studied the signaling pathways underlying IFN-γ- and LPS-dependent NO production as a means to functionally validate the resistance phenotype of our Mϕ cell line system. LPS stimulation induced a higher and dose-dependent (2–10-fold) nitrite accumulation in RAW Nramp-1 cells, compared with its NRAMP-1-deficient counterpart (Fig. 1A). As with LPS, NO production following IFN-γ stimulation was significantly higher in RAW Nramp-1 cells (Fig. 1D). Previous reports have shown that IFN-γ- and LPS-dependent NO production in NRAMP-1-expressing Mϕs results from increased iNOS mRNA stability and transcription (14Fritsche G. Dlaska M. Barton H.

These results are in support of previous observations (50Blackwell J.M. Searle S. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 65: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 51Lafuse W.P. Alvarez G.R. Zwilling B.S.

Macrophage PTP Activity Is Affected by the Functional Expression of NRAMP-1—In order to understand the mechanism by which NRAMP-1 mediates the regulation of protein phosphorylation and activation of signaling pathways, we studied its impact on the direct coordinators of tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is tightly controlled by the balanced activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and PTPs. PTPs, comprising the largest gene family of phosphatases in the human genome (52Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T.

Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), are key regulators of signal transduction in multiple cellular processes, including differentiation, activation, and response to infection. Basal Mϕ PTP activity was determined by the capacity of total Mϕ protein lysates to dephosphorylate the phosphate analogue pNPP and a synthetic tyrosine monophosphorylated peptide substrate. Dephosphorylation of the two PTP substrates showed a significant 35% reduction of PTP activity in response to NRAMP-1 expression (Fig. 2A), contributing to the higher phosphorylation levels of some phosphoproteins, including STAT1, ERK1/2, and MEK1/2, and increased kinase activities (31Olivier M. Cook P. Desanctis J. Hel Z. Wojciechowski W. Reiner N.E. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 51Lafuse W.P. Alvarez G.R. Zwilling B.S. Cell. Immunol. 2002; 215: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of the differential PTP activity, tyrosine phosphorylation of Mϕ proteins from both cell lines was monitored by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2B, RAW Nramp-1 Mϕs had higher levels of total tyrosine phosphorylation at basal level and upon latex beads phagocytosis (data not shown). Furthermore, anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot showed increased phosphorylation in RAW Nramp-1 protein bands ranging from 30 to 150 kDa (Fig. 2C), suggesting that inhibition of more than one PTP is involved in the maintenance of higher protein phosphorylation. Modulation of PTP Activity in NRAMP-1-deficient Mϕs Reverts Their Functional Phenotype—Peroxovanadium-derived compounds have been shown by our laboratory (35Olivier M. Romero-Gallo B.J. Matte C. Blanchette J. Posner B.I. Tremblay M.J. Faure R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13944-13949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and others (54Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be specific and potent PTP inhibitors that modulate phagocyte functions in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the contribution of differential PTP activity in the signaling and functional events associated with NRAMP-1 expression, RAW and RAW Nramp-1 cells were incubated with the peroxovanadium-derived compound bpV(phen) to reach equivalent PTP activity levels in both cell lines. As seen in Fig. 3A, treatment with doses ranging from 5 to 25 μm bpV(phen) result in equivalent PTP activity for RAW and RAW Nramp-1 Mϕs. Interestingly, 1 h of bpV(phen) treatment prior to LPS stimulation promotes similar and enhanced capacity of both cell lines to produce NO (Fig. 3B). Moreover, inhibition of PTP activity in RAW Mϕs even with the lower dose of bpV(phen) (5 μm) rescues the functional phenotype and induces NO production to the same level of bpV(phen)-untreated RAW Nramp-1 Mϕs. This finding suggests that the basal difference in PTP activity is crucial for the differential regulation of NO given that equivalent levels of PTP activity in both cell lines, achieved by partial inhibition with bpV(phen), rescue the capacity of NRAMP-1-deficient Mϕs to produce NO. NRAMP-1 Expression Prevents Full Induction of Mϕ PTP Activity upon Leishmania Infection—As previously shown by our group, Leishmania infection strongly induces Mϕ PTP activity, particularly that of the Src homology 2 domain containing PTP SHP-1, as a mechanisms to down-regulate Mϕ functions and promote successful intracellular survival (32Forget G.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 2555-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In light of the observation that NRAMP-1 expression plays a role in the regulation of Mϕ PTP activity, we sought to determine if the difference in PTP activity among RAW and RAW Nramp-1 cells was maintained in response to a strong PTP-inducing stimulus and whether this difference plays an active role in the control of L. donovani infection. Infection of RAW Mϕs promotes a 35% induction of PTP activity above basal level. However, functional NRAMP-1 expression limits the capacity of Mϕs to reach full PTP activation in response to Ld (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the classical down-regulation of host cell signaling may be partially blocked in NRAMP-1-expressing cells. Knowing that parasite-induced Mϕ PTP activation is fundamental for its intracellular development, we studied the capacity of Ld to survive in both cell lines by infecting Mϕs with luciferase-transfected Ld promastigotes (Ld-Luc) (38Roy G. Dumas C. Sereno D. Wu Y. Singh A.K. Tremblay M.J. Ouellette M. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Following 6 h of initial Mϕ-parasite contact and a chase period of 24 h, no difference in intracellular survival was observed between RAW and RAW Nramp-1Mϕs. However, when Mϕs were activated with LPS following the initial 6-h Mϕ-parasite contact, the intracellular parasite killing capacity of RAW Nramp-1 Mϕs was greatly increased as a result of higher NO production.

To investigate the structural basis for substrate recognition and catalysis, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of PtlH in several complexes with the cofactors iron, alpha-ketoglutarate, and the non-reactive enantiomer of the substrate, ent-1-deoxypentalenic acid, in four different crystal forms to up to 1.31 A resolution. The overall structure of PtlH forms a double-stranded barrel helix fold, and the cofactor-binding site for iron and alpha-ketoglutarate is similar to other double-stranded barrel helix fold enzymes. Additional secondary structure elements that contribute to the substrate-binding site in PtlH are not conserved in other double-stranded barrel helix fold enzymes. Binding of the substrate enantiomer induces a reorganization of the monoclinic crystal lattice leading to a disorder-order transition of a C-terminal alpha-helix. The newly formed helix blocks the major access to the active site and effectively traps the bound substrate. Kinetic analysis of wild type and site-directed mutant proteins confirms a critical function of two arginine residues in substrate binding, while simulated docking of the enzymatic reaction product reveals the likely orientation of bound substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2081167817,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a versatile and ubiquitous family of membrane receptors that transmit extracellular signals to mammalian cells and constitute the most important class of drug targets. Yet, sensitive and specific methods are lacking that would allow quantitative comparisons of pharmacologic properties of these receptors in physiological or pathological settings in live animals. We sought to overcome these limitations by employing low affinity, reversible beta-galactosidase complementation to quantify GPCR activation via interaction with beta-arrestin. A panel of cell lines was engineered expressing different GPCRs together with the reporter system. In vitro evaluation revealed highly sensitive, dynamic, and specific assessment of GPCR agonists and antagonists. Following implantation of the cells into mice, it was possible for the first time to monitor pharmacological GPCR activation and inhibition in their physiological context by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging in living animals. This technology has unique advantages that enable novel applications in the functional investigation of GPCR modulation in live animals in biological research and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2106125063,"Ubiquitination of ENaC subunits has been shown to negatively regulate the cell surface expression of ENaC channels. We have previously demonstrated that epsin links ubiquitinated ENaC to clathrin adaptors for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Epsin is thought to directly modify the curvature of membranes upon binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) where it recruits clathrin and stimulates lattice assembly. Murine phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (PI5KIα) has been shown to enhance endocytosis in a PIP2-dependent manner. We tested the hypothesis that PI5KIα-mediated PIP2 production would negatively regulate ENaC current by enhancing epsin-mediated endocytosis of the channel. Expression of PI5KIα decreased ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes by 80%, entirely because of a decrease in cell surface ENaC levels. Catalytically inactive mutants of PI5Kα had no effect on ENaC activity. Expression of the PIP2 binding region of epsin increased ENaC current in oocytes, an effect completely reversed by co-expression of PI5KIα. Overexpression of epsin reduced amiloride-sensitive current in CCD cells. Overexpression of PI5KIα enhanced membrane PIP2 levels and reduced apical surface expression of ENaC in CCD cells, down-regulating amiloride-sensitive current. Knockdown of PI5KIα with isoform-specific siRNA resulted in a 4-fold enhancement of ENaC activity. PI5KIα localized exclusively to the apical plasma membrane domain when overexpressed in mouse CCD cells, consistent for a role in regulating PIP2 production at the apical plasma membrane. We conclude that membrane turnover events regulating ENaC surface expression and activity in oocytes and CCD cells can be regulated by PI5KIα.

ENaC activity is critical to the physiological maintenance of Na+ homeostasis, volume regulation, and thus, systemic blood pressure (1Swift P.A. MacGregor G.A. Am. J.

Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because of its central role in responding to extreme changes in Na+ intake, ENaC transport rates are tightly regulated and defects in the channel or factors regulating the channel result in inherited forms of hypertension and hypotension. Key modulating factors in controlling epithelial Na+ transport are regulation of the mechanisms that facilitate ENaC surface expression or Po. ENaC surface expression is regulated by a variety of hormonal and non-hormonal factors, including mineralocorticoids and insulin as well as osmotic changes (2Rossier B.C. Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Eaton D.C. Malik B. Saxena N.C. Al-Khalili O.K. Yue G. J. Membr.

The balance of membrane delivery and retrieval events are coordinated to regulate the number of channels available at the apical membrane for Na+ reabsorption (6Snyder P.M. Endocr.

Indeed, alterations in the removal of ENaC channel from the apical plasma membrane appear to be the underlying cause of Liddle's Syndrome (8Rotin D. Kanelis V. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F391-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, identifying the factors that control insertion, retrieval, and recycling of membrane channels will aid in our understanding of the complex action of hormones, physiological and pathological conditions that are associated with altered channel expression or activity. epithelial Na+ channel phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase hemagglutinin thin layer chromatography bovine serum albumin green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline epithelial Na+ channel phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase hemagglutinin thin layer chromatography bovine serum albumin green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline It is widely accepted that ENaC surface expression is negatively regulated by ubiquitination (9Snyder P.M.

Elegant studies have revealed that the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 binds to a consensus PPXY motif in the C terminus of ENaC subunits and mediates the ubiquitination of lysine residues on the N terminus of the α- and γ-subunits of ENaC in MDCK cells (14Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Malik B. Yue Q. Yue G. Chen X. Price S.R. Mitch W.E. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of membrane proteins serves as a signal for retrieval of these proteins from the cell surface into the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (16Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that ENaC binds to epsin, which facilitates the internalization of ubiquitinated ENaC from the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (17Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J. Kester L. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Kleyman T.R. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14129-14135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Epsin is thought to directly modify the curvature of membranes upon binding to PIP2 where it recruits clathrin and stimulates lattice assembly (18Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 19Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The rate of clathrin-mediated endocytosis appears to be influenced by PIP2 metabolism in a variety of ways. PIP2 has been shown to increase the affinity of AP-2 complexes for the internalization signals of a variety of cargo molecules (20Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). AP-2, which, like epsin, functions to promote clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, also contains PIP2 selective domains and mutations in the PIP2 binding regions of epsin or the μ2 subunit of AP-2 interfere with endocytosis (21Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). PIP2 clearly participates in the regulation of numerous cell processes in addition to endocytosis. Proteins responsible for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangement are recruited to specific membranes via their interactions with PIP2 (23Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a diverse class of ion channels and transporters can be regulated by direct interaction with PIP2 and/or are sensitive to dynamic changes in PIP2 concentrations at the plasma membrane (25Hilgemann D.W. Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci. STKE. 2001. 2001; : RE19Google Scholar). Indeed, PIP2 has been implicated in the up-regulation of ENaC activity by effects on exocytosis of channels or by direct effects on Po (26Yue G. Malik B. Yue G. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11965-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Staruschenko A. Nichols A. Medina J.L. Camacho P. Zheleznova N.N. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F949-F957Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The versatility assigned to PIP2 suggests that there are spatially and temporally regulated pools of PIP2 in the plasma membrane. Generation of PIP2 at the plasma membrane can be accomplished by the three isoforms of the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PI5Ks) α, β, and γ (31Blazer-Yost B.L. Butterworth M. Hartman A.D. Parker G.E. Faletti C.J. Els W.J. Rhodes S.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C624-C632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse and human nomenclature for the α and β isoforms are reversed; for these studies we used the murine cDNA for PI5Kα. With regard to endocytosis, the activity of all three isoforms appears to influence the rate of internalization in various cell types. The assembly of the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex to the plasma membrane has been shown to be influenced by the activity of both the murine α and γ isoforms of PI5K (32Padron D. Wang Y.J. Yamamoto M. Yin H. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Bairstow S.F. Ling K. Su X. Firestone A.J. Carbonara C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20632-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At the synapse, a very active area of rapid endocytosis, PI5KIγ has been shown to be the predominant enzyme involved in PIP2 production (34Wenk M.R. Pellegrini L. Klenchin V.A. Di P.G. Chang S. Daniell L. Arioka M. Martin T.F. De C.P. Neuron. 2001; 32: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PIP2 production via murine PI5KIβ has been shown to increase the regulated process of internalization of EGF receptors, whereas PI5KIα has no effect in fibroblasts (35Barbieri M.A. Heath C.M. Peters E.M. Wells A. Davis J.N. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47212-47216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most recently, the direct interaction of type I PI5Ks with AP-2 complexes has been shown to stimulate PI5K activity and the PI5KIγ isoform has been shown to interact with AP-2 complexes and regulate endocytosis of transferrin (33Bairstow S.F.

Haucke V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The majority of these studies were performed in nonpolarized cells or have examined the traffic of basolateral cargo only. It is not clearly known which isoforms are physiologically relevant to apical trafficking in polarized epithelial cells or those which contribute to the balance of ENaC turnover at the apical plasma membrane. The following experiments were designed to test whether modulation of PIP2 levels via PI5KIα functions to regulate ENaC surface expression and activity in native epithelial cells. Cell Culture and Adenoviral Expression—mpkCCDc14 cells (CCD cells) were derived from the cortical collecting ducts of SV40 transformed mice and were the generous gift of Alain Vandewalle (37Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCD cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 with 2% fetal bovine serum as previously described. For adenovirus infection, cultured CCD cells were grown on 12-mm transwells (0.4-μm pore; Costar, Cambridge, MA), rinsed extensively with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C on 50-μl drops of PBS-containing recombinant adenoviruses and 150 μl of PBS/virus on the apical surface of the transwell, using a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100. Recombinant adenovirus encoding the constitutive expression of the tetracycline-repressible transactivator at an m.o.i. of 50 was included in all experiments to enable doxycycline-repressible synthesis of appropriate PI5KIα tagged with an HA epitope (38Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2477-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following infection, cells were incubated in complete media supplemented with 20 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were rinsed in complete media and incubated for 16 h in the absence of doxycycline to allow for expression of PI5KIα constructs. Infection efficiency was visualized by immunofluorescence with anti-HA antibodies and was estimated at greater than 90% for all viruses. DNA and Replication-defective Recombinant Adenoviruses—The cDNA for murine PI5KIα was kindly provided by Chris Carpenter (Harvard Medical School). This construct was utilized for the generation and purification of replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses (AVs) encoding the tetracycline-repressible construct encoding PI5KIα as described (39Guerriero C.J. Weixel K.M. Bruns J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis to generate the D227A and D203A mutations was performed in the pAdtet PI5KIα cDNA construct by using the QuikChange™ system (Stratagene). Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Complementary RNAs (cRNA) for wild-type and mutant constructs were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit employing T3 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGE mMachine, Ambion Inc, Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes (stage V-VI) were pretreated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IV) in calcium-free saline solution. Murine ENaC cRNAs (1–3 ng/subunit in 50 nl of H20) were microinjected into all oocytes. Oocytes in the experimental group were additionally injected with 5 ng of cRNA of the indicated PI5KIα constructs. All oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS: 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate). Whole cell currents were measured 24–46 h after cRNA injections. Similar experiments were performed using ROMK cRNA (2 ng) injected into oocytes. Whole Cell Measurements—A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used as preciously described. Whole cell inward amiloride-sensitive currents were measured in control oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC alone or experimental oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC with appropriate PI5KIα constructs using a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and a TEV 200A voltage Clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 7.0 (Axon Instruments). Amiloride-sensitive currents were defined as the difference of current in the absence and the presence of 0.1 mm amiloride. Membrane potentials were clamped from -140 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments with duration of 900 ms. Currents were measured at a holding potential of -100 mV, 600 ms after initiation of the clamp potential. For ROMK measurements, oocytes were bathed in a 45 mm K+ solution (45 mm KCl, 45 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Voltage sensing and current injecting microelectrodes had resistances of 0.5–1.5 MΩ when backfilled with 3 m KCl. Once a stable membrane potential was attained, oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of -20 mV and currents were recorded during 500 ms voltage steps, ranging from -100 mV to +40 mV in 20 mV increments. Data were collected using an ITC16 analog-to-digital, digital-to-analogue converter (Instrutech Corp.), filtered at 1 kHz and digitized on line at 2 kHz using Pulse software (HEKA Electronik) for later analysis. Data shown are based on the average maximum current, measured at -100 mV. Cell Surface ENaC and ROMK Labeling—Plasma membrane expression of the external HA-tagged ROMK channel and external FLAG-tagged ENaC was measured in single oocytes following procedures outlined as previously reported (40Lebowitz J.

In these studies, oocytes were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in oocytes Ringers for 15 min. at 4 °C and washed four times in oocytes Ringers. To block spurious antibody binding, oocytes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in MBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Exposed HA or FLAG epitopes on the surface of intact oocytes were labeled with a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Roche 3F10, 1% BSA, 4 °C, overnight) or 1 mg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. Oocytes were washed with MBS containing 1% BSA, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rat or goat anti-mouse (1 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories, 1% BSA, 1.5 h). After extensive washing, individual oocytes were placed in chemiluminescence substrate as described (41Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Luminescence from single oocytes was measured as described previously (40Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S.

Cell Surface Biotinylation—The cell surface pool of ENaC was determined by surface biotinylation as described (42Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, CCD cells cultured on Transwells were washed (5 min) with ice-cold PBS with agitation on ice to remove growth media. Apical domain selective biotinylation was performed in borate buffer (85 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 15 mm Na2B4O7, pH9) for 20 min. The basolateral surface was incubated in growth medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) to prevent biotinylation. The biotinylation was quenched by FBS incubation and PBS washing. Monolayers were lysed (0.4% DCA, 1% Non-idet P-40, 50 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 10 min. Protein concentration of the postnuclear supernatant was determined, and 200 μg of protein was combined with a streptavidin bead slurry (Pierce Chemical Co.) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were collected in 2× sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Equal concentrations of cell lysate were analyzed in parallel to determine total the total cellular pool of ENaC. Indirect Immunofluorescence—CCD cells grown on transwell filters were infected with tet-responsive adenoviruses encoding HA epitope-tagged PI5KIα and/or a GFP-tagged PH domain from PLCδ and the tetracycline-repressible transactivator at a m.o.i. 100 as described above. Following infection and expression of the adenovirus, cells were rinsed in PBS and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Briefly, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde using a pH-shift protocol as described (43Leung S.M. Rojas R. Maples C. Flynn C. Ruiz W.G. Jou T.S. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4369-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged PI5KIα was visualized using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:500) (Covance) and AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (1:500) (Molecular Probes), ZO-1 was visualized using rat anti-ZO-1 hybridoma supernatant R40.76 (1:10) and AlexaFluor secondary antibody (1:500) (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired using a Leica TCL-SL confocal microscope equipped with argon and green and red helium neon lasers (Leica, Dearfield, IL). Images were taken with a 100× (1.4 numerical aperture) plan apochromat oil objective and the appropriate filter combination. The images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were saved in a tag-information-file-format (TIFF), and image contrast was adjusted in the Photoshop program (Adobe, Mountain View, CA). Thin Layer Chromatography Analysis of Phospholipids—Lipid analysis was performed essentially as described in Ref. 44Bruns J.R. Ellis M.A. Jeromin A. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2012-2018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Xenopus oocytes expressing appropriate cDNAs were incubated overnight with [32P]orthophosphate in modified Barth's media. The following morning samples were washed 1× with modified Barth's to remove unincorporated 32P. Oocytes were homogenized in 300 μl of 1 n HCl, and lipids were extracted as described below. AV-infected CCD cells grown on 6-cm dishes were starved in phosphate-free buffer for 30 min, radiolabeled for 4 h with 40 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN). Cells were rinsed gently in ice-cold buffer and scraped into a 4:3:3 mixture of CHCl3/CH3OH/1 n HCl. The organic phase was washed with equal volumes of CH3OH and 1 n HCl. Aliquots were counted using a scintillation counter, and equal counts/min were spotted onto oxalate-treated Silica gel 60 TLC plates (EM Science) and developed in 1-propyl alcohol, 2 m acetic acid; H2O (63:4: 33). Authentic lipid standards (Avanti Polar Lipids) were included in all experiments and visualized using iodine vapor. Radiolabeled products were visualized and quantitated using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Internalization of IgA—IgA was radioiodinated using the iodine monochloride method as described (45Breitfeld P.P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Meth. Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of 125I-IgA was performed essentially as described by Apodaca et al. (46Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 125I-IgA applied either to the basolateral or apical surface on ice for 1.5 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold media and incubated in prewarmed 37 °C media in a water bath for appropriate time points. After each time point, 125I-IgA that was not internalized from the cell surface was removed by treating the cells with 25 mg/ml l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl-ketone-treated trypsin. The filters were washed and removed from the insert, and the amount of cell-associated 125I-IgA and that which was removed by washing and trypsin treatment were determined using a gamma counter (Packard Instrument, Downers Grove, IL) as described (46Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). An equal number of mock-infected CCD cells not expressing the pIgR were treated identically to determine nonspecific IgA uptake, and these values were subtracted from those of the pIgR-infected CCD cells. After the final time point, filters were cut out of the insert, and the amount of 125I-IgA in all samples was determined using a gamma counter. An equal number of mock-infected CCD cells not expressing the pIgR were treated identically to determine nonspecific IgA uptake, and these values were subtracted from those of the pIgR-infected CCD cells. Overexpression of Epsin—Mouse CCD cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged epsin construct (provided by Linton Traub, University of Pittsburgh) using Lipofectamine 2000 standard protocol. The following day, the cells were taken up by trypsin treatment, pelleted with a brief low speed centrifugation, and plated on 12-mm filter inserts (Transwells) at superconfluency. Two days later, the cells were used for electrophysiological or biochemical measurements. siRNA of PIP5Kα—Approximately 2 × 106 of 80–90% confluent cells were resuspended in nucleofector T solution and 2 pmol (final concentration) of siRNA specific for PI5K Iα (Dharmacon), mixed in the cuvette and directly placed in the nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems). The siRNA oligonucleotides were electroporated into the cells using program K-29. An equal volume of warm culture media was added, and the cell suspension plated on a plastic 12-well plate containing 2 ml of culture media. The following day, the cells were trypsinized and plated on 12-mm filter inserts (Transwells) at superconfluency. Two days later, the cells were used for electrophysiological or biochemical study. The effect of PI5KIα-mediated PIP2 production on ENaC activity was initially examined using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. To determine to what extent PIP2 production was modified in oocytes expressing PI5KIα, lipids were extracted from oocytes injected with PI5KIα or control cRNAs and examined by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1A PI5KIα induced a 40% increase in steady state PIP2 production in oocytes compared with control. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents were measured in oocytes coinjected with cRNAs for αβγ ENaC and PI5KIα. Co-expression of PI5KIα with αβγ ENaC reduced amiloride-sensitive current by 80% (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the effect of PI5KIα on ENaC surface activity is due to modulation of PIP2 production, we examined the effect of catalytically inactive mutants PI5KIαD227A (47Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H.

Carpenter, personal communication. on ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes. Co-expression of either mutant with ENaC has no effect on amiloride-sensitive currents compared with control oocytes expressing ENaC subunits alone (Fig. 1B), indicating that the catalytic activity of PI5KIα is necessary for the down-regulation of ENaC channel activity. PIP2 has been shown to enhance endocytic and exocytic events to control steady state levels of proteins in the plasma membrane. To determine whether the PI5KIα-mediated reduction in ENaC activity is caused by differences in"

The evidence that NF-κB is dispensable for HIV-1 expression raises the question of whether IκB-α represses the HIV-1 transcription by mechanisms distinct from NF-κB inhibition. Here, we report that IκB-α negatively regulates the HIV-1 expression and replication in an NF-κB-independent manner by directly binding to Tat, which results in the nuclear export and cytoplasmic sequestration of the viral transactivator. The sequence of IκB-α required for Tat inhibition spans from amino acids 72 to 287 and includes the nuclear localization signal, the carboxyl-terminal nuclear export signal, and the binding site for the arginine-rich domain of Tat. This novel mechanism of cross-talk between Tat and IκB-α provides further insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 regulation and could assist in the development of novel strategies for AIDS therapy.

Upon NF-κB-activating stimuli, IκB-α is phosphorylated at serines 32 and 36 by the IκB kinase complex, ubiquitinated at lysines 21 and 22, and proteolyzed by the 26 S proteasome (18Ghosh S. Karin M.

Following the proteolysis of IκB-α, the free NF-κB complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the κB sites and activates the transcription of the NF-κB-dependent genes, including the IκB-α gene (18Ghosh S.

The newly synthesized IκB-α migrates to the nucleus, where it displaces the NF-κB complex from DNA and promotes its nuclear export, thus terminating the NF-κB transcriptional activity (29Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Consistent with these findings, we showed that NL-IκB-M, a recombinant HIV-1 strain expressing the IκB-αS32/36A gene integrated in the nef region, is strongly repressed at the transcriptional level and highly attenuated (37Quinto I.

In that study, the inhibition of HIV-1 by IκB-αS32/36A was ascribed to the repression of the NF-κB-dependent expression of HIV-1. However, this mechanism accounts partially for the HIV-1 transcriptional inhibition because viral strains lacking the NF-κB enhancer are competent for transcription and replication (38Leonard J.

The evidence that NF-κB is dispensable for the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 raises the question of whether IκB-α represses other transcription factors, which differ from NF-κB and are required for HIV-1 expression. To test this possibility, we have analyzed the functional and physical interactions of IκB-α with the HIV-1 Tat transactivator, which is indispensable for viral replication (41Dayton A.I.

Here, we report that IκB-α binds to Tat and promotes its nuclear export to the cytoplasm. According to this novel evidence, IκB-α acts as a potent repressor of HIV-1 transcription by inhibiting both the NF-κB and Tat transacting factors, which are major players in the transcriptional activation and elongation of HIV-1 transcripts.

The cells were transfected with DNA by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and the total amounts of DNA were equalized by transfection of pRc/CMV empty vector (Invitrogen). For luciferase assays, pSV-β-gal plasmid (0.2 μg) was co-transfected with the pLTRluc plasmids to monitor the transfection efficiency. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer of Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix, Bedford, MA).

The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained genomic DNA (200 ng), primers (600 nm), and 1× iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was performed by using iCycler Apparatus (Bio-Rad). After an initial denaturation step (95 °C for 8 min), the cycling profile for total HIV-1 DNA was 50 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 6 s. Viral DNA was normalized to cellular genomic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primers were as follows: MH531, TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGT; MH532, GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAGC; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. The HIV-1 DNA copy number was measured as reported (46Brussel A. Sonigo P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Viral Stocks and Cell Culture Infection—293-T cells were transfected with viral plasmids, and the viral production was measured by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Jurkat cells (5 × 104 cells) were infected with p24 (0.3 ng) of viral stocks, and the cell supernatants were collected every 3 days for p24 assay; equal volumes of fresh medium were replaced into the cultures at the same time. Statistical Analysis—The data were reported as the means ± S.E. and the statistical significance of differences between means was assessed by using the two-tail unpaired Student's t test. The differences between the means were accepted as statistically significant at the 95% level (p = 0.05). Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells (5 × 106) were harvested, washed in cold PBS, and lysed on ice in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and aliquots of proteins were resuspended in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 1% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol), resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase-linked mouse or rabbit IgG (1:2000) (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). The proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. The primary antibodies were as follows: anti-HA (F7), anti-GST (B-14), anti-IκB-α (C-15), and normal mouse serum from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG M2 and anti-γ-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (Asp214) antibody from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). GST Pulldown—GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as previously described (43Ambrosino C. Ruocco M.R. Chen X. Mallardo M. Baudi F. Trematerra S. Quinto I. Venuta S. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14883-14892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures (500 ml) were grown to exponential phase and induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h to express GST fusion proteins. The bacteria were lysed by sonication in buffer A (1× PBS, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in buffer A. After incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed five times with buffer A and subjected to a high salt wash (0.8 m NaCl) to free the fusion proteins from contaminating bacterial nucleic acids (47Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were eluted with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 10 mm glutathione and 1 mm DTT. The eluted GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (1× PBS, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), and aliquots (5-10 μg) were conjugated with glutathione-Sepharose (20 μl) in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 3% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free). The GST fusion proteins conjugated with glutathione-Sepharose were collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and aliquots (5-10 μg) were incubated with cell extracts (200 μg) in 500 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 1 μg/μl of bovine serum albumin on a rocking platform for 3 h at 4 °C. To remove nucleic acids, the cell extracts were treated with micrococcal nuclease (0,2 unit/μl) for 30 min at 28 °C. Protein complexes were collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed in binding buffer, and resuspended in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 1% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol). The proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The pcDNA3 plasmids expressing the IκB genes under the T7 promoter were used as templates to translate in vitro the [35S]methionine-labeled IκB proteins by using the TnT Quick Coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega). Aliquots (10 μl) of translation mixture were incubated with GST-Tat or GST proteins (10 μg) in 500 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 1 μg/μl of bovine serum albumin on a rocking platform for 3 h at room temperature. Following GST pulldown, the proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting with antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were performed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture EDTA-free. Antibodies (2.5 μg) were preincubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (20 μl) in 50 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS containing 2% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture EDTA-free) overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The protein G-Sepharose-coupled antibodies were incubated with cell extract (500 μg) in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed in immunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in SDS gel loading buffer. The proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described (48Liu W. Quinto I. Chen X. Palmieri C. Rabin R.L. Schwartz O.M. Nelson D.L. Scala G. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips, fixed, and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cyto-Perm kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). To visualize FLAG-Tat and HA-IκB-α, the immunostaining was performed with anti-FLAG-M2-FITC mAb (F-4049; Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-HA rabbit antiserum (SC-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor568 (A11011; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (T3605; Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides by using ProLong Antifade Kit (P7481; Molecular Probes). The images were collected on a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Mycrosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a 63× Apo PLA oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) and 60-μm aperture. Z stacks of images were collected using a step increment of 0.2 μm between planes. FLAG-Tat was visualized by excitation with an argon laser at 488 nm and photomultiplier tube voltage of 420 mV. HA-IκB-α was detected using a krypton laser at 568 nm and photomultiplier tube voltage of 650 mV. The nuclei were detected using a krypton laser at 613 nm and photomultiplier tube voltage of 450 mV. Single optical sections using 4X averaging were acquired by sequential scanning to collect the images in three channels. For quantitative analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels, horizontal sections scanned through the nucleus and cytoplasm of thirty representative cells were evaluated. Fluorescence-based assessment of protein levels was performed by image analysis using the LEICA Scan TCS-SP2 software (Leica Mycrosystems). Quantization was performed on 8-bit gray scale images with no saturated pixels. The mean nuclear or cytoplasmic fluorescence was measured as the ratio between total fluorescence/total pixels at the nuclear or cytoplasmic level in individual cells. The relative nuclear or cytoplasmic fluorescence was calculated as the ratio between the mean nuclear or cytoplasmic fluorescence and the mean fluorescence of the whole cell (49Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37941-37949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). IκB-α Represses the Tat-mediated Transactivation and Replication of HIV-1 Independently of NF-κB Activity—To determine the effect of IκB-α on the transcriptional activity of Tat, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the luciferase gene under the control of the wild type or NF-κB- or Sp1-deleted HIV-1 LTR in the presence or absence of Tat and IκB-α. In agreement with previous observations (39Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 139-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion of the NF-κB or Sp1 sites significantly reduced the basal expression (Fig. 1A) and the Tat-mediated transactivation (Fig. 1, B-D) of the HIV-1 LTR. IκB-α inhibited the Tat transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 80% for the wild type LTR (Fig. 1B) and 60% in the case of NF-κB-deleted LTR (Fig. 1C). The evidence that IκB-α inhibited"
https://openalex.org/W2012009763,"Background The availability of large collections of microarray datasets (compendia), or knowledge about grouping of genes into pathways (gene sets), is typically not exploited when training predictors of disease outcome. These can be useful since a compendium increases the number of samples, while gene sets reduce the size of the feature space. This should be favorable from a machine learning perspective and result in more robust predictors. Methodology We extracted modules of regulated genes from gene sets, and compendia. Through supervised analysis, we constructed predictors which employ modules predictive of breast cancer outcome. To validate these predictors we applied them to independent data, from the same institution (intra-dataset), and other institutions (inter-dataset). Conclusions We show that modules derived from single breast cancer datasets achieve better performance on the validation data compared to gene-based predictors. We also show that there is a trend in compendium specificity and predictive performance: modules derived from a single breast cancer dataset, and a breast cancer specific compendium perform better compared to those derived from a human cancer compendium. Additionally, the module-based predictor provides a much richer insight into the underlying biology. Frequently selected gene sets are associated with processes such as cell cycle, E2F regulation, DNA damage response, proteasome and glycolysis. We analyzed two modules related to cell cycle, and the OCT1 transcription factor, respectively. On an individual basis, these modules provide a significant separation in survival subgroups on the training and independent validation data."
https://openalex.org/W2055307936,"B. anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax. Pathogenesis is primarily mediated through the exotoxins lethal factor and edema factor, which bind protective antigen (PA) to gain entry into the host cell. The current anthrax vaccine (AVA, Biothrax™) consists of aluminum-adsorbed cell-free filtrates of unencapsulated B. anthracis, wherein PA is thought to be the principle target of neutralization. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the natural adjuvant, C3d, versus alum in eliciting an anti-PA humoral response and found that C3d conjugation to PA and emulsion in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) imparted superior protection from anthrax challenge relative to PA in IFA or PA adsorbed to alum. Relative to alum-PA, immunization of mice with C3d-PA/IFA augmented both the onset and sustained production of PA-specific antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding portion (domain 4) of PA. C3d-PA/IFA was efficacious when administered either i.p. or s.c., and in adolescent mice lacking a fully mature B cell compartment. Induction of PA-specific antibodies by C3d-PA/IFA correlated with increased efficiency of germinal center formation and plasma cell generation. Importantly, C3d-PA immunization effectively protected mice from intranasal challenge with B. anthracis spores, and was approximately 10-fold more effective than alum-PA immunization or PA/IFA based on dose challenge. These data suggest that incorporation of C3d as an adjuvant may overcome shortcomings of the currently licensed aluminum-based vaccine, and may confer protection in the early days following acute anthrax exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1975923858,"The isolation of arboviruses from patient's low titer sera can be difficult. Here we compared the detection efficiency of Dengue (DEN), Yellow Fever (YF), Saint Louis Encephalitis (SLE), West Nile (WN), Ilheus (ILH), Group C (GC), Oropouche (ORO), Mayaro (MAY) and Venezuela Encephalitis Equine (VEE) viruses using a Modified Shell Vial Culture (MSVC) protocol to a Standard Cell Culture (SCC) protocol. First the MSVC and SCC protocols were compared using five dilutions for each of the following stock viruses: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4, YF, SLE, WN, ILH, GC, ORO, MAY and VEE. Next, patients' original sera from which viruses (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, YF, GC, ORO, MAY and VEE) had been previously isolated were compare by the two methods using five sera dilutions. In addition, seven sera that were positive for DEN-3 by RT-PCR and negative by SCC were processed by MSVC. The MSVC protocol was consistently 1-2 logs higher virus dilution more sensitive for virus detection than the SCC protocol for all stock Flaviviruses tested (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4, YF, SLE, WN and ILH). MSVC was equal to or one log more sensitive for virus detection than SCC for the stock Bunyaviruses (GC and ORO). For the stock Alphavirus MAY, MSVC was equally or one log more sensitive for virus detection than SCC, while for VEE SCC was equally or one log more sensitive for virus detection than MSVC. MSVC was consistently one to two sera dilutions more sensitive than SCC for the detection of Flaviviruses from patients' sera. Both methods were approximately equally sensitive for the detection of Bunyaviruses from patients' sera and equal or one dilution less sensitive for the detection of Alphaviruses from patients' sera. Additionally, MSVC detected DEN virus in five of seven DEN-3 RT-PCR positive, SCC negative patients' sera."
https://openalex.org/W2011232802,"The G-protein-coupled receptor B1 family includes corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), growth hormone-releasing hormone, incretin, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptors. The three-dimensional NMR structure of the first extracellular domain (ECD1) of CRF receptor 2beta (CRF-R2beta), free and complexed with astressin, comprises a Sushi domain. This domain is stabilized in part by a salt bridge between Asp(65) and Arg(101). Analogous residues are conserved in other members of the B1 family. To address the importance of the salt bridge residues within this receptor family, we studied the effects of mutating the residues in full-length CRF-R2beta and isolated ECD1. Mutation D65A or D65R/R101D resulted in loss of the canonical disulfide arrangement, whereas R101A retained the Cys(4)-Cys(6) disulfide bond. The mutations resulted in misfolding within the ECD1 as determined by NMR and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate binding but did not prevent cell surface expression. The D65A mutation in CRF-R2beta greatly reduced binding and activation, but the R101A substitution had only a small effect. Similar effects were seen on astressin binding to the ECD1. The different interactions of Asp(65) and Arg(101), deduced from the three-dimensional structure of the complex, are consistent with the differential effects seen in the mutants. The reduction in binding of Asp(65) mutants is a consequence of a distinct Asp(65)-Trp(71) interaction, which stabilizes the ligand-binding loop. Hence, loss of the salt bridge leads to disruption of the overall fold but does not abolish function. Because homologous mutations in other B1 receptors produce similar effects, these conserved residues may play similar roles in the entire receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W2164835383,"Over the past decade many linkage studies have defined chromosomal intervals containing polymorphisms that modulate a variety of traits. Many phenotypes are now associated with enough mapping data that meta-analysis could help refine locations of known QTLs and detect many novel QTLs.We describe a simple approach to combining QTL mapping results for multiple studies and demonstrate its utility using two hippocampus weight loci. Using data taken from two populations, a recombinant inbred strain set and an advanced intercross population we demonstrate considerable improvements in significance and resolution for both loci. 1-LOD support intervals were improved 51% for Hipp1a and 37% for Hipp9a. We first generate locus-wise permuted P-values for association with the phenotype from multiple maps, which can be done using a permutation method appropriate to each population. These results are then assigned to defined physical positions by interpolation between markers with known physical and genetic positions. We then use Fisher's combination test to combine position-by-position probabilities among experiments. Finally, we calculate genome-wide combined P-values by generating locus-specific P-values for each permuted map for each experiment. These permuted maps are then sampled with replacement and combined. The distribution of best locus-specific P-values for each combined map is the null distribution of genome-wide adjusted P-values.Our approach is applicable to a wide variety of segregating and non-segregating mapping populations, facilitates rapid refinement of physical QTL position, is complementary to other QTL fine mapping methods, and provides an appropriate genome-wide criterion of significance for combined mapping results."
https://openalex.org/W1970361231,"Shp2 has been known to mediate growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation, but its role in cell survival is less clear. Gain-of-function Shp2 mutants such as Shp2E76K are associated with myeloid leukemias. We found that Shp2E76K could transform cytokine-dependent human TF-1 myeloid cells into cytokine independence and further characterized the Shp2E76K-induced cell survival mechanism in this study. Expression of Shp2E76K suppressed the cytokine withdrawal-induced intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which is controlled by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins showed that Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were up-regulated in Shp2E76K-transformed TF-1 (TF-1/Shp2E76K) cells. Knockdown of Bcl-XL but not Mcl-1 with short hairpin RNAs prevented Shp2E76K-induced cytokine-independent survival. Roscovitine, which down-regulated Mcl-1, also did not prevent cytokine-independent survival of TF-1/Shp2E76K cells, whereas the Bcl-XL inhibitor HA14-1 did. Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (Erk1/2) were constitutively activated in TF-1/Shp2E76K cells, whereas little active Akt was detected under cytokine-free conditions. Shp2E76K-induced Bcl-XL expression was suppressed by Mek inhibitors and by a dominant-negative Mek1 mutant but not by the phosphoinositide 3-phosphate inhibitor LY294002 and the Akt inhibitor API-2. Inhibition of Erk1/2 blocked cytokine-independent survival of TF-1/Shp2E76K cells, whereas inhibition of Akt had a minimal effect on cytokine-independent survival of TF-1/Shp2E76K cells. These results show that Shp2E76K can evoke constitutive Erk1/2 activation in TF-1 cells. Furthermore, Shp2E76K induces cytokine-independent survival of TF-1 cells by a novel mechanism involving up-regulation of Bcl-XL through the Erk1/2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2084333552,"As part of an island-wide project to identify and eradicate potentially invasive plant species before they become established, a program of inventories is being carried out in the urban and agricultural zones of the four inhabited islands in Galapagos. This study reports the results of the inventory from Puerto Villamil, a coastal village representing the urban zone of Isabela Island. We visited all 1193 village properties to record the presence of the introduced plants. In addition, information was collected from half of the properties to determine evidence for potential invasiveness of the plant species. We recorded 261 vascular taxa, 13 of which were new records for Galapagos. Most of the species were intentionally grown (cultivated) (73.3%) and used principally as ornamentals. The most frequent taxa we encountered were Cocos nucifera (coconut tree) (22.1%) as a cultivated plant and Paspalum vaginatum (salt water couch) (13.2%) as a non cultivated plant. In addition 39 taxa were naturalized. On the basis of the invasiveness study, we recommend five species for eradication (Abutilon dianthum, Datura inoxia, Datura metel, Senna alata and Solanum capsicoides), one species for hybridization studies (Opuntia ficus-indica) and three species for control (Furcraea hexapetala, Leucaena leucocephala and Paspalum vaginatum)."
https://openalex.org/W2084587199,"Peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells from patients with transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) deficiency are hyporesponsive. The mechanism of this defect is unknown, but the phenotype of TAP-deficient NK cells is almost normal. However, we noticed a high percentage of CD56bright cells among total NK cells from two patients. We further investigated TAP-deficient NK cells in these patients and compared them to NK cells from two other TAP-deficient patients with no clinical symptoms and to individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases other than TAP deficiency (chronic lung diseases or vasculitis). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from venous blood were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and the phenotype of NK cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, 51Chromium release assays were performed to assess the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. In the symptomatic patients, CD56bright NK cells represented 28% and 45%, respectively, of all NK cells (higher than in healthy donors). The patients also displayed a higher percentage of CD56dimCD16− NK cells than controls. Interestingly, this unusual NK cell subtype distribution was not found in the two asymptomatic TAP-deficient cases, but was instead present in several of the other patients. Over-expression of the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A by TAP-deficient NK cells was confirmed and extended to the inhibitory receptor ILT2 (CD85j). These inhibitory receptors were not involved in regulating the cytotoxicity of TAP-deficient NK cells. We conclude that expansion of the CD56bright NK cell subtype in peripheral blood is not a hallmark of TAP deficiency, but can be found in other diseases as well. This might reflect a reaction of the immune system to pathologic conditions. It could be interesting to investigate the relative distribution of NK cell subsets in various respiratory and autoimmune diseases."
