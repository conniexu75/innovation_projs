https://openalex.org/W2084373725,"The interrogation of proteomes (""proteomics"") in a highly multiplexed and efficient manner remains a coveted and challenging goal in biology and medicine.We present a new aptamer-based proteomic technology for biomarker discovery capable of simultaneously measuring thousands of proteins from small sample volumes (15 µL of serum or plasma). Our current assay measures 813 proteins with low limits of detection (1 pM median), 7 logs of overall dynamic range (~100 fM-1 µM), and 5% median coefficient of variation. This technology is enabled by a new generation of aptamers that contain chemically modified nucleotides, which greatly expand the physicochemical diversity of the large randomized nucleic acid libraries from which the aptamers are selected. Proteins in complex matrices such as plasma are measured with a process that transforms a signature of protein concentrations into a corresponding signature of DNA aptamer concentrations, which is quantified on a DNA microarray. Our assay takes advantage of the dual nature of aptamers as both folded protein-binding entities with defined shapes and unique nucleotide sequences recognizable by specific hybridization probes. To demonstrate the utility of our proteomics biomarker discovery technology, we applied it to a clinical study of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We identified two well known CKD biomarkers as well as an additional 58 potential CKD biomarkers. These results demonstrate the potential utility of our technology to rapidly discover unique protein signatures characteristic of various disease states.We describe a versatile and powerful tool that allows large-scale comparison of proteome profiles among discrete populations. This unbiased and highly multiplexed search engine will enable the discovery of novel biomarkers in a manner that is unencumbered by our incomplete knowledge of biology, thereby helping to advance the next generation of evidence-based medicine."

We used neutron scattering to observe the influence of an electric current on the magnetic structure in a bulk material. In the skyrmion lattice of MnSi, where the spins form a lattice of magnetic vortices similar to the vortex lattice in type II superconductors, we observe the rotation of the diffraction pattern in response to currents which are over five orders of magnitude smaller than those typically applied in experimental studies on current-driven magnetization dynamics in nanostructures. We attribute our observations to an extremely efficient coupling of inhomogeneous spin currents to topologically stable knots in spin structures."

Now, after centuries of gradual improvements, fluorescence microscopy has made a quantum leap in its resolving power due, in large part, to advancements over the past several years in a new area of research called super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. In this Primer, we explain the principles of various super-resolution approaches, such as STED, (S)SIM, and STORM/(F)PALM. Then, we describe recent applications of super-resolution microscopy in cells, which demonstrate how these approaches are beginning to provide new insights into cell biology, microbiology, and neurobiology."

Using optogenetic techniques in transgenic mice, Witten et al.

Their excitation paradoxically reduced neighboring medium spiny neuron firing, while their inhibition increased medium spiny neuron firing. Furthermore, the giant interneurons were directly activated by cocaine, and silencing their drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure in freely behaving animals disrupted cocaine reward."

To maintain homeostasis, stem cells must respond to tissue needs. Here we show that in response to damage or stress in the intestinal (midgut) epithelium of adult Drosophila, multiple EGFR ligands and rhomboids (intramembrane proteases that activate some EGFR ligands) are induced, leading to the activation of EGFR signaling in intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Activation of EGFR signaling promotes ISC division and midgut epithelium regeneration, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis. ISCs defective in EGFR signaling cannot grow or divide, are poorly maintained, and cannot support midgut epithelium regeneration after enteric infection by the bacterium Pseudomonas entomophila. Furthermore, ISC proliferation induced by Jak/Stat signaling is dependent upon EGFR signaling. Thus the EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway plays central, essential roles in ISC maintenance and the feedback system that mediates intestinal homeostasis.

The discovery of resident somatic stem cells identified the source of the remarkable regenerating ability in some of adult human tissues, such as blood, skin, hair, and the digestive tract (Fuchs, 2009Fuchs E. The tortoise and the hair: slow-cycling cells in the stem cell race.Cell. 2009; 137: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, how stem cells respond to tissue needs remains poorly understood (Pellettieri and Sánchez Alvarado, 2007Pellettieri J. Sánchez Alvarado A. Cell turnover and adult tissue homeostasis: from humans to planarians.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In particular, how stem cells are activated (for growth, proliferation, and differentiation) to regenerate new tissues after tissue injury, stress, or normal wear and tear is still unclear in most cases. Homeostasis in the human small intestine and colon is mediated by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside in the crypts of Lieberkühn (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H.

Self-renewal and cancer of the gut: two sides of a coin.Science. 2005; 307: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). ISCs proliferate and differentiate to give rise to new functional epithelial cells in order to replenish cell loss from the villi. This dynamic process is intimately linked to the development of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the western world (Radtke and Clevers, 2005Radtke F. Clevers H. Self-renewal and cancer of the gut: two sides of a coin.Science. 2005; 307: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Oncological studies have established a genetic model for CRC development involving multiple steps: mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene result in the activation of WNT signaling, which promotes the formation of small adenomas in the form of polyps. Subsequent mutations in KRAS, BRAF, p53, MLH1, or TGF-β signaling promote the formation of carcinomas, and finally additional mutations drive tumor metastasis (Vogelstein et al., 1988Vogelstein B. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Kern S.E. Preisinger A.C. Leppert M. Nakamura Y. White R. Smits A.M. Bos J.L. Genetic alterations during colorectal-tumor development.N. Engl. J.

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is believed to be an early event in the development of colon adenomas. Ectopic activation of EGFR signaling can cause intestinal and colonic hyperplasia, a likely precursor to ademona formation (Calcagno et al., 2008Calcagno S.R. Li S. Colon M. Kreinest P.A.

Consistently, genetic studies have shown that ectopic activation of the EGFR pathway can accelerate tumor progression in the ApcMin/+ genetic background (Bilger et al., 2008Bilger A. Sullivan R.

Activating mutations in KRAS (codon 12, 13, or 61, which permanently lock it into the GTP-bound state) and BRAF (BRAFV600E) are among the most common mutations found in colon cancer samples (Andreyev et al., 1998Andreyev H.J.

Furthermore, partial loss of function of EGFR (Egfrwa2) severely impaired adenoma formation in Apcmin/+ mice (Roberts et al., 2002Roberts R.B. Min L. Washington M.K. Olsen S.J. Settle S.H.

USA. 2002; 99: 1521-1526Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR (panitumumab or cetuximab) are effective in treating CRC, provided that activating mutations in downstream KRAS or BRAF are not present, further emphasizing the critical role for EGFR signaling during CRC development (Amado et al., 2008Amado R.G.

Oncol. 2008; 26: 5705-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Developmentally, neonatal mice lacking EGFR function develop disorganized crypts in the gastrointestinal tract (Threadgill et al., 1995Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K. Harris R.C. et al.Targeted disruption of mouse EGF receptor: effect of genetic background on mutant phenotype.Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Despite these many indications of its importance, the precise functions of EGFR signaling in normal gut homeostasis in mammals are poorly understood, making studies in model systems like Drosophila potentially informative. As in the human intestine, the Drosophila adult midgut epithelium also undergoes rapid turnover, a dynamic process mediated by thousands of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A. The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In the fly midgut epithelium, basally localized intestinal stem cells divide, renew themselves, and give rise to progenitors called enteroblasts (EBs). In contrast to transit amplifying cells in mammalian intestinal crypts, Drosophila EBs appear not to proliferate, but directly differentiate into two conserved cell types, the absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and the secretory enteroendocrine cells (EE). Genetic studies show that the Drosophila Notch and WNT pathways play conserved roles in the self-renewal and proliferation of ISCs (Bardin et al., 2010Bardin A.J. Perdigoto C.N. Southall T.D.

With this simple model, we and others previously demonstrated a feedback regulatory mechanism for maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. In this case, cell loss, damage, or stress in the midgut epithelium triggers the expression of Unpaired (Upd) cytokines by differentiated enterocytes, and these signals activate Jak/Stat signaling in intestinal stem cells to promote their proliferation and differentiation (Amcheslavsky et al., 2009Amcheslavsky A.

Edgar B.A. Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling mediates regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut.Cell. 2009; 137: 1343-1355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This feedback provides a truly homeostatic mechanism for tissue maintenance in the Drosophila midgut and may explain in general how stem cells respond to tissue needs in other organs and organisms. In the present study we demonstrate that, in response to gut epithelial damage or stress in Drosophila, multiple EGFR ligands and several rhomboids are induced, and these activate the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway in ISCs. In parallel with Upd/Jak/Stat signaling, the activation of EGFR signaling promotes the proliferation of ISCs and their subsequent differentiation into mature midgut enterocytes, thus promoting gut self-renewal. To test whether EGFR signaling is induced in the regenerating Drosophila adult midgut, we assayed the expression of EGFR ligands in whole midguts via RT-qPCR. We induced midgut epithelium regeneration by expressing the cell death gene reaper (Rpr), or activated JNKK (Drosophila HepAct), or RNAi against puckered (puc; a feedback inhibitor of JNK signaling) in the enterocytes by means of the EC-specific-inducible Gal4 driver, MyoIAts. Alternatively, we fed flies a pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas entomophila (Pe). As we showed previously, EC apoptosis, JNK activation, and enteric Pe infection all induce compensatory ISC proliferation and midgut epithelial regeneration (Jiang et al., 2009Jiang H. Patel P.H. Kohlmaier A. Grenley M.O. McEwen D.G. Edgar B.A. Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling mediates regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut.Cell. 2009; 137: 1343-1355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We found that three Drosophila EGFR ligands, vein (vn), spitz (spi), and Keren (Krn), were induced in these regenerating midguts (Figure 1A ). Regenerating midguts also induced the expression of MAP Kinase Phosphatase 3 (MKP3), a downstream target of Drosophila EGFR signaling (Figure 1A). We examined the expression pattern of vn by using the vn-lacZ reporter. Weak expression was observed exclusively in the visceral muscle cells (VM) of control midguts, similar to its expression in the larval midgut (Figure 1B; Jiang and Edgar, 2009Jiang H. Edgar B.A. EGFR signaling regulates the proliferation of Drosophila adult midgut progenitors.Development. 2009; 136: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). vn-lacZ expression was highly induced in the VM of the regenerating midgut (Figures 1C–1E). The induction of vn expression in response to Pe infection was further confirmed by vn fluorescent in situ hybridization (Figures 1F and 1G). The strongest signals were found in the nuclei of circular and longitudinal visceral muscle cells, appearing as intense foci, probably the loci of vn transcription (Figures 1F and 1G). Similarly, the activation of apoptosis and JNK signaling in the ECs also induced vn expression in the VM (data not shown). However, in the case of ectopic JNK activation (MyoIAts > HepAct), strong vn induction was also observed in the ECs (Figures S1A and S1B available online), where strong signals were also found in the cytosol. Induction of vn in the ECs by HepAct is consistent with the much higher vn induction in these midguts detected by RT-qPCR (Figure 1A). Fluorescent in situ hybridization further revealed that Krn was induced in the ECs in response to Pe infection (Figures 1H and 1I). The strongest signal appeared as intense foci in EC nuclei. In contrast, a reporter for spi (spi-Gal4NP0261) was mainly expressed in small progenitor cells, with low levels of expression also observed in some ECs (Figures S1C and S1C′). Drosophila rhomboids encode intramembrane proteases that cleave and activate some EGFR ligands, including Spi and Krn (Urban et al., 2002Urban S. Lee J.R. Freeman M. A family of Rhomboid intramembrane proteases activates all Drosophila membrane-tethered EGF ligands.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4277-4286Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We quantified the expression of all seven rhomboid-like genes in the midgut by RT-qPCR and observed modest upregulation of rho, rho2, 4, and 6 in regenerating midguts (Figure S2A). We also examined the expression of rho with the rhoX81-lacZ reporter. rho-lacZ was weakly expressed in the VM (data not shown) but not in the epithelial cells of controls (Figure S2B). Although rho-lacZ expression in the VM did not change after infection (data not shown), its expression was induced in the ECs (Figures S2C–S2E). The induction of rho in the ECs in response to Pe infection was confirmed by in situ hybridization (Figures S2F and S2G). The induction of multiple EGFR ligands and rhos in the midgut was also detected when flies were infected with another pathogenic bacteria, ECC15 (Buchon et al., 2009bBuchon N. Broderick N.A. Poidevin M. Pradervand S. Lemaitre B. Drosophila intestinal response to bacterial infection: activation of host defense and stem cell proliferation.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 200-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the induction of these factors probably activates EGFR signaling. To test this, we examined the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a downstream effector of EGFR, by using antibodies against the diphosphorylated, active form of MAPK, termed dpERK (Gabay et al., 1997Gabay L. Seger R. Shilo B.Z. MAP kinase in situ activation atlas during Drosophila embryogenesis.Development. 1997; 124: 3535-3541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Staining for dpERK in control midguts revealed that MAPK was mainly active in ISCs but was weak or absent in the EBs (Figure 2A ; Figures S3A–S3A″). Brief Pe infection (1 day) led to increased dpERK in both ISCs and EBs (Figures 2B and 2B′), suggesting that Pe infection induced the activation of MAPK in midgut progenitor cells. Interestingly, MAPK activity in the progenitor cells decreased after 2 days of Pe infection, and ectopic MAPK activity was observed in newly formed pre-ECs (Figures 2C and 2C′). This downregulation in progenitors is probably the result of increased expression of MKP3, a negative regulator of MAPK (Figure 1A; Rintelen et al., 2003Rintelen F. Hafen E. Nairz K. The Drosophila dual-specificity ERK phosphatase DMKP3 cooperates with the ERK tyrosine phosphatase PTP-ER.Development. 2003; 130: 3479-3490Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with the activation of MAPK in midgut progenitors, ectopic induction of strong EGFR ligands (MyoIAts > sSpi) activated MAPK only in the progenitor cells, but not in the mature ECs (Figures 2D and 2D′). However, activated Ras (esgtsF/O > RasV12) led to strong cell-autonomous activation of MAPK in both progenitors and large polyploid ECs (Figures 2E and 2E′). This suggests that differentiated ECs lack a critical component of the EGFR pathway upstream of Ras and are therefore unable to respond to EGFR ligands. One possibility is that ECs downregulate EGFR as they differentiate. We previously reported that EGFR signaling drives the proliferation of adult midgut progenitors (AMPs) in the larval gut and showed that VM-derived Vn is required for AMP proliferation during early larval development (Jiang and Edgar, 2009Jiang H. Edgar B.A. EGFR signaling regulates the proliferation of Drosophila adult midgut progenitors.Development. 2009; 136: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). By using an inducible visceral muscle driver, 24Bts, we overexpressed Vn specifically in adult VM and observed a mild increase of mitotic ISCs (Figure 3A ). Thus VM-derived Vn is sufficient to induce ISC proliferation. The mild effect on ISC proliferation is probably because Vn is a weak EGFR ligand (Schnepp et al., 1998Schnepp B. Donaldson T. Grumbling G. Ostrowski S. Schweitzer R. Shilo B.Z. Simcox A. EGF domain swap converts a drosophila EGF receptor activator into an inhibitor.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 908-913Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Next, we ectopically activated EGFR signaling in the ISCs by expressing the strong EGFR ligands, sSpi or sKrn (Reich and Shilo, 2002Reich A. Shilo B.Z. Keren, a new ligand of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, undergoes two modes of cleavage.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4287-4296Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Schweitzer et al., 1995Schweitzer R.

Ghabrial A. Schüpbach T. Ectopic activation of torpedo/Egfr, a Drosophila receptor tyrosine kinase, dorsalizes both the eggshell and the embryo.Development. 1997; 124: 3871-3880PubMed Google Scholar), or activated Ras (RasV12) (Karim and Rubin, 1998Karim F.D. Rubin G.M. Ectopic expression of activated Ras1 induces hyperplastic growth and increased cell death in Drosophila imaginal tissues.Development. 1998; 125: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar) by using a lineage induction system, esgtsF/O. In the esgtsF/O system, progenitor cells and all of their newborn progeny express Gal4 and UAS-linked Gal4 targets, including the UAS-GFP marker (Jiang et al., 2009Jiang H. Patel P.H. Kohlmaier A. Grenley M.O. McEwen D.G. Edgar B.A. Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling mediates regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut.Cell. 2009; 137: 1343-1355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We then examined their effects on ISC proliferation. Activation of EGFR signaling induced increased ISC division (Figure 3B), resulting in the generation of many new midgut cells, including EC-like GFP+ cells (Figures 3D–3F). Most of these large GFP+ cells were positive for PDM-1, a marker for fully differentiated ECs (Figures 3F–3F″). Therefore, EGFR/Ras signaling does not suppress EC differentiation. In addition, we found that knocking down Cbl, a negative regulator of EGFR signaling (Hime et al., 1997Hime G.R. Dhungat M.P. Ng A. Bowtell D.D. D-Cbl, the Drosophila homologue of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene, interacts with the Drosophila EGF receptor in vivo, despite lacking C-terminal adaptor binding sites.Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2709-2719Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Meisner et al., 1997Meisner H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), by Cbl RNAi (esgtsF/O > Cbl RNAi), also induced ISC proliferation (Figure 3B; Figure S4B). Prolonged activation of EGFR signaling resulted in severely hyperplasic midguts (Figure S8D). We also induced EGFR ligands in mature ECs (MyoIAts > sSpi or sKrn). This treatment similarly promoted ISC proliferation, demonstrating that paracrine EGF signaling is able to activate ISC division (Figure 3B). In fact, the source of ectopic EGFR ligands did not seem to be important. No matter where Vn, sSpi, or sKrn were induced (VMs, ECs, or progenitors), they were always capable of inducing dramatic ISC proliferation (data not shown). To ask which downstream effectors of EGFR are responsible for inducing ISC proliferation, we ectopically expressed pathway-specific Ras variants (RasV12S35 or RasV12G37) in midgut progenitor cells (Karim and Rubin, 1998Karim F.D. Rubin G.M. Ectopic expression of activated Ras1 induces hyperplastic growth and increased cell death in Drosophila imaginal tissues.Development. 1998; 125: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). RasV12S35, which specifically activates the MAPK pathway, was able to promote ISC proliferation, whereas induction of RasV12G37, which preferentially activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, had no effect on ISC proliferation (Figure 3B). Activated Raf (Rafgof) also promoted ISC proliferation (Figure 3B), and coexpressing MKP3 largely inhibited ectopic ISC proliferation induced by RasV12 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, depleting Capicua (Cic) (esgtsF/O > Cic RNAi), a transcriptional repressor downstream of MAPK pathway (Astigarraga et al., 2007Astigarraga S. Grossman R. Díaz-Delfín J. Caelles C. Paroush Z. Jiménez G. A MAPK docking site is critical for downregulation of Capicua by Torso and EGFR RTK signaling.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), also induced ISC proliferation (Figure 3B; Figure S4C). We conclude that EGFR signaling induces ISC proliferation specifically through Ras, Raf, and MAPK, rather than via PI3K or another effector pathway. To further explore the role of EGFR signaling in the midgut, we generated mosaic ISC clones homozygous for rasΔc40b, a null allele (Schnorr and Berg, 1996Schnorr J.D. Berg C.A. Differential activity of Ras1 during patterning of the Drosophila dorsoventral axis.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1545-1557Google Scholar), or Egfr (Egfr null, Egfr[CO]) (Clifford and Schüpbach, 1989Clifford R.J.

Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) for Drosophila neural development.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 251-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We then quantified the size of marked ISC clones at intervals after clone induction. Although the initial growth of ras and Egfr mutant ISC clones was normal, their long-term proliferation was severely compromised (Figures 4A–4E ). For ras and stat double mutant, the clones were not only small, but also lacked ECs (Figure 4D), a phenotype consistent with Jak/Stat's critical role for ISC differentiation (Beebe et al., 2010Beebe K.

Consistent with the EGFR pathway's essential role in ISC proliferation, midgut renewal after Pe infection was completely inhibited when EGFR signaling was suppressed in the progenitor cells by Egfr RNAi (Figures 4G–4J). Furthermore, prolonged EGFR suppression in healthy animals (4 weeks) led to almost complete loss of enteroblasts (esg+, Su(H)+) and ∼33% reduction of intestinal stem cells (esg+, Su(H)−) (Figures 4F and 4I). In the short term, however, EGFR suppression did not significantly alter the number of ISCs, but probably only prevented their growth and division. Interestingly, old ECs generated before the induction of lineage marking were still present in these aged midguts (∼1 month, Figure 4I), suggesting that EC loss were also partially inhibited. Next we tested whether EGFR signaling is required for compensatory ISC proliferation and midgut epithelium regeneration in"

Readers that simultaneously recognize histones with multiple marks allow transduction of complex chromatin modification patterns into specific biological outcomes. Here we report that chromatin regulator tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) functions in humans as a reader of dual histone marks by means of tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (Bromo) regions. The three-dimensional structure of the PHD-Bromo region of TRIM24 revealed a single functional unit for combinatorial recognition of unmodified H3K4 (that is, histone H3 unmodified at lysine 4, H3K4me0) and acetylated H3K23 (histone H3 acetylated at lysine 23, H3K23ac) within the same histone tail. TRIM24 binds chromatin and oestrogen receptor to activate oestrogen-dependent genes associated with cellular proliferation and tumour development. Aberrant expression of TRIM24 negatively correlates with survival of breast cancer patients. The PHD-Bromo of TRIM24 provides a structural rationale for chromatin activation through a non-canonical histone signature, establishing a new route by which chromatin readers may influence cancer pathogenesis."

Here, we investigated the effects of resveratrol and possible link with SIRT1 in β-cells. Insulinoma INS-1E cells and human islets were cultured with resveratrol before analyzing their physiological responses. Treatment of INS-1E cells for 24 h with 25 μm resveratrol resulted in marked potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2051634614,"The adipose-derived hormone leptin maintains energy balance in part through central nervous system-mediated increases in sympathetic outflow that enhance fat burning. Triggering of β-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes stimulates energy expenditure by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent increases in lipolysis and fatty-acid oxidation. Although the mechanism is unclear, catecholamine signalling is thought to be disrupted in obesity, leading to the development of insulin resistance. Here we show that the cAMP response element binding (CREB) coactivator Crtc3 promotes obesity by attenuating β-adrenergic receptor signalling in adipose tissue. Crtc3 was activated in response to catecholamine signals, when it reduced adenyl cyclase activity by upregulating the expression of Rgs2, a GTPase-activating protein that also inhibits adenyl cyclase activity. As a common human CRTC3 variant with increased transcriptional activity is associated with adiposity in two distinct Mexican-American cohorts, these results suggest that adipocyte CRTC3 may play a role in the development of obesity in humans."

Some of the challenges researchers are facing include efficient creation of spin currents, minimization of Joule heating, and extending the lifetime of electronic spins, which is especially important for quantum information applications. Costache and Valenzuela (p. 1645 ) address the first challenge by designing and fabricating an efficient and simple superconducting-based single-electron transistor that can produce spin current with controlled flow. Key to the design is asymmetric tunneling, which leads to a ratchet effect (or diode-like behavior), allowing the separation of up and down spins. Jonietz et al. (p. 1648 ) use electric currents five orders of magnitude smaller than those used previously in nanostructures to manipulate magnetization in a bulk material, MnSi, pointing the way toward decreased Joule heating in spintronic devices. This so-called spin-torque effect causes the rotation of the skyrmion lattice of spins, characteristic of MnSi, which is detected by neutron scattering. Finally, McCamey et al. (p. 1652 ) extend the short lifetime of an electronic spin of a phosphorous dopant by mapping it onto the much longer lived nuclear spin of the atom. Mapping the nuclear spin back onto the electronic spin allows production of a spin memory with a storage time exceeding 100s, which should prove useful for future practical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2065843574,"Recent studies have demonstrated that transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibition may contribute to the protective anti-inflammatory actions of andrographolide, an abundant component of plants of the genus Andrographis. However, the precise mechanism by which andrographolide inhibits NF-κB signaling remains unclear. We thus investigated the mechanism involved in andrographolide suppression of NF-κB signaling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exposed to proinflammatory stimuli, LPS, and IFN-γ. Andrographolide was shown to suppress LPS/IFN-γ-induced inducible nitric-oxide synthase and matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in rat VSMCs. Andrographolide also inhibited LPS/IFN-γ-induced p65 nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, p65 Ser(536) phosphorylation, and NF-κB reporter activity. However, IKK phosphorylation and downstream inhibitory κBα phosphorylation and degradation were not altered by the presence of andrographolide in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated VSMCs. These andrographolide inhibitory actions could be prevented by selective inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Furthermore, andrographolide was demonstrated to increase ceramide formation and PP2A activity in VSMCs and to inhibit neointimal formation in rat carotid injury models. These results suggest that andrographolide caused neutral sphingomyelinase-mediated ceramide formation and PP2A activation to dephosphorylate p65 Ser(536), leading to NF-κB inactivation and subsequent inducible nitric-oxide synthase down-regulation in rat VSMCs stimulated by LPS and IFN-γ."

A series of experiments comparing the molecular details of a well-known process — mating-type determination — in three ascomycete yeasts has revealed an evolutionary change in the configuration of a transcription circuit (an intercalation of a new regulator) that preserves an ancient form of regulation but produces an important novel phenotype. The new variant causes the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis to mate only when nutrients are in short supply, thus taking food availability into account, a behaviour that is not found in the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the human pathogen Candida albicans. How new phenotypes can be introduced during evolution without losses of fitness remains largely unexplained at the molecular level. By comparing the molecular details of a well known process — mating type determination — across a large diversity of yeast species, the network rewiring event of the intercalation of a new level of gene transcription control into an ancient regulatory circuit is shown, which allowed for the creation of a new phenotype — taking food availability into account when deciding to mate. Changes in gene regulatory networks are a major source of evolutionary novelty1,2,3. Here we describe a specific type of network rewiring event, one that intercalates a new level of transcriptional control into an ancient circuit. We deduce that, over evolutionary time, the direct ancestral connections between a regulator and its target genes were broken and replaced by indirect connections, preserving the overall logic of the ancestral circuit but producing a new behaviour. The example was uncovered through a series of experiments in three ascomycete yeasts: the bakers’ yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and the human pathogen Candida albicans. All three species have three cell types: two mating-competent cell forms (a and α) and the product of their mating (a/α), which is mating-incompetent. In the ancestral mating circuit, two homeodomain proteins, Mata1 and Matα2, form a heterodimer that directly represses four genes that are expressed only in a and α cells and are required for mating4,5,6. In a relatively recent ancestor of K. lactis, a reorganization occurred. The Mata1–Matα2 heterodimer represses the same four genes (known as the core haploid-specific genes) but now does so indirectly through an intermediate regulatory protein, Rme1. The overall logic of the ancestral circuit is preserved (haploid-specific genes ON in a and α cells and OFF in a/α cells), but a new phenotype was produced by the rewiring: unlike S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, K. lactis integrates nutritional signals, by means of Rme1, into the decision of whether or not to mate."

Additionally, hypernegative supercoiling was observed in an internal plasmid after drug treatment. Furthermore, a model of pneumococcal TopA was made based on the crystal structure of Escherichia coli TopA. Docking calculations indicated strong interactions of the alkaloids with the nucleotide-binding site in the closed protein conformation, which correlated with their inhibitory effect.

https://openalex.org/W2040296567,"In the rod cell of the retina, arrestin is responsible for blocking signaling of the G-protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin. The general visual signal transduction model implies that arrestin must be able to interact with a single light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin molecule (Rho*P), as would be generated at physiologically relevant low light levels. However, the elongated bi-lobed structure of arrestin suggests that it might be able to accommodate two rhodopsin molecules. In this study, we directly addressed the question of binding stoichiometry by quantifying arrestin binding to Rho*P in isolated rod outer segment membranes. We manipulated the ""photoactivation density,"" i.e. the percentage of active receptors in the membrane, with the use of a light flash or by partially regenerating membranes containing phosphorylated opsin with 11-cis-retinal. Curiously, we found that the apparent arrestin-Rho*P binding stoichiometry was linearly dependent on the photoactivation density, with one-to-one binding at low photoactivation density and one-to-two binding at high photoactivation density. We also observed that, irrespective of the photoactivation density, a single arrestin molecule was able to stabilize the active metarhodopsin II conformation of only a single Rho*P. We hypothesize that, although arrestin requires at least a single Rho*P to bind the membrane, a single arrestin can actually interact with a pair of receptors. The ability of arrestin to interact with heterogeneous receptor pairs composed of two different photo-intermediate states would be well suited to the rod cell, which functions at low light intensity but is routinely exposed to several orders of magnitude more light."

Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) has been reported to express in HCC tissues and cell lines. This article describes the efficacy of an anti-EGFRvIII monoclonal antibody (mAb CH12) in the treatment of HCC xenografts with EGFRvIII expression and the underlying mechanism of EGFRvIII as an oncogene in HCC. The results demonstrated that CH12 bound preferentially to EGFRvIII with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.346 nm/liter. In addition, CH12 induces strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in Huh7-EGFRvIII (with exogenous expression of EGFRvIII) and SMMC-7721 (with endogenous expression of EGFRvIII) cells. Notably, CH12 significantly inhibited the growth of Huh7-EGFRvIII and SMMC-7721 xenografts in vivo with a growth inhibition ratio much higher than C225, a U. S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody. Treatment of the two HCC xenografts with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, in vivo treatment with CH12 reduced the phosphorylation of constitutively active EGFRvIII, Akt, and ERK. Down-regulation of the apoptotic protectors Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, as well as up-regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27, were also observed after in vivo CH12 treatment.

This article describes the efficacy of an anti-EGFRvIII monoclonal antibody (mAb CH12) in the treatment of HCC xenografts with EGFRvIII expression and the underlying mechanism of EGFRvIII as an oncogene in HCC. The results demonstrated that CH12 bound preferentially to EGFRvIII with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.346 nm/liter. In addition, CH12 induces strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in Huh7-EGFRvIII (with exogenous expression of EGFRvIII) and SMMC-7721 (with endogenous expression of EGFRvIII) cells. Notably, CH12 significantly inhibited the growth of Huh7-EGFRvIII and SMMC-7721 xenografts in vivo with a growth inhibition ratio much higher than C225, a U. S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody. Treatment of the two HCC xenografts with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, in vivo treatment with CH12 reduced the phosphorylation of constitutively active EGFRvIII, Akt, and ERK. Down-regulation of the apoptotic protectors Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, as well as up-regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27, were also observed after in vivo CH12 treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that the monoclonal antibody CH12 is a promising therapeutic agent for HCC with EGFRvIII expression.

Burroughs A. Bruix J. Lancet. 2003; 362: 1907-1917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). The cancer is usually diagnosed at a stage when the disease is already advanced and incurable. Surgery is the most effective treatment for HCC. However, tumor recurrence after a curative liver resection is high (2Carr B.I. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: S218-S224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Zhu A.X. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 790-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Adjuvant chemotherapy has not significantly improved survival of HCC patients (3Zhu A.X. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 790-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Sorafenib is the only targeted therapy approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration to treat HCC. Although sorafenib showed good tolerance in the studied populations, most patients in clinical practice suffer from underlying liver cirrhosis with impaired metabolic function and experience dose-limiting toxicities with the need to reduce the overall dose of sorafenib subsequently (4Wörns M.A. Weinmann A. Pfingst K. Schulte-Sasse C. Messow C.M. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Teufel A. Schuchmann M. Kanzler S. Düber C. Otto G. Galle P.R. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2009; 43: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been successfully targeted for cancer therapy (5Gainet M. Guardiola E. Dufresne A. Pivot X. Cancer Radiother. 2003; 7: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). EGFR expression in HCC has been reported (6Daveau M. Scotte M. François A. Coulouarn C. Ros G. Tallet Y. Hiron M. Hellot M.F. Salier J.P. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 36: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). EGFR expression has been suggested to contribute to the aggressive growth characteristics of HCC tumors (7DeCicco L.A. Kong J. Ringer D.P.

EGFR overexpression has been demonstrated to be positively correlated with early tumor recurrence and a negative prognostic factor in poorly differentiated HCCs (6Daveau M. Scotte M. François A.

Hence, EGFR represent a promising target for developing innovative HCC treatment strategies. However, despite the clinical success of several EGFR-targeting therapies, including the monoclonal antibody cetuximab (C225, Erbitux) (11Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 2787-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 12Nygren P. Sørbye H. Osterlund P. Pfeiffer P.

Cancer. 2004; 11: 689-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 14Huang S. Armstrong E.A. Benavente S. Chinnaiyan P. Harari P.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), no obvious responses were observed in HCC patients after treatment with cetuximab (15Yu X.T. Zhu S.N. Xu Z.D. Hu X.Q. Zhu T.F. Chen J.Q. Lu S.L. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 133: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The presence of EGFR gene mutations may account for the limited clinical response to EGFR-targeting therapies such as cetuximab in HCC patients. Among the EGFR mutations, EGFRvIII is the most commonly described mutation, which is a ligand-independent, constitutively active variant with in-frame deletion of exons 2–7, resulting in the deletion of amino acids 6–273 in the extracellular domain and the generation of a glycine at the fusion point (16Kuan C.T. Wikstrand C.J. Bigner D.D. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). EGFRvIII expression has been detected in glioma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (17Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Godwin A.K. Ramirez G. Gunn G. Zoltick P.W. Biegel J.A. Hayes R.L. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar, 18Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Mori T.

Recently, we also observed its expression in liver cancer cell lines such as SMMC-7721 (21Wang H. Jiang H. Zhou M. Xu Z. Liu S. Shi B. Yao X. Yao M. Gu J. Li Z. Cancer Lett. 2009; 279: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). EGFRvIII mRNA has also been observed in the serum of HCC patients (22Zhou M. Gong B. Gu J. Li Z. Liver Int. 2010; 30: 925-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Expression of EGFRvIII can promote tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo (20Sok J.C. Coppelli F.M. Thomas S.M. Lango M.N.

Collectively, these results suggest that EGFRvIII is a potential therapeutic target for HCC. To explore whether EGFRvIII-targeting therapy is a new option for HCC patients, we report here the development of a monoclonal antibody directed to EGFRvIII for the treatment of HCC xenografts in vivo.DISCUSSIONOne limitation of antibodies targeting the WT-EGFR is their significant uptake in normal tissues such as the liver and skin, which often causes side effects such as skin rash and gastrointestinal toxicity. To avoid this problem, Johns et al. (27Johns T.G. Adams T.E. Cochran J.R. Hall N.E. Hoyne P.A. Olsen M.J. Kim Y.S. Rothacker J. Nice E.C. Walker F. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A. Old L.J. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Wittrup K.D. Scott A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30375-30384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) developed mAb 806, which binds to a specific epitope of EGFR. In a phase I clinical study, ch806 displayed excellent targeting of tumor sites in all patients with no evidence of normal tissue uptake and no significant toxicity (28Scott A.M. Lee F.T. Tebbutt N. Herbertson R. Gill S.S. Liu Z. Skrinos E. Murone C. Saunder T.H. Chappell B. Papenfuss A.T. Poon A.M. Hopkins W. Smyth F.E. MacGregor D. Cher L.M. Jungbluth A.A. Ritter G. Brechbiel M.W. Murphy R.

However, the highest dosage level of ch806 in the phase I clinical trial was 40 mg/m2. The authors mentioned that further dose escalation was not performed due to the limited amount of cGMP ch806 available for the trial (28Scott A.M. Lee F.T. Tebbutt N. Herbertson R. Gill S.S. Liu Z. Skrinos E. Murone C. Saunder T.H. Chappell B. Papenfuss A.T. Poon A.M. Hopkins W. Smyth F.E. MacGregor D. Cher L.M. Jungbluth A.A. Ritter G. Brechbiel M.W. Murphy R. Burgess A.W. Hoffman E.W. Johns T.G. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4071-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting the difficulty in production of ch806. In this study, human-mouse chimeric antibody of 12H23 (CH12) displayed almost the same binding affinity to EGFRvIII as ch806 (29Panousis C. Rayzman V.M. Johns T.G. Renner C. Liu Z. Cartwright G. Lee F.T. Wang D. Gan H. Cao D. Kypridis A. Smyth F.E. Brechbiel M.W. Burgess A.W. Old L.J. Scott A.M. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the yield of CH12 is ∼5-fold higher than that of ch806 (data not shown). Additionally, in an in vivo biodistribution assay, 24 h after antibody injection, the percentage of the injected radioactive dose per gram of tissue (% injected radioactive dose g−1) of l25I-labeled CH12 in Huh7-EGFRvIII xenografts are highest among the tested solid organs, indicating its accumulation in the tumor tissues (supplemental Fig. S4). Therefore, we decided to use CH12 to treat HCC.Intriguingly, CH12 displayed significant ADCC and CDC effects on Huh7-EGFRvIII cells as well as SMMC-7721 cells, which bound weakly to CH12 in a FACS assay. Importantly, CH12 showed strong anti-tumor effect on Huh7-EGFRvIII and SMMC-7721 xenografts. We also tested the anti-HCC effect of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration-approved antibody C225. The results indicated that C225 displayed limited growth-inhibition effect on HCC xenografts with EGFRvIII expression. Thus, the EGFRvIII expression may be a reason for the minimal effect of C225 in the clinical trial.Further study on the mechanism underlying the growth inhibition effect indicated that CH12 treatment can suppress angiogenesis, promote apoptosis, and decrease proliferation. Cyclin D1 is involved in regulating the G1/S transition and was observed to be amplified in HCC (30Zhang Y.J. Jiang W. Chen C.J. Lee C.S. Kahn S.M. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 31Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 32Nishida N. Fukuda Y.

Ikenaga M. et al.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3107-3110PubMed Google Scholar). p27 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor which binds to cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes and facilitates the inhibition of the catalytic activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), ultimately inducing G1 cell cycle arrest. It has been suggested that p27 loss occurs early in the carcinogenesis process. The more aggressive, metastasizing cancers tend to lack p27 expression (33Ito Y. Matsuura N. Sakon M. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Takeda T. Umeshita K. Nagano H. Nakamori S. Dono K. Tsujimoto M. Nakahara M. Nakao K. Taniguchi N. Monden M. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). High p27 expression, correlated with prolonged survival, is a favorable independent prognostic parameter for HCC (33Ito Y. Matsuura N. Sakon M. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Takeda T. Umeshita K. Nagano H. Nakamori S. Dono K. Tsujimoto M. Nakahara M. Nakao K. Taniguchi N. Monden M. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Fiorentino M. Altimari A. D'Errico A. Cukor B. Barozzi C. Loda M. Grigioni W.F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3966-3972PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the decreased proliferation in HCC xenografts caused by CH12 treatment should be ascribed to the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and up-regulation of p27 expression. It has been demonstrated that the EGFRvIII can induce up-regulation of Bcl-xL (35Nagane M. Coufal F. Lin H. Bögler O. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5079-5086PubMed Google Scholar), which has been observed to overexpress in a subset of HCC and demonstrated as a significant prognostic factor for disease progression in human HCC (36Takehara T. Liu X. Fujimoto J. Friedman S.L. Takahashi H. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 37Watanabe J. Kushihata F. Honda K. Sugita A. Tateishi N. Mominoki K. Matsuda S. Kobayashi N. Surgery. 2004; 135: 604-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Previous study indicated that EGFR inhibitor gefitinib can suppress the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, further rendering HCC cells prone to apoptosis (38Höpfner M. Sutter A.P. Huether A. Schuppan D. Zeitz M. Scherübl H. J. Hepatol. 2004; 41: 1008-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, the weakened expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL should contribute to the apoptosis-promoting effect of CH12.As we know, antibodies are often used with chemotherapeutic drugs in clinic. A previous report indicated that combining cetuximab with TKIs (erlotinib or AG1024) or the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor fluvastatin or doxorubicin resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects on HepG2 and Huh7 hepatocellular cancer cells (39Huether A. Höpfner M. Baradari V. Schuppan D. Scherübl H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 1568-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Considering that EGFRvIII expression can decrease the sensitivity of HCC cell lines to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (21Wang H. Jiang H. Zhou M. Xu Z. Liu S. Shi B. Yao X. Yao M. Gu J. Li Z. Cancer Lett. 2009; 279: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), CH12 which inhibits the signal transduction of EGFRvIII, may be combined with 5-fluorouracil to enhance the antitumor effects.CH12 can also be combined with sorafenib, which inhibits Raf-1, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1–3, and PDGFR-β (40Faloppi L. Scartozzi M. Maccaroni E. Di Pietro Paolo M. Berardi R. Del Prete M. Cascinu S. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2010; (doi:10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.08.001)PubMed Google Scholar) for HCC treatment. This combination may significantly reduce the dosage of sorafenib and thus decrease the side effects of sorafenib. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody CH12 developed here has potential to be used as therapeutics for HCC with EGFRvIII expression.

Oncologist. 2006; 11: 790-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Sorafenib is the only targeted therapy approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration to treat HCC. Although sorafenib showed good tolerance in the studied populations, most patients in clinical practice suffer from underlying liver cirrhosis with impaired metabolic function and experience dose-limiting toxicities with the need to reduce the overall dose of sorafenib subsequently (4Wörns M.A. Weinmann A.

https://openalex.org/W2094572278,"Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) belongs to the neuronal calcium sensor family of Ca2+-myristoyl switch proteins that regulate signal transduction in the brain and retina. Here we analyze Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding, characterize metal-induced conformational changes, and determine structural effects of myristoylation and dimerization. Mg2+ binds functionally to VILIP-1 at EF3 (ΔH = +1.8 kcal/mol and KD = 20 μm). Unmyristoylated VILIP-1 binds two Ca2+ sequentially at EF2 and EF3 (KEF3 = 0.1 μm and KEF2 = 1–4 μm), whereas myristoylated VILIP-1 binds two Ca2+ with lower affinity (KD = 1.2 μm) and positive cooperativity (Hill slope = 1.5). NMR assignments and structural analysis indicate that Ca2+-free VILIP-1 contains a sequestered myristoyl group like that of recoverin. NMR resonances of the attached myristate exhibit Ca2+-dependent chemical shifts and NOE patterns consistent with Ca2+-induced extrusion of the myristate. VILIP-1 forms a dimer in solution independent of Ca2+ and myristoylation. The dimerization site is composed of residues in EF4 and the loop region between EF3 and EF4, confirmed by mutagenesis. We present the structure of the VILIP-1 dimer and a Ca2+-myristoyl switch to provide structural insights into Ca2+-induced trafficking of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) belongs to the neuronal calcium sensor family of Ca2+-myristoyl switch proteins that regulate signal transduction in the brain and retina. Here we analyze Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding, characterize metal-induced conformational changes, and determine structural effects of myristoylation and dimerization. Mg2+ binds functionally to VILIP-1 at EF3 (ΔH = +1.8 kcal/mol and KD = 20 μm). Unmyristoylated VILIP-1 binds two Ca2+ sequentially at EF2 and EF3 (KEF3 = 0.1 μm and KEF2 = 1–4 μm), whereas myristoylated VILIP-1 binds two Ca2+ with lower affinity (KD = 1.2 μm) and positive cooperativity (Hill slope = 1.5). NMR assignments and structural analysis indicate that Ca2+-free VILIP-1 contains a sequestered myristoyl group like that of recoverin. NMR resonances of the attached myristate exhibit Ca2+-dependent chemical shifts and NOE patterns consistent with Ca2+-induced extrusion of the myristate. VILIP-1 forms a dimer in solution independent of Ca2+ and myristoylation. The dimerization site is composed of residues in EF4 and the loop region between EF3 and EF4, confirmed by mutagenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1989886004,"Understanding the mechanisms of electron transfer (ET) in photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) may inspire novel catalysts for sunlight-driven fuel production. The electron exit pathway of type II RCs comprises two quinone molecules working in series and in between a non-heme iron atom with a carboxyl ligand (bicarbonate in photosystem II (PSII), glutamate in bacterial RCs). For decades, the functional role of the iron has remained enigmatic. We tracked the iron site using microsecond-resolution x-ray absorption spectroscopy after laser-flash excitation of PSII. After formation of the reduced primary quinone, QA−, the x-ray spectral changes revealed a transition (t½ ≈ 150 μs) from a bidentate to a monodentate coordination of the bicarbonate at the Fe(II) (carboxylate shift), which reverted concomitantly with the slower ET to the secondary quinone QB. A redox change of the iron during the ET was excluded. Density-functional theory calculations corroborated the carboxylate shift both in PSII and bacterial RCs and disclosed underlying changes in electronic configuration. We propose that the iron-carboxyl complex facilitates the first interquinone ET by optimizing charge distribution and hydrogen bonding within the QAFeQB triad for high yield QB reduction. Formation of a specific priming intermediate by nuclear rearrangements, setting the stage for subsequent ET, may be a common motif in reactions of biological redox cofactors.

The electrons are transferred to the acceptor side, comprising two identical quinone molecules, with the primary one, QA, bound to the D2 subunit and the secondary one, QB, bound to D1 (7Ferreira K.N.

A single ferrous non-heme iron atom is bound at ∼7 Å distance to each quinone and is coordinated by four histidine residues (Fig. 1). A similar QAFeQB triad is found in the non-oxygenic reaction center of purple bacteria (BRC) (9Deisenhofer J. Michel H. Science. 1989; 245: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), but instead of plastoquinone molecules as in PSII, other quinone types are employed. There is a fifth ligand to the iron, which in PSII is a bicarbonate (BC) molecule, HCO3− (10Hienerwadel R. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16288-16297Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas in BRC the carboxyl group of a glutamate (M-Glu234 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides) coordinates the Fe(II) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Upon light excitation of dark-adapted reaction centers, QA is reduced within <1 ns (11Diner B.A. Rappaport F. Annu. Rev.

After the second excitation, the QA−QB− +2H+→QAQBH2 reaction proceeds, and the quinol is exchanged against an oxidized quinone molecule (13de Wijn R. van Gorkom H.J.

The interquinone ET represents a striking example of a directed and efficient reaction between protein-bound cofactors of the same chemical type. Near quantitative QB− formation implies that there must be mechanisms that provide sufficient thermodynamic driving force for the forward ET. Extensive experimental and theoretical investigations on the events associated with the interquinone ET reactions have disclosed a wealth of information, e.g. on the ET kinetics and accompanying protonation reactions (reviewed in Refs. 15Nabedryk E.

Biol. 2011; 684: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For both PSII and BRCs, in particular the function of the non-heme iron and of its carboxyl ligand in the ET reactions has remained enigmatic (15Nabedryk E. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1229-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Wraight C.A. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 309-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Gunner M.R. Madeo J. Zhu Z. J.

Renger T. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 98: 53-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Based on time-resolved FTIR and UV/visible absorption experiments on BRCs, the transient oxidation of the Fe(II) to Fe(III) by QB after formation of QA− and the subsequent re-reduction of the iron by QA− have been invoked (25Remy A. Gerwert K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Later studies on BRC using time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Fe K-edge provided no evidence for Fe(III) formation during the QA−→QB ET (26Hermes S. Bremm O. Garczarek F. Derrien V. Liebisch P. Loja P. Sebban P. Gerwert K. Haumann M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, a kinetic XAS trace tentatively was assigned to structural changes of unclear origin (26Hermes S. Bremm O. Garczarek F. Derrien V. Liebisch P. Loja P. Sebban P. Gerwert K. Haumann M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There are considerable differences in the properties of the non-heme iron in PSII and BRCs. In PSII, the Fe(II) can be oxidized to Fe(III) at a midpoint potential (Em) of about +400 mV (27Diner B.A. Petrouleas V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 107-125Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For BRCs, chemical oxidation of the Fe is not observed (28Ishikita H. Galstyan A. Knapp E.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The ability to oxidize the Fe in PSII makes this system ideal to study the reduction of Fe(III) by QA− after the first flash excitation, i.e. a possible combination of redox and coordination changes, as well as the behavior of the iron complex during the subsequent QA−→QB and QA−→QB− ET reactions. Time-resolved XAS experiments are particularly useful to investigate both oxidation state and coordination changes at protein-bound metal centers (29Chen L.X. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2005; 56: 221-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Haumann M. Liebisch P. Müller C. Barra M. Grabolle M. Dau H.

By XAS, in an element-specific approach exclusively changes at the metal site are monitored, whereas the further cofactors and the protein matrix remain invisible (5Dau H. Haumann M. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2008; 252: 273-295Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Using this technique, an intermediate of the Mn-complex prior to O2 evolution in the PSII reaction cycle was detected (30Haumann M. Liebisch P. Müller C. Barra M. Grabolle M. Dau H. Science. 2005; 310: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and thermodynamic limitation of water oxidation by the O2 product ruled out (31Haumann M. Grundmeier A. Zaharieva I. Dau H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17384-17389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the non-heme iron site using microsecond-resolution XAS after laser flash excitation of a PSII preparation. The observed spectral changes are interpreted in terms of redox, coordination, and electronic modifications at the Fe using XANES simulations and density-functional theory (DFT) (33Kirchner B. Wennmohs F. Ye S. Neese F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) on QAFeQB site models, for PSII and BRCs. The disclosed coordination changes at the iron imply an essential and active function of the Fe(II)-carboxyl complex in the interquinone ET. Oxygen-evolving PSII membrane particles were prepared as in Refs. 30Haumann M. Liebisch P. Müller C. Barra M. Grabolle M. Dau H. Science. 2005; 310: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 31Haumann M. Grundmeier A. Zaharieva I. Dau H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17384-17389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. For oxidation of the non-heme iron, PSII membranes (∼30 mg of chlorophyll) were suspended at ∼1 mg of chlorophyll/ml in 30 ml of buffer A (10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 m betaine, 20 mm MES, pH 7.0) containing 5 mm K3[FeIII(CN)6] (ferricyanide, from Sigma) as the oxidant and incubated for 15 min on ice under gentle stirring in darkness. Thereafter, the PSII membranes were collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 12 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A, washed three times by centrifugation after resuspension in 300 ml of buffer A to remove the ferricyanide, and resuspended at ∼8 mg of chlorophyll/ml in buffer B (buffer A, but pH 6.3). Aliquots of the PSII suspension (70 μg of chlorophyll) were pipetted on ∼250 sample holders for XAS each with 20 samples (30Haumann M. Liebisch P. Müller C. Barra M. Grabolle M. Dau H. Science. 2005; 310: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 31Haumann M. Grundmeier A. Zaharieva I. Dau H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17384-17389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and stored in liquid nitrogen for <2 weeks. Samples were handled under dim green light. For further details see supplemental Materials and Information, section 2. By total reflection x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy on a PicoFox (Bruker) instrument the metal content of samples was determined (supplemental Fig. S2). The rates and yields of ET at the PSII acceptor side and extent of Fe preoxidation were monitored by laser flash-induced variable chlorophyll fluorescence transients (prompt chlorophyll fluorescence), which was measured using the PSII samples for XAS after transfer to thin acrylic glass holders (supplemental Fig. S3). Measurements at the iron x-ray absorption K-edge (at 18 ± 1 °C) were performed at undulator beamline ID26 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at Grenoble, France, using the previously described set-up (30Haumann M. Liebisch P. Müller C. Barra M. Grabolle M. Dau H. Science. 2005; 310: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 31Haumann M. Grundmeier A. Zaharieva I. Dau H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17384-17389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For each x-ray measurement, a fresh PSII sample was employed. Three types of experiments were performed, namely (i) time-resolved measurements of the excited x-ray fluorescence at selected fixed excitation energies in the region of the Fe K-edge, (ii) time scan measurements in the whole Fe K-edge spectral region using a XANES scan thereafter for signal calibration, and (iii) rapid-scan monochromator sweeps to obtain complete x-ray absorption spectra. The technical details of each type of experiment are outlined in supplemental information, section 4. Calculations of XANES spectra were performed with FEFF8.2 using the full multiple-scattering and self-consistent field options (34Löscher S. Schwartz L. Stein M. Ott S. Haumann M. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 46: 11094-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with Fe-site models for PSII and BRC based on crystallographic data (8Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A.

Biol. 2007; 371: 396-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (see supplemental information, section 5). Spin-unrestricted geometry optimizations were performed with the ORCA suite of DFT programs (35Neese F. ORCA: An Ab Initio Density Functional and Semiempirical Program Package. Universität Bonn, Bonn, Germany2007Google Scholar) on a four-personal computers cluster. For the high spin states of the Fe-quinone complex, we used the BP86 functional and a split-valence (SV) basis set for all atoms except for the Fe, for which the triple-zeta valence plus polarization (TZVP) basis set was used. The resolution of the identity approximation was used with the Coulomb auxiliary fitting basis sets SV/J and TZV/J. A conductor-like screening model for the solvation environment (36Sinnecker S. Rajendran A. Klamt A. Diedenhofen M. Neese F. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2006; 110: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) was applied using a dielectric constant of ϵ = 4. At the equilibrium geometries, single-point calculations were done with the B3LYP functional and TZVP basis set. For further details, see supplemental information, section 6. In the PSII samples, the non-heme iron was oxidized to Fe(III) in the dark by K3[Fe(CN)6] (ferricyanide). The XAS samples contained the intrinsic electron acceptors of PSII, namely QA, QB, and two or three additional plastoquinones per PSII reaction center, as verified by prompt chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (supplemental information, section 3), which revealed that on the average at least eight electrons could be transferred to the PSII acceptor side, in agreement with previous results (8Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 37Krivanek R. Kern J. Zouni A. Dau H. Haumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). No residual Fe(III)-oxidant was present according to the similar numbers of flash-induced turnovers revealed by the prompt chlorophyll fluorescence data (supplemental information, section 3) and by the similar metal contents (4.6 ± 0.3 Fe per 4 Mn, supplemental Fig. S2) of preoxidized and control samples. Because PSII membranes contain two Fe atoms bound directly to the PSII reaction center (the non-heme iron and the Fe ion of cytochrome b559) (38Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and possibly spurious contaminations with rubredoxin containing Fe(III) (39Wastl J. Duin E.C. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Link T. Hoffmann S. Sticht H. Dau H. Lingelbach K. Maier U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30058-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we estimate that about 2.5 additional unspecific Fe atoms per PSII were present in the XAS samples (supplemental information, section 2). The high O2 activity (1.1 ± 0.1 mol O2/gchlorophyll h) indicated full functionality of the cofactors in preoxidized PSII. Flash-induced prompt chlorophyll fluorescence signals (37Krivanek R. Kern J. Zouni A. Dau H. Haumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) revealed a typical induction curve and almost complete reduction of QB and the plastoquinone pool prior to flash 10 (supplemental Fig. S3). Comparison of initial prompt chlorophyll fluorescence amplitudes on flash 1 showed Fe(III) in 60–70% of preoxidized PSII, i.e. the ET QA−Fe(III)→QAFe(II) occurred in these centers and QA−QB→QA QB− in the remainder. After flash 2, the ET QA−→QB was expected in the majority of centers and predominant quinol formation after flash 3. The main kinetic component (55%) of the QA−→QB ET (flash 2) revealed a halftime of 830 ± 50 μs (supplemental Fig. S3). The Fe K-edge spectrum of dark-adapted preoxidized PSII samples (Fig. 2A) showed an edge energy of 7124.3 eV (at 50% level), indicating the prevalence of Fe(III), as expected (supplemental information, section 2). After excitation by a single laser flash prior to the XAS scan, the edge was shifted to 7123.8 eV, i.e. by 0.5 eV to lower energies. The magnitude and direction of the edge shift were in line with the reduction of close to one Fe ion per PSII, i.e. a quantitative redox change of the non-heme iron (edge shift of ∼2.5 eV for reduction of a single-Fe compound (40Westre T.E. Kennepohl P. DeWitt J.G. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6297-6314Crossref Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), ∼5 Fe per PSII in the samples). X-ray fluorescence time courses were measured at selected excitation energies in the Fe K-edge spectral region. At 7126 eV (Fig. 2B), the pronounced increase of the x-ray fluorescence intensity on flash 1 and only small changes on the following flashes indicated almost complete reduction of the non-heme Fe(III) on flash 1. From the x-ray transient, a halftime of 15 ± 3 μs of the QA−Fe(III)→QAFe(II) ET was derived (Fig. 2C). The microsecond kinetics proved that the x-ray transients exclusively reflected changes at the non-heme iron (supplemental information, section 2). The transient that was observed on the second flash at 7122 eV revealed a slower rise (t½ = 150 ± 50 μs) of the x-ray fluorescence level, which was followed by an even slower decay phase with a main component showing a halftime of 820 ± 100 μs (Fig. 2D). This halftime matched the one of QA− reoxidation by QB (supplemental Fig. S3), meaning that the main decay of the x-ray transient paralleled the QA−QB→QA QB− ET. The rising phase likely followed QA− formation in nanoseconds and was terminated prior to QA− reoxidation. Time-resolved measurements were performed at x-ray energies in the whole Fe K-edge range. The changes in the x-ray fluorescence levels at 0.55 ± 0.5 ms, after completion of Fe(III) reduction and of the ∼150-μs rising phase, and at 9.5 ± 0.5 ms, at the end of the decay, after laser flashes 1, 2, 3, and 10 are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra after flash 1 were similar to the difference of the K-edges (Fig. 2A) and hence mainly attributable to the Fe(III)→Fe(II) transition. The spectral differences at 9.5 ms compared with 0.55 ms likely were due to the 30–40% of centers in which the QA−→QB ET occurred already on flash 1. After flash 2, the spectral change at 0.55 ms was very different from that after flash 1 (Fig. 3) in that, e.g. there was no maximum at ∼7126 eV, but at ∼7122 eV instead. At 9.5 ms after flash 2, the spectral changes vanished almost completely, in agreement with the signal decay observed at 7122 eV (Fig. 2D). A similar spectral change as after flash 2 also was observed after flash 3; however, its magnitude was smaller (Fig. 3). After flash 10, i.e. in the presence of a mostly reduced plastoquinone pool, spectral changes in the microsecond to millisecond range were negligible. By calculation of Fe K-edge spectra using structural models of the iron site (supplemental information, section 5), we scrutinized the underlying changes at the non-heme iron in the QA−→Fe(III) and QA−→QB reaction steps. The K-edge spectrum of a 6-coordinated Fe(II), i.e. ligated by the nitrogen atoms of the four histidines and by two oxygen atoms from BC in PSII (Fig. 4A) or glutamate in BRCs, was in good agreement with the experimental spectrum of BRCs (26Hermes S.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), in which the glutamate is a bidentate ligand to the Fe(II). The experimental spectrum of PSII was in between those of 5-coordinated and 6-coordinated Fe(III), as expected because both species were present in the preparation (Fig. 4A and supplemental information, section 2). The best simulation of the experimental difference spectra from the time-resolved XAS measurements (first flash) and from the K-edge data were the spectral difference of 6-coordinated Fe(II) minus 5-coordinated Fe(III) (Fig. 4C). The spectral difference of 6-coordinated Fe(II) minus 6-coordinated Fe(III) agreed less well with the experiment. These results suggested that the Fe(III) is 5-coordinated in PSII and holds a monodentate BC ligand, which changes to a bidentate ligation mode upon Fe(II) formation. The difference spectrum after flash 2 from the time-resolved x-ray experiment was well simulated by the calculated difference of 5-coordinated Fe(II) minus 6-coordinated Fe(II) (Fig. 4B). Any simulation assuming also an oxidation state change of Fe did not reproduce the experimental data (compare Fig. 4C). Accordingly, the ET QA−→QB was not accompanied by a redox change of the iron, but rather by a structural change. Most likely, this is the switch from a bidentate ligation of BC at Fe(II) to a monodentate ligation at Fe(II) after the formation of QA−, which is reversed upon the ET to QB. DFT is currently one of the most successful approaches for the description of the molecular and electronic structures of molecular systems containing transition metals and for the calculation of their spectroscopic parameters (33Kirchner B. Wennmohs F. Ye S. Neese F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 64Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. Phys. Chem. Chem.

With this theory, the properties of a many-electron system can be determined by using functionals of the spatially dependent electron density, reducing the many-body problem of N electrons with 3N spatial coordinates to three spatial coordinates. This allows to calculate also relatively large molecules in reasonably short time spans on personal computer clusters. For DFT calculations, different theory levels and three increasingly complex starting models of the QAFeQB site of PSII were used, the simplest one comprising only the QAFe(BC)(histidine)4 moieties (Fig. 5A, supplemental Fig. S4, Table 1, and supplemental Table S1). Optimized structures with oxidized quinones consistently revealed a slightly asymmetric chelating, i.e. bidentate BC (mean ΔR(Fe-O) of 0.17 Å). Low Mayer bond orders implied that both Fe-O bonds were weak. For reduced QA, a pronounced elongation of the longer Fe-O bond (mean of approximately 0.8 Å) was observed, which corresponded to a change from 6-coordinated to 5-coordinated iron. In the largest model containing also QB, additional amino acids, and a water molecule (supplemental Fig. S4), the effects were somewhat smaller (supplemental Table S1), due to electron delocalization on QA and QB, a technical problem of the DFT approach (41Cohen A.J. Mori-Sánchez P. Yang W. Science. 2008; 321: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). However, for all reduced models a highly asymmetric or even true syn-monodentate BC coordination was found, with a long Fe-O distance exceeding 2.6 Å.TABLE 1Structural and electronic parameters of Fe-site models from density-functional theory calculations for the small PSII model (Fig. 5A) and for a similar model of BRC including a water molecule (M2102 in structure 2J8D, supplemental Fig. S4)ParameterModelOxRedΔShort Fe-O [Å]PSII2.192.02−0.17BRC2.162.03−0.13Long Fe-O [Å]PSII2.313.16+0.85BRC2.293.21+0.92Fe-N(His) [Å]PSII2.162.17+0.01BRC2.101.98−0.12QA…H(NHis) [Å]PSII1.611.54−0.12H-N(His) [Å]PSII1.071.11+0.04BRC1.661.52−0.14BRC1.061.09+0.03Fe-d populationPSII6.176.28+0.11BRC6.166.46+0.30Spins on FePSII3.943.76−0.18BRC3.932.05−1.88MBO short Fe-OPSII0.410.51+0.10BRC0.360.42+0.06MBO long Fe-OPSII0.30<0.10<−0.20BRC0.31<0.10<−0.21Charge on QAPSII−0.19−0.80−0.61BRC−0.19−0.83−0.64Charge on BC/GluPSII−0.47−0.58−0.11BRC−0.41−0.51−0.10Charge on FePSII+0.88+0.85−0.03BRC+0.90+0.75−0.15Charge on HisAPSII+0.13+0.03−0.10BRC+0.13+0.05−0.08Charge on HisBPSII+0.24+0.19−0.04BRC+0.15+0.13−0.02 Open table in a new tab In the smallest PSII model, the highest occupied molecular orbital entirely was located on QA− (Fig. 5B). For oxidized QA, the occupied molecular orbital with strongest Fe-d(z2) character was oriented approximately along the (histidine)N-Fe-N(histidine) axis (Fig. 5B) and that with Fe-d(x2-y2) character roughly aligned with the basal Fe-N(histidine) and Fe-O(BC) bonds, indicating a distorted octahedral Fe(II) for the bidentate BC. For reduced QA and monodentate BC, the d-orbital orientations were similar, i.e. the now trigonal-bipyramidal Fe(II) had a basal Fe-O bond.

We developed a vaccine epitope (StreptInCor) composed of 55 amino acids residues of the C-terminal portion of the M protein that encompasses both T and B cell protective epitopes. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the StreptInCor peptide showed that the structure was composed of two microdomains linked by an 18-residue α-helix. A chemical stability study of the StreptInCor folding/unfolding process using far-UV circular dichroism showed that the structure was chemically stable with respect to pH and the concentration of urea. The T cell epitope is located in the first microdomain and encompasses 11 out of the 18 α-helix residues, whereas the B cell epitope is in the second microdomain and showed no α-helical structure. The prediction of StreptInCor epitope binding to different HLA class II molecules was evaluated based on an analysis of the 55 residues and the theoretical possibilities for the processed peptides to fit into the P1, P4, P6, and P9 pockets in the groove of several HLA class II molecules. We observed 7 potential sites along the amino acid sequence of StreptInCor that were capable of recognizing HLA class II molecules (DRB1*, DRB3*, DRB4*, and DRB5*). StreptInCor-overlapping peptides induced cellular and humoral immune responses of individuals bearing different HLA class II molecules and could be considered as a universal vaccine epitope."
https://openalex.org/W2001550558,"Ketamine is a widely used dissociative anesthetic which can induce some psychotic-like symptoms and memory deficits in some patients during the post-operative period. To understand its effects on neural population dynamics in the brain, we employed large-scale in vivo ensemble recording techniques to monitor the activity patterns of simultaneously recorded hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and various interneurons during several conscious and unconscious states such as awake rest, running, slow wave sleep, and ketamine-induced anesthesia. Our analyses reveal that ketamine induces distinct oscillatory dynamics not only in pyramidal cells but also in at least seven different types of CA1 interneurons including putative basket cells, chandelier cells, bistratified cells, and O-LM cells. These emergent unique oscillatory dynamics may very well reflect the intrinsic temporal relationships within the CA1 circuit. It is conceivable that systematic characterization of network dynamics may eventually lead to better understanding of how ketamine induces unconsciousness and consequently alters the conscious mind."

Cholinergic nervous systems are involved in neuromuscular transmission and in the central cholinergic projection implicated in cognitive function. Several mutations of the CHAT gene have been reported to cosegregate with congenital myasthenic syndrome with episodic apnea (1Ohno K. Tsujino A. Brengman J.M. Harper C.M. Bajzer Z. Udd B. Beyring R.

The major isoform of human ChAT is a 69-kDa soluble protein, referred to as the common type of ChAT (cChAT), although alternative translation initiation generates two minor isoforms of 74- and 82-kDa with distinct N-terminal extension sequences (3Oda Y. Nakanishi I. Deguchi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Chireux M.A. Le Van Thai A. Weber M.J. J. Neurosci.

Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, our group has previously reported an alternatively spliced variant of a rat ChAT homologue, which is predominantly localized in the peripheral nervous system and is therefore named peripheral ChAT (pChAT) (6Tooyama I. Kimura H. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2000; 17: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ACh is synthesized in the neuronal cytoplasm including the nerve terminal, and then transported into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Upon neuronal depolarization, ACh is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to its specific receptors. Subsequently, intrasynaptic ACh is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase to liberate choline and acetate. The liberated choline is immediately recycled into the presynaptic terminals by reuptake mainly mediated through the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1). The rate-limiting step for ACh synthesis is the supply of choline (7Kuhar M.J. Murrin L.C. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 8Simon J.R. Atweh S. Kuhar M.J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of ACh synthesis in presynaptic neurons depends on VAChT and CHT1 as well as on ChAT (9Ferguson S.M. Blakely R.D. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite the many studies carried out following the molecular cloning of these proteins (10Apparsundaram S.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), regulation of the expression of these coordinately functioning proteins remains to be clarified (14Ribeiro F.M. Black S.A. Prado V.F. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Prado M.A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ChAT is also expressed in various types of non-neuronal cells including epithelial, mesothelial, endothelial, muscle, and immune cells (15Wessler I. Kilbinger H. Bittinger F. Unger R. Kirkpatrick C.J. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ChAT is implicated in as yet unidentified function(s) besides neurotransmitter synthesis. Furthermore, Resendes et al. (17Resendes M.C. Dobransky T. Ferguson S.S. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have described nuclear localization of ChAT isoforms. This group has also defined one nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the 69-kDa isoform, and two NLSs in the 82-kDa isoform of human ChAT (hChAT) (16Gill S.K. Bhattacharya M. Ferguson S.S. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20217-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An NLS acts like a “tag” on the exposed surface of a protein and targets it to the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. The 69-kDa hChAT isoform is shuttled between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, whereas the 82-kDa isoform is predominantly localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, we previously reported that a rat pChAT isoform, in contrast to the 69-kDa cChAT isoform, is preferentially localized in the cytoplasm and that inhibition of cellular protein kinase C activity leads to increased accumulation of nuclear pChAT (18Matsuo A. Bellier J.P. Hisano T. Aimi Y. Yasuhara O. Tooyama I. Saito N. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These observations led us to examine the functional relevance of the distinct subcellular localizations of ChAT. To date the functional significance of nuclear ChAT remains unresolved. However, the 82-kDa nuclear isoform is expressed in human brains of normal aged subjects and in patients with Alzheimer disease (19Gill S.K. Ishak M. Dobransky T. Haroutunian V. Davis K.L. Rylett R.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2007; 28: 1028-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the molecular weight of ChAT is larger than that of proteins that can passively diffuse across the nuclear envelope, the nuclear translocation of ChAT should be an energy requiring process. This fact may suggest this process has some physiological significance. To elucidate possible functions of nuclear ChAT, we investigated transcriptional changes of genes related to ACh production, which we considered likely to respond to ChAT overexpression in neuronal cell lines. We report here that ChAT overexpression induces transcription of the CHT1 gene in SH-SY5Y cells and that this induction requires the nuclear localization and catalytic activity of ChAT. To obtain the full-length cDNA encoding the human 69-kDa isoform of ChAT (hChAT), we performed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a human small intestine Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Otsu, Japan) as a template. For construction of hChAT fused with green fluorescent protein (hChAT-GFP), an EcoRI restriction site and the Kozak sequence were introduced into the 5′-end of the cDNA, and a BamHI restriction site was introduced into the 3′-end. The stop codon TGA was substituted for TGC. The cDNA fragment was ligated into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The catalytically inactive mutant, inactive-hChAT-GFP, and the NLS-disrupted mutant, NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP (Fig. 1, inactive and NLS2-(−)), were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL-II Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The numbering of amino acid residues described below is according to the 82-kDa hChAT isoform 2 (GenBankTM accession number NP_065574). For the inactive-hChAT-GFP, Glu at amino acid residue 441 (Glu441) was substituted by Lys using the sense-strand oligonucleotide: GCGGTGTGGTGTGCAAACACTCCCCATTC. For NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP, Arg481, Arg482, Arg484, and Lys486 were all substituted by Ala using the sense-strand oligonucleotide: CGAGCTCCCCGCCCCCGCGGCGCTGGCGTGGGCATGCTCCCCGGAAATT. Additionally, we also made another candidate for NLS-disrupted mutant, NLS1-(−)-hChAT, Arg322, Arg323, Arg334, and Lys335 were all substituted by Ala with two processes of PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the sense strand oligonucleotides: GTCTTGGATGTTGTCATTAATTTCGCCGCTCTCAGTGAGGGGGATC and GGGGGATCTGTTCACTCAGTTGGCAGCGATAGTCAAAATGGCTTCCAAC. DNA sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing using the ABI 3100 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For selection of stable transformants of SH-SY5Y cells, the transfected cells were maintained in culture medium containing 300 μg/ml of G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). After 3 weeks of culture, the GFP-positive cells were collected using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; BD FACSAria II Cell Sorter, BD Biosciences). SH-SY5Y cells expressing wild-type hChAT-GFP (wt-hChAT-GFP), mutant hChAT-GFP, or GFP alone were selected based on the fluorescence intensity of the GFP they expressed. According to the fluorescence intensity, we divided wt-hChAT-GFP into two types: highly expressing cells (wt-hChAT-GFP) and moderately expressing cells (wt-hChAT-GFP-M), for further comparisons by using the FACS. Stable expression of each construct was verified using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. We also prepared human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing wt-hChAT-GFP, mutant hChAT-GFP, or GFP alone for preliminary experiments and further comparisons with the SH-SY5Y cell lines. Cultured cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and treated with 0.02% EDTA and 0.25% trypsin. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 80 × g for 5 min and then homogenized in 5–10 volumes (v/w) of 10 mm phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, 10 μl of the supernatant was used for ChAT activity measurement using the radiometric method with a slight modification (20Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 300 mm NaCl, 8 mm choline, 0.12 mm eserine, and 0.3 mm cold acetyl-CoA, and an appropriate quantity of [3H]acetyl-CoA in 50 mm PB (pH 7.4). Each reaction was performed in a 0.6-ml plastic tube at 37 °C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction by ice cooling, the reaction mixture (20 μl total volume) was transferred to another tube containing 4.5 ml of 0.1 m PB (pH 7.4), followed by the addition of 2 ml of acetonitrile containing 5 mg/ml of sodium tetraphenylboron (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and 8 ml of a toluene-based scintillation mixture (Scintiblender II, Nacalai Tesque). The radioactivity of [3H]ACh, collected by means of this liquid cation-exchange method into the organic phase, was counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-CARB 3100, Meridian, CT). The ChAT activity was expressed as nanomoles of [3H]ACh formed per minute per milligram of protein (21Bellier J.P. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1607-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Images were collected as previously reported (18Matsuo A. Bellier J.P. Hisano T. Aimi Y. Yasuhara O. Tooyama I. Saito N. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For comparison of the fluorescence intensity of individual images, identical parameters were set for imaging. Image processing and data analysis were performed using Photoshop or ImageJ software. To evaluate transient nuclear translocation, we used the Crm-1-dependent nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B (Sigma) (22Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of leptomycin B for up to 24 h. Analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out as described above. We observed the relationship between the subcellular localization of ChAT-GFP and the cell cycle by immunocytochemistry for cell cycle markers. Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously reported (18Matsuo A. Bellier J.P. Hisano T. Aimi Y. Yasuhara O. Tooyama I. Saito N. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were cultured for 2 days in a glass-bottom dish. After rinsing twice with cold PBS, the cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer at 4 °C. The fixed cells were rinsed gently three times with 100 mm PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST). They were incubated overnight with anti-cyclin E antibody conjugated with rhodamine (rabbit polyclonal, Sc-481, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, 1:50) or anti-cyclin B1 antibody conjugated with Alexa 647 (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., 1:50) in PBST at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with PBST for 10 min each, the cells were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out as described above. To evaluate involvement of acetylcholine muscarinic receptors, cultured cells were treated with 10 nm to 10 μm atropine (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist, for 72 h. We also tested the effects of nonspecific muscarinic agonists on CHT1 induction in the cultured cells, by using pilocarpine (10 μm to 1 mm, Wako) and carbachol (10 μm to 1 mm, Wako) for 72 h. Fresh aliquots of the agonist or antagonists were added to the culture at 24-h intervals with medium change. The treated cells were collected and analyzed using real time PCR as described below. Cultured cells were treated with 1 to 50 μm LY294002 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, for 24 or 72 h (23Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The treated cells were collected and analyzed using real time PCR as described below. Real time reverse transcription PCR assays were performed to quantify the mRNA levels of CHT1, CHAT, and VACHT. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the FastPure RNA kit (Takara-Bio, Otsu, Japan). Typically, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara-Bio) and random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers (Takara-Bio). To make external cDNA standards for real time PCR, the PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The plasmid cDNA was amplified in a One Shot TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen Japan Ltd.), and isolated using a Quantum Prep Plasmid Miniprep kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The primers used for PCR of hChAT (CHAT), CHT1, VACHT, β-actin (ACTB), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are shown under supplemental Table S1. Real time PCR was carried out using a Light Cycler system or the Light Cycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real Time) II kit (Takara-Bio). To confirm amplification specificity, the PCR products from each primer pair were subjected to melting curve analysis and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The results were analyzed using the second derivative maximum method of the LightCycler Software (Roche Diagnostics). Relative quantification of cDNA was performed based on these fluorescence measurements by comparison with a standard curve that was generated during the course of each PCR run. We confirmed a good correlation between the expression level of GAPDH mRNA and that of ACTB mRNA. These genes were therefore used as reference genes for normalization. The values were normalized to the levels of GAPDH cDNA determined from the same cDNA sample in the same PCR run. All experiments were performed independently at least three times. The levels of target mRNA were expressed relative to levels of GAPDH mRNA (arbitrary units). For the preparation of total cell homogenates cultured cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and harvested using trypsin/EDTA. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 80 × g for 5 min and then lysed in 5–10 volumes (v/w) of 10 mm PB (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete-mini, Roche Applied Science). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as total soluble fractions. Nuclear fractions of cultured cells were obtained using a previously described method (24Nishimura M. Yu G. Levesque G. Zhang D.M. Ruel L. Chen F. Milman P. Holmes E. Liang Y. Kawarai T. Jo E. Supala A. Rogaeva E. Xu D.M. Janus C. Levesque L. Bi Q. Duthie M. Rozmahel R. Mattila K. Lannfelt L. Westaway D. Mount H.T. Woodgett J. St. George-Hyslop P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SH-SY5Y cells were harvested in a buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. After rinsing the cells, 1/10 volume of 0.5% Nonidet-P 40 was added to the cell suspension. After the lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The resultant pellets were resuspended in a high-salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors, and then placed on ice for 15 min. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and collected as the nuclear fraction. CHT1 is functionally a plasma protein, which is also known to be constantly cycled through the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. Because previous studies showed that CHT1 is predominantly intracellular, we used the cytoplasmic fractions for Western blotting of CHT1, as described below (25Okuda T. Okamura M. Kaitsuka C. Haga T.

Hisano T. Aimi Y. Yasuhara O. Tooyama I. Saito N. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-GFP (mouse monoclonal, Roche, diluted 1:2500), anti-β-actin (mouse monoclonal, MAB1501, Chemicon International Inc., Billerica, MA, diluted 1:2000), anti-GAPDH (mouse monoclonal, MAB374, Chemicon, diluted 1:2000), anti-ChAT (rabbit polyclonal generated in our laboratory (30Kimura S. Bellier J.P. Matsuo A. Tooyama I. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2007; 50: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), diluted 1:5000), and anti-CHT1 (rabbit polyclonal, AB5966, Chemicon, diluted 1:1000). Bands were visualized using the Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K, Yokohama, Japan), and analyzed using a LAS-4000 IR multicolor image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of each band was semi-quantified using ImageJ software. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. For statistical analysis, an unpaired two group t test, a non-parametric Kruskal-Willis test, a Mann-Whitney test, or a post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test was used to determine the significance of differences between means. We first determined if the hChAT-GFP construct was useful for examination of ChAT activity and subcellular localization. The expected molecular weight of wt-hChAT fused with the 27-kDa GFP is 96 kDa. On immunoblotting of wt-hChAT-GFP-transfected HEK293 cell lysates, polyclonal anti-ChAT and monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies both detected wt-hChAT-GFP of the expected size (data not shown). A high level of ChAT-specific activity was detected in the homogenate of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with wt-hChAT-GFP. Furthermore, as we previously reported for a rat homolog of ChAT fused with GFP (18Matsuo A. Bellier J.P. Hisano T. Aimi Y. Yasuhara O. Tooyama I. Saito N. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), wt-hChAT-GFP was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in HEK293 cells by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing wt-hChAT-GFP or GFP alone were selected based on the intensity of their GFP fluorescence. To avoid clonal deviation, we collected GFP-positive cells using FACS. The level of CHAT mRNA in each cell line was confirmed using RT-PCR. As expected, wt-hChAT-GFP cells expressed abundant CHAT mRNA, whereas GFP alone cells expressed only a trace level of CHAT mRNA (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-ChAT or monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies confirmed the expression of a protein of the expected size in this cell line (Fig. 2B and data not shown). To ensure that the expressed ChAT-GFP was catalytically active, specific ChAT activities were measured. The wt-hChAT-GFP cells exhibited a high level of ChAT activity (wt-hChAT-GFP, 97.9 ± 7.16 nmol/mg of protein/min, mean ± S.E., and wt-hChAT-GFP-M, 12.6 ± 3.94), whereas no activity was detected in homogenates of GFP alone cells. ChAT activity of HEK293 cells stably expressing wt-hChAT-GFP was 158.68 ± 11.45 nmol/mg/min. Subcellular distribution of wt-hChAT-GFP and GFP alone in these living cells was investigated using a confocal laser scanning microscope. As we previously reported for the rat ChAT-GFP homolog in HEK293 cells (18Matsuo A. Bellier J.P. Hisano T. Aimi Y. Yasuhara O. Tooyama I. Saito N. Kimura H. Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), wt-hChAT-GFP was located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Although it was more strongly expressed in the cytoplasm, wt-hChAT-GFP nuclear localization was assessed by its co-localization with the nuclear fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 3A) and was confirmed using a biochemical cell fractionation assay (Fig. 3, B and C). The fluorescence intensity of GFP alone was the same in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, which may be a result of nonspecific passive diffusion. We observed ChAT-GFP subcellular localization in wt-hChAT-GFP cells with cell-cycle markers: cyclin B1 (G2/M phase marker) and cyclin E (G1/S phase marker). In the cell culture condition we used in this study, strong nuclear staining with the anti-cyclin E antibody was detected in most of the tested wt-hChAT-GFP cells (supplemental Fig. S1), however, cyclin B1 staining was not detected. To determine whether CHAT affects transcriptional activation of the CHT1 or VACHT genes, we analyzed RNA extracted from wt-hChAT-GFP and GFP alone cells for mRNA expression of these genes using real time PCR. The CHT1 mRNA level in wt-hChAT-GFP cells was significantly higher than that of GFP alone cells (Fig. 4B). VACHT mRNA in the wt-hChAT-GFP cells was comparable with that in GFP alone cells (relative ratio of wt-hChAT-GFP to GFP alone cells: 0.96 ± 0.02). These results suggested that transcription of CHT1 was selectively up-regulated by overexpression of wt-hChAT-GFP. To examine whether the up-regulated CHT1 mRNA in the wt-hChAT-GFP cells was translated into protein, we performed Western blot analysis for CHT1. The anti-CHT1 antibody strongly detected CHT1-protein expression in the cytoplasmic fraction of wt-hChAT-GFP cells, whereas only a faint band was detected in GFP alone cell homogenates (Fig. 4C), suggesting that exogenous wt-hChAT-GFP induced CHT1 protein expression. In contrast, stable expression of wt-hChAT-GFP (or of GFP alone) in HEK293 cells, which do not express CHT1 mRNA or protein, did not induce CHT1 mRNA or protein expression (data not shown), suggesting that CHT1 induction by wt-hChAT-GFP may be specific to neuronal cell types. To examine whether nuclear translocation of hChAT is required for its up-regulation of CHT1 expression, we prepared a mutant hChAT construct in which the NLS was disrupted. It has been reported that hChAT bears two putative NLSs: NLS1 (322RRLSEGDLFTQLRKIVKM339) and NLS2 (476ELPAPRRLRWK486) (16Gill S.K. Bhattacharya M. Ferguson S.S. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20217-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We constructed two mutants: one of which was NLS1-(−)-hChAT-GFP, in which all four of the Arg322, Arg323, Arg334, and Lys335 residues of the NLS1 sequence were replaced by Ala, and the second was NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP, in which all four of the Arg481, Arg482, Arg484, and Lys486 residues of the NLS2 sequence were substituted by Ala (Fig. 1). Using fluorescence microscopy, we confirmed that mutation of NLS2 but not mutation of NLS1, inhibits hChAT-GFP translocation to the nucleus upon transient transfection into HEK293 cells (data not shown). This observation was consistent with a previous report showing that the C-terminal NLS2 is more important for hChAT nuclear translocation than NLS1 (16Gill S.K. Bhattacharya M. Ferguson S.S. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20217-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP exhibited ChAT activity equivalent to that of wt-hChAT-GFP in HEK293 cells (data not shown). We next established a polyclonal SH-SY5Y cell line stably expressing NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP using a procedure similar to that used for establishment of wt-hChAT-GFP cell lines. We then compared the mRNA expression level of CHAT in these cells using real time PCR. The results indicated that equivalent levels of hChAT were expressed in wt-hChAT-GFP and NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP cells exhibited a significant level of CHAT activity (6.6 ± 1.05 nmol/mg/min). The ChAT activity of these cells was not as high as that of wt-hChAT-GFP cells, but was comparable with that of rat striatum homogenate (3.56 ± 0.12) (21Bellier J.P. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1607-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we determined that NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP fluorescence was almost exclusively localized in the cytoplasm, whereas nuclear fluorescence was similar to the background level (Fig. 3A). Co-staining with the Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye clearly showed that NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP did not co-localize with this dye. This cellular localization of NLS2-(−)-hChAT-GFP was in clear contrast to that of wt-hChAT-GFP. We further confirmed alm"

Yet, little is known about signal transduction pathways that mediate KRAS-induced phenotypes in human CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells. When cultured on bone marrow stroma, we observed that KRAS(G12V)-transduced cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells displayed a strong proliferative advantage over control cells, which coincided with increased early cobblestone (CAFC) formation and induction of myelomonocytic differentiation. However, the KRAS(G12V)-induced proliferative advantage was transient. By week three no progenitors remained in KRAS(G12V)-transduced cultures and cells were all terminally differentiated into monocytes/macrophages. In line with these results, LTC-IC frequencies were strongly reduced. Both the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, but not JNK, were activated by KRAS(G12V) and we observed that proliferation and CAFC formation were mediated via ERK, while differentiation was predominantly mediated via p38. Interestingly, we observed that KRAS(G12V)-induced proliferation and CAFC formation, but not differentiation, were largely mediated via secreted factors, since these phenotypes could be recapitulated by treating non-transduced cells with conditioned medium harvested from KRAS(G12V)-transduced cultures. Multiplex cytokine arrays and genome-wide gene expression profiling were performed to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which oncogenic KRAS(G12V) can contribute to the process of leukemic transformation. Thus, angiopoietin-like 6 (ANGPTL6) was identified as an important factor in the KRAS(G12V) secretome that enhanced proliferation of human CB CD34(+) cells."

https://openalex.org/W2151469570,"The opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is one of the oldest known medicinal plants. In the biosynthetic pathway for morphine and codeine, salutaridine is reduced to salutaridinol by salutaridine reductase (SalR; EC 1.1.1.248) using NADPH as coenzyme. Here, we report the atomic structure of SalR to a resolution of ∼1.9 Å in the presence of NADPH. The core structure is highly homologous to other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The major difference is that the nicotinamide moiety and the substrate-binding pocket are covered by a loop (residues 265-279), on top of which lies a large ""flap""-like domain (residues 105-140). This configuration appears to be a combination of the two common structural themes found in other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. Previous modeling studies suggested that substrate inhibition is due to mutually exclusive productive and nonproductive modes of substrate binding in the active site. This model was tested via site-directed mutagenesis, and a number of these mutations abrogated substrate inhibition. However, the atomic structure of SalR shows that these mutated residues are instead distributed over a wide area of the enzyme, and many are not in the active site. To explain how residues distal to the active site might affect catalysis, a model is presented whereby SalR may undergo significant conformational changes during catalytic turnover."

N-tropic murine leukemia virus is sensitive to human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α) restriction, whereas human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) escapes this antiviral factor. We previously revealed that mutation of four critical amino acid residues within the capsid can render murine leukemia virus resistant to huTRIM5α. Here, we exploit the high degree of conservation in the tertiary structure of retroviral capsids to map the corresponding positions on the HIV1 capsid. We then demonstrated that, when changes were introduced at some of these positions, HIV1 becomes sensitive to huTRIM5α restriction, a phenomenon reinforced by additionally mutating the nearby cyclophilin A binding loop of the viral protein.

The retroviral capsid is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the Gag (group-specific antigen) precursor, which provides all the structural elements responsible for organizing the virion (23Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Yeager M. Sundquist W.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Gag is synthesized as a polyprotein of 55 kDa that assembles at the plasma membrane together with the viral genome, leading to the release of immature virions. Gag is then cleaved by the viral protease to generate matrix, CA, and nucleocapsid homomultimers that reassemble to form the three inner shells of the mature virion. Although matrix lies beneath the envelope-bearing viral outer lipid bilayer, CA forms the virion inner core, wrapping the nucleocapsid-associated viral genome and enzymes (23Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Yeager M. Sundquist W.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Mature retroviral capsids can adopt spherical (e.g. MLV), cylindrical (e.g. Mason-Pfizer Monkey virus) or conical (e.g. HIV) morphologies, but despite these differences, they exhibit a remarkable degree of structural conservation, all deriving from a hexagonal array of hexameric CA monomers (24Byeon I.J.

The NTD is composed of six (MLV) or seven (HIV) α-helices, and for lentiviruses only, it includes an extended loop between helix 4 and 5. In the case of HIV1 and FIV, this loop is known to bind the cellular peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) (32Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M.

CypA is packaged into the virions during viral assembly through binding with the CA moiety of the Gag polyprotein (47Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J.

CypA is recruited by CA proteins from HIV1, FIV, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from African green monkeys (SIVagm) and chimpanzee but not from other lentiviruses such as equine infectious anemia virus and SIV from macaque (SIVmac) (41Lin T.Y.

The CA-CypA interaction can be prevented by mutating CA at positions 89 (CA89) and 90 (CA90) or by using the competitive inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA). This leads to a decrease in HIV1 infectivity in human cells through mechanisms that are still unclear (44Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 49Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Göttlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although CypA can both bind to and catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of the peptide bond between HIV1 CA89 and CA90, it is not known which of these two properties is required for its effect on viral infectivity (42Bosco D.A. Eisenmesser E.Z. Pochapsky S. Sundquist W.I. Kern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5247-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, CsA-based experiments have revealed that CypA recruitment in target rather than producer cells is responsible for boosting HIV1 infectivity (53Hatziioannou T. Perez-Caballero D. Cowan S. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). CypA has also been demonstrated to impact upon TRIM5α-mediated restriction. In particular, HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5α from Old World monkeys such as rhesus macaque is impaired when target cells are treated with CsA or CypA-directed RNA interference or, to some extent, by mutating the cyclophilin binding loop of CA (54Berthoux L.

Virology. 2006; 351: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, the positive effect of CypA on HIV1 replication in human cells is independent of TRIM5α (55Keckesova Z.

Virol. 2006; 80: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Remarkably, retrotransposition of the CypA coding sequence into the TRIM5 gene has occurred on two independent occasions during primate evolution (58Brennan G. Kozyrev Y. Hu S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

As a result, owl monkeys (part of the New World monkeys) as well as two macaque species (part of the Old World monkeys) express a chimeric protein, TRIMCyp, in which the PRYSPRY domain is replaced by CypA, allowing the capture of incoming retroviral capsids through a CypA-CA interaction. HIV1 successfully infects human cells partly due to its ability to escape huTRIM5α, a feat that N-MLV cannot accomplish. However, if the N-MLV capsid is mutated at four key positions (CA82, CA109, CA110, and CA117) situated at the edge of a cavity formed by helices 4–6, it is no longer inhibited by huTRIM5α (19Yap M.W.

Here, we take advantage of the high conservation of retroviral capsids to identify the corresponding positions of the HIV1 CA. Through a combination of genetic and functional studies, we then demonstrate that these positions can be engineered to render HIV1 susceptible to huTRIM5α. We further reveal that this effect is amplified by preventing CA-CypA binding. Together, these results shed interesting light on the mechanisms of TRIM5α-mediated restriction and escape there from and highlight structural determinants of the virus that could serve as attractive drug targets. Mus dunni tail fibroblasts (MDTF) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MLV-based particles were produced using packaging constructs N and B-tropic MLV (pCIG3-N and pCIG3-B) and the GFP-encoding construct pCNCG as described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HIV1-based vectors were produced with the packaging construct pCMVΔR8.74 and the vector pRRLsin PGK GFP. The env construct for all viral productions was pMD2G, expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The MLV plasmids encoding human, rhesus macaque TRIM5α, or owl monkey TRIMCyp (pLPCX-huTRIM5α-HA, pLPCX-rhTRIM5α-HA, pLPCX-TRIMcyp-HA) were kind gifts from J. Sodroski. The squirrel monkey TRIM5α sequence was amplified from pCXCR-sqTRIM5α (kindly provided by G. Towers) and fused in 3′ by PCR with the sequence encoding the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). The PCR product was inserted downstream of the CMV promoter of the MLV vector construct pLPCX (Clontech) allowing for puromycin selection of transduced cells. HuTRIM5α and MLV capsid mutants were already described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All HIV1 capsid mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pCMVΔR8.74 using the XL QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Multiple sequence alignment of the target and template sequences was performed using the MUSCLE algorithm (69Edgar R.C.

HIV and SIV belong to the lentivirus retroviral genus (71Jern P. Sperber G.O. Blomberg J. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the sequence identity between their capsid proteins ranges from 60 to 86%. MLV belongs to the gammaretroviral genus (71Jern P. Sperber G.O. Blomberg J. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the sequence identity between the N-MLV and B-MLV capsid proteins is 97%. The sequence identity for the capsid proteins between the lentiviruses and gammaretroviruses is only around 13%. Based on the target-template sequence alignments, model structures of HIV-2, SIVagm, and SIVmac capsid proteins were built by satisfaction of spatial restraints using the MODELLER program Version 9.1 (72Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). 2000 models were built for each protein, and the final model was selected based on the modeler objective function. The structural sequence alignments were performed using the MatchMaker command of the UCSF Chimera program (73Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar). This alignment is based on a combination of residue identity/similarity and secondary structure correspondence. The former is obtained using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (74Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar) with the BLOSUM-62 (75Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4330) Google Scholar) residue similarity matrix, whereas the secondary structure assignment is computed with the Kabsch and Sander algorithm (76Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12333) Google Scholar). The weights applied to the residue similarity and secondary structure during the computation of the structural alignments were 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. HIV1-based GFP vectors were produced by CaPO4-mediated transient co-transfection of the retroviral vector, gag-pol, and env encoding constructs at a ratio of 2.8:1.8:1 as described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All vector-containing supernatants were centrifuged, filtered, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in PBS, whereas producer cells were harvested to determine gag expression levels (see below). The physical titers were determined by monitoring the reverse transcriptase enzymatic activity of a certain volume of PBS-containing vectors as described (77Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infectious titer was determined by a single-round infectivity assay on Fv1-null MDTF cells. Virion infectivity was calculated by dividing the infectious titer by the physical titer. To test Gag expression, total proteins were extracted from producer cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot. Gag polyproteins were detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the HIV1 capsid p24. 3B. Chesebro and H. Chen, the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. To ensure equal loading, the level of actin was assessed using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) followed by a secondary sheep anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Viral proteins were analyzed by loading equal amounts of virions (based on reverse transcriptase activity as described (77Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot. Gag protein in virions was detected using the same antibody as described above. A polyclonal CypA-specific antibody followed by a donkey anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody was used to determine CypA incorporation into virions. Retroviral vectors encoding TRIM5α variants were produced using the pLPCX-derived plasmids as described above. 5 × 104 MDTF were transduced with viral supernatants containing recombinant retroviral vectors and selected 3 days later by the addition of puromycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml and maintained continuously in the presence of the drug. TRIM5α expression levels were determined by immunoblot as described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged proteins were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated rat monoclonal (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science). Actin was used as a protein loading control and detected as described above. MDTF cell lines were seeded at 2.5 × 104 in a 24-well plate and transduced 24 h later with, in the case of MLV-based vectors, 6 doses of 2-fold serial dilutions of GFP reporter vectors. Infections with HIV1-based GFP vectors were performed with 3 doses (in duplicate) or 6 doses of 2-fold serial dilutions starting with equal amounts of virions particles normalized by reverse transcriptase activity as described (77Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments using CsA, the drug was added at the time of infection at a concentration of 5 μm. Cells were harvested 3 days post-transduction, fixed in 1% formaldehyde-containing PBS, and resuspended in PBS 1% fetal calf serum. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using the BD Biosciences FACScan. Results were analyzed with FlowJo 8.1.1 software. The -fold restrictions were calculated as described (66Maillard P.V. Reynard S. Serhan F. Turelli P. Trono D. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Each orthologue of TRIM5α blocks a different range of retroviruses, yet the targeted capsids present a high degree of structural homology. We focused our attention on four MLV CA residues (CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117) that were previously demonstrated to condition susceptibility to huTRIM5α, asking whether these positions also influenced MLV restriction by other TRIM5α species (19Yap M.W.

Despite the evidence that specific signaling proteins and ion channels gravitate toward these lipid microdomains, identification of their functional impact remains a formidable challenge. We report that in contrast to matured auditory hair cells, depletion of membrane cholesterol in developing hair cells produced marked potentiation of voltage-gated K+ currents (IKv). The enhanced magnitude of IKv in developing hair cells was in keeping with the reduced cholesterol-rich microdomains in matured hair cells. Remarkably, potentiation of the cholesterol-sensitive current was sufficient to abolish spontaneous activity, a functional blueprint of developing and regenerating hair cells. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that developmental plasticity of lipid microdomains and the ensuing changes in K+ currents are important determinants of one of the hallmarks in the maturation of hearing.

To achieve the post-hearing phenotype, pre-hearing hair cells undergo a precise and conserved transition from spontaneous action potentials (SAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SAPspontaneous action potentialEembryonic dayPpostnatal dayMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinTEAtetramethylammonium chloride. to graded generator potentials (2Marcotti W.

Additionally, a reduction in the Ca2+ current density and the late-stage disappearance of low voltage-activated Ca2+ current (4Levic S. Nie L. Tuteja D. Harvey M. Sokolowski B.H. Yamoah E.N. Proc.

A revised version of the structure of the plasma membrane consists of ordered microdomains rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and saturated phospholipids (13Simons K. Ikonen E.

These cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich domains are thought to confer spatial segregation of signaling pathways in cells (13Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8153) Google Scholar). Indeed, several ion channels gravitate toward these cholesterol-rich “icebergs” in the sea of lipids, which regulate channel protein functions or their cell-surface expression (18Alioua A. Lu R.

Moreover, the composition of the lipid microdomains undergoes drastic and consistent plasticity during neurodevelopment, serving as stage-specific markers for certain lineages of cells (20Yanagisawa M.

Technol. 1990; 15: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hair cell membrane-bound motor proteins such as prestin and Myo1c have biochemical properties that are consistent with their association with lipid rafts (24Sturm A.K. Rajagopalan L.

J. 2004; 87: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that lipid microdomains and their potential developmental plasticity play important roles in hair cell functions. We report for the first time that depletion of cholesterol produces a differential modulation of voltage-gated K+ currents (IKv) in developing hair cells compared with matured cells. Significantly, the data are in keeping with the developmental plasticity of cholesterol in plasma membranes of developing and matured hair cells. The ensuing impact of cholesterol depletion is a profound attenuation of SAPs in developing hair cells. We propose that alteration of the lipid composition of membrane lipids is fundamental to the transition from SAPs to graded receptor potentials, an important feature in the maturation of hearing. This investigation was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California Davis. Basilar papillae were isolated as described previously (4Levic S. Nie L. Tuteja D. Harvey M. Sokolowski B.H. Yamoah E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19108-19113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed within 5–45 min of isolation. This study included chickens at different stages of embryonic development, ranging from E6 and E21, as well as post-hatched chickens. Fertilized eggs were incubated at 37 °C in a Marsh automatic incubator (Lyon Electric). Before experiments, chicken embryos were killed and staged according to the number of somites present. Basilar papillae were isolated as described previously (4Levic S. Nie L. Tuteja D. Harvey M. Sokolowski B.H. Yamoah E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19108-19113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The preparations were dissected in oxygenated chicken saline containing 155 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 3 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The tegmentum vasculosum and the tectorial membrane were removed without any prior enzymatic treatment using a fine minutia needle. Chicken basilar papillae were stored in a 37 °C incubator in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) before recordings from hair cell in situ. All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C) within 5–45 min of isolation. All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. K+ currents were recorded in a whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration using 3–5-megohm pipettes. Currents were amplified with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and filtered at 2 kHz through a low-pass Bessel filter, and data were digitized at 5–20 kHz using an analog-to-digital converter. This study included cells (n = 537) of healthy appearance whose leak current was not greater than 30 pA at a −80-mV holding potential throughout the recording period (∼40 min). The sampling frequency was determined by the protocols used. No on-line leak current subtraction was made, and as such, only recordings with a holding current less than 20 pA were accepted for analyses. The liquid junction potentials were measured and corrected. The capacitative transients were used to estimate the capacitance of the cell as an indirect measure of the cell size. Capacitative decay was fitted with a single exponential curve to determine the membrane time constant. Series resistance was estimated from the membrane time constant, given its capacitance. The series resistances were within the 5–20-megohm range. After 60–90% compensation, the mean residual uncompensated resistance was 6.3 ± 0.5 megohms (n = 60). The seal resistance was typically 5–20 gigohms. Action potentials were amplified (100×), filtered (band pass of 2–10 kHz), and digitized at 5–500 kHz as described (4Levic S. Nie L. Tuteja D. Harvey M. Sokolowski B.H. Yamoah E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19108-19113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of channel blockers used were made in either double-distilled H2O or dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the recording bath solution was ∼0.001%. The extracellular solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 0–2 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3, 310 mosm). The intracellular solution contained 120 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2–5 mm BAPTA (1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), and 10 mm d-glucose (pH 7.3). TEA, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and cholesterol were obtained from Sigma. The stock solutions of MβCD were made in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C. A cholesterol-MβCD (8:2) complex was prepared as described (29Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of cholesterol was dissolved in 2 ml of 1:1 chloroform/methanol solution, and 12.8 μl of this solution was added to 10 ml of extracellular solution and left overnight at 37 °C. The solution was filtered to remove any remaining cholesterol crystals. The number of cells (n) is given with each data set. Data were analyzed using pClamp8 (Axon Instruments), Origin7.0 (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA), and Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Voltage dependence of activation was examined from currents elicited by step depolarizations to potentials between −70 and 50 mV at different developmental stages (E10–P2), and then normalized curves were fitted with the Boltzmann distribution. Pooled data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Significant differences between groups were tested using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 or 0.01 indicating a statistically significant difference. Data were analyzed using pClamp8 and Origin7.0. The n values reported reflect the number of cells. To visualize cholesterol in the plasma membrane of hair cells, we used filipin staining (30Reid P.C. Sakashita N. Sugii S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Hickey W.F. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 582-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Filipin binds to cholesterol with high affinity and has natural fluorescence under UV excitation. Filipin (125 μg/ml) staining was performed in a light-protected room for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation with primary reagents, the preparation was washed with 0.5 m Tris containing no serum and counterstained with NeuroTraceTM 500/525 green fluorescent Nissl stain (N-21480, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The preparation was visualized using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). To examine the roles of membrane lipids in the functional development of ionic conductances in hair cells, we determined the sensitivity of voltage-gated K+ currents (IKv) to membrane cholesterol by application of the cholesterol-depleting compound MβCD. MβCD removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane and disrupts the function of lipid rafts in eukaryotic cell membranes (29Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were elicited with ∼250-ms depolarizing voltage steps in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −80 mV. To suppress Ca2+-activated IK, we omitted Ca2+ and included 100 nm iberiotoxin in the bath solution. Fig. 1A shows traces of IKv elicited from an E12 midsection basilar papilla hair cell before and after application of MβCD. MβCD significantly enhanced IKv. Shown in Fig. 1B is the current-voltage relationship obtained from data from midsection basilar papilla hair cells (n = 16). The current modulated by MβCD or the cholesterol depletion-sensitive current is denoted as the difference current. The voltage dependence of current activation was not altered significantly, as shown in Fig. 1E. The Boltzmann fits are plotted with solid lines. Half-activation voltages were −31.3 ± 3.6 mV for the control and −35.1 ± 5.8 mV after application of MβCD (p = 0.3, n = 9). The maximum slope factors for the activation curves were 18.3 ± 1.8 mV and 16.8 ± 3.9 mV for control currents and after application of MβCD (p = 0.1, n = 9), respectively. In stark contrast to immature hair cells, the sensitivity of IKv to MβCD was lost in matured hair cells (Fig. 1C). Application of MβCD in P2 midsection hair cells left IKv unaltered, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (C and D). As shown in Fig. 1F, the MβCD-sensitive current density declined by ∼4-fold from E12 to E18. MβCD-sensitive current density was 18.6 ± 2.1 pA/picofarads at E12 and 4.6 ± 1.3 pA/picofarads at E18. After E18, the MβCD-sensitive current disappeared. Of note, the density of IKv increased by ∼3-fold from E12 to P2. To determine the specificity of the MβCD on IKv, MβCD was saturated with cholesterol at a ratio of 8:2 (ratio shown to abolish MβCD lipid-buffering capacity (29Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Abi-Char J. Maguy A. Coulombe A. Balse E. Ratajczak P. Samuel J.L. Nattel S. Hatem S.N. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). Application of a cholesterol/MβCD mixture did not potentiate IKv in immature hair cells, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The magnitude of IKv was unaltered after exposure to a cholesterol-MβCD 8:2 saturated complex (Fig. 2, A–D). Together, these experiments support the notion that MβCD exerts its effects on IKv by cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane of developing hair cells. MβCD-sensitive currents showed slow kinetics of activation and a lack of current inactivation (Fig. 1), raising the possibility that the delayed rectifier IKv in developing hair cells is the targeted current. We tested the effect of TEA on MβCD-sensitive current (8Fuchs P.A. Evans M.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 429: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A (panels a–c) illustrates the effects of 5 mm TEA on the MβCD-sensitive IKv recorded in E12 midsection basilar papilla hair cells. Note the increase in current amplitude after application of MβCD (Fig. 3, A and B) and subsequent current sensitivity to 5 mm TEA (Fig. 3A, panel c). The reverse experiment in which developing hair cells were pre-exposed to TEA showed no noticeable increase in current after exposure to MβCD (Fig. 3, C, panels a–c, and D). Thus, the data suggested that the TEA-sensitive IKv is the MβCD-sensitive conductance. Because TEA-sensitive currents are present in adult hair cells (3Fuchs P.A. Sokolowski B.H. Proc. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Fuchs P.A. Evans M.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 429: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it may be inferred that interaction of the channel producing the delay rectifier current with cholesterol is functionally relevant only in developing hair cells. Next, we cross-checked whether MβCD had any effect on inward Ca2+ currents in developing versus matured hair cells. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, Ca2+ currents in hair cells were reduced after cholesterol depletion. However, the effects of MβCD were not statistically significant (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine whether hair cell membrane cholesterol undergoes changes during development, we used filipin staining to evaluate cholesterol contents. Filipin labeling was markedly greater in E14 compared with P2 hair cells (Fig. 4). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, MβCD was effective in depleting cholesterol in hair cells. If indeed these findings have any physiological relevance, we would predict that the magnitude of the TEA-sensitive IKv would increase as part of the normal developmental plasticity of hair cell membrane cholesterol. The data shown in Fig. 1F are in keeping with the correlation between developmental changes in cholesterol and the magnitude of IKv, solidifying the physiological relevance of the present findings. To further investigate the functional ramifications of changes in membrane cholesterol in hair cell development, we examined the effects of MβCD on the spontaneous electrical activity. Fig. 5 illustrates membrane SAP from immature midsection basilar papilla hair cells at E12 before (Fig. 5A) and after (Fig. 5B) exposure to MβCD. Membrane depletion of cholesterol resulted in loss of spontaneous activity. The summary data on the effects of MβCD on the resting membrane potential are shown in Fig. 5C. Alterations of MβCD concentrations produced concentration-dependent changes in the spike frequency (Fig. 5D) and the resting membrane potential of hair cells, which is reminiscent of the effects of TEA on spike activity during development (3Fuchs P.A. Sokolowski B.H. Proc. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Fuchs P.A. Evans M.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 429: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, the spike width was reduced markedly (Fig. 5E). In this study, we show that plasma membrane cholesterol is an important determinant of the magnitude of IKv in hair cells. This effect of membrane cholesterol is an important functional feature specific to developing but not matured hair cells. The evidence and implications of this work also raise the suggestion that functional maturation of hair cells entails plasticity of membrane lipid composition. Moreover, because the TEA-sensitive IKv currents are also expressed in matured hair cells (8Fuchs P.A. Evans M.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 429: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), our findings further raise the possibility that interaction between membrane proteins and cholesterol changes with hair cell development. These effects of membrane cholesterol on IKv function could have significant consequences for the regulation of developing hair cell excitability in physiological conditions. Cholesterol and other lipid compounds such as sphingolipids assemble to form microdomains in the sea of plasma membrane lipids. These cholesterol-rich niches serve not only as platforms for the delivery of ion channel proteins but also as sites for the functional interaction of other membrane proteins (32Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Indeed, several Kv channels have been identified in these cholesterol-rich microdomains and found to produce functional alterations of channel properties (33Wong W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Levitan I. Christian A.E. Tulenko T.N. Rothblat G.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, there is a paucity of data on endogenous Kv channels in cholesterol-rich membrane niches and the functional impact of these lipid niches in the auditory system. The importance of the findings on the effects of cholesterol depletion on increased Kv channel current magnitude in developing hair cells is underpinned by the pivotal role of IKv in the development of hair cells (2Marcotti W. Johnson S.L. Holley M.C. Kros C.J. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 5Kros C.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Rüsch A. Nature. 1998; 394: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The composition of membrane lipids greatly affects the biophysical and mechanical properties of the plasma membrane such as the fluidity and stiffness, which can modulate the gating of voltage-gated channels (35Lundbaek J.A. Birn P. Girshman J. Hansen A.J. Andersen O.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3825-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 36Oliver D. Lien C.C. Soom M. Baukrowitz T. Jonas P. Fakler B. Science. 2004; 304: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 37Lindblom G. Orädd G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Niemelä P.S. Ollila S. Hyvönen M.T. Karttunen M. Vattulainen I. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e34Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Additionally, cholesterol may exert its effect by directly binding to the membrane proteins, affecting protein conformation and dynamics (39Jones O.T. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2364-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Single-channel studies have eliminated the likelihood that membrane lipids modulate single-channel unitary conductances, thereby potentiating the current (28Romanenko V.G. Fang Y. Byfield F. Travis A.J. Vandenberg C.A. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 41Toselli M. Biella G. Taglietti V. Cazzaniga E. Parenti M. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2443-2457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Instead, it appears that cholesterol affects the number of active channels in the plasma membrane. In this study, the relatively short delay between MβCD application (∼2 min) and the effect on IKv precludes the possibility for changes in channel synthesis or subunit assembly. However, there are several reports indicating that the membrane cholesterol modulates the equilibrium between active and silent forms of channels (28Romanenko V.G. Fang Y. Byfield F. Travis A.J. Vandenberg C.A. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Abi-Char J. Maguy A. Coulombe A. Balse E. Ratajczak P.

J. 2005; 89: 2443-2457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is conceivable that cholesterol modulates the surface distribution of the channels, which, as it turns out, has marked impact on channel functions (31Abi-Char J. Maguy A. Coulombe A. Balse E. Ratajczak P. Samuel J.L. Nattel S. Hatem S.N. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in addition to direct interactions with membrane cholesterol, the observed potentiation of IKv in developing hair cells could ensue from indirect association of Kv channels with other binding proteins that are lipid-sensitive (33Wong W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Martínez-Mármol R. Villalonga N. Solé L. Vicente R. Tamkun M.M. Soler C.

Res. 2006; 98: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, cholesterol depletion eliminates SAPs in developing hair cells, and in keeping with the roles of Kv channels, the resting membrane potential and action potential durations were altered accordingly. Lipid microdomains represent important niches for compartmentalization of cell functions. Indeed, several essential features of hair cells are derived and made possible by exclusive expression of specific proteins in subcellular compartments. Whereas most of the mechanosensory apparatus such as transduction channels and adaptation motor are expressed at or in close proximity to apical stereociliary bundle membranes (45LeMasurier M. Gillespie P.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 46Ren T. Gillespie P.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), prestin, the motor protein of outer hair cells (27Sfondouris J. Rajagopalan L. Pereira F.A. Brownell W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22473-22481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), voltage-gated ion channels, and synaptic protein machinery are compartmentalized at the basolateral membrane. Although until now studies on the role of membrane lipid compartmentalization in hair cells remained limited, in heterologous expression systems, prestin floats in low-density membrane fractions and associates with markers of lipid microdomains (24Sturm A.K. Rajagopalan L. Yoo D. Brownell W.E. Pereira F.A. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2007; 136: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, components of the hair cell transduction apparatus resist extraction by nonionic detergents (25Gillespie P.G. Cyr J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 521-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting that parts of the transduction apparatus are embedded in lipid raft microdomains. Thus, our findings are consistent with the growing evidence that specialized lipid microdomains may play a critical role in hair cell functions. On a pragmatic level, recent reports have associated hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia with hearing loss (47Evans M.B. Tonini R. Shope C.D. Oghalai J.S. Jerger J.F. Insull Jr., W. Brownell W.E. Otol.

The findings that outer hair cell function is tuned to membrane cholesterol content (49Rajagopalan L. Greeson J.N. Xia A. Liu H. Sturm A. Raphael R.M. Davidson A.L. Oghalai J.S. Pereira F.A.

BH4 can limit its own synthesis by triggering decameric GTPCH to assemble in an inhibitory complex with two GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) pentamers. Subsequent phenylalanine binding to the GTPCH·GFRP inhibitory complex converts it to a stimulatory complex. An N-terminal inhibitory peptide in GTPCH may also contribute to autoregulation of GTPCH activity, but mechanisms are undefined. To characterize potential regulatory actions of the N-terminal peptide in rat GTPCH, we expressed, purified, and characterized a truncation mutant, devoid of 45 N-terminal amino acids (Δ45-GTPCH) and contrasted its catalytic and GFRP binding properties to wild type GTPCH (wt-GTPCH). Contrary to prior reports, we show that GFRP binds wt-GTPCH in the absence of any small molecule effector, resulting in allosteric stimulation of GTPCH activity: a 20% increase in Vmax, 50% decrease in KmGTP, and increase in Hill coefficient to 1.6, from 1.0. These features of GFRP-stimulated wt-GTPCH activity were phenocopied by Δ45-GTPCH in the absence of bound GFRP. Addition of GFRP to Δ45-GTPCH failed to elicit complex formation or a substantial further increase in GTPCH catalytic activity. Expression of Δ45-GTPCH in HEK-293 cells elicited 3-fold greater BH4 accumulation than an equivalent of wt-GTPCH. Together, results indicate that the N-terminal peptide exerts autoinhibitory control over rat GTPCH and is required for GFRP binding on its own. Displacement of the autoinhibitory peptide provides a molecular mechanism for physiological up-regulation of GTPCH activity."

Single-site mutants derived from various multipoint mutation clusters identified the importance of discrete residues in the γ domain that are important for substrate processing. Among the various residues, aspartate at position 328 was identified as critical for substrate human plasminogen activation through extensive mutagenesis of its side chain, namely D328R, D328H, D328N, and D328A. Other mutants found to be important in substrate plasminogen activation were, namely, R319H, N339S, K334A, K334E, and L335Q. When examined for their 1:1 interaction with human plasmin, these mutants were found to retain the native-like high affinity for plasmin and also to generate amidolytic activity with partner plasminogen in a manner similar to wild type streptokinase. Moreover, cofactor activities of the mutants precomplexed with plasmin against microplasminogen as the substrate as well as in silico modeling studies suggested that the region 315–340 of the γ domain interacts with the serine protease domain of the macromolecular substrate. Overall, our results identify the presence of a substrate specific exosite in the γ domain of streptokinase.

https://openalex.org/W2084669279,"The dynactin complex is required for activation of the dynein motor complex, which plays a critical role in various cell functions including mitosis. During metaphase, the dynein-dynactin complex removes spindle checkpoint proteins from kinetochores to facilitate the transition to anaphase. Three components (p150Glued, dynamitin, and p24) compose a key portion of the dynactin complex, termed the projecting arm. To investigate the roles of the dynactin complex in mitosis, we used RNA interference to down-regulate p24 and p150Glued in human cells. In response to p24 down-regulation, we observed cells with delayed metaphase in which chromosomes frequently align abnormally to resemble a “figure eight,” resulting in cell death. We attribute the figure eight chromosome alignment to impaired metaphasic centrosomes that lack spindle tension. Like p24, RNA interference of p150Glued also induces prometaphase and metaphase delays; however, most of these cells eventually enter anaphase and complete mitosis. Our findings suggest that although both p24 and p150Glued components of the dynactin complex contribute to mitotic progression, p24 also appears to play a role in metaphase centrosome integrity, helping to ensure the transition to anaphase.
