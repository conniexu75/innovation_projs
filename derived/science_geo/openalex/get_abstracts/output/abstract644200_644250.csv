https://openalex.org/W2995305717,"Population ageing and air pollution have emerged as two of the most pressing challenges in China. However, little evidence has explored the impact of air pollution on obesity among older adults in China.The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study-a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older Chinese was linked to the air pollution data at the city level. Multilevel logistic models were fitted on obesity status among older people in relation to different air quality measures such as chronic exposures to severities of air pollution and pollutants.Air pollution was positively associated with increased risks of general obesity and abdominal obesity among older adults (N = 4,364) especially for those with disability. The marginal effects of average air quality index (AQI) on obesity suggest that one standard deviation increase in AQI is associated with increased risks of central obesity by 2.8% (95%CI 1.7% 3.9%) and abdominal obesity by 6.2% (95%CI 4.4% 8.0%). The risk of chronic exposures to light (and moderate), heavy and severe pollution on obesity elevated in a graded fashion in line with the level of pollution. Durations of exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with increased risk of obesity among older people in China.Chronic exposures to severe air pollution and certain pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 raise the risk of obesity among older people in China and the relationships were stronger for those with disability. Future policies that target these factors might provide a promising way of enhancing the physical health of older people."
https://openalex.org/W2996266928,"Increasing vessel traffic in the marine environment due to commercial and recreational activities has amplified the number of conflicts with marine animals. However, there are limited multi-year observations of the healing rate of marine animals following vessel strike. Here we document the healing rate of a reef manta ray Mobula alfredi, following lacerations caused by a propeller along the pectoral fin. We demonstrate a high healing capacity, with wound length following a negative exponential curve over time. Lacerations healed to 5% of the initial wound length (i.e. 95% closure) within 295 days. The wounds appeared to stabilise at this point as observed more than three years following the incident and resulted in a distinctive scarring pattern. Examination of an extensive photo-identification catalogue of manta rays from the Ningaloo Coast World Heritage Area showed that the scarring pattern occurs more frequently than previously recognised, as the wounds had been previously attributed to failed predation attempts. This study provides baseline information for wound healing from vessel strike in reef manta rays and indirect evidence for increased vessel strikes on manta rays within the Ningaloo Coast World Heritage Area. We discuss the implication for spatial and behavioural management of vessels around manta rays."
https://openalex.org/W2994660133,"Existing normative flow cytometry data have several limitations including small sample sizes, incompletely described study populations, variable flow cytometry methodology, and limited depth for defining lymphocyte subpopulations. To overcome these issues, we defined high-dimensional flow cytometry reference ranges for the healthy human immune system using Human Immunology Project Consortium methodologies after carefully screening 127 subjects deemed healthy through clinical and laboratory testing. We enrolled subjects in the following age cohorts: 18-29 years, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-66 and enrolled cohorts to ensure an even gender distribution and at least 30% non-Caucasians. From peripheral blood mononuclear cells, flow cytometry reference ranges were defined for >50 immune subsets including T-cell (activation, maturation, T follicular helper and regulatory T cell), B-cell, and innate cells. We also developed a web tool for visualization of the dataset and download of raw data. This dataset provides the immunology community with a resource to compare and extract data from rigorously characterized healthy subjects across age groups, gender and race."
https://openalex.org/W2952735718,"Lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic tumour in dogs and is remarkably similar to the human disease. Tumour biomarker discovery is providing new tools for diagnostics and predicting therapeutic response and clinical outcome. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that participate in post-transcriptional gene regulation and their aberrant expression can impact genes involved in cancer. The aim of this study was to characterize microRNA expression in lymph nodes and plasma from dogs with multicentric B or T cell lymphoma compared to healthy control dogs. We further compared expression between lymph nodes and corresponding plasma samples and assessed changes in expression at relapse compared to time of diagnosis. Lastly, we investigated microRNAs for association with clinical outcome in patients treated with CHOP chemotherapy. A customized PCR array was utilized to profile 38 canine target microRNAs. Quantification was performed using real time RT-qPCR and relative expression was determined by the delta-delta Ct method. In lymph nodes, there were 16 microRNAs with significantly altered expression for B cell lymphoma and 9 for T cell lymphoma. In plasma, there were 15 microRNAs altered for B cell lymphoma and 3 for T cell lymphoma. The majority of microRNAs did not have correlated expression between lymph node and plasma and only 8 microRNAs were significantly different between diagnosis and relapse. For B cell lymphoma, 8 microRNAs had differential expression in the non-remission group compared to dogs that completed CHOP in complete remission. Four of these microRNAs were also altered in patients that died prior to one-year. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for high versus low microRNA expression revealed that 10 microRNAs were correlated with progression-free survival and 3 with overall survival. This study highlights microRNAs of interest for canine multicentric lymphoma. Future goals include development of microRNA panels that may be useful as biomarkers with the intent to provide improved outcome prediction to veterinary cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2994741577,"Methanogenic archaea occupy a functionally important niche in the gut microbial ecosystem of mammals. Our purpose was to quantitatively characterize the dynamics of methanogenesis by integrating microbiology, thermodynamics and mathematical modelling. For that, in vitro growth experiments were performed with pure cultures of key methanogens from the human and ruminant gut, namely Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter ruminantium and Methanobacterium formicium. Microcalorimetric experiments were performed to quantify the methanogenesis heat flux. We constructed an energetic-based mathematical model of methanogenesis. Our model captured efficiently the dynamics of methanogenesis with average concordance correlation coefficients of 0.95 for CO2, 0.98 for H2 and 0.97 for CH4. Together, experimental data and model enabled us to quantify metabolism kinetics and energetic patterns that were specific and distinct for each species despite their use of analogous methane-producing pathways. Then, we tested in silico the interactions between these methanogens under an in vivo simulation scenario using a theoretical modelling exercise. In silico simulations suggest that the classical competitive exclusion principle is inapplicable to gut ecosystems and that kinetic information alone cannot explain gut ecological aspects such as microbial coexistence. We suggest that ecological models of gut ecosystems require the integration of microbial kinetics with nonlinear behaviours related to spatial and temporal variations taking place in mammalian guts. Our work provides novel information on the thermodynamics and dynamics of methanogens. This understanding will be useful to construct new gut models with enhanced prediction capabilities and could have practical applications for promoting gut health in mammals and mitigating ruminant methane emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2994801819,"Analysis of microbiome data involves identifying co-occurring groups of taxa associated with sample features of interest (e.g., disease state). Elucidating such relations is often difficult as microbiome data are compositional, sparse, and have high dimensionality. Also, the configuration of co-occurring taxa may represent overlapping subcommunities that contribute to sample characteristics such as host status. Preserving the configuration of co-occurring microbes rather than detecting specific indicator species is more likely to facilitate biologically meaningful interpretations. Additionally, analyses that use taxonomic relative abundances to predict the abundances of different gene functions aggregate predicted functional profiles across taxa. This precludes straightforward identification of predicted functional components associated with subsets of co-occurring taxa. We provide an approach to explore co-occurring taxa using ""topics"" generated via a topic model and link these topics to specific sample features (e.g., disease state). Rather than inferring predicted functional content based on overall taxonomic relative abundances, we instead focus on inference of functional content within topics, which we parse by estimating interactions between topics and pathways through a multilevel, fully Bayesian regression model. We apply our methods to three publicly available 16S amplicon sequencing datasets: an inflammatory bowel disease dataset, an oral cancer dataset, and a time-series dataset. Using our topic model approach to uncover latent structure in 16S rRNA amplicon surveys, investigators can (1) capture groups of co-occurring taxa termed topics; (2) uncover within-topic functional potential; (3) link taxa co-occurrence, gene function, and environmental/host features; and (4) explore the way in which sets of co-occurring taxa behave and evolve over time. These methods have been implemented in a freely available R package: https://cran.r-project.org/package=themetagenomics, https://github.com/EESI/themetagenomics."
https://openalex.org/W2995842425,"Objectives To explore the levels and trends of household need for caregivers of older people and to explore the impact of potential determinants of psychological burden among caregivers of older people in Thailand. Methods The secondary data analysis was performed using the Survey of Older Persons in Thailand 2007, 2011, and 2014 datasets which conducted by the National Statistical Office of Thailand. The household need for caregivers of older persons refers to having at least one older person in the household who needs a caregiver for assistance with activities of daily living. Caregiver mental health, which is confined to the available 2011 data, is defined as a state of psychological burden. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to explore the impact of potential determinants of psychological caregiver burden. Results The household need for caregivers in Thailand tends to be increasing, from 5.0% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2014. The levels of the household need for caregivers were significantly higher in urban areas, Bangkok, and high socioeconomic households. In terms of psychological caregiver burden, the Thai Mental Health Indicators in 2011 produced, on average, a fair level of mental health, but one-fourth of caregivers had poor mental health. Duration of care for older people, household wealth, and functional dependency significantly predict total caregiver burden. Household characteristics are vital in predicting psychological caregiver burden, and the adjusted effect of the fifth quintile of household wealth was high (odds ratio = 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.47–3.73). Conclusion The increasing need for caregiving in households with an older person can lead to a higher caregiver burden, particularly among those caregivers who care for dependent older people in poor households. Longer duration of caregiving is a factor that mitigates this burden."
https://openalex.org/W2995465782,"This study aimed to examine the effects of chronic methamphetamine use on the topological organization of whole-brain functional connectivity network (FCN) by reconstruction of neural-activity time series at resting-state. The EEG of 36 individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (IWMUD) and 24 normal controls (NCs) were recorded, pre-processed and source-reconstructed using standardized low-resolution tomography (sLORETA). The brain FCNs of participants were constructed and between-group differences in network topological properties were investigated using graph theoretical analysis. IWMUD showed decreased characteristic path length, increased clustering coefficient and small-world index at delta and gamma frequency bands compared to NCs. Moreover, abnormal changes in inter-regional connectivity and network hubs were observed in all the frequency bands. The results suggest that the IWMUD and NCs have distinct FCNs at all the frequency bands, particularly at the delta and gamma bands, in which deviated small-world brain topology was found in IWMUD."
https://openalex.org/W2995562343,"Disease causing gene identification is considered as an important step towards drug design and drug discovery. In disease gene identification and classification, the main aim is to identify disease genes while identifying non-disease genes are of less or no significant. Hence, this task can be defined as a one-class classification problem. Existing machine learning methods typically take into consideration known disease genes as positive training set and unknown genes as negative samples to build a binary-class classification model. Here we propose a new One-class Classification Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) method to precisely classify candidate disease genes. Our aim is to build a model that concentrate its focus on detecting known disease-causing gene to increase sensitivity and precision. We investigate the impact of our proposed model using a benchmark consisting of the gene expression dataset for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cancer. Compared with the traditional methods, our experimental result shows the superiority of our proposed method in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure to detect disease causing genes for AML. OCSVM codes and our extracted AML benchmark are publicly available at: https://github.com/imandehzangi/OCSVM."
https://openalex.org/W2995292147,"Aegicetus gehennae is a new African protocetid whale based on a partial skull with much of an associated postcranial skeleton. The type specimen, Egyptian Geological Museum, Cairo [CGM] 60584, was found near the base of the early-Priabonian-age (earliest late Eocene) Gehannam Formation of the Wadi Al Hitan World Heritage Site in Egypt. The cranium is distinctive in having ventrally-deflected exoccipitals. The vertebral column is complete from cervical C1 through caudal Ca9, with a vertebral formula of 7:15:4:4:9+, representing, respectively, the number of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae. CGM 60584 has two more rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae than other known protocetids, and two fewer lumbars. Sacral centra are unfused, and there is no defined auricular surface on the ilium. Thus there was no weight-bearing sacroiliac joint. The sternum is distinctive in being exceptionally broad and flat. The body weight of CGM 60584, a putative male, is estimated to have been about 890 kg in life. Long bones of the fore and hind limbs are shorter than expected for a protocetid of this size. Bones of the manus are similar in length and more robust compared to those of the pes. A log vertebral length profile for CGM 60584 parallels that of middle Eocene Maiacetus inuus through the anterior and middle thorax, but more posterior vertebrae are proportionally longer. Vertebral elongation, loss of a sacroiliac articulation, and hind limb reduction indicate that Aegicetus gehennae was more fully aquatic and less specialized as a foot-powered swimmer than earlier protocetids. It is doubtful that A. gehennae had a tail fluke, and the caudal flattening known for basilosaurids is shorter relative to vertebral column length than flattening associated with a fluke in any modern whale. Late protocetids and basilosaurids had relatively long skeletons, longer than those known earlier and later, and the middle-to-late Eocene transition from foot-powered to tail-powered swimming seemingly involved some form of mid-body-and-tail undulation."
https://openalex.org/W4251924638,"The world glaciers and areas of persistent summer snowpack are being lost due to warming temperatures. For cold-adapted species, habitat features may offer opportunities for cooling during summer heat yet the loss of snow and ice may compromise derived thermoregulatory benefits. Herein we offer insights about habitat selection for snow and the extent to which other behavioral adjustments reduce thermal debt among high elevation mammals. Specifically, we concentrate on respiration in mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), a species whose native distribution is currently tied to northern mountain ranges of North America, where large patches of persistent summer snow are declining, and which became extinct during geologically warmer epochs. To examine sensitivity to possible thermal stressors and use of summer snow cover, we tracked marked and unmarked mountain goats in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, to test hypotheses about selection for cold microclimates including shade and snow during periods of relatively high temperature. To understand functional responses of habitat choices, we measured microhabitat temperatures and a component of goat physiology-breaths per minute-as an index for metabolic expenditure. Individuals 1) selected areas closer to snow on warmer summer days, and 2) on snow had a 15% mean reduction in respiration when accounting for other factors, which suggests remnant snow plays an important role in mediating effects of air temperature. The use of shade was not as an important variable in models explaining respiration. Despite the loss of 85% of glaciers in in Glacier National Park, summer's remnant snow patches are an important reservoir by which animals reduce heat stress and potential hyperthermia. Our findings, when contextualized with behavioral strategies deployed by other high elevation mammalian taxa help frame how ambient temperatures may be modulated, and they offer a direct way by which to assess susceptibility to increasing heat in cold-adapted species."
https://openalex.org/W2995029472,"Testis-specific serine/threonine kinase 1-like (TSSK1-like), which plays important roles in late-phase spermatogenesis and male fertility, was characterized in Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai, an important commercial marine gastropod. Further, its expression patterns were assessed in diploid and induced triploid males showing differential degrees of testis maturation. Abalone TSSK1-like shared conserved structural features with mammalian TSSK1s and other potential metazoan orthologs, especially regarding the catalytic STKc domain. Phylogenetically, abalone TSSK1-like displayed a genetic affiliation with its molluscan TSSK1-like orthologs and human TSSK1. Additionally, abalone TSSK1-like gene showed a tetrapartite exon-intron organization, unlike the intronless structure of most amniotic tetrapodian TSSK1s. Molecular phylogenetic analysis in the metazoan lineage suggested a possible revision in the origin of the earliest ancestral TSSK1. Further, abalone TSSK1-like showed testis-predominant expression, which was significantly influenced by both age and seasonal reproductive cycles. Comparative expression analyses between diploid and triploid abalone males suggested that robust TSSK1-like expression occurred primarily at the post-meiotic stage. Additionally, RT-PCR assay indicates that mature abalone sperms retain TSSK1-like transcripts after release. Taken together, this study provides useful insights for further studies to assess male reproduction and sterility and/or partial fertility of induced male triploidy in abalone species."
https://openalex.org/W2995431196,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a ubiquitous RNA post-transcriptional modification found in coding as well as non-coding RNAs. m6A has also been found in viral RNAs where it is proposed to modulate host-pathogen interactions. Two m6A sites have been reported in the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) stem IIB, one of which was shown to enhance binding to the viral protein Rev and viral RNA export. However, because these m6A sites have not been observed in other studies mapping m6A in HIV-1 RNA, their significance remains to be firmly established. Here, using optical melting experiments, NMR spectroscopy, and in vitro binding assays, we show that m6A minimally impacts the stability, structure, and dynamics of RRE stem IIB as well as its binding affinity to the Rev arginine-rich-motif (ARM) in vitro. Our results indicate that if present in stem IIB, m6A is unlikely to substantially alter the conformational properties of the RNA. Our results add to a growing view that the impact of m6A on RNA depends on sequence context and Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W2995517936,"The increasing concerns with antimicrobial resistance highlights the need for studies evaluating the impacts of antimicrobial use in livestock on antimicrobial resistance using new sequencing technologies. Through shotgun sequencing, we investigated the changes in the fecal microbiome composition and function, with a focus on functions related to antimicrobial resistance, of dairy calves. Heifers 2 to 3 weeks old, which were not treated with antibiotics by the farm before enrollment, were randomly allocated to one of three study groups: control (no treatment), a single treatment of enrofloxacin, or a single treatment of tulathromycin. Fecal samples were collected at days 4, 14, 56 and 112 days after enrollment, and DNA extraction and sequencing was conducted. The effect of antibiotic treatment on each taxon and genetic functional level by time (including Day 0 as a covariate) revealed few changes in the microbiota. At the genus level, enrofloxacin group had higher relative abundance of Blautia, Coprococcus and Desulfovibrio and lower abundance of Bacteroides when compared to other study groups. The SEED database was used for genetic functional analyses, which showed that calves in the enrofloxacin group started with a higher relative abundance of ""Resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds"" function on Day 0, however an increase in antibiotic resistance genes after treatment with enrofloxacin was not observed. ""Resistance to Fluoroquinolones"" and ""Erythromycin resistance"", of relevance given the study groups, were not statistically different in relative abundance between study groups. ""Resistance to fluoroquinolones"" increased during the study period regardless of study group. Despite small differences over the first weeks between study groups, at Day 112 the microbiota composition and genetic functional profile was similar among all study groups. In our study, enrofloxacin or tulathromycin had minimal impacts on the microbial composition and genetic functional microbiota of calves over the study period."
https://openalex.org/W2995827563,"Trust in parental support and subsequent support seeking behavior, a hallmark of secure attachment, result from experiences with sensitive parents during distress. However, the underlying developmental mechanism remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that trust is the result of an expectancy-learning process condtional upon contingency (the probability that caregiver support has a positive outcome). We developed a new paradigm in which a novel caregiver provides help to solve a problem. Contingency of the caregiver’s support was manipulated and participants’ trust in the caregiver and their help seeking behavior was measured in three independent samples. The hypothesis was supported suggesting that trust and support seeking result from an expectancy-learning process. These findings’ potential contribution to attachment theory is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2996053729,"Background Because tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) leads to significantly lower plasma tenofovir concentrations than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and is a stronger substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) than TDF, TAF could lead to decreased central nervous system (CNS) tenofovir exposure than TDF. We aimed to determine if switching from TDF to TAF increases the risk of neuronal injury, by quantifying plasma levels of neurofilament light protein (NfL), a sensitive marker of neuronal injury in HIV CNS infection. Methods Plasma NfL concentration was measured at baseline, week 24, and week 84 in stored plasma samples from 416 participants (272 switching to elvitegravir (E)/cobicistat (C)/emtricitabine (F)/TAF and 144 continuing E/C/F/TDF) enrolled in the randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority Gilead GS-US-292-0109 trial. Results While plasma NfL levels in both groups were within the normal range, we found a small but significant decrease in the E/C/F/TAF arm after 84 weeks from a geometric mean of 9.3 to 8.8 pg/mL (5.4% decline, 95% CI 2.0-8.4, p = 0.002). This change was significantly different (p = 0.001) from that of the E/C/F/TDF arm, in which plasma NfL concentration changed from 9.7 pg/mL at baseline to 10.2 pg/mL at week 84 (5.8% increase, 95% CI -0.8-12.9, p = 0.085). This increase is in line with what could be expected in normal ageing. Plasma NfL concentrations significantly correlated with age. No correlation was found between plasma NfL and serum creatinine. Conclusions We found no biomarker evidence of CNS injury when switching from TDF to TAF. It is unclear whether the small decrease in plasma NfL found after switch to TAF is of any clinical relevance, particularly with plasma NfL levels in both arms remaining within the limits found in HIV-negative controls. These results indicate that switching from TDF to TAF appears safe with regard to neuronal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2995551073,"Recently, we have documented a hematopoietic NKL-code mapping physiological expression patterns of NKL homeobox genes in early hematopoiesis and in lymphopoiesis, which spotlights genes deregulated in lymphoid malignancies. Here, we enlarge this map to include normal NKL homeobox gene expressions in myelopoiesis by analyzing public expression profiling data and primary samples from developing and mature myeloid cells. We thus uncovered differential activities of six NKL homeobox genes, namely DLX2, HHEX, HLX, HMX1, NKX3-1 and VENTX. We further examined public expression profiling data of 251 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 183 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, thereby identifying 24 deregulated genes. These results revealed frequent deregulation of NKL homeobox genes in myeloid malignancies. For detailed analysis we focused on NKL homeobox gene NANOG, which acts as a stem cell factor and is correspondingly expressed alone in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We detected aberrant expression of NANOG in a small subset of AML patients and in AML cell line NOMO-1, which served as a model. Karyotyping and genomic profiling discounted rearrangements of the NANOG locus at 12p13. But gene expression analyses of AML patients and AML cell lines after knockdown and overexpression of NANOG revealed regulators and target genes. Accordingly, NKL homeobox genes HHEX, DLX5 and DLX6, stem cell factors STAT3 and TET2, and the NOTCH-pathway were located upstream of NANOG while NKL homeobox genes HLX and VENTX, transcription factors KLF4 and MYB, and anti-apoptosis-factor MIR17HG represented target genes. In conclusion, we have extended the NKL-code to the myeloid lineage and thus identified several NKL homeobox genes deregulated in AML and MDS. These data indicate a common oncogenic role of NKL homeobox genes in both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. For misexpressed NANOG we identified an aberrant regulatory network, which contributes to the understanding of the oncogenic activity of NKL homeobox genes."
https://openalex.org/W2995887093,"Introduction To determine whether on-site incubation of blood cultures at the intensive care unit (ICU) improves not only the time to incubation but also time to positivity, time to knowledge of positivity and time to results (identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing). Methods This observational single-centre study in ICU patients with severe sepsis and septic shock investigated the impact of blood culture incubation immediately on-site at the ICU (ICU group) by comparison with traditional processing in a remote laboratory (LAB group) on different time intervals of blood culture diagnostics from obtaining blood to clinician notification of final result. The effect of on-site incubation was evaluated in Kaplan-Meier estimates for the time to positivity, time to knowledge of positivity and time to microbiological results and a linear mixed model was built. Results A total of 3,549 blood culture sets from 657 ICU patients were analysed: 2,381 in the LAB group and 1,168 in the ICU group. Overall, 660 (18.6%) blood culture sets were positive and 2,889 (81.4%) sets remained negative. On-site incubation was associated with reduced time to knowledge of positivity (46.9 h [CI 43.4–50.8 h] vs. 28.0 h [CI 23.6–32.2 h], p < 0.001) and reduced time to result (61.4 h [CI 58.4–64.8 h] vs. 42.1 h [CI 39.1–47.5 h], p < 0.001). In blood cultures processed instantaneously at the ICU compared to incubation in the remote laboratory within 4 h, the time to microbiological result was significantly reduced by 8.5 h (p < 0.001). Pre-existing anti-infective therapy had no significant impact on diagnostic time intervals. Conclusions Instantaneous incubation of blood cultures in the ICU compared to incubation in a remote laboratory significantly improves time to knowledge to positivity and time to result. These effects are even more pronounced during off-hours of the microbiological laboratory. The results underline the importance of 24/7 diagnostics to provide round-the-clock processing of blood culture samples in patients with sepsis and septic shock and an immediate to communication of the results to the clinicians."

https://openalex.org/W2996102260,"Visceral Leishmaniasis is a chronic zoonosis and, if left untreated, can be fatal. Infected dogs have decreased cellular immunity (Th1) and develop a potent humoral response (Th2), which is not effective for elimination of the protozoan. Immune response can be modulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), however, characterization of miRNAs and their possible regulatory role in the spleen of infected dogs have not been done. We evaluated miRNA expression in splenic leukocytes (SL) from dogs naturally infected with Leishmania infantum and developing leishmaniasis (CanL; n = 8) compared to healthy dogs (n = 4). Microarray analysis showed increased expression of miR 21, miR 148a, miR 7 and miR 615, and downregulation of miR 150, miR 125a and miR 125b. Real-time PCR validated the differential expression of miR 21, miR 148a and miR 615. Further, decrease of miR 21 in SL, by means of transfection with a miR 21 inhibitor, increased the IL-12 cytokine and the T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, and decreased parasite load on SL of dogs with CanL. Taken together, these findings suggest that L. infantum infection alters splenic expression of miRNAs and that miR 21 interferes in the cellular immune response of L. infantum-infected dogs, placing this miRNA as a possible therapeutic target in CanL."

TL states that the variance of population abundance is a power function of the mean population abundance. Despite extensive studies of TL for non-human populations, testing and interpreting TL using data on human populations are rare. Here we examine three types of TL that quantify the spatial and temporal variation of US county population abundance. Our results show that TL and its quadratic extension describe the mean-variance relationship of county population distribution well. The slope and statistics of TL reveal economic and demographic trends of the county populations. We propose TL as a useful statistical tool for analyzing human population variability. We suggest new ways of using TL to select and make population projections."
https://openalex.org/W2995783395,"The recent clinical application of perfusion technology for the machine preservation of donation after cardiac death (DCD) grafts has some advantages. Oxygenation has been proposed for the preservation of DCD liver grafts. The aim of this study is to clarify whether the use of HbV-containing preservation solution during the subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) of the liver graft improves the graft function of DCD porcine livers in an ex vivo reperfusion model. Pig livers were excised after 60 minutes of warm ischemic time and were preserved under one of three preservation conditions for 4 hours. The preservation conditions were as follows: 4°C cold storage (CS group; N = 5), Hypothermic machine preservation (HMP) with UW gluconate solution (HMP group; N = 5), SNMP (21°C) with UW gluconate solution (SNMP group; N = 5), SNMP (21°C) with HbVs (Hb; 1.8 mg/dl) perfusate (SNMP+HbV group; N = 5). Autologous blood perfusion was performed for 2 hours in an isolated liver reperfusion model (IRM). The oxygen consumption of the SNMP and SNMP+HbV group was higher than the HMP groups (p < 0.05). During the reperfusion, the AST level in the SNMP+HbV group was lower than that in the CS, HMP and SNMP groups. The changes in pH after reperfusion was significantly lower in SNMP+HbV group than CS and HMP groups. The ultrastructural findings indicated that the mitochondria of the SNMP+HbV group was well maintained in comparison to the CS, HMP and SNMP groups. The SNMP+HbVs preservation solution protected against metabolic acidosis and preserved the liver function after reperfusion injury in the DCD liver."
https://openalex.org/W2994702964,"Myctophids are among the most abundant mesopelagic teleost fishes worldwide. They are dominant in the Southern Ocean, an extreme environment where they are important both as consumers of zooplankton as well as food items for larger predators. Various studies have investigated myctophids diet, but no data is yet available regarding their associated microbiota, despite that the significance of bacterial communities to fish health and adaptation is increasingly acknowledged. In order to document microbiota in key fish groups from the Southern Ocean, the bacterial communities associated with the gut, fin, gills and light organs of members of six species within the three myctophid genera Electrona, Protomyctophum and Gymnoscopelus were characterized using a 16S rRNA-based metabarcoding approach. Gut communities display limited diversity of mostly fish-specific lineages likely involved in food processing. Fin and skin communities display diversity levels and compositions resembling more those found in surrounding seawater. Community compositions are similar between genera Electrona and Protomyctophum, that differ from those found in Gymnoscopelus and in water. Low abundances of potentially light-emitting bacteria in light organs support the hypothesis of host production of light. This first description of myctophid-associated microbiota, and among the first on fish from the Southern Ocean, emphasizes the need to extend microbiome research beyond economically-important species, and start addressing ecologically-relevant species."
https://openalex.org/W2994863389,"Background Walking ability is an important prerequisite for activity, social participation and independent living. While in most healthy adults, this ability can be assumed as given, limitations in walking ability occur with increasing age. Furthermore, slow walking speed is linked to several chronic conditions and overall morbidity. Measurements of gait parameters can be used as a proxy to detect functional decline and onset of chronic conditions. Up to now, gait characteristics used for this purpose are measured in standardized laboratory settings. There is some evidence, however, that long-term measurements of gait parameters in the living environment have some advantages over short-term laboratory measurements. Methods We evaluated cross-sectional data from an accelerometric sensor worn in a subgroup of 554 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). Data from the two BASE-II age groups (age between 22–36 years and 60–79 years) were used for the current analysis of accelerometric data for a minimum of two days and a maximum of ten days were available. Real world walking speed, number of steps, maximum coherent distance and total distance were derived as average data per day. Linear regression analyses were performed on the different gait parameters in order to identify significant determinants. Additionally, Mann-Whitney-U-tests were performed to detect sex-specific differences. Results Age showed to be significantly associated with real world walking speed and with the total distance covered per day, while BMI contributed negatively to the number of walking steps, maximum coherent distance and total distance walked. Additionally, sex was associated with walking steps. However, R2-values for all models were low. Overall, women had significantly more walking steps and a larger coherent distance per day when compared to men. When separated by age group, this difference was significant only in the older participants. Additionally, walking speed was significantly higher in women compared to men in the subgroup of older people. Conclusions Age- and sex-specific differences have to be considered when objective gait parameters are measured, e.g. in the context of clinical risk assessment. For this purpose normative data, differentiating for age and sex would have to be established to allow reliable classification of long-term measurements of gait."
https://openalex.org/W2995593492,"Current sinks and sources spatially separated between the apical and basal dendrites have been believed to be essential in generating local field potentials (LFPs). According to this theory, LFPs would not be large enough to be observed in the regions without laminar structures, such as striatum and thalamus. However, LFPs are experimentally recorded in these regions. We hypothesized that focal excitatory input induces a concentric current sink and source generating LFPs in these regions. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by the numerical simulations of multicompartment neuron models and the analysis of simplified models. Both confirmed that focal excitatory input can generate LFPs on the order of 0.1 mV in a region without laminar structures. The present results suggest that LFPs in subcortical nuclei indicate localized excitatory input."
https://openalex.org/W2995762923,"The study of social cognition (SC) has emerged as a key domain of mental health, supporting the notion that poorer performance in SC tasks is linked to psychopathology, although most studies have primarily addressed only schizophrenia (SZ). Some recent studies have also shown deficits of SC in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients; however, little is known about how individuals with OCD may differ on SC performance from individuals with SZ. Moreover, initial research in this field suggests that mindfulness skills may be related to SC abilities such as theory of mind (ToM), emotion processing and empathy. Given the potential benefits of mindfulness for treating OCD and SZ, further efforts are needed to understand the association between mindfulness and SC in these populations. The main objective of this study was to compare samples of patients with SZ and OCD to healthy controls (HCs) on several social cognition (SC) domains and mindfulness measures. In total, 30 outpatients diagnosed with SZ, 31 outpatients diagnosed with OCD and 30 healthy controls were assessed in emotion recognition (the Eyes Test), ToM (the Hinting Task), attributional style (the Ambiguous Intentions and Hostility Questionnaire), empathy (the Interpersonal Reactivity Index) and dispositional mindfulness (the MAAS and the FFMQ). Both clinical groups showed poorer performance in emotion recognition and ToM than the HCs. The OCD and SZ patients did not significantly differ in impairment in SC, but the OCD group had higher scores in attributional style (intentionality and anger bias). With regard to mindfulness, the results found lower levels of acting with awareness for the HCs than for either clinical group and higher non-reactivity to inner experience for the HCs than for the individuals with OCD; the results also yielded significant correlations between SC and mindfulness. In conclusion, these findings revealed that SC abilities were impaired in the SZ and OCD groups compared to the HC group, suggesting a similar disrupted pattern in both clinical groups. Aspects of dispositional mindfulness were differentially associated with SC, which may suggest their potential role in novel transdiagnostic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2995977978,"Flavored tobacco products are increasing in popularity but remain unregulated, with the exception of the ban on flavored conventional cigarettes. Lack of regulation of cigarillos and little cigars allows vendors to have their own version of popular flavors, each with different chemical components. A new classification system was created for flavored cigars in order to easily communicate our results with the scientific community. To understand the physicochemical characteristics of flavored little cigars and cigarillo smoke, size distribution and concentration of particulate matter in smoke were determined. Acellular reactive oxygen species generation was measured as an indirect measurement of the potential to cause oxidative stress in cells. In addition, cigarillo smoke extract treatment on bronchial epithelial (Beas-2b) cells were assessed to determine the flavor-induced cellular toxicity. Flavored cigars/cigarillos showed significant variability in the tested parameters between flavors as well as brands of the same flavor, but most of the cigars showed higher potential of generating oxidative stress, than research grade cigarettes. Flavored cigars produced maximum particle concentrations at 1.0μm and 4.0 μm compared with 3R4F reference research cigarettes. A differential cytotoxic response was observed with cigarillo smoke extract treatments, with “fruits/candy” and “drinks” being the most toxic, but were not more cytotoxic than smoke from cigarettes. These cigarillos with flavors must be well characterized for toxicity in order to prevent adverse effects caused by exposure to flavor chemicals. Our study provides insight into understanding the potential health effects of flavor-infused cigars/cigarillos and the need for the regulation of those flavoring chemicals in these products. Future research is directed to determine the flavoring toxicity of little cigars and cigarillos in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W2996243803,"The Asian/American genotype of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) has been introduced in Brazil through the state of Rio de Janeiro around 1990, and since then it has been spreading and evolving, leading to several waves of dengue epidemics throughout the country that cause a major public health problem. Of particular interest has been the epidemic of 2008, whose highest impact was evidenced in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a higher number of severe cases and mortality rate, compared to previous outbreaks. Interestingly, no circulation of DENV-2 was witnessed in this region during the preceding 9-year period. By early 2010, phylogenetic analysis of the 2008 epidemic strain revealed that the outbreak was caused by a new viral lineage of the Asian/American genotype, which was pointed as responsible for the outbreak severity as well. The same scenario is repeating in 2019 in this state; however, only a few cases have been detected yet. To provide information that helps to the understanding of DENV-2 dynamics in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and thereafter contribute to public health control and prevention actions, we employed phylogenetic studies combined with temporal and dynamics geographical features to determine the origin of the current viral strain. To this effect, we analyzed a region of 1626 nucleotides entailing the Envelope/NS1 viral genes. Our study reveals that the current strain belongs to the same lineage that caused the 2008 outbreak, however, it is phylogenetically distant from any Brazilian strain identified so far. Indeed, it seemed to be originated in Puerto Rico around 2002 and has been introduced into the state in late 2018. Taking into account that no DENV-2 case was reported over the last decade in the state (representing a whole susceptible children generation), and the fact that a new viral strain may be causing current dengue infections, these results will be influential in strengthening dengue surveillance and disease control, mitigating the potential epidemiological consequences of virus spread."
https://openalex.org/W2994354891,"The present study compared lab-based and web-based versions of cognitive individual difference measures widely used in second language research (working memory and declarative memory). Our objective was to validate web-based versions of these tests for future research and to make these measures available for the wider second language research community, thus contributing to the study of individual differences in language learning. The establishment of measurement equivalence of the two administration modes is important because web-based testing allows researchers to address methodological challenges such as restricted population sampling, low statistical power, and small sample sizes. Our results indicate that the lab-based and web-based versions of the tests were equivalent, i.e., scores of the two test modes correlated. The strength of the relationships, however, varied as a function of the kind of measure, with equivalence appearing to be stronger in both the working memory and the verbal declarative memory tests, and less so in the nonverbal declarative memory test. Overall, the study provides evidence that web-based testing of cognitive abilities can produce similar performance scores as in the lab."
https://openalex.org/W2994624782,"From a large clinical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we report several interrelated findings involving transient supra-network brainwide states characterized by a saturation phenomenon we are referring to as “polarization.” These are whole-brain states in which the voxelwise-normalized BOLD (vn-BOLD) activation of a large proportion of voxels is simultaneously either very high or very low. The presence of such states during a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan is significantly anti-correlated with diagnosed schizophrenia, significantly anti-correlated with connectivity between subcortical networks and auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks and also significantly anti-correlated with contemporaneous occupancy of transient functional network connectivity states featuring broad disconnectivity or strong inhibitory connections between the default mode and other networks. Conversely, the presence of highly polarized vn-BOLD states is significantly correlated with connectivity strength between auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks and with contemporaneous occupancy of transient whole-brain patterns of strongly modularized network connectivity and diffuse hyperconnectivity. Despite their consistency with well-documented effects of schizophrenia on static and time-varying functional network connectivity, the observed relationships between polarization and network connectivity are with very few exceptions unmediated by schizophrenia diagnosis. Many differences observed between patients and controls are echoed within the patient population itself in the effect patterns of positive symptomology (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity). Our findings highlight a particular whole-brain spatiotemporal BOLD activation phenomenon that differs markedly between healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients, one that also strongly informs time-resolved network connectivity patterns that are associated with this serious clinical disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2996296722,"Recently, porous acupuncture (PA), which is anodized to increase its surface area for higher stimulation intensity, was developed and showed significantly improved therapeutic effects with more comfort as compared with original acupuncture (OA) in vivo. However, the impact of PA on the change of local blood flow as well as its efficacy and acceptability has not yet been confirmed in a clinical trial. In a randomized, controlled crossover clinical trial, we investigated the effects of PA on the change in local blood flow using laser Doppler perfusion imaging and considered the sensation of pain intensity and discomfort severity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) to explore its physiological impact and the possibility of PA in clinical use.Twenty-one healthy participants were randomly treated with PA or OA on one side of Zusanli (ST36) and each participant served as his or her own control. Baseline local blood flow and galvanic skin response (GSR) were obtained for 5 min and acupuncture interventions were subsequently performed. Next, local blood flow and GSR were subsequently obtained for 10 min after insertion, 10 min after manipulation, and 5 min after the withdrawal of acupuncture. At the end of the experiment, participants were asked to indicate the sensation of pain intensity at each session of insertion, retention, manipulation, and withdrawal as well as the overall pain intensity and discomfort severity.PA significantly increased the local blood flow as compared with OA and there was no significant difference in GSR between patients treated with PA versus OA in each phase of insertion and manipulation. No significant difference in pain intensity or discomfort severity was found during manipulation, retention, or withdrawal of acupuncture.These results indicate that PA increases local blood flow, which can be closely related to the observed enhanced performance, without any associated discomfort or pain, suggesting its applicability in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2996586378,"Biodiversity loss and sparse observational data mean that critical conservation decisions may be based on little to no information. Emerging technologies, such as airborne thermal imaging and virtual reality, may facilitate species monitoring and improve predictions of species distribution. Here we combined these two technologies to predict the distribution of koalas, specialized arboreal foliovores facing population declines in many parts of eastern Australia. For a study area in southeast Australia, we complemented ground-survey records with presence and absence observations from thermal-imagery obtained using Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Systems. These field observations were further complemented with information elicited from koala experts, who were immersed in 360-degree images of the study area. The experts were asked to state the probability of habitat suitability and koala presence at the sites they viewed and to assign each probability a confidence rating. We fit logistic regression models to the ground survey data and the ground plus thermal-imagery survey data and a Beta regression model to the expert elicitation data. We then combined parameter estimates from the expert-elicitation model with those from each of the survey models to predict koala presence and absence in the study area. The model that combined the ground, thermal-imagery and expert-elicitation data substantially reduced the uncertainty around parameter estimates and increased the accuracy of classifications (koala presence vs absence), relative to the model based on ground-survey data alone. Our findings suggest that data elicited from experts using virtual reality technology can be combined with data from other emerging technologies, such as airborne thermal-imagery, using traditional statistical models, to increase the information available for species distribution modelling and the conservation of vulnerable and protected species."
https://openalex.org/W2995302866,"Epithelial ovarian cancers are insidious pathologies that give a poor prognosis due to their late discovery and the increasing emergence of chemoresistance. Development of small pharmacological anticancer molecules remains a major challenge. Ribavirin, usually used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infections and more recently few cancers, has been a suggestion. However, Ribavirin has many side-effects, suggesting that the synthesis of analogs might be more appropriate. We have investigated the effect of a Ribavirin analog, SRO-91, on cancer cell behavioral characteristics considered as some of the hallmarks of cancer. Two human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines (SKOV3 and IGROV1) and normal cells (mesothelial and fibroblasts) have been used to compare the effects of SRO-91 with those of Ribavirin on cell behavior underlying tumor cell dissemination. SRO-91, like Ribavirin, inhibits proliferation, migration, clonogenicity and spheroids formation of cancer cells. Unlike Ribavirin, SRO-91 is preferentially toxic to cancer compared with normal cells. An in vitro physiologically relevant model showed that SRO-91, like Ribavirin or cisplatin, inhibits cancer cell implantation onto peritoneal mesothelium. In conclusion, SRO-91 analog effects on tumor dissemination and its safety regarding non-cancerous (normal) cells are encouraging findings a promising drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2996636605,"Introduction Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 (PCSK6) is a secretory protein that activates corin in the heart. Higher circulating levels of corin are associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This study aimed to determine the role of serum PCSK6 and corin levels in predicting cardiovascular outcomes in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods In total, 565 patients who had undergone coronary angiography were enrolled. Serum PCSK6 and corin levels were determined before the administration of contrast media. In this study, coronary revascularization, acute myocardial infarction, acute stroke, and death were defined as cardiovascular outcomes. All patients were followed up for at least one year after coronary angiography or until the occurrence of death. Results During a median follow-up of 691 days, 67 patients (15.7%) developed composite cardiovascular outcomes after coronary angiography, including 51 incidents of coronary revascularization, 7 instances of acute myocardial infarction, 2 acute strokes, and 15 deaths. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and all significant variables in the univariate analysis, serum levels of neither PCSK6 nor corin were associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes. This correlation remained insignificant in patients with underlying hypertension, diabetes mellitus, CAD, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, in patients without CKD, higher serum PCSK6 levels were associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes (hazard ratio 1.380; 95% confidence interval 1.023–1.862). Conclusions We found no association between cardiovascular outcomes and pre-procedural serum levels of PCSK6 or corin in patients undergoing coronary angiography. However, an increased risk was seen in non-CKD patients with higher PCSK6 levels. Further studies are needed to verify these results."
https://openalex.org/W2994873403,"Multiple-Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) is widely used by laboratory-based surveillance networks for subtyping pathogens causing foodborne and water-borne disease outbreaks. However, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has recently emerged as the new more powerful reference for pathogen subtyping, making a data conversion method necessary which enables the users to compare the MLVA identified by either method. The MLVAType shiny application was designed to extract MLVA profiles of Vibrio cholerae isolates from WGS data while ensuring backward compatibility with traditional MLVA typing methods.To test and validate the MLVAType algorithm, WGS-derived MLVA profiles of nineteen Vibrio cholerae isolates from Democratic Republic of the Congo (n = 9) and Uganda (n = 10) were compared to MLVA profiles generated by an in silico PCR approach and Sanger sequencing, the latter being used as the reference method.Results obtained by Sanger sequencing and MLVAType were totally concordant. However, the latter were affected by censored estimations whose percentage was inversely proportional to the k-mer parameter used during genome assembly. With a k-mer of 127, less than 15% estimation of V. cholerae VNTR was censored. Preventing censored estimation was only achievable when using a longer k-mer size (i.e. 175), which is not proposed in the SPAdes v.3.13.0 software.As NGS read lengths and qualities tend to increase with time, one may expect the increase of k-mer size in a near future. Using MLVAType application with a longer k-mer size will then efficiently retrieve MLVA profiles from WGS data while avoiding censored estimation."

https://openalex.org/W2994904865,"Objective Fetal exposure to an intrauterine environment affected by maternal obesity and excessive gestational weight gain increases the likelihood of infants born large for gestational age and childhood obesity. This study examined behavioural factors and lifestyle practices associated with women’s perceived attainability of meeting the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) weight gain guidelines. Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from pregnant (n = 320) and postpartum (n = 1179) women who responded to the validated Canadian Electronic Maternal (EMat) health survey. Consenting women completed the survey through REDCap™ a secure, web-based data capture platform. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate correlates associated with meeting or not meeting IOM recommendations. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for relevant behavioural and sociodemographic covariates. Results There were no significant differences between adjusted and unadjusted ORs for self-efficacy, barriers, and facilitators to weight gain during pregnancy. Women who reported worry regarding weight gain were significantly less likely to meet IOM guidelines (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.33–0.69). Perceived controllability of behaviour was significantly associated with meeting IOM guidelines. An internal locus of control for weight gain was associated with an increased odds of meeting guidelines when women perceived to be in control of their weight gain (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.29–2.37), healthy and exercised (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.34–2.71), and when no barriers to healthy weight gain were perceived (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.04–1.95); whereas, an external locus of control in which women viewed weight gain as beyond their control, was associated with a significantly reduced odds of achieving guidelines (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.39–0.88). Conclusions Self-efficacy and perceived controllability of behaviour are key factors to consider when developing pregnancy-specific interventions to help women achieve guideline-concordant weight gain and ensure the downstream health of both mother and infant."
https://openalex.org/W2994914330,"Every year, more than 250,000 invasive candidiasis infections are reported with 50,000 deaths worldwide. The limited number of antifungal agents necessitates the need for alternative antifungals with potential novel targets. The 2-benzylidenebenzofuran-3-(2H)-ones have become an attractive scaffold for antifungal drug design. This study aimed to determine the antifungal activity of a synthetic aurone compound and characterize its mode of action. Using the broth microdilution method, aurone SH1009 exhibited inhibition against C. albicans, including resistant isolates, as well as C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis with IC50 values of 4–29 μM. Cytotoxicity assays using human THP-1, HepG2, and A549 human cell lines showed selective toxicity toward fungal cells. The mode of action for SH1009 was characterized using chemical-genetic interaction via haploinsufficiency (HIP) and homozygous (HOP) profiling of a uniquely barcoded Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant collection. Approximately 5300 mutants were competitively treated with SH1009 followed by DNA extraction, amplification of unique barcodes, and quantification of each mutant using multiplexed next-generation sequencing. Barcode post-sequencing analysis revealed 238 sensitive and resistant mutants that significantly (FDR P values ≤ 0.05) responded to aurone SH1009. The enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways and gene ontology demonstrated the cell cycle pathway as the most significantly enriched pathway along with DNA replication, cell division, actin cytoskeleton organization, and endocytosis. Phenotypic studies of these significantly enriched responses were validated in C. albicans. Flow cytometric analysis of SH1009-treated C. albicans revealed a significant accumulation of cells in G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest. Fluorescence microscopy detected abnormally interrupted actin dynamics, resulting in enlarged, unbudded cells. RT-qPCR confirmed the effects of SH1009 in differentially expressed cell cycle, actin polymerization, and signal transduction genes. These findings indicate the target of SH1009 as a cell cycle-dependent organization of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a novel mode of action of the aurone compound as an antifungal inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2995873235,"Central foveal thickness (CFT) measurements from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans provide a precise measure of severity of pathologic changes in the fovea, progress of disease and response to treatment. Although these measures are additionally valuable to assess foveal development in infants, their reproducibility is not known. The goal of this retrospective study is to evaluate the variation and reproducibility of CFT measurements using handheld spectral-domain OCT (hh-SDOCT) in supine infants compared to conventional adult tabletop imaging.Imaging sessions with multiple macular, volume scans in one eye were selected for analysis from two participant groups: Group 1, 25 imaging sessions from 21 preterm infants without macular edema imaged supine in the nursery using hh-SDOCT (Leica/Bioptigen Envisu C2300, RTP, NC); Group 2, 25 imaging sessions from 25 adults imaged using tabletop Bioptigen SDOCT. For each imaging session, three macular OCT volumes with acceptable image quality were selected for analysis. CFTs were measured using a customized script for automatic segmentation. An expert grader and a typical grader corrected the segmentation lines for the central foveal frame. Coefficient of variations (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for graders and systems and compared to the previous literature on OCT reproducibility.CFT measurements were repeatable and reproducible for both handheld and tabletop SDOCT systems. For handheld, grader ICC (CI) and mean CV were 0.94 (0.90-0.97) and 3.8 (typical) and 0.98 (0.96-0.99) and 2.9 (expert), and for tabletop were 0.91(0.83-0.96) and 2.1 (typical) and 0.92 (0.86-0.96) and 1.9 (expert). Intergrader reproducibility of handheld and tabletop SDOCT systems were ICC(CI) 0.97 (0.95-0.98) and 0.93 (0.89-0.96) respectively, and both are comparable to previously reported reproducibility of tabletop systems.Handheld SDOCT is a reproducible instrument to measure foveal thicknesses in supine infants. It can be used in clinical research to evaluate foveal changes during retinal development and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2995544758,"There is a large group of patients with ischemia of lower limbs not suitable for surgical reconstruction of arteries treated with the help of external assist by intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC). Until recently the generally accepted notion was that by compressing tissues below the knee, veins become emptied, venous pressure drops to zero and the increased arterial-venous pressure gradient enables greater arterial flow. We used a pump that, in contradiction to the ""empty veins"" devices, limited the limb venous outflow by venous obstructions and in a long period therapy expanded the perfusion vessels and brought about persistent reactive hyperemia.To check the toe and calf arterial inflow measured by venous stasis plethysmography and capillary flow velocity during arterial assist IPC in a long-term therapy of ischemic legs.Eighteen patients (12M, 6F) age 62 to 75 with leg peripheral arterial disease (PAD, Fontaine stage II) were studied. Pneumatic device with two 10cm wide cuffs (foot, calf) (Bio Compression Systems, Moonachie, NJ, USA) inflated to 120 mmHg for 5-6 sec to obstruct the venous flow, deflation time 16 sec, applied for 45-60 min daily for a period of 2 years.At pump inflation increase in toe arterial pressure, volume, capillary blood flow velocity and one-minute arterial inflow test was observed. Increased toe volume appeared concomitantly with the inflated chamber venous obstruction. Resting pressure in the great saphenous vein increased. The two years therapy showed persistence of the resting limb increased toe capillary flow. Intermittent claudication distance increased by 20-120%. After two years arterial assist TBI increased from 0.2 to 0.6 (range 0.3 to 0.8) (p<0.05 vs pre-therapy). The toe arterial inflow dominated over that in calf skin and muscles, nevertheless, there was prolongation of the claudication distance presumably due to dilatation of exchange vessels also in muscles.Our arterial assist IPC brought about increase in the toe capillary flow, long lasting dilatation of toe capillaries and extension of painless walking distance. The crucial factor of rhythmic repeated venous outflow obstructions should be taken into account in designing effective assist devices."
https://openalex.org/W2995581315,"The use of cultivars adapted to the climate and soil conditions associated with adequate irrigation supply maximizes lettuce agronomic performance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the agronomic performance of four lettuce cultivars submitted to five different drip irrigation depths under a protected environment in Viçosa-MG, Brazil. A randomized block design was applied in a split plot scheme with four replications, and several agronomic characteristics were evaluated by analysis of variance, Tukey range tests, regression and principal component analysis. A higher chlorophyll concentration in the Raider Plus cultivar promoted the production of more leaves, leading to a higher phytomass. The Luara cultivar presented a higher number of commercial leaves per plant than the other cultivars, regardless of the irrigation depth, reflected in a larger diameter and volume of the aerial part of the plants. The Raider Plus and Luara cultivars presented better root development than that of the other cultivars, reducing the effect of plant water stress even under lower irrigation depth conditions. Although higher water productivity (WP) was observed for the lowest irrigation depth (50% of ETc), important variables reached the maximum values at depths higher than 100% water replenishment. Therefore, Raider Plus and Luara cultivars with an irrigation depth of 110% of crop evapotranspiration provided better commercial lettuce quality and are recommended for lettuce cultivation in the research region and under conditions similar to those of the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2994628150,"Background An extended-release, once-daily, oral formulation of tacrolimus is currently used after kidney transplantation as a substitute for the conventional twice-daily formulation. The purpose of this study was to provide a limited sampling strategy with minimum and optimum sampling points to predict the tacrolimus area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of once-daily tacrolimus in de novo adult kidney transplant patients. Methods A total of 36 adult Japanese kidney transplant patients receiving once-daily tacrolimus were included: 31 were allocated to a study group to develop limited sampling strategy (LSS) model equations based on multiple stepwise linear regression analysis, and 5 were allocated to a validation group to estimate the precision of the LSS equations developed by the study group. Twelve-hour AUC (AUC0-12) was calculated by the trapezoidal rule, and the relationship between individual concentration points and AUC0-12 were determined by multiple linear regression analysis. The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the regression models. Three error indices (mean error, mean absolute error, and root mean squared prediction error) were calculated to evaluate predictive bias, accuracy, and precision, respectively. Quality of the statistical models was compared with Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Results A four-point model using C0, C2, C4 and C6 gave the best fit to predict AUC0-12 (R2 = 0.978). In the three- and two-point models, the best fits were at time points C2, C4, and C6 (R2 = 0.973), and C2 and C6 (R2 = 0.962), respectively. All three models reliably estimated tacrolimus AUC0-12, consistent with evaluations by the three error indices and Akaike’s information criterion. Practically, the two-point model with C2 and C6 was considered to be the best combination, providing a highly accurate prediction and the lowest blood sampling frequency. Conclusions The two-point model with C2 and C6 may be valuable in reducing the burden on patients, as well as medical costs, for once-daily tacrolimus monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2996354434,"Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are Gram-negative bacteria that are typically resistant to most or all antibiotics and are responsible for a global pandemic of high mortality. Rapid, accurate detection of CPOs and the classification of their carbapenemases are valuable tools for reducing the mortality of the CPO-associated infections, preventing the spread of CPOs, and optimizing use of new β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem/relebactam. The current study evaluated the performance of CPO Complete, a novel, manual, phenotypic carbapenemase detection and classification test. The test was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity against 262 CPO isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii and 67 non-CPO isolates. It was also evaluated for carbapenemase classification accuracy against 205 CPOs that produced a single carbapenemase class. The test exhibited 100% sensitivity 98.5% specificity for carbapenemase detection within 90 minutes and detected 74.1% of carbapenemases within 10 minutes. In the classification evaluation, 99.0% of carbapenemases were correctly classified for isolates that produced a single carbapenemase. The test is technically simple and has potential for adaptation to automated instruments. With lyophilized kit storage at temperatures up to 38°C, the CPO Complete test has the potential to provide rapid, accurate carbapenemase detection and classification in both limited resource and technologically advanced laboratories."

More than 1.9M people have participated in the interactive, more than 770K users have provided metadata. Said metadata allowed us to capture regional variation in language as of today, which we can compare to historical survey data–enabling us to track the evolution of German in Europe over the past 40 years. We report on regional levelling of lexical variants, a process which appears to be particularly prevalent in the northern parts of German-speaking Europe. We further found an effect of (former) national and regional borders on language use. This innovative paradigm allows us to collect sociolinguistic data of an unprecedented scale–at the same time it presents significant challenges, both of which–benefits and challenges–will be discussed in this contribution."
https://openalex.org/W2994736819,"This study aimed to determine whether the closure of a functioning arteriovenous (AV) access affects the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and to compare outcomes according to the timing of AV access closure after kidney transplantation (KT). From 2009 to 2015, medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 142 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who underwent AV access closure. The 142 KTRs were categorized into three groups: AV access closure was performed within 6 months after KT in Group 1 (n = 45), at 6-12 months after KT in Group 2 (n = 49), and at 12-24 months after KT in Group 3 (n = 48). The baseline (at the time of AV access closure) and follow-up eGFR values during the 3-year follow-up period were compared. Linear mixed model analysis revealed no significant association between longitudinally observed eGFR values and the amount of time elapsed after AV access closure in the study population (P = 0.36). There was no significant association between 3-year eGFR values and the timing of AV access closure (P = 0.58). In conclusion, after successful KT, AV access closure did not affect the eGFR significantly, and the timing of AV access closure was not significantly associated with outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2995066206,"While the arbitrariness of language has long been considered one of its defining features, there is growing evidence that non-arbitrariness also plays an important role. Here we investigated two sources of non-arbitrariness: systematicity (via grammatical gender) and iconicity (via shape sound symbolism). We manipulated these two elements orthogonally, allowing us to examine the effect of each. In Experiment 1, we found that French speakers associated nonwords containing feminine (masculine) endings with round (sharp) shapes. French speakers also associated nonwords containing round-sounding (sharp-sounding) phonemes with round (sharp) shapes. This was repeated using auditory presentation with both an English-speaking (Experiment 2a) and French-speaking (Experiment 2b) sample. As predicted, the English speakers showed no effects of grammatical gender, while the French speakers did. These results demonstrate that speakers of a language with grammatical gender associate different properties to words belonging to different genders. The results also show that sound symbolism can emerge in stimuli with existing associated information (i.e., endings indicative of grammatical gender, and the association that they evoke). Finally, while previous studies have looked at effects of arbitrary and non-arbitrary mappings contained in a single stimulus, this is the first study to demonstrate that different kinds of non-arbitrary mappings can have an effect when appearing in the same stimulus. Together these results add to our understanding of the importance of non-arbitrariness in language."
https://openalex.org/W2996400398,"Circulating fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is associated with various diseases and simple and less invasive techniques for assessment of FABP4 concentration are required in clinical research setting. The purpose of the present study was to assess the correlation of plasma FABP4 concentration between venous and capillary blood in healthy young adults. Twenty-eight healthy young adults aged from 20 to 26 years (mean age, 22.2 ± 1.4 years, 14 males and 14 females) were included. Paired resting blood samples were taken from the cubital vein (venous) and fingertip (capillary) blood. Plasma FABP4 concentration in both blood was analyzed by enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay. Plasma FABP4 concentration did not differ significantly between venous and capillary blood (-0.11± 0.75 ng/mL, p = 0.447, 95%CI: -0.402-0.182). Pearson's correlation coefficient for plasma FABP4 concentration between venous and capillary blood samples suggests strong correlation (r = 0.961, p < 0.001). The Bland & Altman plot showed a non-significant bias (-0.11 ± 0.75 ng/mL, p = 0.684) and the 95% limits of agreement ranged from -1.59 to 1.37 ng/mL. FABP4 concentration in both venous and capillary blood was significantly higher in females than in males (venous blood: p = 0.041; capillary blood: p = 0.049). These results suggest that capillary blood sampling can detect gender difference and is useful for the assessment of FABP4 concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2995568251,"This paper quantifies the socio-economic status (SES) gradient in median lifespan for three birth cohort groups. For this, mortality models were estimated using unique data on the SES of Dutch Olympic athletes born between 1852 and 1947, and who were followed until their death (or December 2018). The empirical findings show that for the older birth cohorts (1852–1899) there were no significant differences in median lifespan between SES groups. For the middle cohorts (1900–1919), the low SES athletes had a significantly lower median lifespan of five years less compared to medium SES athletes and the median lifespans of high and medium SES athletes did not differ significantly. For the younger cohorts (1920–1947), large and statistically significant differences were found between the three SES groups: low SES athletes had a median lifespan of about six years lower than medium SES athletes, while high SES athletes had an almost five years higher median lifespan compared to medium SES athletes. These new findings, which can be reconciled with the existing literature, suggest a strong steepening of the population SES-lifespan gradient over time in the Netherlands."
https://openalex.org/W2996445545,"The present study investigated whether measurable verbal differences occur when people vocalize their true and false intentions. To test potential differences, we used an experimental set-up where liars planned a criminal act (i.e., installing a virus on a network computer) and truth-tellers a non-criminal act (i.e., installing a new presentation program ""SlideDog"" on a network computer). Before they could carry out these acts, a confederate intercepted the participant and interviewed them about their intentions and the planning phase by using both anticipated and unanticipated questions. Liars used a cover story to mask their criminal intentions while truth-tellers told the entire truth. In contrast to our hypotheses, both human and automated coding did not show any evidence that liars and truth-tellers differed in plausibility or detailedness. Furthermore, results showed that asking unanticipated questions resulted in lengthier answers than anticipated questions. These results are in line with the mixed findings in the intention literature and suggest that plausibility and detailedness are less diagnostic cues for deception about intentions."
