https://openalex.org/W2099742439,"The genomes of various tumour cells contain mutant oncogenes that act dominantly, in that their effects can be observed when they are introduced into non-malignant cells1–4. There is evidence for another class of oncogenes, in which tumour-predisposing mutations are recessive to wild-type alleles5–7. Retinoblastoma is a prototype biological model for the study of such recessive oncogenes8. This malignant tumour, which arises in the eyes of children, can be explained as the result of two distinct genetic changes, each causing loss of function of one of the two homologous copies at a single genetic locus, Rb (refs 9–12), assigned to the q14 band of human chromosome 13 (refs 13–22). Mutations affecting this locus may be inherited from a parent, may arise during gametogenesis or may occur somatically. Those who inherit a mutant allele at this locus have a high incidence of non-ocular, second tumours23, almost half of which are osteosarcomas believed to be caused by the same mutation24,25. Here we describe the isolation of a complementary DNA segment that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at this locus. The gene is expressed in many tumour types, but no RNA transcript has been found in retinoblastomas and osteosarcomas. The cDNA fragment detects a locus spanning at least 70 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome band 13ql4, all or part of which is frequently deleted in retinoblastomas and osteosarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2010601153,"The amino acid sequences of ten proteins with intracellular half-lives less than 2 hours contain one or more regions rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T). These PEST regions are generally, but not always, flanked by clusters containing several positively charged amino acids. Similar inspection of 35 proteins with intracellular half-lives between 20 and 220 hours revealed that only three contain a PEST region. On the basis of this information, it was anticipated that caseins, which contain several PEST sequences, would be rapidly degraded within eukaryotic cells. This expectation was confirmed by red blood cell-mediated microinjection of 125I-labeled caseins into HeLa cells where they exhibited half-lives of less than 2 hours. The rapid degradation of injected alpha- and beta-casein as well as the inverse correlation of PEST regions with intracellular stability indicate that the presence of these regions can result in the rapid intracellular degradation of the proteins containing them."
https://openalex.org/W1963829537,"A novel human B-lymphotropic virus (HBLV) was isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes of six individuals: two HTLV-III seropositive patients from the United States (one with AIDS-related lymphoma and one with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy), three HTLV-III seronegative patients from the United States (one with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, one with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and one with immunoblastic lymphoma), and one HTLV-III seronegative patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia from Jamaica. All six isolates were closely related by antigenic analysis, and sera from all six virus-positive patients reacted immunologically with each virus isolate. In contrast, only four sera from 220 randomly selected healthy donors and none from 12 AIDS patients without associated lymphoma were seropositive. The virus selectively infected freshly isolated human B cells and converted them into large, refractile mono- or binucleated cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. HBLV is morphologically similar to viruses of the herpesvirus family but is readily distinguishable from the known human and nonhuman primate herpesviruses by host range, in vitro biological effects, and antigenic features."
https://openalex.org/W2081944345,"Extending our search for homologous domains of the Drosophila paired gene, two closely linked genes at the gooseberry locus have been isolated. Both genes are expressed with a single segment periodicity but with different spatial and temporal expression patterns. While the transcripts of one gene appear earlier and are equally distributed between ectoderm and mesoderm, those of the second gene accumulate preferentially in neuroblasts. The similarity of these expression patterns to the 14-band pattern of the paired gene suggests a functional relationship. Such a functional link may be reflected in the two structurally homologous domains shared with the paired gene: a new type of homeo box extended by 18 amino acids at the 5′ end, and a new domain, the paired box, consisting of a sequence of 128–135 amino acids. Thus, together with the PRD repeat, the paired gene contains at least three different domains, each defining a gene set thought to be important for development."
https://openalex.org/W2069462985,"We report the isolation, sequence, and transcriptional behavior of the Drosophila even-skipped (eve) gene, a member of the pair-rule class of segmentation genes. We show that the eve gene contains a homeo box and hence is related structurally to the pair-rule gene fushi tarazu and to homeotic selector genes. However, the eve homeo box differs significantly from those previously described and encodes a putative DNA recognition helix that would probably recognize different sequences. The eve gene resembles other pair-rule genes in showing a transient seven stripe zebra pattern during the blastoderm stage, but seven additional stripes arise soon thereafter. Together, these 14 stripes are required for the activation of coincident stripes of engrailed transcripts, leading to the subdivision of the embryo into compartmental and segmental units."
https://openalex.org/W2143265447,"Adrenal medullary endocrine (chromaffin) cells and sympathetic neurons both derive from the neural crest. We have found that the embryonic adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia are both initially populated by precursors expressing neural-specific genes. By birth, however, the medulla consists largely of chromaffin cells. In primary culture, the medullary precursors have three developmental fates: in NGF they continue to mature into neurons and survive, whereas in glucocorticoid they either extinguish their neuronal properties and exhibit an endocrine phenotype, or else continue to develop into neurons but then die. These data suggest that, in vivo, the adrenal medulla develops through both the glucocorticoid-induced differentiation of bipotential progenitors and the degeneration of committed neuronal precursors, which have migrated into the gland."

https://openalex.org/W2067310342,"A glia-derived neurite promoting factor (GdNPF) has serine protease inhibitory activity and in addition regulates the migration of neuronal cells. cDNA cloning of GdNPF is necessary for studying the physiological relevance and the mode of action of this protein and similar cell-derived protease inhibitors. Xenopus oocytes injected with rat glioma cells mRNA release this inhibitor. A rat cDNA clone coding for the previously purified glia-derived neurite promoting factor (GdNPF) was isolated upon hybridization-selected translation, followed by immunoprecipitation. The correct identity of this cDNA is proven by the presence of a sequence coding for a tryptic fragment from pure GdNPF. Northern analysis indicates that GdNPF mRNA is found almost exclusively in brain tissue and could be developmentally regulated. The same cDNA clone has been used to isolate full-length rat and human GdNPF cDNA. The deduced human GdNPF amino acid sequence indicates that the protein is a member of a family of cell-derived protease inhibitors named protease nexins."
https://openalex.org/W2035752728,"Exposure of cultures of cortical cells from mouse to either of the endogenous excitatory neurotoxins quinolinate or glutamate resulted in widespread neuronal destruction; but only in the cultures exposed to quinolinate, an N-methyl-D-aspartate agonist, was there a striking preservation of the subpopulation of neurons containing the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d). Further investigation revealed that neurons containing NADPH-d were also resistant to the toxicity of N-methyl-D-aspartate itself but were selectively vulnerable to the toxicity of either kainate or quisqualate. Thus, neurons containing NADPH-d may have an unusual distribution of receptors for excitatory amino acids, with a relative lack of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a relative preponderance of kainate or quisqualate receptors. Since selective sparing of neurons containing NADPH-d is a hallmark of Huntington's disease, the results support the hypothesis that the disease may be caused by excess exposure to quinolinate or some other endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate agonist."
https://openalex.org/W1571964755,"With a variety of forms of ischemic and toxic tissue injury, cellular accumulation of Ca2+ and generation of oxygen free radicals may have adverse effects upon cellular and, in particular, mitochondrial membranes. Damage to mitochondria, resulting in impaired ATP synthesis and diminished activity of cellular energy-dependent processes, could contribute to cell death. In order to model, in vitro, conditions present post-ischemia or during toxin exposure, the interactions between Ca2+ and oxygen free radicals on isolated renal mitochondria were characterized. The oxygen free radicals were generated by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase to simulate in vitro one of the sources of oxygen free radicals in the early post-ischemic period in vivo. With site I substrates, pyruvate and malate, Ca2+ pretreatment, followed by exposure to oxygen free radicals, resulted in an inhibition of electron transport chain function and complete uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. These effects were partially mitigated by dibucaine, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor. With the site II substrate, succinate, the electron transport chain defect was not manifest and respiration remained partially coupled. The electron transport chain defect produced by Ca2+ and oxygen free radicals was localized to NADH CoQ reductase. Calcium and oxygen free radicals reduced mitochondrial ATPase activity by 55% and adenine nucleotide translocase activity by 65%. By contrast oxygen free radicals alone reduced ATPase activity by 32% and had no deleterious effects on translocase activity. Dibucaine partially prevented the Ca2+-dependent reduction in ATPase activity and totally prevented the Ca2+-dependent translocase damage observed in the presence of oxygen free radicals. These findings indicate that calcium potentiates oxygen free radical injury to mitochondria. The Ca2+-induced potentiation of oxygen free radical injury likely is due in part to activation of phospholipase A2. This detrimental interaction associated with Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria and exposure of the mitochondria to oxygen free radicals may explain the enhanced cellular injury observed during post-ischemic reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2025680394,"The X/Y homologous gene MIC2 was shown to exchange between the sex chromosomes, thus demonstrating that it is a pseudoautosomal gene in man. MIC2 recombines with the sex-determining gene(s) TDF at a frequency of 2 to 3 percent. It is the most proximal pseudoautosomal locus thus far described and as such is an important marker for use in studies directed towards the isolation of TDF."
https://openalex.org/W1984173520,"We have examined the distribution of Ultrabithorax (Ubx) proteins in embryos mutant for the zygotic gap class of segmentation genes. Members of this class include hunchback (hb), knirps (kni), and Krüppel (Kr). All three mutations disrupt segmentation in specific regions of the embryo. Mutations in kni and Kr produce complex alterations in the Ubx expression pattern. In hb mutants Ubx is ectopically expressed both anterior and posterior to its wild-type boundaries. Thus, the hb gene may play an important role in the specification of the boundaries of Ubx expression. Using the Ubx protein distribution as a marker for metameric organization and using Hoechst dye to monitor cell death, we could follow early events that lead to the final gap-segmentation phenotype in the larval cuticle."
https://openalex.org/W1564942609,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) from human platelets blocks the ability of Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells to grow in response to serum mitogens, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or insulin. The phenotypic response of Mv1Lu cells to TGF beta is characterized by a flat, very enlarged cell morphology and a markedly increased production and accumulation of extracellular matrix fibronectin. The ability of TGF beta to alter the ligand binding or signal transducing activity of mitogen receptors in Mv1Lu cells has been examined. In contrast to NRK-49F rat fibroblasts, Mv1Lu cells do not respond to TGF beta with a decrease in the affinity or a change in the number of cell surface receptors for EGF. Soluble extracts from Mv1Lu cells contain a protein kinase activity which selectively phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6; this S6 kinase activity is elevated severalfold minutes after exposure of cells to mitogens. This kinase activity has been used as the parameter to measure the signaling ability of EGF receptors and insulin receptors in cells treated with TGF beta. We find that TGF beta does not alter the basal level of S6 kinase activity or its elevation by EGF or insulin. In TGF beta-treated cells rendered insensitive to the growth-promoting action of EGF, the parameters of elevation of S6 kinase activity by EGF are similar to those of control, growth-competent cells. The results suggest that TGF beta inhibits cell proliferation by acting at a level distal from the receptors for growth-activating factors."
https://openalex.org/W1997065157,"Gonococci (Gc) exhibit pilus+----pilus- ""phase transitions"" at high frequency, but only some of the pilus- Gc can revert to pilus+ phenotype. We examined reversible phase transitions between pilus+ Gc and a particular pilus- variant (P-rp+ phenotype) whose pilin mRNA carries a unique block of nucleotides encoding an ""assembly missense"" pilin polypeptide. The results show that Gc pilus+ in equilibrium with P-rp+ transitions can result from intragenic recombination in which there is nonreciprocal exchange of partially homologous DNA sequences from a partial pilin gene (in silent, storage form) into the expression locus' complete pilin gene. Hence Gc pilus phase variation, like pilus antigenic variation, can occur by gene conversion of the pilin structural gene expression locus."
https://openalex.org/W1978966652,"Employing pulsed field gradient electrophoresis, we constructed a 4.5 million bp (Mb) Sfil restriction map of the human X-chromosomal region p21, harboring genes for Duchenne (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy. In a DMD patient with additional chronic granulomatosis and retinitis pigmentosa, the proximal 3.5 Mb is deleted. Another DMD patient, with additional glycerol kinase deficiency and adrenal hypoplasia, lacks at least 3.3 Mb in the middle region, including marker C7 but not B24, placing C7 closer to DMD. Another DMD patient has a partial pERT-87 deletion of minimally 140 kb. Truncated Sfil fragments in a female X:21 translocation patient place the junction probe XJ1.1 115 kb from the distal end of the normal fragment. Probe pERT-84 maps to the same fragment, within 750 kb of XJ1.1."
https://openalex.org/W1566730133,"S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)glutathione (DCVG) and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) produced time- and concentration-dependent cell death in isolated rat kidney proximal tubular cells. AT-125 blocked and glycylglycine potentiated DCVG toxicity, indicating that metabolism by gamma-glutamyltransferase is required. S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteinylglycine, a putative metabolite of DCVG, also produced cell death, which was prevented by 1,10-phenanthroline, phenylalanylglycine, and aminooxyacetic acid, inhibitors of aminopeptidase M, cysteinylglycine dipeptidase, and cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, respectively. Aminooxyacetic acid and probenecid protected against DCVC toxicity, indicating a role for metabolism by cysteine conjugate beta-lyase and organic anion transport, respectively. DCVC produced a small decrease in cellular glutathione concentrations and did not change cellular glutathione disulfide concentrations or initiate lipid peroxidation. DCVC caused a large decrease in cellular glutamate and ATP concentrations with a parallel decrease in the total adenine nucleotide pool; these changes were partially prevented by aminooxyacetic acid. Both DCVG and DCVC inhibited succinate-dependent oxygen consumption, but DCVC had no effect when glutamate + malate or ascorbate + N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine were the electron donors. DCVC inhibited mitochondrial, but not microsomal, Ca2+ sequestration. These alterations in mitochondrial function were partially prevented by inhibition of DCVG and DCVC metabolism and were strongly correlated with decreases in cell viability, indicating that mitochondria may be the primary targets of nephrotoxic cysteine S-conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2066678435,"We have characterized mutations of the Abdominal-B gene of the bithorax complex of Drosophila. We conclude that the gene contains two distinct genetic elements: one has a morphogenetic role and acts in parasegments 10, 11, 12, and 13, while the other acts on parasegment 14 and has primarily or exclusively a regulatory function. Evidence indicates that the latter suppresses the activity of the morphogenetic element of Abd-B and of other genes responsible for the development of sclerotic plates. The regulatory element also suppresses those BX-C genes and other homeotics that, in the absence of Polycomb or extra sex combs function, can become active in parasegment 14."
https://openalex.org/W1965539412,"bl4 maturase, encoded by the fourth intron of the yeast mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, controls the splicing of both the fourth intron of the cytochrome b gene and the fourth intron of the gene encoding subunit I of cytochrome oxidase. By fusing the encoding presequence of subunit 9 of the Neurospora ATPase to a restriction fragment containing the bl4 maturase coding sequence, we have constructed a hybrid gene that can be translated on yeast cytosolic ribosomes. The resulting protein is imported into mitochondria, which was revealed by its ability to restore to respiratory competence a yeast mutant defective in the bl4 maturase. Moreover, a protein reacting with antimaturase antibodies was detected in the mitochondria of the transformed cells; this imported maturase functioned similarly to the endogenous maturase."
https://openalex.org/W1592082159,"beta-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids was studied with isolated solubilized or nonsolubilized peroxisomes or with perfused liver isolated from rats treated with clofibrate. gamma-Linolenic acid gave the higher rate of beta-oxidation, while arachidonic acid gave the slower rate of beta-oxidation. Other polyunsaturated fatty acids (including docosahexaenoic acid) were oxidized at rates which were similar to, or higher than, that observed with oleic acid. Experiments with 1-14C-labeled polyunsaturated fatty acids demonstrated that these are chain-shortened when incubated with nonsolubilized peroxisomes. Spectrophotometric investigation of solubilized peroxisomal incubations showed that 2,4-dienoyl-CoA esters accumulated during peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids possessing double bond(s) at even-numbered carbon atoms. beta-Oxidation of [1-14C]docosahexaenoic acid by isolated peroxisomes was markedly stimulated by added NADPH or isocitrate. This fatty acid also failed to cause acyl-CoA-dependent NADH generation with conditions of assay which facilitate this using other acyl-CoA esters. These findings suggest that 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase participation is essential during peroxisomal beta-oxidation if chain shortening is to proceed beyond a delta 4 double bond. Evidence obtained using arachidionoyl-CoA, [1-14C]arachidonic acid, and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid suggests that peroxisomal beta-oxidation also can proceed beyond a double bond positioned at an odd-numbered carbon atom. Experiments with isolated perfused livers showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids also in the intact liver are substrates for peroxisomal beta-oxidation, as judged by increased levels of the catalase-H2O2 complex on infusion of polyunsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1529957677,"A plasma proteinase inhibitor, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2PI), is cross-linked with alpha chain of fibrin(ogen) by activated coagulation Factor XIII (plasma transglutaminase). alpha 2PI serves only as a glutamine substrate (amine acceptor) for activated Factor XIII in the cross-linking reaction, and the cross-linking occurs between Gln-2 of the alpha 2PI molecule and a lysine residue (amine donor) of fibrin(ogen) alpha chain, whose position was investigated. alpha 2PI and fibrinogen were reacted by activated Factor XIII. The resulting alpha 2PI fibrinogen A alpha chain complex was separated and subjected to two cycles of Edman degradation using phenyl isothiocyanate for the first cycle and dimethylaminoazobenzene-isothiocyanate for the second cycle. The aqueous phase after the cleavage stage of the second cycle, containing dimethylaminoazobenzene-thiohydantoin-Gln cross-linked with A alpha chain, was subjected to CNBr fragmentation and tryptic digestion. Only one of the peptides was found to have the peak of absorbance at 420 nm, indicating the presence of dimethylaminoazobenzene-thiohydantoin-Gln in that peptide. The peptide was identified as corresponding to residues Asn-290-Arg-348 of A alpha chain by analyses of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition. The peptide contains a single lysine at position 303, indicating that Lys-303 of fibrinogen A alpha chain is the lysine residue that forms a cross-link with Gln-2 of alpha 2PI."
https://openalex.org/W1971885500,"Here we characterize the T-cell-activating protein (TAP), an Ly-6 gene product involved in T cell activation, as a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 10–12 kd under nonreducing conditions and 15–18 kd under reducing ones. Two of the three bands that are precipitated from metabolically labeled cells are expressed on the cell surface and can be recovered from the supernatants of cells treated with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Thus TAP appears to be attached to the cell membrane via this lipid. Precisely the same anchorage is observed for the activating Thy-1 molecule, and is therefore of particular interest as a potentially novel linkage involved in membrane signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1517689470,"The extracellular adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis was purified either as a free enzyme or as a complex with calmodulin. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 1600 mumol of cAMP min-1 X mg-1 and exists under two molecular forms of 45 and 43 kDa which are apparently structurally related. Calmodulin increased considerably the resistance of adenylate cyclase to inactivation by trypsin. Although trypsin cleaved the adenylate cyclase-calmodulin complex, the digested fragments remained associated by noncovalent interactions in an active conformation. Specific mouse anti-adenylate cyclase antibodies inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and were used to develop a specific radioimmunoassay that allows detection of as little as 5 ng of adenylate cyclase in culture supernatants."
https://openalex.org/W1494855408,"GGGYG-resact (Gly-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Cys-Val-Thr-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly-Cys-Val-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg -Leu-NH2) was synthesized and shown to possess the same respiration-stimulating activity and receptor-binding ability as resact. The incubation of intact sperm cells with radioiodinated peptide, 125I-GGGYG-resact, and the chemical cross-linking reagent, disuccinimidyl suberate, resulted in the appearance of a single, major radioactive band of apparent molecular weight 160,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The interaction was specific since 150 nM nonradioactive resact but not speract (200 nM) blocked formation of the radioactive band. The radioactive, cross-linked protein co-migrated with 32P-labeled guanylate cyclase and could be immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against the sperm guanylate cyclase. The incubation of intact cells with NH4Cl resulted in the partial dephosphorylation of guanylate cyclase and a change in its apparent molecular weight from 160,000 to 150,000; NH4Cl also caused the same conversion in the apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked protein. These data demonstrate that an analogue of resact can be covalently coupled to guanylate cyclase with the specificity predicted for the peptide receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1560091399,"Beef heart mitochondrial F1 contains a total of six adenine nucleotide-binding sites including at least two different types of sites. Three sites exchange rapidly during hydrolysis of MgATP, whereas three sites do not (Cross, R. L. and Nalin, C. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2874-2881). When F1 that has been stored as a suspension in (NH4)2SO4/ATP/EDTA/sucrose/Tris, pH 8.0, is pelleted, rinsed with (NH4)2SO4, dissolved, and desalted, it retains three bound adenine nucleotides. We find that two of these endogenous nucleotides are bound at nonexchangeable sites and one at an exchangeable site. The vacant nonexchangeable site is highly specific for adenine nucleotide and is rapidly filled by ADP upon addition of ADP or during ATP hydrolysis. ADP bound at this site can be removed by reprecipitating the enzyme with (NH4)2SO4. The single nucleotide retained by desalted F1 at an exchangeable site is displaced during hydrolysis of ATP, GTP, or ITP. The binding of PPi at two sites on the enzyme also promotes its dissociation. Neither procedure affects retention of nucleotide at the nonexchangeable sites. These observations, combined with the finding that PPi is much more easily removed from exchangeable sites than ADP, have led to the development of a procedure for preparing F1 with uniform and well-defined nucleotide site occupancy. This involves sequential exposure to MgATP, PPi, and high concentrations of Pi. Unbound ligand is removed between each step. The resulting enzyme, F1[3,0], has three occupied nonexchangeable sites and three vacant exchangeable sites. Evidence that nonexchangeable and exchangeable sites represent noncatalytic and catalytic sites, respectively, suggest that this form of the enzyme will prove useful in numerous applications, including transient kinetic measurements and affinity labeling of active site residues."
https://openalex.org/W1520988756,"The inactivation of the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylinosine (FSBI) proceeds with pseudo-first order kinetics. The rate of inactivation increased from pH 7 to 9 revealing a pKa of about 8.2. When a tryptic digest of the enzyme which had been inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl[3H]inosine ([3H]FSBI) was submitted to reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, a single major peak of radioactivity, T1, was resolved. Amino acid sequence analysis of purified peptide fragments derived from T1 showed that the modification of beta-Tyr-345 is responsible for inactivation of the enzyme. Complete inactivation of the enzyme by [3H]FSBI is estimated to proceed with modification of 0.8 mol of beta-Tyr-345/mol of enzyme. Another notable observation is that inosine triphosphatase (ITPase) activity catalyzed by F1 from bovine heart mitochondria is much more sensitive to inactivation by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) than is ATPase activity. Whereas complete inactivation of ATPase activity by FSBA has been shown to proceed with the mutually exclusive modification of Tyr-368 or His-427 in all three copies of the beta subunit (Bullough, D. A., and Allison, W. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5722-5730), it is shown here that complete inactivation of ITPase activity by FSBA is accompanied by modification of these residues in only one copy of the beta subunit. Inactivation of both the ATPase and ITPase activities of the enzyme by FSBI proceeds with modification of Tyr-345 in a single copy of the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1861983924,"Mitochondria prepared from the yeast nuclear pet mutant N9-84 lack a detectable F1-ATPase activity. Genetic complementation of this mutant with a pool of yeast genomic DNA in the yeast Escherichia coli shuttle vector YEp13 restored its growth on a nonfermentable carbon source. Mitochondria prepared from the transformed host contained an 8-fold higher than normal level of the F1 alpha-subunit and restored ATPase activity to 50% that of the wild-type strain. Deletion and nucleotide sequence analysis of the complementing DNA on the plasmid revealed a coding sequence designated ATP1 for a protein of 544 amino acids which exhibits 60 and 54% direct protein sequence homology with the proton-translocating ATPase alpha-subunits from tobacco chloroplast and E. coli, respectively. In vitro expression and mitochondrial import experiments using this ATP1 sequence showed that additional amino-terminal sequences not present in the comparable plant and bacterial subunits function as transient sequences for import."
https://openalex.org/W1480593564,"The sea urchin egg peptides speract (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly) and resact (Cys-Val-Thr-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly-Cys-Val-Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH2) bind to spermatozoa of the homologous species (Lytechinus pictus or Arbacia punctulata, respectively) and cause transient elevations of cyclic GMP concentrations (Hansbrough, J. R., and Garbers, D. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1447-1452). The addition of these peptides to spermatozoan membrane preparations caused a rapid and dramatic (up to 25-fold) activation of guanylate cyclase. The peptide-induced activation of guanylate cyclase was transient, and the subsequent decline in enzyme activity coincided with conversion of a high Mr (phosphorylated) form of guanylate cyclase to a low Mr (dephosphorylated) form. When membranes were incubated at pH 8.0, the high Mr form was converted to the low Mr form without substantial changes in basal enzyme activity. However, the peptide-stimulated activity of the low Mr form of guanylate cyclase was much less than the peptide-stimulated activity of the high Mr form. Activation of the low Mr form by peptide was not transient and persisted for at least 10 min. In addition, the pH 8.0 treatment that caused the Mr conversion of guanylate cyclase also caused an increase in the peptide-binding capacity of the membranes. We propose a model in which activation of the membrane form of guanylate cyclase is receptor-mediated; the extent of enzyme activation is modulated by its phosphorylation state."
https://openalex.org/W1567909617,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was found to bind specifically, reversibly, and in a protein-dependent manner to a single class of high affinity (KD approximately equal to 20 nM) binding sites in membranes prepared from canine renal outer medulla. PGE2 binding activity was solubilized from these membranes in a stable form (t1/2 greater than 14 days) in the absence of ligand in 75% yields using digitonin. The characteristics of PGE2 binding to membranes and solubilized protein were similar with respect to pH dependence, KD for PGE2, and order of potency of prostaglandins (PGE2 approximately PGE1 greater than PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2) in inhibiting the binding of [3H]PGE2. Importantly, the extents of binding of PGE2 to membranes and to a solubilized preparation partially purified by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Affi-Gel 10 were both increased about 2-fold by GDP and GTP and its analogs. Treatment of the digitonin-solubilized PGE2 binding activity with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) rendered the binding activity insensitive to stimulation by GTP and decreased the apparent molecular weight of the peak of PGE2 binding activity from about 175,000 to about 65,000. These results suggest that the PGE2 binding activity resides in a protein which is tightly associated with, but distinct from, a guanine nucleotide regulatory (N) protein. PGE2 (greater than or equal to 10 nM) was found to stimulate GTPase activity of renal outer medullary membranes, and this stimulation was eliminated by pretreatment of membranes with pertussis toxin and NAD, but not cholera toxin and NAD. Treatment of both particulate and solubilized preparations of PGE2 binding activity with pertussis toxin plus NAD also eliminated the ability of GTP to stimulate PGE2 binding. This evidence indicates that it is the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, Ni, with which the PGE2 binding activity is associated. Thus, this PGE2 binding activity is an inhibitory PGE2 receptor, quite possibly one that mediates inhibition of vasopressin-induced cAMP formation in the medullary thick ascending limb and/or collecting tubule of the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1516840674,"The metabolism of photoreceptor cGMP and the relationship of its light-sensitive regulation to rhodopsin photoisomerization and to the photoreceptor electrical response was examined in isolated, intact rabbit retinas. The dynamics of cGMP metabolism were assessed by measuring the rate of 18O incorporation from 18O-water into the alpha-phosphoryls of the guanine nucleotides. The photoreceptor electrical response was determined by measuring the aspartate-isolated mass receptor potential. Basal cGMP flux in dark-adapted retinas was 33 pmol cGMP X mg protein-1 X s-1 which translates into a metabolic rate in the rod outer segment (ROS) of 1.7 mM/min in ATP equivalents. Photic stimulation increased this flux as much as 4.5-fold. With continuous illumination, increasing intensity caused increments in cGMP metabolic flux to a maximum of 4.5-fold, with corresponding increases in the electrical response over the same 3-log unit intensity range. Tight coupling between activation of guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase was indicated by either no changes in cGMP steady state concentrations or relatively small fluctuations represented by increases of 50% at lower light intensities and a 12% decrease at one of the highest intensities. A stoichiometry of about 10,000 molecules of cGMP generated and hydrolyzed per photon absorbed was calculated for the lowest light intensity when the increment in cGMP metabolic flux per photon was maximal. Flashing light caused an increase in flux in proportion to frequency up to 1 Hz and a nearly proportional increase in the voltage time integral of the electrical response up to 0.5 Hz. This indicates that the temporal resolution, or on/off rate, of the cGMP metabolic response was as fast or faster than the temporal resolution of the electrical response. The concentration of cGMP remained relatively stable in spite of the marked acceleration of cGMP flux that occurred over the 32-fold range of frequencies tested. Taken together these results show that the light-accelerated rate of cGMP synthesis tightly coupled to hydrolysis becomes a primary energy-utilizing system in the photoreceptor and represents a response that fulfills certain of the fundamental criteria required of a metabolic event playing an essential role in phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1481208553,"An RNA moiety has been shown to be involved in the conversion of Glu to delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first committed intermediate of the chlorophyll pathway. We now have evidence suggesting that in Chlamydomonas, the first reaction for converting Glu to ALA is the aminoacylation of Glu to a Glu-specific tRNA. The Glu-tRNA thus formed could be the substrate for Glu-1-semialdehyde synthesis catalyzed by a postulated dehydrogenase. Glu-1-semialdehyde can be converted to ALA by an aminotransferase. Of the three reactions converting Glu to ALA, only the second reaction, catalyzed by a postulated dehydrogenase, is sensitive to inhibition by heme (a known inhibitor of ALA synthesis). We think the regulated enzyme of ALA synthesis is the postulated dehydrogenase. It is postulated that in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas, the synthesis of ALA and the synthesis of proteins may share a common pool of glutamyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1509951428,"Rabbit tracheal epithelial cells undergo terminal cell division, start to express a squamous phenotype, and form cross-linked envelopes when reaching the plateau phase of the growth curve. This terminal differentiation is accompanied by a 20-30-fold increase in the activity of the cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase. This activity is found almost solely in the particulate fraction of homogenized cells and can be solubilized by nonionic detergents. This transglutaminase crossreacts with a monoclonal antibody raised against type I transglutaminase, but does not react with an antiserum against type II transglutaminase. The tracheal transglutaminase contains a protein subunit of approximately 92 kDa. The omission of epidermal growth factor from the medium or the addition of fetal bovine serum, conditions that induce terminal cell division and expression of a squamous phenotype, enhance transglutaminase activity. High calcium concentrations only stimulate transglutaminase activity after the cells become committed to terminal cell division. Retinoids, which inhibit the expression of the squamous phenotype but not terminal cell division, inhibit the enhancement in transglutaminase activity induced by either confluency or serum, indicating that this enzyme activity is under the control of retinoids. Some retinoids are active at concentrations as low as 10(-12) M. The ability of retinoids to inhibit transglutaminase activity correlates well with their capacity to bind to the retinoic acid-binding protein. Our results show that the increase in transglutaminase activity correlates with the induction of the terminal differentiated phenotype and suggest that this enzyme can function as a marker for this program of differentiation of rabbit tracheal epithelial cells in culture. Our results identify the transglutaminase as type I transglutaminase and are in agreement with the concept that this transglutaminase is involved in the formation of cross-linked envelopes."
https://openalex.org/W2021839340,"The properties of three dominant alleles of ftz are described. These alleles cause transformations of the first abdominal segment to the third and cause alternate segment pattern deletions that are out of phase with respect to those caused by ftz null alleles. To explain the effects of these mutations, a model is proposed in which ftz+ has two roles: to subdivide the body into parasegments and to activate appropriate bithorax complex functions in alternate parasegments. According to this model, the effects of the novel ftz alleles can be understood as arising from a slight widening of the blastoderm stripes of ftz expression."
https://openalex.org/W1551585156,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytoplasm. The active enzyme is a dimer composed of identical subunits of Mr = 53,000. The amino acid composition and the NH2-terminal sequence are presented. Partial cDNA clones for the enzyme were isolated by screening of a rat liver lambda gt11 expression library with antibodies raised against the purified protein. The identity of the clones was confirmed by hybrid selection and translation. When rats were fed diets supplemented with cholesterol, cholestyramine, or cholestyramine plus mevinolin, the hepatic protein mass of cytoplasmic synthase, as determined by immunoblotting, was 25, 160, and 1100%, respectively, of the mass observed in rats fed normal chow. Comparable changes in enzyme activity were observed. Approximately 9-fold increases in both HMG-CoA synthase mRNA mass and synthase mRNA activity were observed when control diets were supplemented with cholestyramine and mevinolin. When rats were fed these two drugs and then given mevalonolactone by stomach intubation, there was a 5-fold decrease of synthase mRNA within 3 h. These results indicate that cytoplasmic synthase regulation occurs primarily at the level of mRNA. This regulation is rapid and coordinate with that observed for HMG-CoA reductase. The chromosomal localization of human HMG-CoA synthase was determined by examining a panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids with the rat cDNA probe. Interestingly, the synthase gene resides on human chromosome 5, which has previously been shown to contain the gene for HMG-CoA reductase. Regional mapping, performed by examination of a series of chromosome 5 deletion mutants and by in situ hybridization to human chromosomes indicates that the two genes are not tightly clustered."

https://openalex.org/W191093306,"The brain peptide human growth hormone releasing factor (1-40) (GRF), which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in the anterior pituitary, is the predominant hormone signal for pituitary growth hormone (GH) release. Activators of protein kinase C such as teleocidin and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) double the cyclic AMP accumulation induced by GRF, with no apparent effect on GRF potency; an inactive 4-alpha-PMA has no such action in cultured anterior pituitary cells. This PMA potentiation can be measured as early as 60 s, is maximal by 15 min, and wanes such that by 3-4 h there is no such amplifying effect of PMA. PMA, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, and teleocidin ED50 values for potentiating GRF activity are similar to those obtained for direct protein kinase C activation. The major inhibitory peptide somatostatin reduced both GRF- and GRF + PMA-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Pertussis toxin totally blocked this somatostatin action without affecting the degree of maximal GRF potentiation achieved with PMA. Thus, the pertussis toxin target(s) are required for somatostatin inhibition of the cyclic AMP generating system, but may not be involved in the PMA potentiation of GRF-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1901817159,"Evidence obtained from quinuclidinylbenzilate binding determinations suggested that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor molecules are present in purified bovine brain coated vesicles. Immunoprecipitates formed from coated vesicles with polyclonal antibodies to clathrin bound on the surface of fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells also showed quinuclidinylbenzilate binding activity. The high purity of coated vesicles was established by assays for biochemical markers and by electron microscopy. Muscarinic receptor sites for quinuclidinylbenzilate binding to coated vesicles displayed a Kd of 25 pM and a Bmax of about 191 fmol/mg of protein. Binding competition experiments using atropine, N-methylscopolamine, oxotremorine, and carbamylcholine confirmed the typical muscarinic nature of the binding site. Ranking order of potency for the receptors was: atropine greater than N-methylscopolamine greater than oxotremorine greater than carbachol Analysis of data using a two-site model revealed 13% high-affinity sites for oxotremorine, 66% high-affinity sites for carbachol, and 62% for the antagonist N-methylscopolamine. Heterogeneity of binding affinities for muscarinic drugs detected in the coated vesicles may be related to the presence of coated vesicle subpopulations in brain tissue, (Kohtz, D. S., Kohtz, J.

https://openalex.org/W1500956589,"The receptor for somatostatin present in rat pancreatic plasma membranes was characterized by affinity labeling with [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin utilizing three different heterobifunctional cross-linking agents: N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxy-succinimide, N-succinimidyl 6-(4-azido 2'-nitrophenylamine)hexanoate, and N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 4-azido-benzoate. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a broad band of Mr = 92,000 when any of the three cross-linkers was used; N-succinimidyl 6-(4-azido 2'-nitrophenylamine), however, was most efficient. Labeling of the Mr = 92,000 protein band was not affected by reducing agents but was sensitive to somatostatin and guanine nucleotides, particularly GTP gamma S, at concentrations which reduced binding to the receptor. The affinity-labeled protein could be solubilized completely with Zwittergent 3-12, partially with Triton X-100 and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, and poorly with Zwittergent 3-08 and digitonin. When exposed to agarose-coupled lectins, the detergent solubilized, labeled Mr = 92,000 protein was completely adsorbed to wheat germ agglutinin, partially to ricin communis II, and not at all to concanavalin A or lotus or lentil lectin. The Mr = 92,000 protein bound to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was not eluted by N-acetylglucosamine but was by triacetylchitotriose, providing a considerable purification of the somatostatin receptor. These data allow us to conclude that the somatostatin receptor is a monomeric glycoprotein with an Mr = 90,000 binding subunit which probably contains a polymeric arrangement of N-acetylglucosamine residues."
https://openalex.org/W174734255,"At the optimal pH for growth (pH 10.5), alkalophilic Bacillus firmus RAB, an obligate aerobe, exhibits normal rates of oxidative phosphorylation despite the low transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient, about -60 mV (delta psi = -180 mV and delta pH = +120 mV). This bioenergetic problem might be resolved by use of an Na+ coupled ATP synthase; otherwise an F1F0-ATPase must be able to utilize low driving forces in this organism. The ATPase activity was extracted from everted membrane vesicles by low ionic strength treatment and purified to homogeneity by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The ATPase preparation had the characteristic F1-ATPase subunit structure, with Mr values of 51,500 (alpha), 48,900 (beta), 34,400 (gamma), 23,300 (delta), and 14,500 (epsilon); the identity of the alpha and beta subunits was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-beta of Escherichia coli and anti-B. firmus RAB F1. Methanol and octyl glucoside, agents that stimulated the low basal membrane ATPase activity 10- to 12-fold, dramatically elevated the MgATPase activity of the purified F1, more than 150-fold, to 50 mumol min-1 mg protein-1. Anti-F1 inhibited membrane ATPase activity greater than or equal to 80%. The membranes exhibited no Na+-stimulated or vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity when prepared in the absence or presence of Na+ or ATP. These findings, which are consistent with previous studies, establish that in alkalophilic bacteria, ATP hydrolysis, and presumably ATP synthesis is catalyzed by an F1F0-ATPase rather than a Na+ ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1517002109,"Gentamicin nucleotidyltransferase-catalyzed reaction of (Sp)-[alpha-17O]dATP with tobramycin produced 2-(2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-[17O]phosphoryl)tobramycin. The configuration at phosphorus in this product was shown to be Rp by chemical degradation to chiral [17O, 18O]dAMP using a stereochemically defined procedure, and determination of the configuration at phosphorus in this product. Periodate-base treatment of 2-(2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-[17O]phosphoryl)tobramycin followed by NaBH4 reduction produced (2-glyceryl)-[17O]dAMP, which upon snake venom phosphodiesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis in H(2)18O produced [17O,18O] dAMP. The configuration at phosphorus in this product was shown to be S by enzymatic phosphorylation to [17O,18O]dATP, adenylylcyclase (Bordetella pertussis)-catalyzed cyclization to 3',5'-cyclic [17O,18O]dAMP, and 31P NMR analysis of the ethyl esters. Since snake venom phosphodiesterase-catalyzed hydrolyses proceed with retention of configuration at phosphorus, (Sp)-[17O,18O]dAMP must have been produced from (Rp)-(2-glyceryl)-[17O]dAMP; and since the chemical degradation to the latter compound did not involve cleavage of any bonds to phosphorus, the initial enzymatic product must have been (Rp)-2-(2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-[17O]phosphoryl)tobramycin. Therefore, nucleotidyl transfer catalyzed by gentamicin nucleotidyl-transferase proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus, and the reaction mechanism involves an uneven number of phosphotransfer steps. Inasmuch as this is an uncomplicated two-substrate group transfer reaction, the mechanism probably involves direct nucleotidyl transfer from the nucleoside triphosphate to the aminoglycoside. The B. pertussis adenylylcyclase reaction was shown to proceed with inversion at phosphorus, as has been established for other adenylylcyclases."

When purified plasma membranes were sonicated and the different plasma membrane domains were separated by sedimentation through a linear sucrose gradient, virtually all of the transglutaminase activity and the large molecular weight transglutaminase substrate were associated with membrane fragments which migrated to a very dense region of the gradient (1.18 g/cm3). The bile canalicular markers, 5'-nucleotidase and HA-4 antigen, were predominantly found at 1.11 g/cm3, while most of the sinusoidal/lateral marker, CE-9 antigen, was detected at 1.14 g/cm3. Smooth membrane vesicles were observed chiefly at the lighter densities upon morphological analysis, while many filament-bearing, plasma membrane segments and junctional complexes were contained in the heavy transglutaminase fractions.

https://openalex.org/W1604085424,"There have been few studies of physiological importance on the regulation of somatostatin by hormones. We have studied the effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone on somatostatin production in the human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cell line, a model for somatostatin production by the parafollicular cell. Dexamethasone inhibited somatostatin production in a dose-related manner with a maximal effect at a concentration of 10(-6) M. TT cells treated with dexamethasone (10(-6) M) showed an almost complete inhibition of somatostatin peptide production by 48 h of treatment. Molecular sizing chromatography demonstrated a decrease in both the probable somatostatin precursor (13,000 dalton) and the fully processed peptide. Analysis of mRNA content by hybridization revealed that dexamethasone also caused a decrease in detectable somatostatin mRNA. The hybridizable somatostatin mRNA decreased to approximately 50% of basal levels within 12 h of treatment. Northern blot hybridization showed a decrease in a single RNA species representing mature somatostatin mRNA. Dose-response experiments revealed inhibition of both peptide and mRNA at concentrations from 1 X 10(-8) to 1 X 10(-5) M dexamethasone. Four days after withdrawal from dexamethasone treatment, peptide and mRNA levels were higher than dexamethasone-treated controls. The sex steroid estradiol had no inhibitory effect on somatostatin production. These results suggest a potential regulator of somatostatin production and provide a system for the study of somatostatin gene regulation."

Evidence that it is formed in kidney was obtained. The origin of gamma-glutamyl-glutathione was explored through studies on the interaction of glutathione with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. When purified gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was incubated with various concentrations (4 microM-50 mM) of glutathione, the initial rates of formation of gamma-glutamyl-glutathione were substantial at all concentrations of glutathione studied and were greater than the rates of formation of glutamate at physiological levels of glutathione (1-10 mM). The findings indicate that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase catalyzes transpeptidation in vivo. That gamma-glutamyl-glutathione is formed in vivo and that it is a significant product of the reaction between glutathione and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase under physiological conditions suggest that this polyanionic tetrapeptide may have a physiological role. gamma-Glutamyl-glutathione is not a substrate of glutathione reductase or of glutathione S-transferase, but it is a substrate of gamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase. That gamma-glutamyl-glutathione has an additional negative charge as compared to glutathione suggests that it may be more effective than glutathione in forming complexes with certain metal ions and other cations."
https://openalex.org/W1549098777,DNA entrapped in liposomes containing lactosylceramide in the bilayers is found to be associated with clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from the rat livers after intravenous injection of these liposomes. The presence of the exogenous DNA in the coated vesicles was detected by Southern blotting. The amount of DNA present in the coated vesicles does not appear to vary up to 4 h after injection of the liposomes into the animals. The recognition of the lactosyl group present in the liposome by the galactose receptor present on the surface of the different liver cells may lead to their internalization in a way analogous to receptor-mediated endocytosis of various macromolecules. DNA present in the lumen of the coated vesicles is found to be biologically active as evidenced by its replication in bacterial cells and mouse fibroblasts.

The bound manganese coordinations were studied by x-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Mn2+ was found to be bound to the enzyme with an average Mn-O bond length of 2.15 +/- 0.15 A, significantly shorter than the 2.15 +/- 0.15 A of the Mn-O bond of the average first hydration shell for Mn2+ in aqueous solution. On adding ATP to the manganese-enzyme mixture, a tertiary complex of Mn2+ X ATP X enzyme was formed as indicated by the appearance of a second shell. Mn-P bond distances were estimated at 4.95 +/- 0.15 A in the tertiary Mn2+ X ATP X enzyme complex, which was considerably longer than the Mn-P bond distance of 3.36 +/- 0.15 A for the Mn2+ X ATP complex in aqueous solution. The Mn-P bond distance in the tertiary Mn2+ X ATP X enzyme complex decreased to 4.32 +/- 0.15 A when selenite, a potent effector of ATPase activity, was added. Based on these results, it is suggested that the tertiary complex is required for catalysis. The stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by anions such as selenite may be the result of shortening the distance between Mn2+ and the ATP phosphates in the enzyme active site."
https://openalex.org/W1635210287,"Under canonical chemiosmotic formulations, the development of a delocalized transmembrane proton gradient should precede and, in the absence of a membrane potential, should account for all the capacity of an energy transducing system to synthesize ATP. Furthermore, any agents, such as permeant proton-absorbing buffers, that slow down the kinetics of the development of this gradient should, consequently, delay ATP synthesis. We have studied the very early (0 through 1000 ms) steps of photosynthetic ATP synthesis utilizing real-time, rapid flow-quench techniques. We have investigated the effect(s) that permeant buffers exert on this process where these buffers show no uncoupling effects, and the transmembrane potential has been collapsed by valinomycin and K+. Experimentally this system was dissected into two ATP synthesizing components, as follows: synthesis of ATP strictly concomitant with light influx and unaffected by the addition of permeant buffers. We refer to this as photosynchronous phosphorylation and synthesis of ATP monitored after the light was extinguished and which was greatly diminished by the addition of proton-absorbing permeant buffers, thus exhibiting the characteristics of conventional postillumination phosphorylation, and we suggest that it represents part of capacitance phosphorylation. The potential for capacitance phosphorylation initiates very rapidly under light and gradually builds up to steady-state level, and it is governed by canonical chemiosmotic principles. We estimate that its contribution to overall ATP yield is minimal during the first few cycles of the system and that it increases gradually towards steady state when it contributes to the majority of ATP synthesized. Neither a delocalized transmembrane proton gradient nor a strictly localized intramembrane proton pathway can account for these observations so we have proposed that a gating mechanism exists which delivers intramembrane protons initially directly to the ATP synthetase complex but subsequently to the lumen as well, and thus, allows the lumen to act as a capacitor during the steady state. This study can reconcile the findings of Ort et al. (Ort, D. R., Dilley, R. A., and Good, N. E. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 449, 108-124) with the contrasting findings of Vinkler et al.

Chem. 251, 2453-2461) were combined in a 4770:320:1 detergent/phospholipid/protein molar ratio and then centrifuged on a discontinuous sucrose gradient to isolate the F0.F1-phosphatidylcholine complex. The specific activity of the reconstituted F0.F1-ATPase was as high as 14.5 mumol/min/mg protein, whereas with no added lipid the activity ranged between 1.4 and 2.2 mumol/min/mg protein. This reconstituted preparation exhibited greater than 90% oligomycin sensitivity which demonstrated the intactness of the multisubunit enzyme complex. The phosphatidylcholine/protein molar ratio of the reconstituted F0.F1 was 250:1 with less than 0.4% of the added octylglucoside remaining. Titrations with both phosphatidylcholine and octylglucoside demonstrated that the specific activity and oligomycin sensitivity were highly dependent on the concentrations of both phospholipid and detergent in the original reconstitution mixture. Analysis of the reconstituted ATPase by electron microscopy demonstrated that the catalytic portion of the enzyme complex projected from the phospholipid bilayer with an orientation similar to that observed with submitochondrial particles. The F0.F1-phosphatidylcholine complex was able to trap inulin, which suggests a vesicular structure impermeable to macromolecules. The electrophoretic mobility of the complex was identical to that for liposomes of egg phosphatidylcholine alone. The reconstitution conditions utilized give rise to an enzyme-phospholipid complex with very low ionic charge that demonstrates high oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity."

Immuno-gold labeling of serial thin sections localized somatostatin to the secretory granules of gonadotropin-producing cells. The gonadotroph-specific hypophysiotropic factor, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone caused a dose-dependent secretion of somatostatin when applied to primary pituitary cultures from these mice. Growth hormone-releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, and dopamine did not affect somatostatin secretion. These experiments demonstrate that a neurosecretory peptide encoded by a foreign gene can enter the regulated secretory pathway of pituitary cells from transgenic mice."
