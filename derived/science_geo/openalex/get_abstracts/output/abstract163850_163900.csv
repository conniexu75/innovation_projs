https://openalex.org/W2011842366,"beta-Catenin is an essential molecule in Wnt/wingless signaling, which controls decisive steps in embryogenesis. To study the role of beta-catenin in skin development, we introduced a conditional mutation of the gene in the epidermis and hair follicles using Cre/loxP technology. When beta-catenin is mutated during embryogenesis, formation of placodes that generate hair follicles is blocked. We show that beta-catenin is required genetically downstream of tabby/downless and upstream of bmp and shh in placode formation. If beta-catenin is deleted after hair follicles have formed, hair is completely lost after the first hair cycle. Further analysis demonstrates that beta-catenin is essential for fate decisions of skin stem cells: in the absence of beta-catenin, stem cells fail to differentiate into follicular keratinocytes, but instead adopt an epidermal fate."
https://openalex.org/W2157788198,"Andersen's syndrome is characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. We have mapped an Andersen's locus to chromosome 17q23 near the inward rectifying potassium channel gene KCNJ2. A missense mutation in KCNJ2 (encoding D71V) was identified in the linked family. Eight additional mutations were identified in unrelated patients. Expression of two of these mutations in Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of function and a dominant negative effect in Kir2.1 current as assayed by voltage-clamp. We conclude that mutations in Kir2.1 cause Andersen's syndrome. These findings suggest that Kir2.1 plays an important role in developmental signaling in addition to its previously recognized function in controlling cell excitability in skeletal muscle and heart."
https://openalex.org/W2102329408,"GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain. Early in development, however, GABAergic synaptic transmission is excitatory and can exert widespread trophic effects. During the postnatal period, GABAergic responses undergo a switch from being excitatory to inhibitory. Here, we show that the switch is delayed by chronic blockade of GABA(A) receptors, and accelerated by increased GABA(A) receptor activation. In contrast, blockade of glutamatergic transmission or action potentials has no effect. Furthermore, GABAergic activity modulated the mRNA levels of KCC2, a K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter whose expression correlates with the switch. Finally, we report that GABA can alter the properties of depolarization-induced Ca(2+) influx. Thus, GABA acts as a self-limiting trophic factor during neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2037412915,"CA125 is an ovarian cancer antigen that is the basis for a widely used serum assay for the monitoring of patients with ovarian cancer; however, detailed information on its biochemical and molecular nature is lacking. We now report the isolation of a long, but partial, cDNA that corresponds to the CA125 antigen. A rabbit polyclonal antibody produced to purified CA125 antigen was used to screen a λZAP cDNA library from OVCAR-3 cells in<i>Escherichia coli</i>. The longest insert from the 54 positive isolated clones had a 5797-base pair sequence containing a stop codon and a poly(A) sequence but no clear 5′ initiation sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence has many of the attributes of a mucin molecule and was designated CA125/MUC16 (gene <i>MUC16</i>). These features include a high serine, threonine, and proline content in an N-terminal region of nine partially conserved tandem repeats (156 amino acids each) and a C-terminal region non-tandem repeat sequence containing a possible transmembrane region and a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site. Northern blotting showed that the level of MUC16 mRNA correlated with the expression of CA125 in a panel of cell lines. The molecular cloning of the CA125 antigen will lead to a better understanding of its role in ovarian cancer."

These structures unify Mre11's multiple nuclease activities in a single endo/exonuclease mechanism and reveal eukaryotic macromolecular interaction sites by mapping human and yeast Mre11 mutations. Furthermore, the structure of the P. furiosus Rad50 ABC-ATPase with its adjacent coiled-coil defines a compact Mre11/Rad50-ATPase complex and suggests that Rad50-ATP-driven conformational switching directly controls the Mre11 exonuclease. Electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and ultracentrifugation data of human and P. furiosus MR reveal a dual functional complex consisting of a (Mre11)2/(Rad50)2 heterotetrameric DNA processing head and a double coiled-coil linker."

https://openalex.org/W2058111528,"At the onset of anaphase, a caspase-related protease (separase) destroys the link between sister chromatids by cleaving the cohesin subunit Scc1. During most of the cell cycle, separase is kept inactive by binding to an inhibitory protein called securin. Separase activation requires proteolysis of securin, which is mediated by an ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex. Cells regulate anaphase entry by delaying securin ubiquitination until all chromosomes have attached to the mitotic spindle. Though no longer regulated by this mitotic surveillance mechanism, sister separation remains tightly cell cycle regulated in yeast mutants lacking securin. We show here that the Polo/Cdc5 kinase phosphorylates serine residues adjacent to Scc1 cleavage sites and strongly enhances their cleavage. Phosphorylation of separase recognition sites may be highly conserved and regulates sister chromatid separation independently of securin."
https://openalex.org/W3029303231,"Abnormalities of chromosome number are the most common genetic aberrations in cancer. The mechanisms regulating the fidelity of mitotic chromosome transmission in mammalian cells are therefore of great interest. Here we show that human cells without an hSecurin gene lose chromosomes at a high frequency. This loss was linked to abnormal anaphases during which cells underwent repetitive unsuccessful attempts to segregate their chromosomes. The abnormal mitoses were associated with biochemical defects in the activation of separin, the sister-separating protease, rendering it unable to cleave the cohesin subunit Scc1 efficiently. These results illuminate the function of mammalian securin and show that it is essential for the maintenance of euploidy."

https://openalex.org/W1992692440,"Centrosome duplication is a critical step in assembly of the bipolar mitotic spindle, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this process during the cell cycle and during animal development are poorly understood. Here, we report that the zyg-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans is an essential regulator of centrosome duplication. ZYG-1 is a protein kinase specifically required for daughter centriole formation that localizes transiently to centrosomes and acts at least one cell cycle prior to each spindle assembly event. In the embryo, ZYG-1 participates in a unique regulatory scheme whereby paternal ZYG-1 regulates duplication and bipolar spindle assembly during the first cell cycle, and maternal ZYG-1 regulates these processes thereafter. ZYG-1 is therefore a key molecular component of the centrosome/centriole duplication process."
https://openalex.org/W1975325714,"In vertebrates, the biological consequences of DNA methylation are often mediated by protein factors containing conserved methyl-CpG binding domains (MBDs). Mutations in the MBD protein MeCP2 cause the neurodevelopmental disease Rett syndrome. We report here the solution structure of the MBD of the human methylation-dependent transcriptional regulator MBD1 bound to methylated DNA. DNA binding causes a loop in MBD1 to fold into a major and novel DNA binding interface. Recognition of the methyl groups and CG sequence at the methylation site is due to five highly conserved residues that form a hydrophobic patch. The structure indicates how MBD may access nucleosomal DNA without encountering steric interference from core histones, and provides a basis to interpret mutations linked to Rett syndrome in MeCP2."

https://openalex.org/W2078709018,"Polyubiquitin chains assembled through lysine 48 (Lys-48) of ubiquitin act as a signal for substrate proteolysis by 26 S proteasomes, whereas chains assembled through Lys-63 play a mechanistically undefined role in post-replicative DNA repair. We showed previously that the products of the UBC13 andMMS2 genes function in error-free post-replicative DNA repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and form a complex that assembles Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro. Here we confirm that the Mms2·Ubc13 complex functions as a high affinity heterodimer in the chain assembly reaction in vitro and report the results of a kinetic characterization of the polyubiquitin chain assembly reaction. To test whether a Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain can signal degradation, we conjugated Lys-63-linked tetra-ubiquitin to a model substrate of 26 S proteasomes. Although the noncanonical chain effectively signaled substrate degradation, the results of new genetic epistasis studies agree with previous genetic data in suggesting that the proteolytic activity of proteasomes is not required for error-free post-replicative repair.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). Ub executes these and other functions through conjugation to other cellular proteins, either as mono-Ub or in the form of a polyUb chain. C termini of Ub molecules (Gly-76) form covalent isopeptide bonds with ε amino groups of lysine residues of target proteins or, in the case of polyUb chains, of Ub itself. The best-understood function of Ub is that of a signal which targets specific proteins for degradation by 26 S proteasomes (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). In Ub/proteasome-dependent proteolysis, a polyUb chain is first assembled on the target protein through a series of three reactions: 1) the active-site cysteine residue of E1 forms a thiol ester with the C terminus of Ub in an ATP-dependent reaction; 2) Ub is trans-esterified to the active-site cysteine residue of one of a family of E2s; and 3) in a reaction catalyzed by an E3 enzyme, multiple Ubs are transferred from the E2 to an internal lysine residue of the target protein. Specificity in Ub-dependent proteolysis arises during this substrate polyubiquitination phase and principally reflects the properties of the E3 enzyme (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). The known E3 enzymes fall into two mechanistic classes: HECT domain E3s and RING finger E3s (reviewed in Refs. 3Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar)). Substrates destined for degradation by proteasomes are conjugated to many molecules of Ub, usually in the form of a specific polyUb chain (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).There are seven lysine residues in Ub, of which five, Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-29, Lys-48, and Lys-63, have been implicated in polyUb chain assembly (5Chau V.

Model proteins conjugated to a single Ub are poor substrates for degradation by 26 S proteasomesin vitro, whereas a model substrate bearing a Lys-48-linked chain comprising at least four Ubs is efficiently recognized (5Chau V.

Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). As expected from the importance of Ub/proteasome-dependent proteolysis, the K48R mutation in Ub is lethal in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast, yeast expressing K63RUb degrade short-lived proteins and abnormal proteins, the canonical substrates of the Ub-proteasome system, at a normal rate (9Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these yeast display other phenotypes, including sensitivity to UV light (9Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stress conditions (6Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and translational inhibitors (15Spence J. Gali R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), that are likely to reflect the inability to assemble polyUb chains through Lys-63. Thus, different types of polyUb chains appear to function as distinct signals.Post-replicative DNA repair fills in gaps opposite damage sites in newly synthesized DNA (16Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Ub plays a central, but poorly understood role in this process, as evidenced by a requirement for Lys-63 of Ub together with multiple proteins that catalyze or regulate Ub conjugation. The defining component of this pathway, encoded by theRAD6 gene (18Reynolds P. Weber S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is an E2 enzyme (19Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) that executes its repair function as part of a complex with the DNA-binding protein Rad18 (20Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 21Bailly V. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Rad18 has a RING finger and is likely to be an E3, but its specific substrates remain to be identified. We recently discovered a second heterodimeric complex consisting of Mms2 and Ubc13 that apparently functions in the assembly of Lys-63 chains forRAD6-dependent repair (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Ubc13 is an E2 enzyme, whereas Mms2 is a ubiquitin E2variant (UEV) (23Broomfield S. Chow B.L. Xiao W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5678-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) that resembles an E2 but lacks the defining E2 cysteine residue (24Sancho E. Vila M.R. Sanchez-Pulido L. Lozano J.J. Paciucci R. Nadal M. Fox M. Harvey C. Bercovich B. Loukili N. Ciechanover A. Lin S.L. Sanz F. Estivill X. Valencia A. Thomson T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mms2 positively regulates the assembly of Lys-63 chains by an unknown mechanism (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Another RING finger protein, the Rad5 helicase, interacts with the Mms2·Ubc13 complex (25Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is not known if Rad5 is an E3 enzyme, a substrate of ubiquitination, or both.Three lines of evidence suggest that the function of Lys-63 chains in DNA repair does not rely on degradative signaling via proteasomes. First, none of the three known in vivo substrates of Lys-63 chains is degraded by 26 S proteasomes; L28, a subunit of the ribosome, is metabolically stable (15Spence J. Gali R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas ubiquitination of the yeast membrane receptors Gap1p and Fur4p is a signal for endocytosis (26Galan J.M. Moreau V. Andre B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,27Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Second, the ability of K63RUb to support the viability of yeast and the absence of a detectable proteolytic defect in these cells (9Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) argue that Lys-63 chains do not serve a generalized proteolytic targeting function. However, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that Lys-63 chains target a small set of substrates for degradation by proteasomes. Finally, catalytically impaired mutants of the 20 S proteasome are relatively insensitive to UV light (28Dor Y. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but given the mild phenotypes of mms2 and ubc13 mutants (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 23Broomfield S. Chow B.L. Xiao W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5678-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), this property does not definitively exclude a role for proteasomes in post-replicative repair.To address the role of Lys-63 polyUb chains in DNA repair, we first used recombinant Mms2 and Ubc13 to characterize the chain assembly reaction in vitro. The ability to make large quantities of Lys-63 chains in vitro enabled us to test whether a Lys-63 chain is competent to signal proteasomal degradation. The positive outcome of this experiment prompted us to conduct a more rigorous test of whether Lys-63 chains target DNA repair-relevant substrates for degradation by proteasomes in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and proteins were from Sigma unless stated otherwise.

The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration and repeatedly diluted in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT) until the concentration of imidazole was <50 mm. The complex was further purified on a 1-ml fast protein liquid chromatography MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT). The final yield of complex was ∼2 mg. Uncomplexed Mms2 was obtained by the same method except that Ubc13 lysate was omitted. The concentration of Mms2p was determined assuming ε280 nm = 16,600m−1 cm−1. Elution positions from the MonoQ column were His10Mms2·Ubc13 complex, 0.11 m NaCl and His10Mms2, 0.13 m NaCl.To purify Ubc13, cells (12 g) were lysed in 50 ml of lysis buffer, and DNA was digested as described above. The soluble lysate was fractionated with ammonium sulfate; proteins precipitating between 30 and 70% saturation were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. The dialysate (∼700 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 25-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. The loaded column was washed with one volume of equilibration buffer and then eluted with a 380-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m). Ubc13 eluted at ∼0.13 m NaCl. The peak fractions were concentrated and dialyzed by dilution into column equilibration buffer. This procedure yielded ∼23 mg of Ubc13 at a purity of about 60%. The concentration of Ubc13 was determined by quantitating 125I-Ub present in the Ubc13∼Ub thiol ester (31Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) against a standard of known concentrations of human UbcH5A (provided by J. You, Johns Hopkins University)Steady-state Ub2 Synthesis AssayThe principle of the assay has been described; it utilizes two differentially blocked Ub molecules that can only give rise to Ub2 (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 32Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The conditions were 0.1 µm E1, 4 µm Mms·Ubc13 complex, 60 µm125I-K63CUb (∼300 cpm/pmol), pH 8, and 37 °C. The concentration of Asp-77Ub was varied to determine steady-state K m andk cat values.Pulse-chase Ub2 Synthesis AssayAssays were performed essentially as described previously, at pH 7.6 and 37 °C (32Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A substoichiometric concentration of 125I-Ub (the donor Ub, 2 µm) was incubated for 3 min (37 °C) with E1 (50–250 nm), Ubc13 (4 µm), and varying concentrations of His10Mms2 to form the Ubc13∼Ub thiol ester in a pulse. A high concentration of unlabeled Ub (the acceptor Ub) was then added together with 20 mm EDTA to initiate the chase. Ub2 formed during the chase is exclusively Lys-63-linked (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Aliquots were withdrawn at increasing times between 0 and 5 min and quenched in sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction products were electrophoresed, and the Ubc13∼Ub bands were excised and quantitated by γ-counting. Pseudo-first order rate constants were obtained from semi-log plots of the percent E2∼Ub thiol ester radioactivity remaining versus incubation time. The data were corrected by subtracting counts obtained in a control reaction quenched with sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol (a low level of stable E2-Ub adduct is produced through autoubiquitination). Hydrolysis of the E2∼Ub thiol ester bond was negligible during the time course of the reactions studied here (data not shown).Alkylation of Mms2 with NEMReactions with His10Mms2 (1 µm) contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml ovalbumin. NEM (0.2 mm) was added. After a 15-min incubation (37 °C), DTT (1 mm) was added for 10 min more to quench NEM. As a control, DTT and NEM were premixed and incubated for 10 min (37 °C) followed by the addition of His10Mms2 (1 µm) for 20 min more.Synthesis of Lys-63-Ub4 and Lys-63-Ub5DHFRLys-63-Ub4 was synthesized by a modification of published methods (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) involving repeated conjugation of the growing chain (blocked Lys-63, free Gly-76) to a monomeric acceptor blocked at its proximal terminus (Asp-77). Because we ultimately used E2–25K (the 25,000-kDa E2 enzyme) to conjugate Lys-63-Ub4 to UbDHFR, all of the Ub moieties in Lys-63-Ub4 carried the K48R mutation. Thus, the final chain product could not be polymerized by E2–25K. K48RUb (10 mg in 1 ml) was first blocked at its proximal terminus by conjugating it toN-acetyl lysine methyl ester (Sigma, 0.1 m) using E2–25K (overnight incubation at pH 8, 37 °C (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)). The product was designated K48RUb-NAL.In the first round of Lys-63 chain assembly, K48C, K63CUb was conjugated to K48RUb-NAL in a 1-ml incubation containing 5 mg of each protein, 4 µm His10Mms2·Ubc13 complex, and 0.1 µm E1. After incubation for 4 h at pH 7.6 (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), enzymes were removed on an anion exchange column. Ub2 was then purified by gradient elution from a 1-ml S-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at pH 4.5 (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The NAL moiety was removed using YUH1 (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); DTT, 1.7 mm, was then added for 15 min followed by iodoacetamide, 10.2 mm, for 50 min more (all at 37 °C). Alkylating the two cysteines in the distal Ub stabilized the chain against intermolecular aggregation via disulfide bond formation. YUH1 was removed on an anion exchange column.This proximally deblocked dimer (4.7 mg) was conjugated to K48RUb-NAL (2.7 mg) essentially as described above (0.6-ml reaction). This step and the next one employed a slight molar excess of the monomeric reactant to drive most of the chain reactant into product, thereby facilitating purification by a stepwise method. After 4 h of incubation, 100 µl of a 50% slurry of Q-Sepharose was added. After mixing, the resin was pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a separate tube. The resin was washed with 100 µl of buffer. The combined supernatants were adjusted to pH 4.5, and Ub species were loaded onto a 0.5-ml S-Sepharose column. The column was eluted first with 2 ml of the same buffer containing 0.33 m NaCl and then with 2 ml of the same buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl. All of the Ub3 was in the second fraction. This fraction was concentrated and dialyzed, the NAL moiety was removed using YUH1, and YUH1p was removed by anion exchange (paragraph above). In the final round of the reaction (0.5 ml), the proximally deblocked trimer (3.6 mg) was conjugated to K48RUb-NAL (1.5 mg) in a 1.5-h incubation. Conjugating enzymes were removed by anion exchange (paragraph above), and Ub4 was purified from the unbound fraction essentially as described in the paragraph above, except that the first elution employed 0.35 mNaCl, and the second employed 0.7 m NaCl. The yield of Lys-63-Ub4 was 4.8 mg. Lys-48-Ub5DHFR and Lys-63-Ub5DHFR were prepared as described by conjugating the respective polymers to 35S-UbDHFR using E2–25K (13Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar).Degradation Assays26 S proteasomes were purified (39Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed as described previously (13Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions containing 10% glycerol, 0.4 mm DTT, 1 µm ubiquitin aldehyde, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (to prevent absorption), and Lys-63- or Lys-48-35S-Ub5DHFR (0–200 nm) were preincubated at 37 °C for 8 min. Purified 26 S proteasomes (2.5 nm) were added. Aliquots of 7 µl were withdrawn at increasing times and quenched by mixing with 10 µl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, followed immediately by 7 µl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Tubes were chilled for 5 min on ice, and the precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation. Acid-soluble radioactivity was determined by counting an aliquot of the supernatant in a liquid scintillation counter. We confirmed that unmodified35S-UbDHFR is inert to proteasomes (13Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). A saturating concentration of unanchored Lys-63-Ub4 did not stimulate the degradation of unmodified UbDHFR, indicating that the chain cannot signal degradation in trans. A similar result was obtained previously with Lys-48-Ub4 (13Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONBiologically, Mms2 functions in error-free post-replicative repair (23Broomfield S. Chow B.L. Xiao W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5678-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); biochemically, it forms a complex with Ubc13 and confers activity in the assembly of Lys-63 chains (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, although Mms2 is arguably the best-characterized member of the UEV protein family, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. One goal of the studies described here was to probe the relationship between the known biochemical activity of the Mms2·Ubc13 complex, namely Lys-63 chain assembly, and the biological role of the complex in DNA repair. A second goal was to rigorously test one potential mechanistic function of the Lys-63 chain signal in DNA repair, that of a signal for proteolysis by proteasomes.The titration study shown in Fig. 1 B indicates that the chain synthesis activity of the Mms2·Ubc13 complex is maximal when the two proteins are present in a 1:1 ratio. The two recombinant proteins co-purify in the same apparent ratio (Fig. 1 A) and migrate on a size exclusion column at the position expected for a heterodimer (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytically active form of the complex is a heterodimer in vitro. Genetic data indicate thatMMS2, UBC13, and Lys-63 of Ub all participate in the error-free post-replicative repair pathway (9Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2037973887,"How pre-ribosomes temporally and spatially mature during intranuclear biogenesis is not known. Here, we report three nucleolar proteins, Noc1p to Noc3p, that are required for ribosome maturation and transport. They can be isolated in two distinct complexes: Noc1p/Noc2p associates with 90S and 66S pre-ribosomes and is enriched in the nucleolus, and Noc2p/Noc3p associates with 66S pre-ribosomes and is mainly nucleoplasmic. Mutation of each Noc protein impairs intranuclear transport of 60S subunits at different stages and inhibits pre-rRNA processing. Overexpression of a conserved domain common to Noc1p and Noc3p is dominant-negative for cell growth, with a defect in nuclear 60S subunit transport, but no inhibition of pre-rRNA processing. We propose that the dynamic interaction of Noc proteins is crucial for intranuclear movement of ribosomal precursor particles, and, thereby represent a prerequisite for proper maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1968048723,"To analyze the function of the chromosomal kinase JIL-1, we generated an allelic series of hypomorphic and null mutations. JIL-1 is an essential kinase for viability, and reduced levels of JIL-1 kinase activity lead to a global change in chromatin structure. In JIL-1 hypomorphs, euchromatic regions of polytene chromosomes are severely reduced and the chromosome arms condensed. This is correlated with decreased levels of histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation. These levels can be restored by a JIL-1 transgene placing JIL-1 directly in the pathway mediating histone H3 phosphorylation. We propose a model where JIL-1 kinase activity is required for maintaining the structure of the more open chromatin regions that facilitate gene transcription."

The crystal structure of the rat reductase complexed with NADP+ has revealed that nicotinamide access to FAD is blocked by an aromatic residue (Trp-677), which stacks against the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin. To investigate the nature of interactions between the nicotinamide, FAD, and Trp-677 during the catalytic cycle, three mutant proteins were studied by crystallography. The first mutant, W677X, has the last two C-terminal residues, Trp-677 and Ser-678, removed; the second mutant, W677G, retains the C-terminal serine residue. The third mutant has the following three catalytic residues substituted: S457A, C630A, and D675N. In the W677X and W677G structures, the nicotinamide moiety of NADP+ lies against the FAD isoalloxazine ring with a tilt of ∼30° between the planes of the two rings. These results, together with the S457A/C630A/D675N structure, allow us to propose a mechanism for hydride transfer regulated by changes in hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions between the isoalloxazine ring and either the nicotinamide ring or Trp-677 indole ring. Superimposition of the mutant and wild-type structures shows significant mobility between the two flavin domains of the enzyme. This, together with the high degree of disorder observed in the FMN domain of all three mutant structures, suggests that conformational changes occur during catalysis.

NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase nitric-oxide synthase ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase root mean square NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR,1 EC 1.6.2.4) is a 78-kDa flavoprotein bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. It contains two flavin cofactors, one FAD and one FMN, and functions in the sequential transfer of two reducing equivalents from NADPH to the heme center of cytochromes P450 via FAD and FMN (for reviews, see Refs. 1Shen A.L.

Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 225-244Crossref Google Scholar). Other physiological electron acceptors of CYPOR include heme oxygenase (3Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochrome b 5(4Enoch H.G. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 10066-10072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although non-physiological, CYPOR is also capable of reducing cytochrome c in vitro. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and potentiometric studies using a reconstituted liver microsomal monooxygenase system indicate that the hydride ion is transferred from NADPH to the lower redox potential flavin, FAD (6Iyanagi T. Makino N. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FAD then transfers single electrons to FMN, which in turn reduces the catalytic heme center of cytochrome P450 (6Iyanagi T.

Other eukaryotic enzymes known to contain two different flavin molecules within the same peptide chain, and that bind pyridine nucleotides, are the nitric-oxide synthase isozymes (NOS) (9Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar), methionine synthase reductase (10Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1471-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This relationship is extended to sequence homology, where CYPOR shares 30–40% identity with the reductase domains of the NOS isozymes, 38% with methionine synthase reductase, and 35% with NR1. Sequence analysis shows CYPOR to be divided into two domains, a flavodoxin-like FMN domain, located in the N-terminal half of the molecule, and a C-terminal FAD domain, similar to that found in ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) (12Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of cloned rat CYPOR confirms this homology (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), showing the FMN domain juxtaposed to the FAD domain. This spatial proximity is provided by the connecting domain that bifurcates the FAD domain and brings the two flavin cofactors within ∼4 Å of each other, thus facilitating direct electron transfer. NMR spectroscopic studies (14Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) indicate that thepro-R-hydrogen attached to the C-4 atom of NADPH is transferred directly to FAD as a hydride ion. However, the wild-type structure of rat CYPOR complexed with NADP+ (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) shows there-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, the face closer to the surface of the molecule, to be stacked against the indole ring of the penultimate C-terminal residue, Trp-677. The nicotinamide ring of NADP+ is projected away from the isoalloxazine ring, in a disordered state toward the protein surface, thus giving no structural information regarding the interaction between the nicotinamide ring and FAD. Such topology is reminiscent of a number of related flavoproteins including FNR (15Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10986-10995Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), all of which show direct stacking of the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings, arrangements that may represent intermediates in their respective catalytic cycles. Structures of an FNR mutant, where the aromatic residue (Tyr-308) found above the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring in the wild-type structure has been mutated to serine, show the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ or NADPH to be orientated over the central pyrazine ring of the isoalloxazine moiety. Several mutants of both rat (24Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41087-41091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and human (25Dohr O. Paine M.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15990-15999Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) CYPOR have been constructed that have mutations involving the stacking aromatic residue and their kinetic properties determined. To assess fully the role of Trp-677 in the hydride transfer mechanism, we selected two mutants of rat CYPOR for crystallographic studies, W677X and W677G. The W677X mutant has both the aromatic residue that stacks on top of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Trp-677) and the adjacent C-terminal residue (Ser-678) deleted. This was designed to prevent the C terminus from precluding nicotinamide binding and to allow NADP+ to bind in a productive manner. The W677G protein, which has the stacking tryptophan residue replaced with glycine, was made to determine that any changes observed in the W677X structure compared with the wild-type structure are solely due to the absence of Trp-677 and not the presence of the carboxylate group of Val-676. Finally, the structure of a third mutant form (S457A/C630A/D675N, or “triple mutant”) was determined in which the structure of the C terminus is preserved, but three catalytically important residues (Ser-457, Cys-630, and Asp-675) have been substituted. The structures of the W677X and W677G mutants reveal the detailed binding mode of the nicotinamide moiety of NADP(H) and provide insights into the energetics of its binding. The structure of the triple mutant, together with those of the two Trp-677 mutants, correlates with previously observed kinetic data and defines the role of these residues in the hydride transfer mechanism. The triple mutant protein (S457A/C630A/D675N) was expressed and purified as described previously (27Shen A.L. Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5391-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The W677X and W677G mutant proteins were constructed by PCR using the primer 5′-TTCATGGGCTTCATCCAGGA-3′ (from exon 14) and the mutagenic primers 5′-GTAGCTCCTAGGTCTACACATCTAGTGA-3′ (W677X) or 5′-TAGCTCCTAGGACCCCACATCTAGTGAG-3′ (W677G), which introduced a premature termination codon or the W677G substitution, respectively, as well as an AvrII cloning site immediately 3′ to the C terminus of the protein. The mutant NheI-AvrII PCR fragments were then cloned into pOR263, and the mutant clones were expressed in Escherichia coli C-1A. Cells were grown in LB media, and protein synthesis was induced by IPTG. The membrane fraction was prepared and solubilized as described previously (27Shen A.L. Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5391-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and passed over a G-50 Sephadex column equilibrated with affinity buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The void volume was collected and loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column equilibrated with affinity buffer plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and then washed with affinity buffer including 50 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm adenosine, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein was eluted with 10 mm 2′-AMP in affinity buffer, again containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrophotometer, with protein concentrations of ∼13 µm. Enzyme samples were first oxidized with 60 µm ferricyanide and dialyzed thoroughly overnight, and then absorbance spectra were taken to ensure flavin was fully oxidized (no broad peak ∼585 nm) (28Iyanagi T. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The formation of air-stable semiquinone was observed after addition of NADPH (200 µm) under aerobic conditions. For measurements of NADP+ difference spectra, NADP+ (130 µm) was added to samples of the oxidized enzyme, and spectra were re-measured; the oxidized enzyme spectra were then subtracted from this to determine difference spectra. Cytochromec reductase activities and primary deuterium isotope effects were determined as described previously (27Shen A.L. Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5391-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Shen A.L. Christensen M.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19976-19980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were crystallized by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method (30McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 159-214Google Scholar), with 18% polyethylene glycol 4000, 150 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaAc, and in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of NADP+. Prior to crystallization, purified protein was treated with a 20-fold molar excess of NADP+ and 2-fold molar excess of FMN in buffer solution (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein solution was concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and excess FMN and NADP+ were removed before crystallization setup. Data were collected at −180 °C, with crystals immersed in Paratone-N before being flash-cooled directly on the goniostat. For in-house data collection, an R-AXIS IIC image plate (Molecular Structure Corp.) with a Rigaku RU 200 generator and Osmic confocal mirrors was used. Synchrotron data were collected at beam-line BM-14C, Advanced Photon Source. Complete data sets were reduced and scaled using the HKL suite (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated using the difference Fourier method with the refined wild-type structure ((13) Protein Data Bank accession code, 1AMO). Multiple rounds of reciprocal space refinement were carried out using CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse K., R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and subsequent manual fitting with the graphic visualization program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was performed using 2F o− F c and F o −F c maps. Automatic addition of water molecules was done using the program DDQ (34van den Akker F. Hol W.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), followed by manual addition or deletion of water molecules until Rfree convergence was achieved. The visible absorption spectra of the oxidized forms of the W677X and W677G mutants are similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, addition of NADPH under aerobic conditions reduces the enzyme and produces the air-stable semiquinone spectrum, illustrated by the broad peak around 585 nm (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that these mutants are competent in hydride and interflavin electron transfer. In addition, as seen by the peak at ∼510 nm in the difference spectrum (Fig.1 B), both mutants are capable of forming charge transfer complexes between the FAD isoalloxazine moiety and oxidized nicotinamide ring of NADP+. Comparison of the 510 nm absorbance peak in the difference spectra shows that the amounts of the charge transfer complex between FAD and the nicotinamide group of NADP+ are substantial in the two mutants, whereas that in the wild type is negligible. This suggests that, unlike the wild type, both mutants are capable of forming equally stable complexes. Cytochrome c reductase activities of the W677X and W677G mutants are 4 and 2%, respectively, that of wild-type (TableI), indicating the importance of the tryptophan residue in catalysis. Notably, K mNADPH is decreased substantially by both of these mutations, suggesting that NADPH may bind more tightly to the protein in the absence of Trp-677. This is further confirmed by a 5–13-fold decrease in K iNADP+, and a decrease in K iNAD+ by 2 orders of magnitude (Table I). Furthermore, the deuterium isotope effect is decreased in W677X, suggesting a change in the rate-limiting step from hydride transfer to cofactor release.Table IKinetic properties of the wild-type and CYPOR mutantsProteink catK mNADPHK iNADP+K iNAD+DVmin−1µmµmµmWT1-aData from Refs. 27 and 29.5421 ± 746 (4)6.3 ± 0.7 (4)18.8 ± 1.9 (3)14200 ± 47001-bData from Ref. 35.2.7W677X118.4 ± 3.6 (3)1-cData from Ref. 24.0.5 ± 0.1 (4)1-cData from Ref. 24.1.4 ± 0.2 (4)77.4 ± 26.7 (3)1.2 ± 0.05 (5)W677G210.2 ± 9.0 (4)0.7 ± 0.1 (3)3.4 ± 0.7 (4)99.1 ± 12.5 (3)NDDV indicates the primary deuterium isotope effect onk cat.

These crystals appeared as thin yellow plates and were prone to forming multiple layers. Upon perfecting the cryo-conditions, crystals could be cooled to −180 °C and diffracted reasonably well to between 1.8 and 2.7 Å resolution, depending on the mutant crystal type (Table II), for the entire duration of data collection (∼16 h in-house, ∼0.5 h at the synchrotron). For the W677X and W677G mutants, multiple data sets were collected in an attempt to reduce the relatively high mosaicity; however, these all gave similar results suggesting that this was an inherent property of these crystals.Table IIData collection and refinement statisticsW677X2-aData collected in-house.W677G2-aData collected in-house.Triple mutant2-bData collected at APS, beamline BM-14C.Data collectionResolution (Å)2.62.71.8Total no. of reflections305,661455,4921,504,516Unique no. of reflections42,99938,773129,222Average 〈I/ς (I)〉2-cValues in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell.23.1 (4.0)13.9 (2.4)34.4 (3.4)Completeness (%)2-cValues in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell.82.3 (66.8)80.0 (57.7)93.3 (70.8)Rsym(%)2-cValues in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell.3.7 (15.5)8.1 (22.7)4.7 (28.5)Mosaicity (°)0.981.400.57RefinementNo. of waters included2562141,321Rfree(%)27.0626.9023.38Rcryst(%)20.9818.8620.76Average B-factor (Å2)44.642.934.9r.m.s. deviation from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0080.0080.007Bond angles (°)1.41.31.32-a Data collected in-house.2-b Data collected at APS, beamline BM-14C.2-c Values in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Crystals used for data collection were of a similar quality to those of the wild-type form, diffracting to 2.6 Å resolution and having a relatively high mosaicity of ∼1° (Table II). As with all the mutant structures studied, initial difference Fourier analysis of the diffraction data made use of the refined wild-type rat CYPOR structure (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Overall, superimposition of the complete molecule reveals very little difference between the wild-type and mutant structure folds (Cα r.m.s. deviation ∼0.6 Å). After one round of simulated annealing, however, the F o −F c map clearly showed an extension of density (>2ς) from the pyrophosphate linker of NADP+ to the region above the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, which is occupied by the indole ring of Trp-677 in the wild-type structure. In contrast, the 2F o −F c map was distorted with respect to the positioning of Trp-677 in the wild-type structure, and there was poor density extending back into the preceding amino acids of the peptide. However, well defined electron density for the phospho-AMP region of NADP+ showed this part of the cofactor was bound to the enzyme in the same orientation as observed in the wild-type structure. This immediately suggested that the nicotinamide ring had substituted for the indole ring of Trp-677 and that significant torsion about the pyrophosphate linker of NADP+ occurred to achieve this stacked conformation. Further refinement resulted in the nicotinamide moiety being tilted ∼30° with respect to the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 2), in a similar orientation to that seen in the Y308S mutant of FNR (22Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The A-face of the nicotinamide ring is stacked against the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring, with the pro-R-hydrogen of the C-4 atom positioned for transfer to the N-5 atom of FAD, consistent with the stereospecificity of hydride transfer (14Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This stereochemistry is identical to that seen in FNR (22Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); however, in the case of the CYPOR structure, the center of the nicotinamide ring is positioned over the N-5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring, whereas with FNR the centers of both the nicotinamide and isoalloxazine rings are directly opposing each other. This suggests, as with the Y308S FNR mutant, that the structure mimics the productive complex between NADPH and FAD, allowing direct hydride transfer to occur. The arrangement of three residues known to be critical for hydride transfer, Ser-457, Cys-630, and Asp-675 (27Shen A.L. Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5391-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). However, the position of the nicotinamide group juxtaposed to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD shows the three catalytic residues forming contacts with NADP+ not seen in the wild-type structure (Fig.4). The potential van der Waal's interaction seen in the wild-type structure between the hydroxyl group of Ser-457 and the N-5 atom of FAD (∼3.9 Å) is maintained in the W677X structure; however, a weak hydrogen bond (∼3.5 Å) is present between Ser-457 and the carboxamide group of NADP+. Asp-675 forms a relatively strong hydrogen bond (∼2.5 Å) to the carboxamide group, presumably leading to displacement of the side chain of Asp-675 with respect to the wild-type structure, resulting in loss of hydrogen bonds to both Ser-457 and Cys-630. Cys-630 is positioned in the same manner as in the wild type but in close contact with the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide ring. A similar arrangement of these three catalytic residues around the nicotinamide ring is also seen in the FNR Y308S mutant structure. However, the carboxylate group of Val-676 in the W677X mutant, which is present two residues before that of the wild type and the two other mutant proteins, forms a hydrogen bond to the carboxamide moiety of NADP+.Figure 4Diagram showing the hydrogen bond networks surrounding the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the nicotinamide ring of NADP+. Thin dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds; thick dotted lines are van der Waal's contacts.A, the wild-type structure. The two catalytic waters involved in hydrogen bond networks with FAD are included. B, the W677X mutant structure. The presence of the nicotinamide ring results in Asp-675 moving out of hydrogen bonding distance from Ser-457 and Cys-630. Van der Waal's contacts are formed between the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide ring and Cys-630 and from Ser-457 to the N-5 atom of FAD. Another van der Waal's contact is formed between the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide ring and the N-5 atom of FAD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The hydrogen bonding scheme around the pyrimidine side of the FAD isoalloxazine ring is the same as that seen in the wild-type structure (Fig. 4). The N-1 and O-2 atoms of the flavin ring form hydrogen bonds with a water molecule (WAT1 in Fig. 4), which in turn hydrogen bonds to the 4′-OH group of the ribytyl chain of FAD and the main chain carbonyl oxygen and nitrogen atoms of Val-474. This tightly bound water molecule is most likely the general acid that donates the proton when the flavin is reduced. The N-3 and O-4 atoms of the isoalloxazine ring are part of another hydrogen bond network with another water molecule (WAT2) and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Cys-472. All of these interactions are conserved in the wild-type and three mutant structures and appear crucial for binding and orientation of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD to the enzyme. Another notable observation is the apparent disorder of the FMN domain in one of the two molecules of the asymmetric unit. Initial B-factors were not refined during the early stages of model building; however, both the 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps indicated strong disorder in the FMN domain of the second molecule of the asymmetric unit (from the N terminus up to residue 241). This region was therefore re-annealed, and after B-factor correction, both maps were re-examined to see if there was any discernible electron density. High B-factors (∼80–100 Å2) and untraceable density confirmed this disorder; therefore, this region was omitted prior to any further refinement. Inspection of the final 2F o− F c map shows this region to have little density; however, superimposition of the wild-type structure shows that three helical regions can still be observed (residues 89–102, 149–160, and 209–230). Attempts have been made at including these regions in refinement, but the disorder is such that the peptide backbone can only be traced at intermittent parts of these regions. Considering that the crystal was kept continuously at −180 °C during data collection, this disorder suggests that during crystal growth the FMN domain is positioned in multiple conformations. In contrast, the FMN domain of the more ordered molecule gave good electron density maps and allowed refinement to give B-factors comparable to the FAD domain (∼50 Å2), reflecting the tight packing of this molecule in the asymmetric unit, within the crystal lattice. Data collection statistics show that crystals of the W677G mutant have particularly high mosaicity (∼1.4°) and diffract to a lower resolution than the other mutant forms (Table II). However, difference Fourier analysis using phases taken from the wild-type structure produced an initial 2F o − F c map which showed, unlike the W677X structure, the FMN domains of both molecules in the asymmetric unit to be relatively well ordered. Inspection of this map above the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD showed that the indole ring of"

ERK binding to substrate proteins is mediated by docking sites including the FXFP motif and the D-domain. We characterized the sequence of amino acids that can constitute the FXFP motif using peptide and protein substrates. Substitutions of the phenylalanines at positions 1 and 3 had significant effects, indicating that these phenylalanines provide substantial binding affinity, whereas substitutions of the residues at positions 2 and 4 had less effect. The FXFP and D-domain docking sites were analyzed in a variety of positions and arrangements in the proteins ELK-1 and KSR-1. Our results indicate that the FXFP and D-domain docking sites form a flexible, modular system that has two functions. First, the affinity of a substrate for ERK can be regulated by the number, type, position, and arrangement of docking sites. Second, in substrates with multiple potential phosphorylation sites, docking sites can direct phosphorylation of specific (S/T)P residues. In particular, the FQFP motif of ELK-1 is necessary and sufficient to direct phosphorylation of serine 383, whereas the D-domain directs phosphorylation of other (S/T)P sites in ELK-1.

Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Ferrell J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These MAP kinases can be activated by a remarkably diverse set of stimuli that function through a variety of signaling pathways. MAP kinase activation is regulated by two upstream protein kinases; a MAP kinase kinase kinase, such as Raf, phosphorylates and thereby activates a MAP kinase kinase (3Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 4Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase kinase that regulates ERK is called MEK (MAP kinase kinase or ERK kinase). MEK is a dual specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates a threonine and tyrosine in a TXY motif of ERK, resulting in a significant increase in ERK kinase activity. ERK is inactivated by dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate the TXY motif. Many different stimuli can activate the protein kinase cascade that activates ERK. One extensively characterized activation pathway is initiated by a secreted growth factor, such as epidermal growth factor, that leads to the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase, Ras, and Raf (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 19: 459-463Google Scholar).Signaling pathways that include ERK mediate a remarkably diverse set of responses during the development and homeostasis of organisms such asCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates. The mechanisms that enable highly conserved signaling pathways to elicit cell type-specific responses are being actively investigated, yet remain poorly understood. In principle, any protein in a signaling cascade could function differently in different cell types and, thus, contribute to a specific response. However, ERK is likely to play an important role in generating cell type-specific responses (6Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). By contrast to Raf and MEK, whose only well documented physiological substrates are MEK and ERK, respectively, ERK has been reported to phosphorylate more than 50 different substrates (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 9Whitmarsh A.J.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These include signaling proteins likely to function upstream of ERK, such as son-of-sevenless guanine nucleotide exchange factor, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), and MEK, and signaling proteins likely to function downstream of ERK, such as the protein kinase pp90rsk, phosphodiesterase, and phosphatases. These findings suggest that ERK plays a central role in feedback regulation and signal propagation. ERK substrates also include many different transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Myc, and ETS proteins including ELK-1, LIN-1, and AOP/YAN, suggesting ERK is a transition point between signaling proteins and regulators of gene expression and differentiation. ERK substrates also include proteins that may regulate cell fate through non-transcriptional mechanisms, such as proteins that regulate programmed cell death and cytoskeletal organization. The large number of ERK substrates that affect differentiation suggests the model that ERK phosphorylates different groups of substrates in different cell types and thereby contributes to cell type-specific responses.The biological role of ERK raises important mechanistic questions as follows: 1) how does ERK specifically recognize a large number of different substrates, and 2) how does ERK phosphorylate specific residues in these proteins? The initial steps in answering these questions came from studies that identified the residue(s) in substrate proteins that are phosphorylated by ERK and analyzed peptides that can function as ERK substrates (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that ERK phosphorylates serine or threonine followed by proline ((S/T)P). In addition, a proline at position −2 is favorable, whereas a proline at position −1 is unfavorable (the phosphoacceptor S/T is position 0). However, this information was not sufficient to explain how ERK recognizes specific proteins as substrates, because many proteins that contain (S/T)P sequences are not phosphorylated by ERK. Furthermore, it did not explain fully how ERK phosphorylates specific sites in substrates with multiple (S/T)P motifs. More recently, some ERK substrates have been shown to contain motifs that mediate high affinity interactions with ERK; we refer to such motifs as docking sites (12Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.-H. Galanis A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We reported that FXFP, a motif that is conserved in ETS transcription factors of the Elk subfamily, is a docking site for ERK (15Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Jacobs D. Beitel G.J. Clark S.G. Horvitz H.R. Kornfeld K.

The FXFP docking site also mediates ERK binding to KSR proteins and phosphodiesterase (24MacKenzie S.J. Baille G.S. McPhee I. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16609-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,30Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We proposed that the D-domain and FXFP form a modular system of docking sites (30Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The domain of ERK that interacts with the FXFP motif has yet to be defined. These findings indicate that ERK recognizes specific substrate proteins by binding to docking sites and that there are at least two different classes of ERK docking sites.Here we investigate the function of ERK docking sites by creating a series of mutant versions of human ELK-1 and C. elegans KSR-1 that contain different numbers and types of docking sites arranged in different positions and combinations. Our results indicate that the modular system of docking sites is highly flexible and accomplishes two significant goals. First, the number, position, and type of docking sites determine the affinity of a substrate protein and ERK. Second, the position and type of docking sites direct ERK phosphorylation of specific (S/T)P residues. These findings address how many unrelated proteins may have evolved to become ERK substrates that are phosphorylated on specific residues. The MAP1 kinase superfamily is composed of several subfamilies including ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 (1Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Ferrell J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These MAP kinases can be activated by a remarkably diverse set of stimuli that function through a variety of signaling pathways. MAP kinase activation is regulated by two upstream protein kinases; a MAP kinase kinase kinase, such as Raf, phosphorylates and thereby activates a MAP kinase kinase (3Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 4Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase kinase that regulates ERK is called MEK (MAP kinase kinase or ERK kinase). MEK is a dual specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates a threonine and tyrosine in a TXY motif of ERK, resulting in a significant increase in ERK kinase activity. ERK is inactivated by dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate the TXY motif. Many different stimuli can activate the protein kinase cascade that activates ERK. One extensively characterized activation pathway is initiated by a secreted growth factor, such as epidermal growth factor, that leads to the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase, Ras, and Raf (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 19: 459-463Google Scholar). Signaling pathways that include ERK mediate a remarkably diverse set of responses during the development and homeostasis of organisms such asCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates. The mechanisms that enable highly conserved signaling pathways to elicit cell type-specific responses are being actively investigated, yet remain poorly understood. In principle, any protein in a signaling cascade could function differently in different cell types and, thus, contribute to a specific response. However, ERK is likely to play an important role in generating cell type-specific responses (6Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). By contrast to Raf and MEK, whose only well documented physiological substrates are MEK and ERK, respectively, ERK has been reported to phosphorylate more than 50 different substrates (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 9Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 10Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These include signaling proteins likely to function upstream of ERK, such as son-of-sevenless guanine nucleotide exchange factor, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), and MEK, and signaling proteins likely to function downstream of ERK, such as the protein kinase pp90rsk, phosphodiesterase, and phosphatases. These findings suggest that ERK plays a central role in feedback regulation and signal propagation. ERK substrates also include many different transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Myc, and ETS proteins including ELK-1, LIN-1, and AOP/YAN, suggesting ERK is a transition point between signaling proteins and regulators of gene expression and differentiation. ERK substrates also include proteins that may regulate cell fate through non-transcriptional mechanisms, such as proteins that regulate programmed cell death and cytoskeletal organization. The large number of ERK substrates that affect differentiation suggests the model that ERK phosphorylates different groups of substrates in different cell types and thereby contributes to cell type-specific responses. The biological role of ERK raises important mechanistic questions as follows: 1) how does ERK specifically recognize a large number of different substrates, and 2) how does ERK phosphorylate specific residues in these proteins? The initial steps in answering these questions came from studies that identified the residue(s) in substrate proteins that are phosphorylated by ERK and analyzed peptides that can function as ERK substrates (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that ERK phosphorylates serine or threonine followed by proline ((S/T)P). In addition, a proline at position −2 is favorable, whereas a proline at position −1 is unfavorable (the phosphoacceptor S/T is position 0). However, this information was not sufficient to explain how ERK recognizes specific proteins as substrates, because many proteins that contain (S/T)P sequences are not phosphorylated by ERK. Furthermore, it did not explain fully how ERK phosphorylates specific sites in substrates with multiple (S/T)P motifs. More recently, some ERK substrates have been shown to contain motifs that mediate high affinity interactions with ERK; we refer to such motifs as docking sites (12Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Sharrocks and colleagues (13Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D.

To characterize gene regulatory mechanisms by which mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity is diminished in response to hypoxia, cardiac myocytes in culture were exposed to long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia prevented the known LCFA-induced accumulation of mRNA encoding muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (M-CPT I), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Under hypoxic conditions, myocytes exhibited significant accumulation of intracellular neutral lipid consistent with reduced CPT I activity and diminished FAO capacity. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the hypoxia-mediated blunting of M-CPT I gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level, is localized to an LCFA/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) response element within the M-CPT I gene promoter, and is PPARα-dependent. DNA-protein binding studies demonstrated that exposure to hypoxia reduces PPARα/RXR binding activity. Immunoblotting studies demonstrated that whereas hypoxia had no effect on nuclear levels of PPARα protein, nuclear and cellular RXRα levels were reduced. Hypoxia also diminished the 9-cis-retinoic acid-mediated activation of a reporter containing an RXR homodimer response element.

The mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional activation of glycolytic enzyme gene expression in response to hypoxia have recently been characterized. Several key genes involved in cellular glucose utilization pathways are transcriptionally activated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (4Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol.

Hypoxia also triggers additional transcriptional control mechanisms involving the Sp factor family (7Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Wu X. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J. Biol.

Despite recent progress in characterizing the regulation of cellular glucose utilization in response to hypoxia, little is known about the mechanisms involved in hypoxia-mediated suppression of mitochondrial flux. This response is particularly relevant for tissues such as the mammalian heart which relies largely on mitochondrial FAO for energy (9Bing R.J. Harvey Lect. 1955; 50: 27-70Google Scholar) yet exhibits a dynamic plasticity related to energy substrate preferences. For example, during the transition from the fetal to postnatal period, the predominant myocardial energy source switches from glycolysis to FAO (9Bing R.J. Harvey Lect. 1955; 50: 27-70Google Scholar, 10Warshaw J.B. Dev. Biol. 1972; 28: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The adult human heart is also capable of adaptive metabolic responses. Under conditions of physiologic hypoxia (e.g. high altitude environments), myocardial energy substrate preference shifts from fatty acids to glucose (11Holden J.E. Stone C.K. Clark C.M. Brown W.D. Nickles R.J. Stanley C. Hochachka P.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1995; 79: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies performed in animals as well as in cell culture have shown a marked decrease in the rate of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) β-oxidation in cardiac myocytes following exposure to a hypoxic environment (12Abdel-aleem S.

Erecinska M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H71-H80PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for this hypoxia-mediated decrease in cardiac FAO are unknown. The activity of the enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), is an important determinant of mitochondrial FAO cycle flux. CPT I catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the mitochondrial import of LCFAs prior to entering the β-oxidation cycle (14McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The muscle CPT I isoform, M-CPT I (or CPT Iβ), is expressed abundantly in tissues with high mitochondrial FAO capacity, such as heart and brown adipose (15Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamanaka Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,16Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol.

Tight post-translational control of M-CPT I activity is effected by malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, via a well characterized mechanism of allosteric inhibition (14McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that M-CPT I expression is also regulated at the gene transcriptional level by LCFA via the lipid-activated nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Specifically, transcriptional activation is mediated by LCFA via a heterodimeric complex composed of PPARα and the retinoid X receptor (RXR), bound to a fatty acid-responsive element (FARE-1) within the M-CPT I gene promoter. This regulatory mechanism likely serves to modulate mitochondrial FAO enzyme levels and substrate flux into the β-oxidation spiral in accordance with myocardial fatty acid availability during development and in diverse dietary and physiologic conditions (19Djouadi F.

We hypothesized that hypoxia leads to decreased capacity for mitochondrial FAO through its effect on the same gene regulatory pathways involved in LCFA-mediated control of M-CPT I expression. Accordingly, we characterized the effects of hypoxia on the regulation of M-CPT I gene expression by LCFAs. We demonstrate that hypoxia antagonizes the LCFA-mediated, PPARα-dependent transcriptional activation of the M-CPT I gene via an HIF-1α-independent pathway. Our results indicate that hypoxia elicits a decrease in the nuclear levels of RXR which, in turn, reduces the formation of functional PPARα/RXR heterodimers. Accordingly, alteration of nuclear receptor signaling represents a novel mechanism by which hypoxia regulates gene expression. Ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (22Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

A hypoxic culture environment was created by the infusion of a pre-analyzed gas mixture of 95% N2, 5% CO2 into an airtight modular chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc.) as described (23Levy F.H.

The viability of the cells under various treatment was assessed by measuring dehydrogenase metabolism of tetrazolium to formazan in live cells using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Animal protocols were approved by the Washington University Animal Care Committee. Total cellular RNA isolation and blotting was performed as described (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

Band intensities were quantified by phosphorimaging using a Bio-Rad GS 525 Molecular Imaging System. The M-CPT I promoter-luciferase plasmids and the heterologous TK promoter-luciferase constructs have been described (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

The (RXRE)2TK.Luc was constructed by ligation of annealed oligonucleotides (sense strand, 5′-GATCCAGGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGTCCAG-3′) into the BamHI site upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter of the pGL2-TK.Luc reporter plasmid. The sequence is based on the RXR response element contained in the rat cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) II gene promoter (25Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S.

The HIF-1-responsive reporter, PGKHRE.TK.Luc, containing the HIF-1α response element from the phosphoglycerate kinase gene, was generously provided by C. Simone (University of Pennsylvania). Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described (22Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

Reporter plasmids were cotransfected with SV40-βGal, containing a β-galactosidase gene downstream of the simian virus promoter, to control for transfection efficiency and cell survival. For cotransfection experiments, the mammalian expression vector, pCDM.PPARα, containing mouse PPARα cDNA (26Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or pCDM (−), the vector backbone alone, was used. Ligands or vehicle were added just before cells were exposed to hypoxia. Oleate complexed to bovine serum albumin at a molar ratio of 2:1 was added to cell media to a final concentration of 250 µm oleate. Eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) or 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were added to cell media containing charcoal-stripped serum to a final concentration of 10 and 0.1 µm, respectively. Cells were harvested after a 48-h hypoxic period. Luciferase activities were determined as described (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Preparation of crude nuclear protein extracts from rat neonatal cardiocytes cultured under normoxic or hypoxic (48 h) conditions and EMSA reactions were performed as described (22Disch D.L.

The adenoviral construct, Ad-PPARα, was constructed by subcloning a SalI/XbaI fragment from a Gal4-FLAG-PPARα construct containing the PPARα cDNA encoding amino acids 1–468 plus an N-terminal FLAG epitope into pAd Track-CMV vector. Recombination and propagation of adenovirus expressing PPARα was performed as described (28He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GATA-RE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. Antibody recognition experiments were performed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope (M5 antibody, Sigma) or with a polyclonal anti-PPARα antibody (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) and electroblotted onto Protran nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunodetection of overexpressed FLAG-PPARα was performed with the same anti-FLAG antibody used in the antibody supershift reactions. The anti-PPARα antibody (FP2) is directed toward the hinge region of PPARα and has been described previously (29Gebel T. Arand M. Oesch F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The anti-RXRα antibody (D-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is directed toward the N terminus of the protein. A universal anti-actin antibody (Sigma) directed against the conserved C terminus of actin was used as a control. Proteins were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between mean mRNA levels were compared using an unpaired Student's t test, and transfection data were analyzed by either a one-factor analysis of variance or an unpaired Student's t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. The effects of hypoxia on basal and fatty acid-induced M-CPT I gene expression were characterized using Northern blot analysis performed with total RNA isolated from primary neonatal cardiac ventricular myocytes incubated in the presence or absence of 250 µm oleate under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As shown previously under normoxic conditions, oleate induced M-CPT I mRNA levels over 5-fold (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In contrast, whereas hypoxia did not alter basal steady-state levels of M-CPT I mRNA, it abolished the oleate-mediated induction of M-CPT I gene expression (Fig.1). Previous studies have demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of M-CPT I activity creates a metabolic mismatch between cardiac myocyte lipid import and mitochondrial utilization, resulting in intracellular neutral lipid accumulation (19Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 20Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P.

A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The observed inhibitory effect of hypoxia on LCFA-mediated activation of M-CPT I gene expression suggested that myocyte lipid homeostasis would be similarly perturbed. To explore this hypothesis, we evaluated neutral lipid content in cardiac myocytes exposed to 250 µm oleate complexed to albumin and cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Oil red O staining of the cardiac myocytes demonstrated a marked accumulation of intracellular neutral lipid within the hypoxic myocytes compared with control cells (Fig. 2). This hypoxia-induced lipid accumulation occurred in the absence of exogenous fatty acid but was more pronounced following exposure to oleate (Fig.2). These data, consistent with the hypoxia-mediated reduction in M-CPT I gene expression, indicate that reduced oxygen availability leads to a diminution in the capacity for myocyte fatty acid catabolism. To determine if the antagonistic effects of hypoxia on LCFA-induced M-CPT I gene expression occur at the transcriptional level, we performed promoter activity assays in cardiac myocytes. Myocytes were transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid containing the human M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking region from −1025 to −12 bp fused to a luciferase gene reporter (MCPT.Luc.1025) (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As shown schematically in Fig.3 A, MCPT.Luc.1025 contains the fatty acid response element-1 (FARE-1), a previously described PPARα-responsive element (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), upstream of two untranslated exons, 1A and 1B (15Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamanaka Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hasimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following transfection, the myocytes were incubated in the presence of oleate or vehicle for 48 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Based on the tetrazolium conversion assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), cell survival was not significantly reduced in any of the hypoxic conditions tested (data not shown). As expected, under normoxic conditions, oleate induced the transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.1025 over 8-fold (Fig. 3 A). This oleate-mediated induction of MCPT.Luc.1025 activity was abolished in hypoxic conditions. In the absence of oleate, exposure to a hypoxic environment had no effect on the transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.1025 (Fig. 3 A). To verify the effectiveness of our hypoxia system, parallel transfection experiments were performed using a thymidine kinase promoter-reporter construct containing three copies of the HIF-1α response element (HRE) derived from the phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGKHRE.TKLuc) (5Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). PGKHRE.TKLuc was markedly induced following a 48-h incubation within the hypoxia chamber confirming that a hypoxic cellular environment had been established (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies have mapped the LCFA-responsive region of the M-CPT I gene to FARE-1, a PPARα-responsive element located at −775 to −763 bp of the 5′-flanking region (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of FARE-1 in the hypoxia response, we repeated cardiac myocyte transfections using MCPT.Luc.1025 and two additional M-CPT I promoter constructs as follows: MCPT.Luc.781, which contains the −781 to −12-bp region of the M-CPT I gene (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) including an intact FARE-1 element, and a mutated construct, MCPT.Luc.781m1, which is identical to MCPT.Luc.781 except that it bears a G to C substitution in the upstream half-site of FARE-1 rendering it unable to bind PPARα (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Compared with MCPT.1025.Luc, a similar hypoxia-mediated repression of LCFA-induced transcription was observed with MCPT.Luc.781, suggesting that the −781 to −1025 region was not essential for the inhibition (Fig.3 B). However, in the absence of an intact FARE-1 (MCPT.Luc.781 m1) the hypoxia-mediated transcriptional repression was absent, indicating that a functional PPARα response element is necessary for the hypoxia response. The results shown in Fig. 3 suggested that the PPARα regulatory pathway is attenuated following exposure to hypoxia. However, the basal activity of the mutated FARE-1 construct, MCPT.Luc.781m1, is significantly lower than that of the corresponding wild-type construct (Fig. 3 B) precluding a definitive conclusion regarding the necessity of PPARα for the transcriptional repression by hypoxia. Accordingly, experiments were performed in the hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cell line, which provides a relative PPARα-deficient background (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cotransfected with either a PPARα expression vector (CDM.PPARα) or the vector backbone (CDM(−)) and MCPT.Luc.781. For these studies, the known PPARα activator ETYA was used to exclude potential PPAR-independent regulatory effects mediated by oleate. MCPT.781.Luc activity was not significantly affected by ETYA treatment or by hypoxic conditions in the absence of PPARα expression vector. However, upon cotransfection with CDM.PPARα, MCPT.781.Luc exhibited ETYA responsiveness, which was markedly diminished under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4 A). As expected, similar results were obtained using oleate as the PPARα activator (data not shown). These data demonstrate that PPARα is a target for the hypoxia-induced block in fatty acid-mediated activation of M-CPT I gene expression. Additionally, we conclude that this effect is not PPARα ligand-specific, suggesting that hypoxia does not mediate its effects via altered metabolism of oleate or other potential fatty acid PPARα ligands. To determine whether a PPARα-responsive element is sufficient to confer the inhibitory effect of hypoxia, transfection experiments were repeated in HepG2 cells with two heterologous promoter-reporter plasmids, MCPT(FARE)2TK.LUC, containing 2 copies of FARE-1 and (ACO)3TK.LUC, containing 3 copies of a PPAR-RE derived from the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) gene (Fig. 4 B). Both reporters contain a minimal viral thymidine kinase promoter. The MCPT(FARE)2TK.LUC and (ACO)3TK.LUC constructs, when cotransfected with CDM.PPARα, displayed 10- and 17-fold activation by ETYA, respectively, under normoxic conditions. In contrast, the ligand-induced activities of the reporter constructs were significantly blunted by hypoxia (Fig. 4 B). The activity of the TK promoter lacking a PPARα response element was not repressed by hypoxia, rather it was modestly increased (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a PPARα response element is sufficient to confer the hypoxia-mediated inhibitory response and that this effect is not unique to the M-CPT I gene PPAR-RE, rather, it likely reflects a global effect on PPARα signaling. The best characterized mechanism whereby hypoxia regulates gene expression involves the transcription factor HIF-1α. HIF-1α mediates hypoxia-induced transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes encoding proteins necessary for cellular and physiologic adaptation to hypoxia (4Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Semenza G.L. Jiang B.-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.-P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HIF-1α is involved in the observed effects of hypoxia on PPARα function, we explored the effects of CoCl2, a hypoxia-mimicking compound known to activate HIF-1α and to induce HIF-1α-dependent changes in target gene expression (32Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). For these experiments, transient transfection assays were repeated in HepG2 cells using the MCPT.Luc.781 reporter plasmid. In contrast to the effects with hypoxia, treatment with 75 µm CoCl2 did not blunt MCPT.Luc.781 activation by oleate (Fig. 5). In parallel experiments, the HIF-1α-responsive construct PGKHRE.TKLuc displayed a robust induction following exposure to CoCl2(Fig. 5). These results suggest that an HIF-1α-independent pathway is involved in the M-CPT I gene transcriptional response to hypoxia. Results from the PPARα overexpression studies shown above indicated that hypoxia alters PPARα function at the post-translational level. To determine whether hypoxia influences the interaction of PPARα with cognate DNA-binding sites, the FARE-1 element was used in EMSA to assess PPARα DNA binding activity. To increase the sensitivity of the analysis, EMSA was performed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from cardiac myocytes infected with a FLAG epitope-tagged PPARα-expressing adenoviral vector (Ad-PPARα) and cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 48 h. The FARE-1 oligonucleotide probe formed one major DNA-protein complex of low mobility and two additional fainter complexes, exhibiting high and intermediate mobilities, respectively (Fig.6, lane 2). All of the complexes represent specific FARE-1-protein interactions, based on competition studies performed with a molar excess of unlabeled FARE-1 or a mutated FARE-1 (data not shown). We have shown previously (17Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) that the low mobility major complex represents a PPARα/RXR heterodimer, the functional form of PPARα. Antibody recognition experiments using anti-FLAG epitope or anti-PPARα antibodies (Fig. 6,lanes 3–5) confirmed that this complex contained PPARα. The faint complex of intermediate mobility was also recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody and could represent a proteolytic product of PPARα. A comparison of FARE-1 binding activity between normoxic and hypoxic extracts revealed that formation of the PPARα·RXR complex was significantly reduced in response to hypoxia (Fig. 6,lanes 6–9), indicating that hypoxia decreases DNA binding activity of the PPARα/RXR heterodimer. As controls, EMSA experiments were also performed with probes containing either the recognition sequence for the HIF-1 complex or for GATA-4, a cardiac-enriched transcription factor. As expected, formation of the HIF-1·DNA complex was induced in extracts prepared from hypoxic cells (Fig. 6,right panel). In contrast, the intensity of the GATA-RE·protein complex was not significantly different between the hypoxic and control samples (Fig. 6, right panel). The results shown above indicate that hypoxia attenuates PPARα signaling by reducing its DNA binding activity. Therefore, nuclear levels of PPARα protein were measured to determine whether the altered binding activity of PPARα/RXR was due to diminished availability of PPARα. For these experiments, Western blot analyses were performed using anti-PPARα and anti-FLAG epitope antibodies with nuclear- and cytosol-enriched protein extracts prepared from Ad-PPARα-infected cardiac myocytes exposed to normoxic or hypoxic (48 h) conditions. As expected, the majority of PPARα was detected in the nucleus under normoxic conditions although a small amount was detected in the cytosol using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.7 A). Surprisingly, hypoxic conditions did not alter the nuclear levels of PPARα (Fig.7 A). Immunoblotting studies were next performed to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the levels of the obligate PPARα partner, RXR. Nuclear levels of endogenous RXRα were significantly lower in hypoxic myocytes compared with normoxic control cells (Fig. 7 B). RXRα was not detected in the cytosolic fraction of normoxic or hypoxic cells suggesting that the observed reduction in nuclear levels of RXRα was not due to redistribution of RXRα from the nucleus to cytosol (data not shown). Consistent with this latter finding, levels of RXRα in total cell protein extracts were also significantly reduced (Fig. 7 B). Recent studies have shown that ligand binding leads to increased proteasomal-mediated degradation of RXR (33Nomura Y. Nagaya T. Hayashi Y. Kambe F. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,34Kopf E. Plassat J.-L. Vivat V. deThe H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As expected, exposure of the normoxic myocytes to the RXR ligand, 9-cis-RA, resulted in reduced levels of RXRα (Fig.7 B). The combination of hypoxia and exposure to RXR ligand resulted in a greater reduction in RXRα levels compared with either condition alone. The results shown above suggested that hypoxia inhibits PPARα-dependent activation by decreasing nuclear levels of RXRα, thereby limiting formation of the functional PPARα·RXRα complex. To test this hypothesis further, experiments were performed to determine whether the observed effects of hypoxia on RXRα nuclear protein levels correlated temporally with the inhibition of PPARα signaling. PPARα-mediated induction of MCPT.Luc.781 and RXRα protein levels were determined at identical time points (12, 24, and 48 h) in cardiac myocytes following the onset of hypoxia. RXRα protein levels began to decrease between 12 h and 24 h of hypoxic exposure and remained low at 48 h compared to levels in normoxic conditions. In contrast, a significant reduction in PPARα-mediated activation of MCPT.Luc.781 did not occur until the period between 24 and 48 h of hypoxia exposure (Fig. 7 C), whereas induction of the HIF-1-responsive PGKHRE.TKLuc occurred within 12 h (data not shown). As expected, PPARα-dependent activation by ETYA was observed at all time points in normoxic conditions (Fig. 7 C). These results demonstrate that the hypoxia-mediated alteration in RXRα protein levels precedes the onset of functional inhibition of PPARα-dependent transactivation. Collectively, these data indicate that hypoxia leads to reduced nuclear levels of RXRα, accounting, at least in part, for the observed reduction in PPARα/RXR binding and activity. RXR serves as the obligate heterodimeric partner for a number of nuclear receptors in addition to PPARα and can mediate 9-cis-RA effects additionally as a homodimer. Given that hypoxia results in a reduction in the nuclear levels of RXRα, it would be predicted that signaling through other RXR-dependent pathways would be similarly affected. To investigate this possibility, the hypoxia transfection experiments were repeated using an RXR-responsive heterologous reporter construct containing 2 copies of a well characterized RXR-RE derived from the cellular retinol-binding protein II (CRBP II) gene promoter. The CRBP II RXR-RE has been shown to confer transcriptional activation by 9-cis-RA through interaction with RXR homodimers (25Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). When cotransfected with CDM.RXRα into HepG2 cells, the (RXRE)2TK.Luc was induced 54-fold by 9-cis-RA under normoxic conditions (Fig. 8). In contrast, the 9-cis-RA-mediated induction of (RXRE)2TK.Luc was reduced by ∼50% in hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia had no significant effect on the basal transcriptional activity of (RXRE)2TK.Luc in the absence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 8). These data indicate that as predicted by the observed hypoxia-induced diminution in nuclear RXR levels, hypoxia alters the activity of a PPARα-independent RXR gene target. Preservation of cellular function in a hypoxic environment requires metabolic adaptation to improve oxygen utilization efficiency during energy production. While the oxidation of fatty acids provides more ATP per mol of substrate compared with that of glucose, it does so at the expense of increased oxygen consumption. Therefore, the hypoxia-mediated switch from mitochondrial β-oxidation to glycolysis in heart is thought to serve as a protective cellular response. Although previous studies have identified mechanisms whereby glycolytic capacity is increased under hypoxic conditions, little is known regarding hypoxia-driven decreases in mitochondrial flux. In this report, we identify one such hypoxia-mediated regulatory response, involving attenuation of the PPARα-dependent transcriptional control of the gene encoding a key enzyme in the mitochondrial FAO pathway. The inhibition of M-CPT I gene expression following exposure to hypoxic conditions likely constitutes an adaptive metabolic response. Given that oxidation of fat is an oxygen “expensive” means of ATP production, reduced myocardial FAO would be predicted to improve oxygen utilization efficiency while maintaining adequate energy generation. Additionally, reduced expression of M-CPT I and other PPARα/RXRα targets may diminish mitochondrial flux and, therefore, reduce accumulation of toxic intermediates during hypoxia. For example, reactive oxygen species resulting from increased flux through mitochondrial pathways upon reoxygenation are associated with myocyte damage and apoptosis (35Saikumar P. Dong Z. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Additionally, under limited oxygen availability, reduced cardiac mitochondrial β-oxidation predisposes to the accumulation of upstream extramitochondrial LCFA intermediates, such as long-chain acylcarnitine (LCAC), the product of the reaction catalyzed by M-CPT I. LCACs have been demonstrated to impair cardiac function through effects on cellular coupling, ion channel function, and sodium/potassium ATPase activity (36Yamada K.A. McHowat J. Yan G.X. Donahue K. Peirick J. Kleber A.G. Corr P.B. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Wu J. Corr P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1034-H1046PubMed Google Scholar, 38Corr P.B. Creer M.H. Yamada K.A. Saffitz J.E. Sobel B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previous studies (38Corr P.B. Creer M.H. Yamada K.A. Saffitz J.E. Sobel B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of LCAC accumulation in cells subjected to hypoxia prevents electrophysiologic derangements and improves cell survival. Given that CPT I catalyzes a rate-limiting step in mitochondrial FAO, down-regulation of M-CPT I expression would lead to a reduction of substrate flux into reactive oxygen species and LCAC-generating mitochondrial pathways. Hence, suppression of PPARα-mediated up-regulation of M-CPT I in response to LCFA may represent a naturally occurring cellular adaptation to reduce the production and accumulation of potentially toxic cellular metabolites during development and under diverse physiologic conditions. The results of our PPARα overexpression and EMSA experiments indicate that hypoxia alters PPARα/RXR DNA binding activity. Surprisingly, immunoblotting studies demonstrated that hypoxia has no effect on the nuclear levels of PPARα protein, rather it results in a significant reduction in the nuclear and whole cell levels of its obligate heterodimeric partner, RXRα. These results indicate that the observed reduction in PPARα-mediated activation of M-CPT I gene expression in the hypoxic cardiac myocyte occurs, at least in part, through decreased availability of RXR resulting in reduced formation of the heterodimeric functional transcriptional regulatory complex. In addition, we found that the 9-cis-RA-induced activity of a PPARα-independent RXR response element was abrogated by hypoxia. These findings suggest a mechanism whereby O2 levels, directly or indirectly, modulate the activity of the retinoid signaling pathway. This mechanism could be important not only for physiologic regulation of postnatal cardiac function but also during early cardiac development in which retinoid signaling likely plays a critical role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. Several mechanisms could be responsible for the reduction of nuclear RXRα protein levels following exposure to hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia could lead to redistribution of RXRα from the nucleus. However, we found that RXRα levels are reduced in both nuclear and whole cell fractions. Alternatively, hypoxia could cause reduced RXRα protein synthesis or increased degradation. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that ligand increases RXRα degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (33Nomura Y. Nagaya T. Hayashi Y. Kambe F. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Kopf E. Plassat J.-L. Vivat V. deThe H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We show here that the effects of hypoxia and 9-cis-RA are additive in reducing steady-state levels of RXRα indicating that the hypoxia effect is active even when RXR is engaged by ligand. Although we did not observe a direct effect of hypoxia on PPARα levels in cardiac myocytes, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional post-translational modifications of PPARα directly inhibit its transactivating properties. Our results suggest that the upstream events involved in the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of M-CPT I gene expression are independent of the well characterized HIF-1α pathway (39Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Other transcription factors, such as Sp1, AP-1, HNF-4, and NFκB, have also been implicated in the gene regulatory response to hypoxia (7Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Wu X. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Herein, we identify a potentially novel transcriptional regulatory pathway involved in the hypoxia response, alteration of nuclear receptor signaling. The results of our time course experiments indicate that in contrast to the rapid activation of the HIF-1 pathway, the levels of RXRα fall between 12 and 24 h after initiation of hypoxic exposure leading to a reduction in PPARα activity. This observation together with the results of the cobalt chloride experiments suggest that the effects of hypoxia on the activity of PPARα/RXR are mediated independent of the HIF-1 pathway. Given that the effects of hypoxia on RXR/PPAR activity is delayed, it is tempting to speculate that a secondary signaling pathway or the level of a regulatory cellular metabolite confers the downstream effect on transcriptional control. In summary, we have shown that the regulated expression of the gene encoding M-CPT I, a critical enzyme in the cardiac mitochondrial FAO pathway, is down-regulated following exposure to hypoxia via deactivation of PPARα/RXR. As ligand-activated transcription factors, PPARα and RXR are candidate targets for therapeutic strategies focused on preserving cellular function during hypoxic insults.

In order to identify PPARα-responsive human genes, HepG2 cells were engineered to express PPARα at concentrations similar to mouse liver. This resulted in the dramatic induction of mRNAs encoding the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase and increases in fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (3–8-fold) and carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase IA (2–4-fold) mRNAs that were dependent on PPARα expression and enhanced by exposure to the PPARα agonist Wy14643.

The effects of exposure include the proliferation of peroxisomes, hepatomegaly, and the development of carcinomas (1Nilsson R. Beije B. Préat V. Erixon K. Ramel C. Chem.-Biol.

Peroxisome proliferation follows the extensive induction of peroxisomal and microsomal enzymes that are involved in fatty acid oxidation, and it is thought that increased production of reactive oxygen species generated by these enzymes could contribute to the carcinogenicity of peroxisome proliferators seen in rats and mice. In contrast to sensitive species, guinea pigs and primates appear to be resistant to the adverse consequences of peroxisome proliferator exposure, whereas other species exhibit intermediate effects (5Bell A.R.

Unlike isolated hepatocytes and tumor-derived liver cell lines from rats and mice, human hepatocytes do not exhibit peroxisome proliferator-dependent peroxisome proliferation or induction of the peroxisomal and microsomal enzymes that contribute to fatty acid oxidation (7Brocard C.

In mice, the targeted disruption of the gene for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)1 prevents the pathological changes and carcinogenicity resulting from peroxisome proliferator exposure (11Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 12Peters J.M.

PPARα is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor to specific enhancer elements in target genes. Response elements for PPARα have been identified in the genes encoding the microsomal P450 ω-hydroxylases and components of the peroxisomal long chain fatty acid β-oxidation pathway including the long chain fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO1), the enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH1), and the 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (ACAA1) (reviewed in Ref. 13Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). These enzymes are induced >10-fold by peroxisome proliferators in rats and mice (reviewed in Ref. 14Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if these genes are regulated by PPARα in humans. Fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators are ligand agonists for PPARα (15Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 16Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), and there is increasing evidence that PPARα plays a central role in fatty acid homeostasis by regulating the degradation of fatty acids by mitochondrial as well as by peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in Ref. 13Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARα contributes to the maintenance of energy balance by regulating the expression of enzymes that participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and the formation of ketone bodies from fatty acids in the fasted state (17Kersten S.

A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The potential role of PPARα in the regulation of mitochondrial capacity for fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in human liver has not been adequately addressed. Several studies indicate that the expression level of PPARα in human liver (20Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21Gervois P. Torra I.P. Chinetti G. Grotzinger T. Dubois G. Fruchart J.C. Fruchart-Najib J. Leitersdorf E. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1535-1549PubMed Google Scholar) is much lower than in mouse liver, and it has been suggested that this difference could contribute to the lack of peroxisome proliferation and subsequent pathologic effects. PPARα agonists are used therapeutically for lowering serum triglycerides, and these hypolipidemic effects observed in humans are known to be mediated by PPARα in other species (22Reisenbichler H. Eckl P.M. Mutat. Res. Fundam. Mol. Mech. Mutagen. 1993; 286: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PPARα in the regulation of at least some aspects of lipid metabolism in humans (3Gibson G.G. Toxicol. Lett. 1993; 68: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The differences between rodents and humans in response to peroxisome proliferator exposure could reflect differences between species in the spectrum of target genes regulated by PPARα. However, the identification of human target genes has been hampered by the lack of detectable PPARα-mediated responses in isolated human hepatocytes or in liver-derived cell lines. The present study was designed to test whether elevated expression of PPARα in the human hepatoma-derived cell line, HepG2, would unmask PPARα-responsive human genes. Several stable cell lines were generated by transfection of HepG2 cells with human PPARα expression vectors. HepG2 cells were selected because they have been studied extensively in relation to lipoprotein metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Although peroxisomes are present in HepG2 cells and can oxidize fatty acids, treatment with peroxisome proliferators does not induce peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in this cell line (8Chance D.S. Wu S.-M. McIntosh M.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Gibbons G.F. Khurana R. Odwell A. Seelaender M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1801-1808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of PPARα mRNA expression in HepG2 cells is roughly 3-fold lower than the values seen for human liver (20Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and transient transfection studies in HepG2 cells using reporter genes under the control of PPAR response elements (PPREs) indicate that significant peroxisome proliferator-dependent reporter expression is evident only when a PPARα expression vector is co-transfected with the reporter construct (20Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 24Mukherjee R. Jow L. Noonan D. McDonnell D.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Stable transformants expressing the mouse PPARα-E282G mutant were also generated. This mutant contains a glycine substitution for glutamate at position 282, which results in a significantly reduced ligand-independent transactivation relative to the wild type receptor (25Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar) and a reduced affinity for a number of ligands (15Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 26Causevic M. Wolf C.R. Palmer C.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, PPARα-E282G exhibits similar efficacy as the wild type when activated by PPARα agonists such as Wy14643 (25Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this mutant provides a clearer indication of peroxisome proliferator-dependent gene regulation than may be evident using wild-type human PPARα. The results presented here demonstrate that elevated expression of PPARα in HepG2 cells increases the expression of genes encoding several enzymes that catalyze branch points or rate-limiting steps in the utilization of fatty acids for the formation of ketone bodies. The PPARα-responsive human genes include the long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), carnitine palmitoyl acyl-CoA transferase 1A (CPT1A), and the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2). In contrast, the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, ACO1, and other components of this pathway do not appear to be affected by increased PPARα levels. HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit, Ft. Collins, CO). The human PPARα or mouse PPARα-E282G cDNAs were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The PPAR expression vectors and empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid were each transfected into HepG2 cells using a modified calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (27Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N.A. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies) was used at a final concentration of 500 µg/ml to select and maintain positive transformants. The cells were given fresh medium containing G418 every 2–3 days to ensure that an adequate active concentration of G418 was present in the culture medium. A microplate dilution technique was performed to purify transformants. In order to simplify the clone designations throughout, the following nomenclature has been used: hPPARα-expressing cell lines 251 and 252 are designated as hPPARα1 and hPPARα2, respectively. The mouse PPARα-E282G-expressing transformants 15 and 16-13 are designated as mPPARαG1 and mPPARαG2. The wild type HepG2 cells (not transfected) are designated as HepG2, and cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector that are resistant to G418 are designated as pcDNA throughout. Upper and lower oligonucleotides that had overlapping, complementary 3′-ends and that together encompassed nucleotides 1302–1440 of the reported promoter sequence for the human HMGCS2 gene (GenBankTM accession numberU81851) were annealed, extended, and amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting PCR fragment was gel-purified and inserted into the SmaI site of p19dLuc to generate the pLuc-HMGP reporter construct. For the reporter constructs containing mutations, pLuc-HMGM1 and pLuc-HMGM2, oligonucleotides containing specific mutations that disrupt either the putative PPAR A/T-rich binding site or the RXR binding site (Fig. 8A) were used as described above. The reporter construct containing the heterologous Herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, pLuc-TK-HMG, was generated by inserting annealed, complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the putative human HMGCS2 PPRE (upper strand, agctCTAAAACTGGGTCAAAGGGCTCAC; lower strand, agctGTGAGCCCTTTGACCCAGTTTTAG) into the HindIII site of pLuc-TK. Lowercase letters indicate single strand overhangs used for cloning. The mutant reporter construct pLuc-TK-HMGM was generated as above using the human HMGCS2 mutant element (Fig. 8 B). The authenticity of the constructs was verified by sequence analysis. The pLuc-TK-ACO-AB, pLuc-TK-Z, or pLuc-TK reporter constructs have been described previously (27Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N.A. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each luciferase reporter construct was transfected (2 µg/well for 24-well plates; 5 µg/well for six-well plates) into HepG2 cells, pcDNA control, or PPAR-transformed cell lines using a modified calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (27Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N.A. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase reporter construct (pCMV-β;CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was co-transfected (0.2 µg/well for 24-well plates or 0.5 µg/well for six-well plates) and used to monitor transfection efficiency. After 16–24 h of incubation with DNA, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with fresh medium containing 500 µg/ml G418 and either 50 µm Wy14643 or an equivalent volume of vehicle (EtOH) for another 20–24 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were then analyzed as described (27Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N.A. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity for each well was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity obtained from the same well. Triplicate transfections were carried out for each treatment in each independent transfection experiment, and at least three separate transfection experiments were performed for each cell line. HepG2 cells and pcDNA or PPAR transformants were each seeded into T75 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a cell density that would reach ∼60% confluence after overnight culture. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 50 µm Wy14643 or EtOH. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing Wy14643 or solvent alone after another 24 h. After exposure to drug for 48 h, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies) and trypsinized. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots, the trypsinized cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol. Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was included prior to sonication twice for 15 s each at 4 °C. The sonicated lysates were treated with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and following a 30-min incubation, they were first centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 10 min and then centrifuged at 235,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final supernatant was used for immunoblot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined with the Pierce BCA reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cell lysates (100 µg of protein/sample) were loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The level of PPARα expression was quantified by developing the transfer blot sequentially with rabbit anti-mouse PPARα (25Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar) and125I-labeled Protein A (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) prior to analysis using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For enzyme activity assays, trypsinized cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 µm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. Whole cell homogenate was obtained using a Radnoti glass wall tissue grinder (Radnoti, Monrovia, CA). After 20 up-down strokes, the homogenate was centrifuged at 550 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The resulting supernatant represents a “crude lysate” that was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activity in the crude lysate was determined by using palmitoyl coenzyme A ([1-14C]palmitoyl-labeled) (55 mCi/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemical, St. Louis, MO) as the substrate in the presence of 2 mm KCN as described by Lazarow (28Lazarow P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase activity in crude lysates was analyzed using the method described by Quant et al. (29Quant P.A. Tubbs P.K. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The buffer system used was modified to 50 mmTris, pH 8.2, and 1 mm EDTA rather than 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, with 10 mm MgCl2 in order to minimize the contribution of cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase activity (30Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3108-3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption coefficient of acetoacetyl-CoA is 3.6 × 103m−1cm−1 under these conditions. HepG2 cells and the stable transformants were cultured and treated with EtOH or 50 µm Wy14643 for 48 h as described above. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNAgents RNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and 10 µg of total RNA were utilized for reverse transcription using a combination of random and oligo(dT) primers (200 ng each) with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For PCR, specific primer sets were synthesized (Table I) and used for assessment of PPARα and PPARα target gene mRNA levels. As the predicted size of the amplified cDNAs (300–500 nucleotides) and theT m values for the primers were similar, uniform conditions were applied for the amplification of all cDNAs. The amplification conditions were as follows: one cycle of denaturing at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. This was followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The reaction products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Table IPCR primer sets for potential PPAR target genesGenesUpper primer1-ant, nucleotide position according to the accession number (from start to end of the primer).Lower primerAccession number1-bAccession number in GenBank™.ntntACAA1719–7391189–1209NM_001607.1ACO11205–12251561–1587X71440ACO21330–13501713–1733NM_003500.1ACS1207–12251576–1596D10040ApoAI20–40427–448M27875ApoAII22–44380–401M29882ApoCIII98–117444–463M28614CPT1A1947–19692352–2378NM_001876.1CPT1B1918–19412326–2350NM_004377CYP4A11242–265692–716L04751ECH11500–15201991–2011NM_001966.1FABP131–52325–345M10617GAPDH201–224876–899NM_002046HMGCS2745–7661115–1136NM_005518MCAD1-cMCAD, mitochondrial medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.914–9351243–1264M16827ME11-dME1, cytosolic malic enzyme.637–658972–993L34035SCD11-eSCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1.880–9041287–1311AF0975141-a nt, nucleotide position according to the accession number (from start to end of the primer).1-b Accession number in GenBank™.1-c MCAD, mitochondrial medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.1-d ME1, cytosolic malic enzyme.1-e SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1. Open table in a new tab PCR-amplified cDNA fragments corresponding to PPARα and target genes were subcloned into pBS-KS(+), sequenced to confirm their authenticity, and used to generate antisense riboprobes. The human β-actin probe used as an internal control has been described previously (20Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The region that is spanned by each riboprobe corresponds to the primer set location as listed in Table I. Transcription was carried out in the presence of [32P]CTP (20 mCi/ml, 800 Ci/mmol) using either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following in vitro transcription, the reaction mixture was electrophoresed through 5% acrylamide, 6 m urea gels, and the probes were retrieved from gel slices with elution buffer (RPAII kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). For hybridization, 10 µg (target genes) or 20 µg (PPARα) of total RNA were combined with 4 × 104 cpm of gel-purified specific probe and 2 × 104 cpm of β-actin probe that was generated at a lower specific content. The samples were incubated at 42 °C for 18 h and then subjected to RNase digestion for 45 min at 37 °C using a 33-fold dilution of RNase A/RNase T1 mix (RPAII kit; Ambion). Protected fragments were separated on 5% acrylamide, 6 m urea gels and analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Escherichia coli lysates containing expressed mPPARα and RXR-MBP (31Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16114-16121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) were analyzed for binding to32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides by EMSA as previously described (27Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N.A. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When supershift assays were performed, 1 µl of anti-mPPARα serum or preimmune serum was added to the reaction. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide (37.5:1) gel containing 0.5× TBE and 1.25% glycerol, and the samples were electrophoresed at 16 mA for 100 min at room temperature. The dried gel was analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, model SI. HepG2 cells were transfected with either the pcDNA3.1 expression vector or with the vector harboring the cDNA for either hPPARα or mPPARα-E282G. The PPARα transformants were enriched by G418 selection. Several cell lines were cloned from pools of hPPARα transformants by dilution in microplates. Individual wells of the microplate were examined microscopically to identify those containing single cells that were then expanded to produce cloned cell lines. The level of transactivation of a luciferase reporter construct containing the PPRE from the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene and the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, pLuc-TK-ACO-AB, provided an initial assessment of increased PPARα expression levels in each cell line. Several stable lines that exhibited significant transactivation of the transiently transfected reporter relative to both HepG2 and pcDNA controls were selected for further analysis. The results of the transient transfection assay for two examples of human PPARα clones are shown in Fig. 1. Both of the hPPARα transformants exhibit relatively strong ligand-independent transactivation of the transiently transfected reporter construct, which is consistent with the phenotype exhibited by the human receptor in transient co-transfection assays with the reporter (20Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This transactivation is enhanced by roughly 2-fold or less when Wy14643, a PPARα agonist, is included in the culture medium. No effect is seen for the reporter construct lacking the PPRE, pLuc-TK. A significantly lower ligand-independent transactivation of the reporter construct is evident for mPPARαG1 cells; however, these cells exhibit similar levels of ligand-dependent activation of reporter transcription to those seen for the hPPARα transformants (Fig. 1). As a result, Wy14643 treatment of the mPPARαG1 cells elicits a 30-fold response in the expression of the reporter compared with the roughly 2-fold or lower ligand-dependent responses seen for the hPPARα transformants. These differences are consistent with the results of previous comparisons between the mutant and wild-type PPAR phenotypes (25Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar). PPARα protein is readily detected by immunoblotting in those cell lines stably expressing PPARα (Fig. 2). In contrast, PPARα was not detected under these conditions using equivalent amounts of protein lysate from the control cells or from human liver. The amount of protein detected by immunoblotting in the hPPARα and mPPARαG transformants is similar to that seen for equivalent amounts of protein lysate prepared from mouse liver. Peroxisome proliferators have been shown to regulate the expression of HMGCS2, CPT1A, and ACS in other species (32Brady P.S. Marine K.A. Brady L.J. Ramsay R.R. Biochem.

We examined the cell-adhesive and integrin-mediated signaling activities of laminin-10/11 in comparison to fibronectin, the best characterized extracellular adhesive ligand. We found that laminin-10/11 are more active than fibronectin in promoting cell migration and preferentially activate Rac, not Rho, via the p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 pathway. Cells adhering to fibronectin develop stress fibers and focal contacts, whereas cells adhering to laminin-10/11 do not, consistent with the high cell migration-promoting activity of laminin-10/11. Pull-down assays of GTP-loaded Rac and Rho demonstrated the preferential activation of Rac on laminin-10/11, in contrast to the activation of Rho on fibronectin. Activation of Rac by laminin-10/11 was associated with the phosphorylation of p130Cas and an increased formation of a p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 complex. Cell migration on laminin-10/11 was suppressed by the expression of either a dominant-negative Rac or CrkII mutants defective in p130Casor DOCK180 binding.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 2Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), assembly of which is regulated by the Rho family of GTPases. Activation of Rho induces the bundling of actin filaments into stress fibers and the clustering of integrins into focal contacts; activation of Cdc42 or Rac results in the formation of long, thin actin-containing extensions called filopodia and curtain-like extensions called lamellipodia, respectively (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). The ligation of integrins triggers a multitude of signaling events, including activation of tyrosine kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p130Cas, and paxillin. This cascade leads to the formation of signaling complexes by the coupling of signaling molecules with adaptor proteins containing SH2 and/or phosphotyrosine binding domains (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 2Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). FAK plays a central role in integrin-mediated signal transduction through its association with Src family kinases, p130Cas, Shc, Grb2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (4Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). p130Cas couples to FAK through an SH3 domain and to CrkII through a tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate domain. The p130Cas-CrkII complex has been shown to serve as a molecular switch regulating integrin-mediated cell spreading and migration over an ECM-coated substratum through coupling with DOCK180, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac (5Klemke R.L.

Src family kinases are the major protein tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate FAK, p130Cas, and other signaling proteins; tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is eliminated in cells with the triple mutation of the Src, Yes, and Fyn kinases (8Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). There are more than 20 different integrin types, each having distinct ligand binding specificities. Gene knockout studies demonstrate that different integrin types have unique, irreplaceable functions, vascular defects in α5 integrin-null mice and epithelial defects in α3 or α6 integrin-null mice (9Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, most studies of integrin-mediated signaling events have been performed on cells adhering to fibronectin (FN) through α5β1 integrin. The signaling events transduced by other integrin types remain unclear, particularly those containing α3- or α6-subunits that bind to laminins. In addition, it is also not known how these signals differ from those transduced by α5β1 integrin. Laminins are the major components of the basement membrane. Cells bind directly to laminins via a subset of integrins and other non-integrin-type receptors, such as dystroglycans. All laminins are composed of an α, β, and γ chain. At least 12 members of the laminin family have been identified, each composed of a distinct combination of heterotrimers (10Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 11Aumailley M. Smyth N. J. Anat. 1998; 193: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are those containing α5 chain, as embryos lacking the laminin α5 chain die late in embryogenesis without anterior neural tube closure or digit septation (13Miner J.H. Cunningham J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The laminin α5 gene is expressed in fetal and adult tissues, including the kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, skin, and intestine (14Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,15Sorokin L.M. Pausch F. Frieser M. Kroger S. Ohage E. Deutzmann R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These results suggest the α5-containing laminins, laminin-10 (α5β1γ1) and laminin-11 (α5β2γ1), have important roles in development and establishment of tissue architecture. Recently, we purified laminin-10/11 (LN-10/11) from the conditioned medium of A549 human lung carcinoma cells to find that the α3β1 integrin is the preferred receptor for LN-10/11, although α6β1 integrin serves as another LN-10/11 receptor in fibroblastic cells (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms governing cell behavior on LN-10/11 and the signals transduced by α3β1 and other cognate integrins, however, remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the integrin-mediated signaling events resulting from adhesion to LN-10/11, compared against those from FN. LN-10/11 preferentially activate Rac, but not Rho, through an α3β1 integrin-dependent pathway involving a p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 complex, thereby strongly promoting cell migration through enhanced lamellipodia formation. FN, however, preferentially activates Rho, leading to enhanced stress fiber and focal contact formation. A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and ECV304 human endothelia-derived cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The MKN45 human gastric carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Rac, CrkII, phosphotyrosine (PY20), paxillin, FAK, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20) antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against p130Cas, DOCK180, and Rho were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mAb against the human α6 integrin subunit (GoH3) was obtained from Cosmo Bio (Tokyo, Japan). mAbs against integrin αv and β4 (ASC-8) were purchased from Telios Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA) and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. The mAbs against α3 (3G8), α5(5G10), and β1 (4G2) integrins were produced and characterized in our laboratory (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J.

The FITC-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody to mouse IgG was purchased from Cappel (West Chester, PA). LN-10/11 were purified to homogeneity from conditioned media of A549 cells as described previously (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The 5D6 mAb, recognizing human laminin α5 chain, was used for immunoaffinity chromatography (19Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17550-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Silver staining and immunoblotting with a panel of mAbs specific for individual laminin α chains verified that the purified LN-10/11 lacked other laminin isoforms (19Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17550-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). LN-5 was purified from the conditioned media of MKN45 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography using an anti-laminin γ2 chain antibody (20Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The pcDNA-CrkII expression plasmid, generated by transferring the CrkII cDNA insert from pCEFL-GST-CrkII to pcDNA-3.1 after BamHI andNotI digestion, was the gift of Drs. Takahisa Takino and Kenneth Yamada (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). The CrkII N-terminal SH3 mutant (CrkII-SH3M) and SH2 mutant (CrkII-SH2M) were generated by the substitution of leucine for tryptophan 169 and arginine 38, respectively, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The expression plasmid for the dominant-negative RacAsn-17 was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Yamada (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). The puromycin resistance plasmid pHA262pur was provided by Dr. Hein te Riele (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). The expression plasmids for GST-RB (a fusion protein of glutathioneS-transferase to the Rho-binding domain of bovine Rho kinase) and GST-CRIB (a fusion protein of glutathioneS-transferase to the Cdc42/Rac interactive-binding domain of PAK1) were kindly provided by Dr. Kozo Kaibuchi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan). Thirty µg of each expression plasmid were co-transfected with 5 µg of pHA262Puro into 3 × 106 A549 cells by electroporation at 170 V and 960 microfarads with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. To increase expression of transfected genes, 5 mm sodium butyrate was included in the culture media. Cells were subcultured at a 1:3 dilution 12 h after transfection and maintained for 48 h in 1 µg/ml puromycin-containing medium. Before use, cells were cultured overnight in the absence of puromycin. Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described previously (20Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Suspended A549 cells were incubated with anti-integrin mAbs (anti-α3, α5, α6, αv, β1, and β4) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following washing, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Twenty four hours after serum starvation, A549 cells with or without transfected plasmids were detached from culture flasks by treatment with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA, washed with serum-free DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and resuspended in the same medium. Cells were kept in suspension for 60 min at 37 °C on a rotator. 2 × 106 cells were allowed to spread on 60-mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 nm of LN-10/11 or 20 nm of FN for 30 min. Following washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were solubilized in 600 µl of 1% Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated from the lysates using a combination of 3 µg of specific mAbs and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were suspended in reducing or nonreducing sample buffer, heated to 100 °C for 3 min, resolved on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots for phosphotyrosine, FAK, p130Cas, CrkII, DOCK180, or other epitopes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A549 cells were serum-starved overnight, detached in trypsin/EDTA, and kept in suspension in DMEM with 1% BSA for 90 min. Cells were plated on dishes coated with indicated concentrations of LN or FN. At the times indicated, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated with either 30 µg of GST-CRIB or GST-RB for 60 min at 4 °C with 30 µl of glutathione-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and then resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, the membranes were immunoblotted using anti-Rac mAb or polyclonal anti-Rho antibody. Whole cell lysates were also directly immunoblotted for the levels of total Rac or Rho for normalization. A549 cells were replated on 50-mm glass microwell dishes (Matsunami, Co., Osaka, Japan) coated with either LN-10/11 (5 nm) or FN (20 nm) in serum-free DMEM and blocked with 1% BSA. Thirty minutes post-replating, the medium was changed to that containing 1% FBS with or without 10 µg/ml antibodies as indicated. Cell migration was then monitored using a Zeiss S-25 inverted microscope. Video images were collected with a CCD camera at 20-min intervals using the Image-Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD). The positions of nuclei were tracked to quantify cell motility. Velocities were calculated in micrometers per 8 h using the same software. Glass coverslips were coated with LN (10 nm) or FN (40 nm) in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 1% BSA. A549 cells were serum-starved overnight and then replated on the coverslips by incubating for 1 h in DMEM containing 1% BSA. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Focal adhesions were visulized by incubating cells with mouse anti-paxillin antibody, following an incubation with FITC-conjugated rabbit antibody specific for mouse IgG. Actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Our previous studies demonstrate that LN-10/11 are very potent cell-adhesive proteins capable of utilizing both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins as major surface receptors (17Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesion of A549 cells onto LN-10/11, however, depends predominantly on α3β1 integrin (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy is due to the marginal expression level of α6β1 integrin in A549 cells, as opposed to a high expression level of α3β1 integrin (Fig. 1). Integrin α5β1, the major receptor for FN, was expressed at lower levels than α3β1 on A549 cells. Consistent with the relative expression of α3β1 and α5β1integrins, the maximal level of A549 cell adhesion was attained at lower coating concentrations of LN-10/11 than FN (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In our cell adhesion assays, the degree of A549 cell adhesion to substrates was comparable and close to the maximal level when coated with either 5 nm LN-10/11 or 20 nm FN. Unless otherwise specified, therefore, we have compared cellular responses to LN-10/11 and FN at these coating concentrations. We compared the activity of LN-10/11 and FN to promote cell migration using time-lapse video microscopy (Fig.2). The migration of A549 cells was significantly faster on LN-1oin the migration of A549 cells on LN-10/11, we examined the effects of function-blocking antibodies against α3, α6, and β1integrin chains on A549 cell migration. Anti-α3 and anti-β1 antibodies, but not anti-α6antibody, inhibited cell migration on LN-10/11 (Fig. 2). These results were consistent with previous observations that the attachment of A549 cells on LN-10/11 was inhibited by anti-α3, but not anti-α6, antibodies (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The adhesive interaction of A549 cells with LN-10/11, therefore, is largely dependent on α3β1 integrin. To explore differences in signals transduced from LN-10/11 and FN, we examined the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of focal contacts in A549 cells adhering to either LN-10/11 or FN. Actin reorganized into microfilament bundles in cells spread on FN, although the cells plated on LN-10/11 contained short, thin actin filaments forming lamellipodia at the cell periphery (Fig. 3 A). Clear focal contacts, visualized using an anti-paxillin antibody, were detected in cells spread on FN but not on LN-10/11. We extended this observation to other cell types by examining the actin cytoskeleton and focal contact formation in ECV304 cells (Fig. 3 B). These cells, when adhered to FN, demonstrated well organized actin stress fibers and clear focal contacts; cells spread on LN-10/11 contained thin, short actin filaments arranged circumferentially without clear focal contacts. Cytoskeletal reorganization associated with cell spreading is regulated by the Rho family of small GTPases. Rho activation controls the assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions; activation of Cdc42 and Rac results in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (21Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). To examine the differential activation of Rac and Rho by LN-10/11 and FN, the quantities of GTP-loaded Rac and Rho were determined by pull-down assays, based on their specific binding to the GST-CRIB (a fusion protein containing the Cdc42/Rac-binding domain of PAK1) and GST-RB (a fusion protein containing Rho-binding domain of Rho kinase). Serum-starved A549 cells were detached and kept in suspension for 90 min and then replated on either LN-10/11 or FN-coated dishes. The level of GTP-bound Rho was significantly elevated on FN as early as 10 min (Fig.4 A). Only a marginal increase in the level of GTP-Rho was observed in cells adhering to LN-10/11. In contrast, a significant increase in Rac activation was observed in cells adhering to LN-10/11, not FN. The complementary profiles of Rho and Rac activation on FN and LN-10/11 were preserved even at higher ligand coating concentrations (Fig. 4 B), indicating that signals transduced from FN and LN-10/11 are distinct in their activation of Rho family GTPases. The activation of integrins upon cell adhesion to the ECM leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of FAK and p130Cas (22Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). To explore the differences in the signaling pathways mediated by LN-10/11 and FN, we examined the phosphorylation of FAK and p130Casin A549 cells plated on either FN, LN-10/11, or LN-5. LN-5 was included as a control ligand binding to α3β1integrin (20Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Lampe P.D. Nguyen B.P. Gil S. Usui M. Olerud J. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the phosphorylation of FAK and p130Cas increased in cells adhering to these proteins, FAK phosphorylation levels were much higher on FN than on LN-10/11 or LN-5 (Fig. 5 A). Conversely, the level of p130Cas phosphorylation was higher on LN-10/11 and LN-5 than on FN (Fig. 5 B). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that the ratio of phosphorylated FAK to phosphorylated p130Cas in the cells spread on FN was two times greater than in cells plated on either LN-10/11 or LN-5 (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that LN-10/11 and FN activate distinct integrin-mediated signaling pathways. The association of p130Cas with the adaptor protein CrkII is important in cell migration over the ECM (5Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation promotes the coupling of p130Cas to CrkII, in turn coupling to downstream effectors such as DOCK180 (6Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased p130Cas phosphorylation on LN-10/11 is associated with increased formation of the p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 complex and subsequent Rac activation, we transfected either the wild-type CrkII or its N-terminal SH3 mutant form (CrkII-SH3M) together with the puromycin selection plasmid into A549 cells. The mutant CrkII is defective in the coupling to downstream effectors. After selection with puromycin for 2 days, the surviving cells were starved in medium containing 0.2% serum for 24 h. CrkII was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-CrkII, followed by immunoblotting with either anti-p130Cas or anti-DOCK180. In wild-type CrkII transfectants, both p130Cas and DOCK180 were associated with CrkII in cells adhering to LN-10/11 (Fig.6). Only marginal amounts of p130Cas and DOCK180 were associated with CrkII in cells adhering to FN, suggesting that LN-10/11 preferentially enhance the formation of the p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 complex. Consistent with these results, DOCK180 was not immunoprecipitated in association with CrkII from cells expressing the CrkII SH3 mutant, even though the association of p130Cas with CrkII was unaffected. These results confirm that the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII is essential for DOCK180 binding (6Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). DOCK180 activates Rac through binding to the CrkII-p130Cas complex (6Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The CrkII SH3 mutant cannot associate with DOCK180; therefore, we examined the inhibition of Rac activation by the CrkII SH3 mutant upon plating transfected cells on LN-10/11. The levels of GTP-bound Rac in the presence of LN-10/11 were elevated in cells transfected with wild-type CrkII; this activation was blocked in cells transfected with the CrkII SH3 mutant (Fig.7, A and C). In contrast, Rho activation after plating cells on FN was not affected by expression of the CrkII SH3 mutant (Fig. 7, B andD). These results suggest that, in A549 cells, LN-10/11 activate Rac through the p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 pathway. To confirm the involvement of CrkII in cell migration on LN-10/11-coated substrates, A549 cells were transfected with either a dominant-negative Rac (RacAsn-17) or CrkII SH2 and SH3 mutants, each defective in coupling to p130Cas or DOCK180, respectively. We measured the migration of these transfectants over LN-10/11-coated substrates using time-lapse video microscopy. Under the condition where the levels of expression of wild-type and mutant CrkII were comparable and 4–6-fold greater than that of endogenous CrkII (Fig.8 B), transfection of either the CrkII SH2 or SH3 mutant reduced cell migration to 50 and 53% of control cells transfected with a puromycin resistance plasmid alone, respectively, although transfection of wild-type CrkII had little effect on cell migration (Fig. 8 A). Incomplete inhibition of cell migration by transfection of CrkII SH2 or SH3 mutants may result from the presence of other signaling pathways regulating integrin- and growth factor-mediated cell migration like the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (24Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 25Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E.H. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant-negative Rac also reduced cell migration on LN-10/11 to 45% of control cells, confirming that Rac activation plays a crucial role in cell migration over LN-10/11. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of cell spreading and migration over LN-10/11 with an emphasis on integrin-mediated signaling pathways. By using transfection of wild-type or dominant-negative signaling molecules together with biochemical analyses, we found that LN-10/11 and FN have distinct effects on cell spreading and migration as summarized in Fig. 9. LN-10/11 induce the formation of protrusive structures such as membrane ruffles and lamellipodia; FN enhances the formation of actin stress fibers and focal contacts. Consistent with these morphological distinctions, LN-10/11 are more potent than FN in promoting cell migration. LN-10/11 preferentially activate Rac, not Rho, whereas Rho, not Rac, is activated by FN. Rac activation is required for cell migration on LN-10/11, since cell migration is down-regulated in cells overexpressing a dominant-negative RacAsn-17. Rac activation on LN-10/11 is mediated by the p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 pathway since (a) p130Cas is preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells adhering to LN-10/11 as compared with cells adhering to FN; (b) the association of CrkII with p130Cas and DOCK180 is enhanced in cells adhering to LN-10/11, not FN; and (c) LN-10/11-mediated Rac activation is abolished by overexpression of a CrkII SH3 mutant. Both CrkII SH2 and SH3 mutants, as well as RacAsn-17, inhibit cell migration on LN-10/11, indicating that LN-10/11 promote cell migration by preferential activation of Rac through the p130Cas-CrkII-DOCK180 pathway. Ligand binding to integrins activates intracellular signaling cascades, which regulate various cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization and cell proliferation and differentiation. Up to 25 integrin αβ heterodimers have been identified; the α5β1 integrin has been most extensively studied as a model for integrin signaling through its specific interaction with FN, a well characterized ECM ligand conta"

https://openalex.org/W2118300139,"The interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix regulates cell adhesion and motility. Here we demonstrate that different cell types adhere and spread when cultured in serum-free medium on immobilized galectin-8, a mammalian β-galactoside-binding protein. At maximal doses, galectin-8 is equipotent to fibronectin in promoting cell adhesion and spreading. Cell adhesion to immobilized galectin-8 is mediated by sugar-protein interactions with integrins, and galectin-8 triggers integrin-mediated signaling cascades including Tyr phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Cell adhesion is potentiated in the presence of Mn2+, whereas it is interrupted in the presence of soluble galectin-8, integrin β1 inhibitory antibodies, EDTA, or thiodigalactoside but not by RGD peptides. Furthermore, cells readily adhere onto immobilized monoclonal galectin-8 antibodies, which are equipotent to integrin antibodies in promoting cell adhesion. Cell adhesion to immobilized galectin-8 is partially inhibited by serum proteins, suggesting that complex formation between immobilized galectin-8 and serum components generates a matrix that is less supportive of cell adhesion. Accordingly, cell motility on immobilized galectin-8 readily takes place in the presence of serum. Truncation of the C-terminal half of galectin-8, including one of its two carbohydrate recognition domains, largely abolishes its ability to modulate cell adhesion, indicating that both carbohydrate recognition domains are required to maintain a functional form of galectin-8. Collectively, our findings implicate galectin-8 as a physiological modulator of cell adhesion. When immobilized, it functions as a matrix protein equipotent to fibronectin in promoting cell adhesion by ligation and clustering of cell surface integrin receptors. In contrast, when present in excess as a soluble ligand, galectin-8 (like fibronectin) forms a complex with integrins that negatively regulates cell adhesion. Because of its dual effects on the adhesive properties of the cells and its association with fibronectin, galectin-8 might be considered a novel type of matricellular protein."
https://openalex.org/W2002315028,"Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) has been identified and measured in different stages of Trypanosoma cruzi. Millimolar levels (in terms of Piresidues) in chains of less than 50 residues long, and micromolar levels in chains of about 700–800 residues long, were found in different stages of T. cruzi. Analysis of purified T. cruzi acidocalcisomes indicated that polyPs were preferentially located in these organelles. This was confirmed by visualization of polyPs in the acidocalcisomes using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. A rapid increase (within 2–4 h) in the levels of short and long chain polyPs was detected during trypomastigote to amastigote differentiation and during the lag phase of growth of epimastigotes (within 12–24 h). Levels rapidly decreased after the epimastigotes resumed growth. Short and long chain polyP levels rapidly decreased upon exposure of epimastigotes to hypo-osmotic or alkaline stresses, whereas levels increased after hyperosmotic stress. Ca2+ release from acidocalcisomes by a combination of ionophores (ionomycin and nigericin) was associated with the hydrolysis of short and long chain polyPs. In agreement with these results, acidocalcisomes were shown to contain polyphosphate kinase and exopolyphosphatase activities.

Some of these approaches are oriented toward the identification of biochemical pathways that allow survival of the parasite and are absent in the host. An unusual characteristic of T. cruzi in comparison with mammalian cells is the storage of calcium in acidic organelles that have been termed acidocalcisomes (2Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol.

Although volutin granules were first described almost 100 years ago (13Meyer A. Bot.

Our results indicate that the concentration of polyPs changes drastically during growth and differentiation of these parasites and that polyPs are rapidly mobilized under osmotic or alkaline stresses. Also, Ca2+release from acidocalcisomes is associated with hydrolysis of polyP. The enzymatic activities required for these rapid changes, polyP kinase and exopolyphosphatase, are present in the acidocalcisomes. The rapid mobilization of Ca2+ and polyP from acidocalcisomes suggests a critical role for these organelles in the adaptation of the parasite to environmental changes.

Cells (1 × 107–1 × 108) were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and treated with methods to extract either long chain or short chain polyP. Different samples were used for each method. Long chain polyP extraction was performed as described by Ault-Richéet al. (17Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.-M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For short chain polyP extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4(2 ml/g of wet weight of cells). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 0.72 mKOH/0.6 m KHCO3. Precipitated KClO4was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the extracted supernatant was used for polyP determination. E. coli strain CA38 pTrcPPX1 is an insertionally inactivated mutant for endogenous polyphosphate kinase and exopolyphophatase (18Crooke E. Akiyama M. Rao N.N. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) induced the production of rPPX1. After incubation for 6 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g for 15 min). The cells were resuspended in Buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 20 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with 2 mg lysozyme/ml) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Then, the cells were sonicated (three times for 20 s at 20% intensity in a Branson sonifier, model 102c). The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 45,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a HisBindTM column that was equilibrated with Buffer I, and the column was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer I. Proteins were eluted with sequential additions of Buffer I containing 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mm imidazole and equilibrated with Buffer I. Exopolyphosphatase activity was determined as in the analysis of polyP (see below), using 0.6 mg/ml of polyP 15. PPX1 was eluted with Buffer containing 50–100 mm imidazole, and the purity of the enzyme, estimated by SDS-PAGE, was over 95%. PolyP levels were determined from the amount of Pi released upon treatment with an excess of rPPX1. Aliquots of long or short chain polyP extracts (always less than 1.5 nmol) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 60 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6.0 mm MgCl2, and 3000–5000 units of purified rPPX1 in a final volume of 75 µl. One unit corresponds to the release of 1 pmol of Pi/min at 37 °C. rPPX1 has been shown to be a powerful catalyst increasing the hydrolytic activity of a phosphoanhydride bond by 1011-fold and is active on both polyP3 and longer chain polyP, as detected by treatment of radiolabeled polyP (20Wurst H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10996-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of Pi was monitored by the method of Lanzetta et al. (21Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentrations of polyP in different stages of T. cruzi were calculated from the respective cell volumes reported before (22Rangel-Aldao R. Allende O. Triana F. Piras R. Henriquez D. Piras M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These values correspond to 30 µl/109 epimastigotes and 12 µl/109amastigotes or trypomastigotes. Urea-polyacrylamide gels were prepared and stained with toluidine blue as previously described (23Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Marker polyPs were obtained by electrophoresis of phosphate glass in 1.5% agarose gels. Four-mm-long gel slices were eluted by centrifugation trough Millipore Ultrafree-MC columns to obtain polyPs of different sizes. The markers were localized by toluidine blue staining, and their size was calculated by calibration with commercial polyPs (Sigma). Epimastigotes (2 × 107 cells) obtained at the exponential phase of growth were harvested by centrifugation; washed with 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 0.8 mm Mg SO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; and resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with [32P]Pi (0.02 mCi/ml) and 50 mm NaH2PO4. After incubation for 60 min at 28 °C, the parasites were washed twice in the same buffer without [32P]Pi. Total poly P (short and long chain) extraction was performed as described by Kumble and Kornberg (23Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107) obtained as described above (5Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol.

The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer, and 45 µl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 µg of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/ml. After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed with an Olympus model BX-60 epifluorescence microscope. Acidocalcisomal fractions (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with DAPI as described above. Olympus WIG (excitation, 500–520 nm; emission, >580 nm) and Olympus WU (excitation, 380–385 nm; emission, >420) filters were used for polyP and DNA detection, respectively. The images were recorded with a charge-coupled device camera (model CH250; Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) and IPLab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA) as described previously (24Lu H.-G. Zhong L. Chang K.-P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9464-9473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes (1 × 109) were washed once in Dulbecco's PBS; resuspended in prewarmed isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic medium; and incubated at 30 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn; quickly transferred to an isotonic buffer preequilibrated at 4 °C to stop the reaction, and centrifuged; and the polyP content of the pellets was quantified as described above. Isotonic medium (137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.5 mm K2HPO4, and 8.5 mm Na2HPO4) was 300 ± 5 mosm, hypotonic medium (half of these concentrations of salts) was 150 ± 4 mosm, and hypertonic medium (32 of these concentrations of salts) was 450 ± 6 mosm. All media contained, in addition, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 11 mm glucose, 1 mmCaCl2 and 0.8 mm MgSO4. Osmolarity of all solutions were checked with an Osmette S automatic osmometer (Precision Systems Inc., Sudbury, MA). For the alkaline or ionophore treatments, epimastigotes or amastigotes (2.5 × 108) were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in 0.55 ml of 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm Mg SO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). At the times indicated, 40 mm NH4Cl, 1 µm ionomycin or 1 µm nigericin was added. Aliquots of 50 µl were withdrawn at the times indicated and mixed with 500 µl of guanidine isothiocyanate lysis buffer (17Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.-M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for long chain polyP determination or with 300 µl of ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4 for short chain polyP determination as described above. Spectrofluorometric determinations of amastigotes loaded with fura 2/AM or BCECF/AM were performed as described previously (3Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem.

Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in Buffer A containing 0.1 mm PPi. ATP (1 mm) was then added, and the preparation was incubated for different times at 37 °C, after which 500 µl of guanidine isothiocyanate lysis buffer (for long chain polyP determination) or 300 µl of ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4 (for short chain polyP determination) was added, and polyP was extracted and quantified as described above. To investigate polyP hydrolysis, acidocalcisomes were suspended in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl at the pH values indicated under “Results.” The suspension was divided into two samples, and 1 mg/ml digitonin was added to one of them, whereas the other was kept as control. The suspension was then vortexed for about 1 min and kept on ice for 5 min to measure tetrapolyphosphatase activity in the presence of 0.1 mmtetrapolyphosphate using a phosphate release assay kit (5Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After the digitonin treatment, aliquots were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min to isolate the soluble content. The supernatant was collected and subjected to a second centrifugation step under the same conditions. Final supernatants and pellets were used for measurement of tetrapolyphosphatase activity at different pH and CaCl2 concentrations. Long and short chain polyP were present in the different stages of T. cruzi; values for short chain polyP were in the mmrange and considerably higher in epimastigotes, which have also mm amounts of long chain polyP. Levels of 3.1 ± 1.4, 25.5 ± 5.1, and 54.3 ± 0.3 mm (in terms of Pi residues and calculated taking into account the cell volumes indicated under “Experimental Procedures”) in chains of less than 50 residues long, and levels of 82.5 ± 5.75, 130 ± 15, and 2889 ± 294.5 µm in chains of about 700–800 residues long, were found in trypomastigotes, amastigotes, and epimastigotes, respectively. PolyPs extracted from different stages of T. cruzi were electrophoresed by 6% urea-PAGE to determine their size distribution (Fig. 1 A). Only one size class of polyP was detected in the three developmental stages: long chain polyP of about 700–800 residues. The lack of detection of other polyPs suggests that the short chain polyPs present in the different stages are too small to be recognized by toluidine blue (probably less than 5 residues) (25Lorenz B. Münkner J. Oliveira M.P. Leitão J.M. Müller W.E.G. Schröeder H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the presence of short chain polyPs, we labeled epimastigotes with [32P]Pi, and the polyPs were extracted and electrophoresed using 6% urea-PAGE. The results are shown in Fig.1 B. Under these conditions, labeled compounds that co-eluted with unlabeled commercial standards of polyP of about 5–15 Pi residues were obtained. This is consistent with our previous 31P NMR work (8Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Addition of a larger amount of material also permitted visualization of long chain polyP (around 700–800 residues) (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The subcellular localization of the large amounts of polyP present in the parasites was investigated using two different methods: first, by subcellular fractionation, and second, by cytochemical techniques. Subcellular fractionation of epimastigotes of T. cruzi revealed that more than 95% of the short and long chain polyPs were present in membrane fractions (10,000 × g pellet, TableI). To investigate whether polyPs were present in acidocalcisomes, we isolated these organelles from epimastigotes using an iodixanol (OptiPrep) density gradient (5Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Short and long chain polyPs were concentrated toward the bottom (dense end) of the gradient (fractions 23–24), with a smaller peak close to the upper part of the gradient (fractions 5–9) (Fig.2). Markers for other compartments all peaked further up the gradient in the region of fractions 5–9. As previously described, this middle peak also contains acidocalcisomes within ghosts of cells (26Rodrigues C. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the densest fractions (fractions 23 and 24) from the iodixanol gradients contained significant amounts (25 and 33%, respectively) of the total short and long chain polyPs recovered, which correlated well with the distribution of proton-translocating pyrophosphatase activity, an acidocalcisomal marker (4Scott D.A. de Souza W.

DAPI is a useful tool in the fluorometric analysis of DNA but can also be used to study polyPs (27Allan R.A. Miller J.J. Can. J.

PolyP shifts DAPI fluorescence to a higher wavelength, with a maximum at about 525 nm (27Allan R.A. Miller J.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 912-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This DAPI fluorescence change is specific for polyP and is not produced by PPi or other anions (results not shown and Ref. 28Tijssen J.P.F. Beekes H.W. Van Steveninck J. Biochim. Biophys.

Epimastigotes of T. cruzi incubated in solutions of DAPI (10 µg/ml) were mounted on slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy.

We examined the rate of dissociation of MutS from a mismatch using linear heteroduplex DNAs or heteroduplexes blocked at one or both ends by four-way DNA junctions in the presence and absence of MutL. In the presence of ATP, dissociation of MutS from linear heteroduplexes or heteroduplexes blocked at only one end occurs within 15 s. When both duplex ends are blocked, MutS remains associated with the DNA in complexes with half-lives of 30 min. DNase I footprinting of MutS complexes is consistent with migration of MutS throughout the DNA duplex region. When MutL is present, it associates with MutS and prevents ATP-dependent migration away from the mismatch in a manner that is dependent on the length of the heteroduplex. The rate and extent of mismatch-provoked cleavage at hemimethylated GATC sites by MutH in the presence of MutS, MutL, and ATP are the same whether the mismatch and GATC sites are incis or in trans.

The DNA mismatch repair pathway targets these mismatches for correction and contributes as much as 1000-fold to the overall fidelity of DNA replication (reviewed in Refs. 1Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar and 2Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The importance of this repair pathway is highlighted by the finding that mutations in mismatch repair genes segregate with the cancer predisposition syndromes hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and familial colorectal cancer (reviewed in Refs. 3Jiricny J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 4Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In addition, inactivation of mismatch repair genes by promoter methylation has been documented in some sporadic tumors (reviewed in Ref. 1Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Much of our current understanding of mismatch repair stems from studies of the Escherichia coli methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway where repair has been reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins (1Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 2Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). MutS recognizes and binds to seven of eight possible base pair mismatches as well as one to four unpaired bases. These mismatches arise by misincorporation of deoxynucleotides or template slippage, respectively. In addition to binding DNA, all MutS proteins have an intrinsic ATPase activity and are members of the ATP binding cassette transporter superfamily (5Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recognition of the mismatch by MutS triggers subsequent steps of mismatch repair in which MutS together with MutL protein and ATP activates an endonuclease, MutH, that cleaves a transiently unmethylated daughter strand at hemimethylated GATC sites, thereby conferring strand specificity on the repair process. The mismatch-provoked strand scission constitutes a point of entry for helicase II (UvrD) and exonucleases that excise the daughter strand in the region spanning the GATC site and the mismatch. Gap repair by polymerase III, single-strand binding protein, and DNA ligase complete the process. ATP binding and hydrolysis are essential for the function of MutS in MMR (reviewed in Ref. 1Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ATP-binding site of E. coli MutS give rise to a dominant negative mutator phenotype (6Wu T.-H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of MutS with MutL requires ATP (7Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mismatch-binding site and the ATP-binding site of MutS are separated by some 70 Å as revealed in the three-dimensional structures of Taq and E. coliMutS proteins (11Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W.

Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mismatch binding and nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are tightly linked. Nucleotide cofactor is involved in the allosteric regulation of DNA binding such that the affinity of some MutS proteins for mismatches is reduced in the presence of ATP, and the rate of ATP hydrolysis by MutS can be modulated by DNA binding (reviewed in Refs. 1Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar and 3Jiricny J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A critical problem in mismatch repair is understanding how binding to a mismatch by MutS triggers downstream repair events such as the activation of MutH endonuclease. In two models, migration of MutS away from the mismatch has been invoked in the search by MutS for enzymes involved in the excision step. In one model, the energy of ATP hydrolysis is used to fuel a unidirectional translocation of MutS away from the mismatch (8Allen D.W. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 14Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Support for this model derives, in part, from electron microscopic studies in which MutS is present at the base of α-loop structures. In an alternate model, binding of MutS to mismatched DNA provokes the exchange of ADP for ATP in the protein resulting in the transformation of MutS from a mismatch-binding protein to a sliding clamp that diffuses away from the mismatch in search of other repair proteins (15Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 16Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Both models are consistent with experiments demonstrating that in the presence of ATP MutS dissociates from the ends of a linear heteroduplex but remains associated with the DNA if the ends are physically blocked by biotin-streptavidin complexes. A weakness of these models is that neither model assigns a role for MutL in signaling downstream repair events. More recently, it has been shown that E. coli MutS together with MutL and ATP can activate MutH for cleavage at hemimethylated GATC sites intrans, i.e. when the mismatch and the hemimethylated GATC sites reside on different DNA molecules (11Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that MutS does not need to migrate from a mismatch to signal downstream repair steps. Here, we characterize the ATP-dependent migration of MutS protein away from a mismatch, and we investigate the effect of MutL on the rate of dissociation of MutS from a heteroduplex DNA. Whereas MutS dissociates rapidly from a mismatch in the presence of ATP unless DNA ends are blocked, in the presence of MutL, MutS remains stably bound to the mismatch DNA. Examination of MutH cleavage at hemimethylated GATC sites in the presence of MutS, MutL, and ATP reveals that intramolecular reactions (in cis) occur with the same efficiency as reactions in trans. These findings suggest that a MutS-MutL complex remains bound to DNA in the vicinity of the mismatch to activate downstream repair proteins. Taq MutS protein was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pETMutS as described previously (17Biswas I. Obmolova G. Takahashi M. Herr A. Newman M.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Mol.

Transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin to anA 600 of 0.5 and induced at 37 °C by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm. Cells were harvested after 3 h and resuspended in 35 ml/liter of culture of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and stored at −80 °C. Thawed cells were lysed by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and applied to a 5-ml metal ion chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with nickel ions. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 60 mmimidazole and eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mmimidazole. The buffer was exchanged by applying the eluted protein to a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 µg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, and 1:1000 dilution of saturated phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein was then applied to a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A and eluted in buffer A with increasing NaCl concentration. His6-tagged MutS eluted at 250–300 mm NaCl; MutL and MutH eluted at 120–150 mmNaCl. Protein fractions were brought to a 30% glycerol final concentration. Aliquots were stored at 4 °C for MutS and −20 °C for MutL and MutH. Proteins were judged to be 95% pure or greater by Coomassie staining after SDS-gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined using the theoretical extinction coefficient as follows: for MutS, 76,874 m−1cm−1; for MutL, 57,981m−1 cm−1; and for MutH, 38,845 m−1cm−1. Concentrations of proteins are those of dimers for MutS and MutL and monomers for MutH. Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized on a 394 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels or by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using an Oligo R3 column (Perspective Biosystems) followed by detritylation and chromatography on a C4 preparative scale column (Vydac). Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).N 6-Methyladenine phorphoramidites were purchased from Glen Research.

MutS was incubated with 1 nm 5′-32P-labeled duplex in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in 10 µl total volume. After 2 min at 37 °C for E. coli MutS and 65 °C for Taq MutS, 2 µl of 15% Ficoll (without dye) was added, and samples were loaded under voltage onto 5% native polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 5 mm MgCl2. After electrophoresis in the same buffer, gels were dried and quantitated on a Fuji BAS-1500 PhosphorImager. Data were analyzed as fraction boundversus protein concentration and were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to an equation for a simple two-state binding process (19Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 50 nm MutS dimer was incubated with 1 nm5′-32P-labeled DNA in binding buffer (as described above) in a total volume of 30 µl. Under these conditions the dissociation constant for heteroduplex DNA ranged from 1 to 16 nm, so the majority of DNA was bound. Reactions were incubated between 1 and 5 min on ice and then for 1 min at 37 °C for E. coli MutS and at 65 °C for Taq MutS. Immediately beforet = 0, an aliquot was removed, brought to 3% w/v Ficoll, and loaded onto a native 5% polyacrylamide gel under voltage as described above. At t = 0, 500 nmunlabeled heteroduplex DNA was added, and the reaction was brought to 1 mm ATP. After varying times aliquots were removed and electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel as described above. Half-lives of complexes were calculated from rate constants determined from the slope of ln (fraction bound) versus time. The fit to simple exponential decay of MutS-DNA complexes was supported by the linearity of semi-log plots. For reactions performed in the presence of purified IHF1 protein, kindly provided by Steve Goodman (20Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), it was included at a concentration of 65 nm. Where indicated, 100 nm MutL was present in the initial reaction or added at t = 0 along with the cold heteroduplex competitor. DNase I footprinting was performed in binding buffer with 1 nm of +1T bulge mismatch duplex, 5′-32P-labeled on the strand containing the unpaired T. MutS (either Taq or E. coli) was present at 50 nm, MutL at 100 nm, and ATP at 1 mmin a reaction volume of 20 µl. Complexes were preformed by incubation for 1–5 min at 21 °C followed by the addition of 1 unit of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions were terminated after 30 s by the addition of an equal volume of 50% formamide containing 50 mm EDTA. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min and analyzed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In cisreactions, the DNA substrate containing both a hemimethylated GATC site (5′-32P-labeled on the unmethylated strand) and the mismatch was incubated at a concentration of 1 nm with 10 nm MutS, 10 nm MutL, 10 nm MutH, 1 mm ATP, and 70 nm unlabeled 36-bp homoduplex DNA in binding buffer (as described above) in a final volume of 30 µl. Trans-reactions were carried out under identical conditions except that they contained 1 nm32P-labeled GATC duplex and 1 nm mismatch duplex in addition to the 70 nm homoduplex DNA. Aliquots were removed at various times and added to an equal volume of formamide and brought to 1% w/v SDS and 50 mm EDTA. Samples were heated to 90 °C and analyzed on 8% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and quantitated on a Fuji BAS-1500 PhosphorImager. The ATP-dependent translocation of MutS from a mismatch was studied using mismatch duplexes containing blocked ends. DNA duplexes, either perfectly base-paired (homoduplex) or containing a mismatch (heteroduplex), were engineered with four-way DNA junctions at both ends (see Fig. 1 A). The distance between junctions was 50 bp. Unlike duplexes blocked with streptavidin-biotin complexes used in previous studies, duplexes blocked with four-way junctions could be reproducibly generated in high yield. Linear heteroduplex or homoduplex DNAs without blocked ends were used for comparison. The rate of dissociation of E. coliMutS from mismatched DNAs in the presence and absence of ATP was determined in gel electrophoretic mobility assays. MutS was preincubated with 32P-labeled duplexes followed by the addition at time 0 of 1 mm ATP and a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled heteroduplex DNA to prevent rebinding by MutS. Aliquots were removed after varying lengths of time and electrophoresed on native polyacrylamide gels (see “Materials and Methods”). Half-lives were calculated from the slopes of semi-log plots of the fraction bound versus time. The presence of four-way junctions at both ends of the duplex greatly retarded the ATP-dependent dissociation of MutS from the DNA (Fig. 1, B and C, and TableI). Whereas ATP induced a rapid dissociation of MutS from linear DNA resulting in the loss of 80–90% of complexes within 15 s, MutS dissociated much more slowly when ends were blocked with four-way junctions. The half-lives of MutS-DNA complexes from the blocked versus unblocked substrate was 1800 s versus an upper limit of 8 s, respectively (Table I). Similar results were obtained with Thermus aquaticus (Taq) MutS protein (Table I). Blocking both ends of mismatch DNAs with three-way junctions yielded the same result (data not shown). Thus, branched DNA structures blocked the ATP-dependent dissociation of MutS from DNA.Table IEffect of nucleotides on the half-life of MutS-DNA complexesHalf-lives of MutS-DNA complexes (seconds) were determined from triplicate measurements, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Half-lives of MutS-DNA complexes (seconds) were determined from triplicate measurements, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the absence of ATP, MutS complexes were quite stable, and forE. coli MutS, the half-lives were 570 versus410 s for the doubly-blocked and unblocked heteroduplexes, respectively. In the case of Taq MutS, half-lives for the doubly-blocked and unblocked heteroduplexes were 170 and 120 s, respectively. The drop in the number of bound complexes observed upon the addition of competitor mismatch DNA, evident in the difference at the 0 versus 15-s time points (Fig. 1 C), represented the loss of nonspecifically bound MutS protein. The observation that MutS dissociated rapidly from linear duplexes while remaining associated with DNA when ends were blocked supports the notion that MutS migrates along the DNA helix in an ATP-dependent fashion. An examination of the relative binding affinities of MutS for blocked and unblocked duplexes established that E. coli andTaq MutS proteins have no specific affinity for the four-way DNA junction. Thus, the presence of four-way DNA junctions had no effect on the apparent K D values measured by polyacrylamide gel retardation assays in the case of either heteroduplex or homoduplex DNA substrates (TableII). In the case of Taq MutS, mismatch duplexes containing an unpaired thymidine were recognized about 1000 times better than homoduplexes. In the case of E. coli MutS, discrimination between heteroduplex and homoduplex DNA was substantially less, amounting to a 10-fold difference in relative affinities. Surprisingly, the presence of 1 mm ATP had little if any effect on the affinity of MutS for mismatch DNA, despite its huge effect on the stability of complexes reflected in the large increase in the rate of dissociation. Given the rate of ATP hydrolysis (17Biswas I. Obmolova G. Takahashi M. Herr A. Newman M.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), <5% of the ATP would be expected to be cleaved over the duration of the experiment making it unlikely that ADP was having any significant effect on observed binding. One explanation for this result is that binding of ATP greatly accelerates the rate of formation of stable MutS-mismatch complexes such that it is very rapid compared with ATP-dependent translocation (see also Ref. 8Allen D.W. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Additional experimentation will be required to understand the molecular basis for the apparent high affinity of MutS for mispairs in the presence of ATP given that ATP destabilizes MutS-mispair complexes.Table IIEffect of ATP and four-way DNA junctions on the binding affinity of MutSK D values in nm were measured using a polyacrylamide gel retardation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence and absence of 1 mm ATP. K D values in nm were measured using a polyacrylamide gel retardation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence and absence of 1 mm ATP. Complexes ofTaq MutS bound to doubly-blocked heteroduplexes were analyzed by DNase I footprinting in the absence and presence of ATP (Fig. 2A). In the absence of ATP, MutS protected about 10 bp on either side of the mismatch, as shown previously (21Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13355-13364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, the footprint was no longer confined to the mismatch but now extended throughout the region of the duplex between the two junctions. This result was consistent with movement being bi-directional, i.e. any given MutS dimer was capable of moving in both directions. Unidirectional translocation would predict that MutS would migrate to one end of the duplex and remain there. Since only 50 bp separated the two junctions and the DNase I footprint of MutS bound to a mismatch extends roughly 20 bp, the directionality of movement was further addressed using heteroduplexes blocked at only one end. The dissociation of MutS from heteroduplexes blocked by four-way junctions at either the left or the right end was monitored in polyacrylamide gel retardation assays as described above (Fig.2 B). If translocation were unidirectional and were equally likely to occur in either direction, then each substrate would remain half-bound. If translocation were unidirectional and occurred in only one direction, then one substrate would be fully bound, and the other substrate would be completely unbound. These predicted outcomes were derived from the enormous stability of MutS complexes on doubly-blocked duplexes with half-lives of 30 min as described above. Neither of these outcomes was observed. Instead, dissociation of MutS from singly-blocked duplexes was rapid and extensive and indistinguishable from that of unblocked duplexes. In the presence of ATP, 90% of bound complexes dissociated by 15 s (Table I). The simplest interpretation of these results is that, in the presence of ATP, MutS migrates away from the mismatch and can change direction. Similar results were obtained for the E. coli MutS protein (TableI), i.e. the rapid and extensive dissociation from singly-blocked duplexes was nearly identical to that observed for unblocked duplexes. These experiments also served as controls demonstrating that MutS is not interacting specifically with four-way DNA junctions. DNase I footprinting failed to detect any significant interaction of MutS with four-way junctions in the absence or presence of ATP. Additionally, the extremely rapid dissociation of MutS from singly-blocked duplexes in the presence of ATP demonstrated that the block to dissociation seen with double-blocked substrates was not due to irreversible binding of MutS to a four-way junction. To test whether a DNA-bound protein residing in the path of MutS would block the migration of MutS, we used integration host factor (IHF), an abundant protein involved in the condensation of the bacterial chromosome and in the initiation of DNA replication and integration of bacteriophage λ (reviewed in Ref. 22Nash H.A. Lin E.E.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 149-179Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to binding at sequence-specific, high affinity sites, much of the protein is bound to the genome nonspecifically due to the very high intracellular concentration of IHF, between 8 and 50 µm (23Yang S.-W. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6292-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Murtin C. Engelhorn M. Geiselmann J. Boccard F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The rate of dissociation of MutS from a heteroduplex DNA to which IHF was bound was assessed using three 110-bp DNA substrates containing the specific IHF-binding site H′ from bacteriophage λ at both ends, the left end, or neither end of the duplex (Fig.3). The kinetics of ATP-dependent MutS dissociation from mismatch DNAs was carried out as described above except that in all cases 65 nm IHF was included in the reaction. Based on DNA binding assays carried out with IHF protein (data not shown), ∼50% of the substrate with 2 IHF-binding sites was expected to be fully bound under these conditions. Higher concentrations of IHF were not used as they resulted in nonspecific binding. In the absence of ATP, dissociation from the three substrates was indistinguishable resulting in half-lives of several hundred seconds. In the presence of ATP, the bulk of MutS protein dissociated from the substrate with one or no IHF-binding sites by 15 s. In contrast, with 2 IHF sites more than 40% of the doubly-blocked substrate was bound by MutS, and the half-life of these complexes was increased at least 6-fold. Thus IHF bound to DNA posed a barrier to migration of MutS. Since a single IHF site posed no apparent block at all, E. coli MutS was not specifically interacting with IHF. As both MutS and MutL are required in the downstream activation of MutH, we investigated the effect of MutL on the ATP-dependent migration of MutS from a mismatch. As expected, in the presence of ATP, MutS alone dissociated very rapidly from a 110-bp duplex containing an u"
https://openalex.org/W2068995617,"We investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying arrhythmias in heart failure. A genetically engineered mouse lacking the expression of the muscle LIM protein (MLP−/−) was used in this study as a model of heart failure. We used electrocardiography and patch clamp techniques to examine the electrophysiological properties of MLP−/− hearts. We found that MLP−/− myocytes had smaller Na+currents with altered voltage dependencies of activation and inactivation and slower rates of inactivation than control myocytes. These changes in Na+ currents contributed to longer action potentials and to a higher probability of early afterdepolarizations in MLP−/− than in control myocytes. Western blot analysis suggested that the smaller Na+ current in MLP−/− myocytes resulted from a reduction in Na+ channel protein. Interestingly, the blots also revealed that the α-subunit of the Na+ channel from the MLP−/− heart had a lower average molecular weight than in the control heart. Treating control myocytes with the sialidase neuraminidase mimicked the changes in voltage dependence and rate of inactivation of Na+ currents observed in MLP−/−myocytes. Neuraminidase had no effect on MLP−/− cells thus suggesting that Na+ channels in these cells were sialic acid-deficient. We conclude that deficient glycosylation of Na+ channel contributes to Na+ current-dependent arrhythmogenesis in heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2076353777,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a regulator of the classical complement pathway C3 convertase (C4bC2a complex).

To elucidate the importance of the polymeric nature of C4BP and the structural requirements for the interaction between C4b and the α-chain, 19 recombinant C4BP variants were created.

C4b-binding protein complement control protein repeat monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Human C4b-binding protein (C4BP)1 is a high molecular mass (570 kDa) plasma glycoprotein that efficiently inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation. Apart from preventing the assembly of the C3-convertase (C4b2a complex), it also accelerates the natural decay of the complex (1Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, C4BP binds C4b and serves as a cofactor to the plasma serine protease factor I in the cleavage of C4b both in fluid phase and when C4b is deposited on cell surfaces (2Scharfstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). C4BP belongs to a gene family of related proteins named the regulators of complement activation, which also includes factor H, complement receptors 1 and 2, membrane cofactor protein, and decay accelerating factor (3Hourcade D. Liszewski M.K. Krych-Goldberg M. Atkinson J.P. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Each of the proteins of the regulators of complement activation family binds C4b and/or C3b and is important for the inhibition of the classical and/or alternative pathways of complement activation. All these proteins contain variable numbers of tandemly arranged domains, which are denoted complement control protein (CCP) repeats. These domains are cysteine-rich and ∼60 amino acid residues long, and each is composed of a hydrophobic core that is wrapped by β-strands (4Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The major form of C4BP in plasma consists of seven identical α-chains (eight CCPs each) and one β-chain (three CCPs), and all of the chains are linked together by disulfide bridges (2Scharfstein J.

We have recently localized the C4b binding site to the interface between CCP1 and CCP2 of the α-chain and identified a cluster of positively charged amino acids that are important for the binding (7Blom A.M.

The aim of the present study was to further characterize the structural requirements of C4BP for its binding to C4b and for its factor I cofactor activity. Recombinant C4BP lacking individual CCP domains and truncated monomeric C4BP variants were created and functionally characterized. The elongated conformation of α-chains and the fact that they are exclusively organized into repetitive, individually folding domains makes C4BP particularly suitable for this kind of studies. A total of 19 C4BP variants were studied, and based on their properties, we conclude that CCP2 and CCP3 are the most important domains, being crucial for binding of C4b and for the functional activity of C4BP. In addition, CCP1 was found to be important, as was the length of the linkers between the first four CCPs. Human plasma C4BP (11Dahlbäck B. Biochem.

C4b and C4BP were labeled with 125I using the chloramine T method. The specific activity was 0.4–0.5 MBq/µg of protein. Full-length cDNA encoding human C4BP α-chain was cloned to pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), a eucaryotic expression vector. This was used as template for the mutagenesis. To create monomeric, truncated C4BP variants, stop codons were introduced after Trp492 (CCP1–8), Lys433 (CCP1–7), Gly375 (CCP1–6), Glu313 (CCP1–5), Glu248 (CCP1–4), and Glu187 (CCP1–3), using the Quik- Change kit (Stratagene). The recombinant, overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction technique was used to construct mutants lacking individual CCPs. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned intoHindII and NotI sites of pcDNA3. The amino acids deleted in each construct, and the sequences of the primers that were used for the polymerase chain reactions are given in TableI. All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IDescription of 19 C4BP mutants used in the present studyModification of amino acid sequence in the α-chain of C4BPPrimer sequence (sense)CCP1–8Expressed Asn1–Trp4925′-CCCAAGTGTGAGTGGTAGACCCCCGAAGGCTGTCCP1–7Expressed Asn1–Lys4335′-GCCCCTCAATGTAAATAGCTGTGCCGGAAACCACCP1–6Expressed Asn1–Gly3755′-ACACCATCATGTGGATAGATTTGCAATTTTCCTCCP1–5Expressed Asn1–Glu3135′-TACCAAGGATGTGAGTAGTTATGTTGCCCTGAACCP1–4Expressed Asn1–Glu2485′-CCTCCTGCTTGTGAGTAGAATAGTTGTATTAATCCP1–3Expressed Asn1–Glu1875′-CCTCCTACCTGTGAATAGATCACCTGTCGCAAGΔCCP1Deleted Asn1–Tyr625′-CCTGCTGTTCTTGGCAAACGATGCAGACACΔCCP2Deleted Lys63–Ile1245′-ACCTTCTGTATCTACGTCAAGTGTAAGCCTΔCCP3Deleted Val125–Lys1885′-CCACAATGTGAAATTATCACCTGTCGCAAGΔCCP4Deleted Lys188–Asn2495′-CCTCCTACCTGTGAAAATAGTTGTATTAATΔCCP5Deleted Asn249–Ala3145′-CCTGCTTGTGAGCCCTTATGTTGCCCTGAAΔCCP6Deleted Leu315–Gly3755′-TACCAAGGATGTGAGGCGGACATTTGCAATTTTΔCCP7Deleted Asp376–Lys4335′-ACACCATCATGTGGAGCTCTGTGCCGGAAAΔCCP8Deleted Cys436–Trp4925′-CAATGTAAAGCTCTGGAGACCCCCGAAGGCΔCCP1–2Deleted Asn1–Ile1245′-CCTGCTGTTCTTGGCGTCAAGTGTAAGCCTAACCP1/2Two alanines inserted between Lys63 and Arg645′-TTCTGTATCTACAAAGCAGCACGATGCAGACACCCAAACCP2/3Two alanines inserted between Ile124 and Val1255′-CCACAATGTGAAATTGCAGCAGTCAAGTGTAAGCCTAACCP3/4Two alanines inserted between Lys188 and Ile1895′-CCTACCTGTGAAAAAGCAGCAATCACCTGTCGCAAGAACCP4/5Two alanines inserted between Pro248 and Asn2495′-CCTGCTTGTGAGCCCGCAGCAAATAGTTGTATTAAT Open table in a new tab Human kidney 293 cells (ATCC number 1573-CRL) were transfected with the various C4BP constructs using Lipofectin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The neomycin analogue, G418, at a concentration of 400 µg/ml was used for selection of transfected cells. Colonies of cells showing the highest expression levels, as judged by immunoblotting of the expression medium, were expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3.4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and 400 µg/ml G418. Medium from transfected cells was collected in 3-day periods, during which time, the cells were cultured in serum-free Opti-MEM Glutamax. It was stored at −20 °C until ∼4 liters of medium was collected. The medium was centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 × g to remove cell debris and applied at a flow of 90 ml/h on an affinity column with mAb 104 (directed against CCP1) or mAb 67 (directed against CCP4) coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (2.6 × 12 cm; Bio-Rad). The column was washed with Tris-buffered saline, 1 m NaCl, and the recombinant protein was subsequently eluted with 3 m guanidinium chloride and immediately dialyzed extensively against Tris-buffered saline. All preparative work was done at 4 °C. The exact concentrations of all mutants were determined from the amino acid composition analysis after 24 h hydrolysis in 6 m HCl. In some cases, the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred into Immobilon membranes and stained with Coomassie, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems 475A sequencer. The mutants were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) before analysis. Approximately 120 µg of each mutant was analyzed in the far UV region (185–250 nm). The resolution was 1 nm, the sensitivity was 20 millidegrees, the speed was 10 nm/min, and every spectrum presented is an average of four measurements. CCP1–3 and CCP1–4 were lyophilized and redissolved in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 0.5% SDS and incubated for 3 min at 95 °C.N-Glycosidase F (5 units, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1% Nonidet P-40 were added to 15 µg of each protein and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 µl of sample buffer (0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 0.005% Coomassie G-250, 4% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol), the samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min and applied on 10–20% gradient gel (Tricine buffer, Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were stained with Coomassie R-250. To immobilize C4b, 50 µl of C4b (10 µg/ml) in 75 mm sodium-carbonate, pH 9.6, were added to microtiter plate wells and left overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.5) and then incubated at room temperature with 200 µl of quench solution (washing buffer supplemented with 3% fish gelatin). After another three washes,125I-labeled wild type recombinant C4BP was added (20 kcpm/well), together with the various unlabeled proteins diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5. The samples were incubated for 4 h at room temperature, the wells were washed five times, and the amount of radioactivity bound in each well measured in a gamma counter. C4BP (200 nm) was mixed with 250 nm C4b, 60 nm factor I, and trace amounts of 125I-labeled C4b in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The samples were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with reducing agent (dithiothreitol). The samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 3 min and applied to a 10–15% gradient SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Sheep erythrocytes were washed twice with DGVB++ (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, containing 70 mmNaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.15 mm CaCl2). They were suspended at a concentration of 109 cells/ml and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of amboceptor (Boehringverke, diluted 1:3000 in DGVB++). The erythrocytes were then washed twice with ice-cold DGVB++ and resuspended to a concentration of 109 cells/ml. C1 was added dropwise to a final concentration of 4 µg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold DGVB++ buffer and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 2 µg/ml of C4, which resulted in the generation of EAC14 cells. The EAC14 cells were incubated in DGVB++ containing C2 alone (approximately 8 µg/ml) or together with C4BP mutants. The mixtures were kept at 30 °C with constant shaking, and 50-µl aliquots were removed at time intervals and added to 100 µl of guinea pig serum diluted 1:30 in GVB-EDTA (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 40 mm EDTA) in order to measure residual C3-convertase activity. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were centrifuged, and lysis of the erythrocytes was determined spectrophotometrically (A 405 nm). EAC142 cells were generated by incubating EAC14 cells at 109cells/ml with an equal volume of C2 diluted in DGVB++(final C2 concentration, approximately 20 µg/ml). The cells were incubated for 5 min (equal to the experimentally determinedT max), centrifuged at 4 °C, and resuspended in DGVB++ (prewarmed to 30 °C) that contained various concentrations of the C4BP mutants. The mixtures were kept shaking at 30 °C, and 50-µl aliquots were removed at time intervals and mixed with 100 µl of guinea pig serum diluted 1:30 in GVB-EDTA. After 1 h at 37 °C, the samples were centrifuged, and the amount of erythrocyte lysis was determined spectrophotometrically. The EAC14 cells that were used in this experiment were prepared essentially as described above but with somewhat different concentrations of proteins. The amboceptor was used at a 1:1000 dilution, and the C1 concentration was 20 µg/ml. In an initial experiment, several batches of C3-convertases were prepared with concentrations of C4 ranging from 0.5 to 32 µg/ml. The deposited C4b was detected by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody against C4c (Quidel). In this experiment, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:300 dilution of the antibody and then washed twice in DGVB++. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dakoppats) was used during the second incubation, and the cell-associated fluorescence was then detected in a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Based on the results of the C4 titration, two batches of C3-convertases were prepared with 1 or 32 µg/ml of C4. EAC142 cells were generated by incubating EAC14 cells at 2 × 108 cells/ml with an equal volume of C2 diluted in DGVB++ (final C2 concentration, approximately 20 µg/ml). The cells were incubated for 5 min, centrifuged at 4 °C, and resuspended in DGVB++ containing different concentrations of wild type C4BP or the CCP1–8 mutant. The mixtures were kept shaking at 30 °C, and 50-µl aliquots were removed after 5 min and either added to 100 µl of cold guinea pig serum diluted 1:30 in GVB-EDTA or placed on ice. The aliquots that were mixed with the guinea pig serum were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the amount of erythrocyte lysis was determined spectrophotometrically after centrifugation. To the aliquots that were placed on ice, C3 (40 µg/ml) was added, and the samples were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After washing, a monoclonal anti-C3 antibody (1:500, Dakoppats) was added and allowed to bind to the cells for 30 min at 30 °C. After additional washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies and deposited C3 was detected in a flow cytometer. Approximately 10 µg of wild type C4BP or each of the C4BP variants lacking individual CCP domains was applied to a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 ml of the starting buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl at a flow of 1.5 ml/min. C4BP in collected fractions (0.2 ml) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conductivity of the eluate was continuously monitored (the column was attached to ÄKTA explorer liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). To define which of the eight CCP domains in the α-chain of C4BP are functionally involved in the regulation of C3-convertase activity, 19 recombinant C4BP variants were created. In series A of C4BP variants (Fig. 1), stop codons were introduced after CCP3, CCP4, CCP5, CCP6, CCP7, or CCP8, which resulted in the generation of six truncated, monomeric C4BP α-chains. In series B, each of the CCPs was individually deleted, resulting in eight variants. In addition, in one deletion variant, both CCP1 and CCP2 were removed. In series C of C4BP variants, the linkers between CCPs were modified by insertion of two alanine residues. All recombinant C4BP molecules were expressed in stable cell lines and purified from culture media by affinity chromatography employing one of two monoclonal antibodies: mAb 104 directed against CCP1 or mAb 67 recognizing CCP4 of α-chain. The purified truncated forms of C4BP (series A) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting using mAb 104 (Fig. 2). All six C4BP mutants were recognized by mAb 104, which is known to react with the CCP1 domain. The two mutants CCP1–3 and CCP1–4 both migrated as double bands, under reducing as well as under nonreducing conditions. The two bands of each variant were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after electrophoresis and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Both bands in the two C4BP variants yielded identical amino acid sequences corresponding to the N terminus of mature C4BP. The size heterogeneity was due to different degrees of glycosylation because after N-glycosidase F digestion, both CCP1–3 and CCP1–4 migrated as single, sharp bands (not shown).Figure 2Analysis of truncated, monomeric C4BP mutants by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant C4BP and the mutants (∼2 µg/well for Coomassie staining and 0.04 µg/well for immunoblotting) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% gel (Tricine buffer). Proteins were then subjected to Coomassie staining (A and B) or transferred to a membrane (C) and allowed to react with mAb 104 directed against CCP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified recombinant, polymeric forms of C4BP lacking single CCP domains (series B) and mutants having Ala residues introduced between the CCP domains (series C) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig.3). All of the variants of both series B and C formed polymeric C4BP similarly to wild type C4BP, and the molecular weight differences between the C4BP variants on nonreduced gels were those that could be expected from the introduced mutations. This suggests that the polymerization process was unaffected by the introduced mutations. The expression levels of all of the recombinant C4BP variants were similar to that of wild type C4BP, which is consistent with proper folding during synthesis. The mutants were also probed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against α-chain of C4BP (mAbs 67, 70, 92, 96, 102, and 104). The mutants were immobilized in wells of microtiter plate and incubated with increasing concentrations of antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Approximately 50% binding to immobilized wild type C4BP was observed at 0.4–1 nm concentration of each antibody (not shown). Similar results were obtained for all variants of C4BP except when the deleted CCP domain contained antibody epitope. We mapped antibody epitopes to CCP1 (mAbs 70, 92, 96, 102, and 104) and CCP4 (mAb 67). In general, the mutations did not affect the recognition of the C4BP by the monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that the overall conformation of the C4BP variants was correct. Circular dichroism analysis of C4BP variants yielded very similar spectra, once again confirming that mutagenesis did not cause folding changes. Results are presented as strength of the signal relative to the lowest point (millidegrees/s) measured (Fig. 4). We also analyzed temperature-induced unfolding of our mutants (by collecting circular dichroism spectra at increasing temperatures). Up to 90 °C, we found polymeric wild type C4BP to be resistant to unfolding (not shown). All polymeric C4BP variants shared this temperature resistance. The monomeric CCP1–8 demonstrated changes in ellipticity at 230 nm at ∼70 °C. These changes were reversible as the normal spectra returned after overnight incubation of the protein at 4 °C.Figure 4Circular dichroism. The circular dichroism spectra obtained for recombinant wild type C4BP and mutants are shown. The results are expressed as the percentage of the lowest point seen in each spectrum.

Dahlbäck B. Müller Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13674-13679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether isolated, monomeric α-chains were fully active in regulation of fluid phase C3 convertase, we compared the CCP1–8 variant with wild type C4BP. The abilities of the two proteins to inhibit the formation of C3 convertase, to accelerate its decay, and to act as cofactors to factor I were investigated. In a fluid phase C4b degradation assay, increasing concentrations of C4BP or CCP1–8 were incubated with C4b, factor I, and trace amounts of125I-labeled C4b and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To estimate the cofactor activity, the C4d bands were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics), and the C4d formation was plotted against the concentration of added protein (Fig.5 A). Both C4BP and CCP1–8 were active as factor I cofactors; ∼100 nm C4BP was needed to reach 50% of C4d release, whereas 350 nm CCP1–8 was required to obtain a similar effect. The 3–4 times higher CCP1–8 concentration needed agrees well with the presence of four strong C4b binding sites in polymeric C4BP, whereas CCP1–8 only binds one C4b. The results suggest that CCP1–8 is equally efficient as intact C4BP in the degradation of fluid phase C4b, implying that there is no functional cooperativity between the α-chains of polymeric C4BP during C4b degradation in fluid phase. The efficiency of monomeric CCP1–8 to inhibit surface bound C3-convertases was compared with that of polymeric C4BP, thus testing the hypothesis that the polymeric nature of C4BP is important for regulation of surface-bound C3-convertases, in particular at high density of C3-convertases. In initial experiments, several batches of EAC14 cells were prepared using C4 concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 32 µg/ml. Deposited C4b was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody against C4b using flow cytometry. At the highest concentration of C4 (32 µg/ml), the density of deposited C4b was at least 8-fold higher than that obtained using 1 µg/ml of C4 (Fig. 5 B). EAC14 cells prepared at 1 µg/ml C4 and at 32 µg/ml C4 were used in the functional evaluation of C4BP and CCP1–8. The decay of C3-convertases was measured by two means, i.e. by the classical hemolytic assay (Fig. 5 C) and by measuring C3b deposition on the cell surface using flow cytometry and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled C3-antibody (Fig. 5 D). In both assays, polymeric C4BP was much more effective than CCP1–8 independently of the convertase density. Moreover, it was observed that lower concentrations of the C4BP were needed to reach similar relative inhibition at high density of C3-convertases as compared with low density, suggesting that the inhibition efficiency of polymeric C4BP increases with increased density of C3-convertases. To evaluate the ability of all C4BP variants to bind C4b, a competition assay was used in which the various C4BP variants were allowed to compete with125I-labeled wild type C4BP for binding to immobilized C4b (Fig. 6). In the absence of competitor, 25–35% of the added 125I-labeled C4BP bound to the immobilized C4b, binding that was competed out by unlabeled C4BP (half-maximal inhibition observed at 5 nm C4BP). The ability of C4BP variants lacking CCP1, CCP2, CCP3, or CCP1–2 to compete was severely impaired, indicating that CCP1–3 is crucial for C4b binding. In particular, CCP2 was found to be important because deletion of this CCP completely abolished the C4b binding activity. In addition, the spacing between the CCPs was found to be important for the integrity of the C4b binding site, as illustrated by the disruptive consequence of alanine insertions between CCPs 1 and 2, CCPs 2 and 3, and CCPs 3 and 4. Deletion of CCP7 also resulted in 10-fold decreased ability to compete with C4BP binding to C4b. To elucidate whether the impaired C4b binding was matched by a decrease in factor I cofactor activity, the C4BP variants were tested in the C4b degradation assay (Fig. 7). During degradation of C4b, factor I cleaves two peptide bonds in C4b. Cleavage of Arg1217-Asn1318 gives rise to a small, 13-kDa peptide named α4. The second cleavage at Arg937-Asn938 results in release of the 45-kDa C4d fragment, which was quantified in the assay. The first three CCPs were found to be important for expression of factor I cofactor activity, and even the shortest monomeric form of C4BP (CCP1–3) was active. When ΔCCP1 was analyzed, the amount of generated C4d was decreased by 60% as compared with the wild type C4BP. However, it was noteworthy that most of the α-chain of C4b was gone after the incubation, suggesting that ΔCCP1 retains its ability to serve as cofactor for the cleavage of Arg1217-Asn1318bond. Cleavage of this site releases the small α4 fragment, and the remainder of the α-chain co-migrates with the β-chain. The small α4 fragment could be quantified after overexposure of the gels. Almost 80–90% of α4 fragment, as compared with the amount formed using the wild type C4BP, was generated. Thus, deletion of CCP1 results in the specific loss of C4b-cleavage at Arg937-Asn938. Similar results were obtained using the C4BP variants in which two alanines had been inserted between CCP1 and CCP2 or between CCP3 and CCP4. In contrast, C4BP va"

Here, we studied the role of pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins and the mitochondria apoptosis pathway in the development of TNFα-induced hepatic injury during endotoxemia. After treating mice with lipopolysaccharide or TNFα in the presence ofd-galactosamine, Bid was cleaved and translocated to mitochondria in hepatocytes. Independently, Bax was also activated by the death receptor engagement and translocated to mitochondria. However, its subsequent insertion into the mitochondrial membrane depends on Bid. Nevertheless, Bid was required, but Bax could be dispensed for the mitochondrial release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria, suggesting that Bid could activate additional downstream molecules other than Bax. The lack of this Bid-dependent mitochondria activation and cytochromec release in the bid-deficient mice was responsible for the significantly delayed effector caspase activation and hepatocyte injury upon endotoxin treatment, culminating in a prolonged survival of the bid-deficient mice. Additional genetic factor(s) could further modify the dependence of TNFα toxicity on the mitochondria pathway as the bid-deficient 129/SvJ mice manifested an even higher resistance than the same type of mice in C57BL/6 background.

When binding to its 55-kDa receptor TNF-R1, TNFα may activate several different apoptosis pathways based on in vitro studies on cell lines (10Tartaglia L.A. Rothe M. Hu Y.F. Goeddel D.V.

The most well studied pathway involves the adaptor molecules TRADD and FADD, which recruit caspase 8, an initiator caspase (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). The activated caspase 8 is then able to activate the effector caspase 3 (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 24Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10947-10964Crossref Scopus (774) Google Scholar), which, together with other effector caspases, is responsible for many of the destructive cellular events during apoptosis (25Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). This cytosolic pathway had been considered to be responsible for the death receptor-mediated apoptosis in general (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). Effector caspases, however, can be activated by another pathway in which mitochondria release cytochrome c in response to death signals such as DNA damage or growth factor deprivation. Cytochromec binds to Apaf-1 to induce its oligomerization, which in turn activates another initiator caspase, caspase 9, which then activates the downstream effector caspases (26Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). This mitochondria pathway is tightly regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Although the pro-death members of the family, such as Bid, Bax or Bak can promote mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, the anti-death members of the family, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, can suppress this process (28Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 29Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar, 30Gross A. McDonnell J.M.

However, several in vitro studies have demonstrated that TNFα could induce cytochrome c release in a variety of cells (31Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNFα may also be able to induce apoptosis through the mitochondria death pathway. Since Bid, a “BH3-only” pro-death Bcl-2 family protein can be proteolytically activated by caspase 8 in response to death receptor activation, leading to Bid translocation to mitochondria and cytochrome c release (32Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Bid-initiated mitochondria apoptosis pathway could contribute to the in vivo TNFα cytotoxicity, such as hepatic injury. Indeed, activation of Fas, another death receptor, led to a Bid-dependent hepatic apoptosis in which the activation of effector caspases was significantly dependent on the mitochondria pathway (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The current study tested this hypothesis and intended to determine the significance and the activation mechanisms of the mitochondria pathway in TNFα-induced hepatic injury. To do so, we selected an animal model employing the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and a sensitizing agent,d-galactosamine (GalN) (12Freudenberg M.A. Keppler D. Galanos C. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 891-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tiegs G. Wolter M. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 40Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the activation of caspases in hepatocytes and their roles in the hepatic injury have been well documented (16Kunstle G. Leist M. Uhlig S. Revesz L. Feifel R. MacKenzie A. Wendel A. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 55: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Jaeschke H. Fisher M.A. Lawson J.A. Simmons C.A. Farhood A. Jones D.A. J.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1192-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We now report that treatment of C57BL/6 mice with the LPS/GalN regime did activate Bid, which was cleaved by caspase 8 to acquire the ability to move to mitochondria. Interestingly, another pro-death Bcl-2 family protein, Bax, was also activated to translocate to mitochondria independently of Bid. However, Bax did require Bid for its subsequent insertion into the mitochondria and therefore for its activity. Activation of Bid seemed to be responsible for the release of cytochrome c and the activation of mitochondria-initiated caspase cascade. Thus both effector caspase activation and liver damage were significantly retarded, although not eliminated, in the absence of Bid. On the other hand, the deletion of the Bax did not seem to significantly affect the mitochondrial release of cytochromec and caspase activation, suggesting that Bax was not the only molecule that could mediate the activity of Bid. Indeed, a recent study showed that Bid could activate another pro-death Bcl-2 family protein, Bak, by inducing its oligomerization (42Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Bak could serve as yet another downstream target of Bid. Thus multiple pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins, led by Bid, could be sequentially activated in vivo to trigger the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. Finally, the dependence on Bid to the response to TNFα was even more significant in 129/SvJ mice than in C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that additional genetic factor(s) might further influence the selective use of the mitochondria apoptosis pathway. We thus concluded that pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins and the mitochondria apoptosis pathway played a critical role in the early development of TNFα-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and pathogenesis in vivo. Mice deficient in bid were established by a gene targeting technique (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). These mice have been bred to either C57BL/6J (99% homogeneity) or 129/SvJ (100% homogeneity) background by first crossing the founder chimeric mice to the inbred C57BL/6J or 129/SvJ mice and then continuous back-crossing of the heterozygous mice to the corresponding background. 129/SvJ strain of the Jackson Laboratory is currently named as 129X1/SvJ (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Mice deficient in bax were established previously (43Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) and were maintained in the C57BL/6J background. All mice used in the experiments were male littermates ∼25–30 g in weight. They were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility on the campus in compliance with National Institutes of Health and University of Pittsburgh guidelines. Endotoxic treatments were given as described previously (3Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Kronke M. Mak T.W.

Briefly, mice were given peritoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8, Sigma L-3129) at 25 or 50 µg/kg andd-galactosamine (GalN, Sigma) at 20 mg per mouse. Alternatively, GalN at 700 mg/kg was intraperitoneally administered followed by an intravenous injection of 2 µg/kg mouse recombinant TNFα (Sigma) 1 h later. All reagents were prepared in 0.9% (w/v) endotoxin-free sterile saline (Sigma). Animals were sacrificed at designated time points for histology and biochemistry studies. Blood plasma was collected for the determination of liver enzyme activities. Staining of liver sections by hematoxylin-eosin or terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were performed as described previously (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Liver homogenates were prepared and sub-fractionated as described previously (32Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were homogenized in buffer A (200 mmmannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES) with a Wheaten Dounce glass homogenizer (type B pestle) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 600 ×g. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min. The heavy membrane fraction (mitochondria) was washed once again in buffer A by centrifugation at 600 ×g for 5 min to remove any contaminating particles and then recovered by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min. The isolated mitochondria were resuspended in buffer B (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, 25 µm EGTA) and kept in ice for use within 2 h. Both mitochondria and cytosol were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-cytochrome cantibody (PharMingen) or anti-Bid antibody (44Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Blots were developed by an ECL method (Pierce). To determine the translocation and membrane insertion of Bax, mice were first treated with the LPS/GalN regime or anti-Fas antibodies (clone Jo-2, PharMingen) as described in the figure legends. The liver homogenates and the mitochondria (the heavy membrane fraction) were prepared as described above. One hundred micrograms of mitochondria were treated with freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 7,000 ×g for 10 min (45Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Fifty percent of the recovered pellets, together with an equal amount of untreated mitochondria, were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using an anti-Bax antibody (lot 651) that recognizes mouse Bax at amino acids 43–61 (45Goping I.S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Caspase activities were analyzed as described in a previous study (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocyte cytosol (50 µg) was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-caspase 8 (Stressgen), anti-activated caspase 3 p19/p17 subunits (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-14-3-3ε antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In addition, caspase activities were analyzed by incubating the cytosol (20–30 µg) with 40 µm site-specific tetrapeptide substrates (IETD-AFC for caspase 8 and DEVD-AFC for caspases 3 and 7, Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min. Fluorescence signals were detected by a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50-B) at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission wavelengths. The signals representative of caspase activities were corrected for background and standardized relative to controls. One of the most common approaches to induce TNFα-mediated liver damage in mice is to administer a low dose of LPS in the presence of a liver-specific transcription inhibitor, GalN, that results in massive hepatocyte apoptosis (12Freudenberg M.A. Keppler D. Galanos C. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 891-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tiegs G. Wolter M. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Leist M.

To test the hypothesis that Bid might be involved in the pathogenesis of this type of liver damage, we first examined whether Bid could be cleaved during such a treatment in hepatocytes and whether cytochrome c was released in correlation to Bid cleavage. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally given 50 µg/kg LPS and 20 mg/mouse GalN. Livers were harvested 2 or 4 h later, homogenated, and subfractionated into cytoplasm and heavy membrane (mitochondria) fractions. Western blot analysis of these fractions indicated that Bid cleavage could be detected 2 h following the treatment, but the 15-kDa truncated Bid (tBid) was found only in the cytosol at this time (Fig.1 A). More cleavage was detected 4 h after the treatment, with more than 50% of tBid now localizing to the mitochondria. Correspondingly, cytochromec release was detected only at this time when tBid was translocated to mitochondria. Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release were only observed in mice treated with both LPS and GalN but not in control mice treated with saline or with either reagent alone (Fig. 1 B). These findings were consistent with previous reports that liver damage and mortality occurred only when both LPS and GalN were present (40Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested that Bid and the mitochondria apoptosis pathway could play a role in the TNFα-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. In order to determine whether cytochrome c release was dependent on Bid, we compared the responses of wild-type and bid-deficient mice to several different treatments. Release of cytochromec in hepatocytes was observed only in wild-type but not inbid-deficient mice after treatment with either 50 or 25 µg/kg LPS plus GalN (Fig. 2,A and B). This was also true if the mice were directly injected with TNFα plus GalN (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the general dogma that the effect of LPS is mediated by TNFα (14Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Germann P.G. Wendel A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kunstle G. Leist M. Uhlig S. Revesz L. Feifel R. MacKenzie A. Wendel A. Immunol.

Cytochrome c release was not observed in bid-deficient mice, even after a prolonged treatment (6 h) at either a high or low dosage (Fig. 2, Aand B). The dependence of cytochrome c release on Bid was not affected by genetic background. Thus wild-type 129/SvJ mice demonstrated the same pattern of cytochrome c release when treated with the LPS/GalN regime as the C57BL/6J mice (Fig.2 D). It has been well established that the hepatotoxicity induced by low dose LPS in the presence of GalN depends on TNF-R1-mediated caspase activities (3Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A.

In addition, our previous study demonstrated that TNFα-induced caspase activation in murine embryonic fibroblasts was greatly enhanced by the Bid-dependent mitochondria pathway (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether LPS/GalN or TNFα/GalN treatment would also activate the effector caspases in hepatocytes mainly through the mitochondria pathway. The cytosol fraction of the hepatocyte was prepared and subjected to Western blotting and enzymatic cleavage assay. Caspase 8 was activated, as defined by the IETDase activity, in both wild-type andbid-deficient mice treated with 50 µg/kg LPS plus GalN for 4 or 6 h (Fig. 3, A andB). The presence of the p10 subunits of activated caspase 8 could be readily detected by Western blot (Fig. 3 B). The initial activities of caspase 8 at 4 h were comparable to the wild-type and bid-deficient mice, but the activities were somewhat higher in wild-type mice at a later time point (6 h), which was reproducibly observed and probably due to a feedback enhancing effect from a higher effector caspase activity in these mice (see below). The same kinetics were previously noted in TNFα-treated murine embryonic fibroblasts (33Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The equivalent elevation of caspase 8 activity in both types of mice early in the response was also consistent with the notion that Bid worked downstream of caspase 8 in the death receptor-mediated apoptosis (32Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

The activation of caspase 8 led to the cleavage of Bid in wild-type mice under various regimes (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). However, effector caspases were only activated in the wild-type, not in the bid-deficient mice, at the early time point (4 h), based on the DEVDase activity assay (Fig. 3 D), the detection of the p19/p17 subunits of activated caspase 3, and the cleavage of caspase 3 substrate 14-3-3ε (Fig. 3, E and F).

https://openalex.org/W2156417547,"The loss of growth-inhibitory responses to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a frequent consequence of malignant transformation. Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 proteins are important mediators of the antiproliferative responses to TGF-β and may become inactivated in some human cancers. Epithelial cells harboring oncogenic Ras mutations often exhibit a loss of TGF-β antiproliferative responses. To further investigate the effect of oncogenic Ras in TGF-β signaling, we used an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression system to express Ha-RasVal-12 in intestinal epithelial cells. Induction of Ha-RasVal-12 caused a decrease in the level of Smad4 expression, inhibited TGF-β-induced complex formation between Smad2/Smad3 and Smad4, blocked Smad4 nuclear translocation, inhibited the TGF-β-mediated decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation, and repressed TGF-β-activated transcriptional responses. The withdrawal of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside or the addition of an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway restored the Smad4 level and TGF-β-induced Smad complex formation. Forced expression of Smad4 resulted in partial recovery of the TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and transcriptional responses in the presence of oncogenic Ras. Further, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the MEK/ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway prevented the Ras-induced decrease in Smad4 expression and complex formation. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which oncogenic Ras represses TGF-β signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent down-regulation of Smad4, thereby subverting the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β. The loss of growth-inhibitory responses to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a frequent consequence of malignant transformation. Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 proteins are important mediators of the antiproliferative responses to TGF-β and may become inactivated in some human cancers.

Smad proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling of the TGF-β family of extracellular polypeptides that initiate signaling from the cell surface through serine/threonine kinase receptors. Binding of the ligand to TGF-β type II receptor results in the recruitment and phosphorylation of the type I receptor, which then phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3. The phosphorylated Smads form complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate transcription of target genes through cooperative interactions with DNA, transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Inactivating mutations in the components of the TGF-β signal transduction pathway are found in a number of human cancers including colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas that harbor mutations in TGF-β type II receptor, Smad2, or Smad4 (2Grady W.M.

The molecular events required for transforming a normal colonic epithelium to an adenomatous polyp and finally to an invasive colon cancer involve the sequential mutation of specific genes. Inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coligene and activating mutations in the Ki-ras gene occur early, whereas Smad4 and p53 inactivation occurs generally late during the progression from adenoma to carcinoma in the colon (7Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). Smad4 germ line mutations have been identified in juvenile polyposis, which is associated with the increased risk of colorectal cancer (8Howe J.R. Roth S. Ringold J.C. Summers R.W. Jrvinen H.J.

It has been observed that both Smad4 heterozygous and Smad4/adenomatous polyposis coli double-mutant heterozygous mice develop invasive carcinomas (9Takaku K. Oshima M. Miyoshi H. Matsui M.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6113-6117PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Smad4 mutations are relatively infrequent in colorectal adenomas and nonmetastatic carcinomas (11Riggins G.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Thiagalingam S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4221-4224PubMed Google Scholar) but are present in more than 30% of invasive metastatic colorectal cancers (12Miyaki M. Iijima T. Ishii A. Konishi M. Sakai K. Ishii A. Yasuno M. Hishima T. Koike M. Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunimiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) suggesting that loss of Smad4 function contributes to tumor progression rather than tumor initiation. TGF-β can override the proliferative effects of Ras-activating mitogens including epidermal growth factor in normal epithelial cells; however, cells transformed by oncogenic Ras often exhibit loss of antiproliferative responses to TGF-β. Activating mutations of the Ki-ras gene occur with high frequency during the progression from adenoma to carcinoma in the colon and probably contribute to tumor progression (7Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in the linker region of Smad3 by activated Ras inhibits TGF-β/Smad-mediated transcriptional responses, Smad nuclear translocation, and growth inhibition (13Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). However, another report has shown that hepatocyte growth factor/epidermal growth factor-mediated MEK1 activation induces phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation by Smad2/4 (14de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies have found that constitutively active MEK, or inhibitors for MEK, had no effect on Smad activity in human keratinocytes (15Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D. Liu Y. Counter C. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or that blockade of Smad4 in transformed keratinocytes containing oncogenic Ras leads to hyperactivation of the Ras-dependent ERK signaling pathway (16Iglesias M. Frontelo P. Gamallo C. Quintanilla M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism by which oncogenic Ras modulates TGF-β/Smad signaling, we have investigated the effect of activated Ha-Ras on TGF-β signaling by using an inducible system. Upon induction of oncogenic Ras, TGF-β-mediated Smad4 complex formation and transcriptional responses were markedly inhibited. These responses correlated with decreased steady-state levels of Smad4 due to degradation of endogenous Smad4 protein. Reversal of Ras activation or the addition of ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitors prevented the degradation of Smad4 and restored the Smad4 complex formation with Smad2 and Smad3. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad4 largely restored TGF-β/Smad-mediated transcriptional responses and TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition in the presence of oncogenic Ras. Our studies demonstrate a mechanism of repression of TGF-β signaling by oncogenic Ras that may contribute to cellular transformation. The RIE:iRas cells with an inducible activated Ha-RasVal-12 c-DNA as described previously (17Sheng H. Williams C.S. Saho J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6628-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were treated with IPTG (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5 mm to induce the expression of Ha-RasVal-12. For the IPTG withdrawal study, cells were treated with IPTG for 72 h, subcultured, and grown in the regular DMEM containing 10% serum (−IPTG). Cells were lysed at intervals using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml FOY-305 (protease inhibitor, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mmsodium fluoride. Smad2 and -3 polyclonal antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added to 500 µg of lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the antigen-antibody mixture and further incubated overnight. Beads were washed thoroughly (4 times) with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-human Smad4 monoclonal antibody (SC 7966, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pan-Ras monoclonal antibodies (Calbiochem), β-actin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), and phospho-Smad2 antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) were used for immunoblotting. In some experiments a ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, ALLN (Sigma), and lactacystin (Calbiochem) at 5 µm were added in the presence or absence of IPTG, and selective kinase inhibitors, such as PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor, 10 µm, Calbiochem) and SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor, 5 µm, Calbiochem), were also used in this study along with IPTG. The extraction of total cellular RNA at different time points (−/+IPTG) was performed using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center). RNA samples (20 µg) were separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was hybridized with the human full-length Smad4 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using Rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cyclophilin A message (1B15) was used for equality of loading. RIE:iRas cells were treated with (+/−)-IPTG for 60 h and were labeled with 150 µCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label; ICN) for 5 h, and then washed three times with DMEM. Fresh DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine was added to the culture, and cell lysates were collected at the indicated time points. An equal amount of protein (600 µg) from each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibody-protein G agarose. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The intensity of the bands was quantitated by densitometry (alpha-Imager). RIE:iRas cells were transiently transfected (−/+)-IPTG for 48 h with HA-Smad4 (0.5 and 1 µg), p3TP-Lux (0.7 µg), and pCMV β-gal (0.3 µg) using Superfect (Qiagen). An equal amount of total DNA was used in transfection for each experiment. Twenty h after transfection, cells were treated with or without TGF-β1 (200 pm) for a further 24 h in the medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum (+/−IPTG). Cells were lysed, and both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured in an Analytical Luminescence Lab Monolight 2010 luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for differences in the transfection efficiency. RIE:iRas cells were treated with (+/−)-IPTG for 72 h and 30 min with TGF-β1 and fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde for 10 min. Nuclear translocation of Smad4 was visualized by immunofluorescence using Smad4 monoclonal antibodies (SC-7966) and CY-3 conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Sigma). [3H]Thymidine assays were performed in triplicate. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated with (+/−)-IPTG for 24–72 h. In some experiments adenoviral constructs of either FLAG-Smad4 or β-gal were added at the multiplicity of infection of 20 with (+/−)-IPTG. TGF-β was added for the final 22 h followed by a 2-h incubation with 1 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine (ICN). The radioactivity incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid material was counted by a liquid scintillation counter. Smad4 plays a central role in TGF-β signaling, and its functional inactivation may result in resistance to TGF-β antiproliferative responses. To investigate whether Smad4 is a target of oncogenic Ras in intestinal epithelial cells, an IPTG-inducible vector was used to express Ha-RasVal-12 in RIE-1 cells (RIE:iRas) (17Sheng H. Williams C.S. Saho J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6628-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We observed the increasing expression of oncogenic Ras after treating the cells with IPTG at different time points (Fig.1 A). To determine whether Ras expression alters Smad4 levels, Western blot analysis was performed on cell lysates after treatment with IPTG as shown in Fig. 1 B. Endogenous Smad4 was readily detectable, and the level remained unchanged over the period of 72 h of culture in the absence of Ras induction. However, a decrease in the Smad4 level was observed after 24 h with the maximum decrement by 72 h after IPTG treatment. This decrease in Smad4 level was associated with the concomitant increase in the level of a smaller polypeptide, designated Smad4*, which was recognized by the anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibody. No change was observed in the level of Smad4 when RIE-1 parental cells were treated with IPTG (data not shown). Both Smad4* and the full-length Smad4, recognized by anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibody, were also observed in RIE-1 cells stably transfected with Ha- RasVal-12(RIE-Ha-Ras). In contrast Smad4* was not detected in nontransformed mink lung epithelial or parental RIE-1 cells, but the full-length endogenous Smad4 was abundant (Fig. 1 C). No Smad4 expression was detected in SW480.7 colon cancer cells as reported previously (18Calonge M.J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33637-33643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). With longer exposure additional degradation products smaller than Smad4* were also observed in the IPTG-treated RIE:iRas cells (Fig.1 D). These data suggest that oncogenic Ras causes down-regulation of Smad4 and that the smaller protein, Smad4*, is likely to be a degradation fragment of Smad4 that is recognized by the anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibodies. The complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 in response to TGF-β is critical for TGF-β/Smad signaling. To investigate whether oncogenic Ras-mediated down-regulation of Smad4 has an effect on the complex formation between Smad2/Smad3 and Smad4, the RIE:iRas cells were treated with or without IPTG either in the absence or presence of TGF-β. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad2/3 antibody, and each immunoprecipitate was probed with antibodies to Smad4 (Fig. 1 E, top panel). At each time point TGF-β induced the association between Smad2/3 with Smad4 both in the presence and absence of IPTG, as expected. However, the amount of coprecipitated Smad4 was reduced significantly with the time of IPTG treatment, and interestingly the Smad4* fragment was also co-precipitated with Smad2/3 during the induction of oncogenic Ras. No change in the level of Smad4 co-precipitated with Smad2/3 was detected in cells that were not treated with IPTG. Ras activation did not inhibit TGF-β-induced accumulation of carboxyl-terminal phosphorylated Smad2 nor did it alter the steady-state levels of Smad2 or Smad3 (Fig. 1 E). To determine whether oncogenic Ras can regulate Smad4 mRNA levels, Northern blot analysis was performed after treating RIE-iRas cells with or without IPTG. The Smad4 mRNA level was not altered by Ras activation (Fig.2 A), indicating that the decrease in the Smad4 protein level was not the result of a decrease in Smad4 mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of the complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 in response to TGF-β is due to the down-regulation of Smad4 by oncogenic Ras. Further, these results suggest that the smaller protein (Smad4*) can still associate with Smad2/3 in response to TGF-β. RIE:iRas cells exhibit a morphological transformation between 24 and 48 h after IPTG treatment, and the transformation of these cells could be completely reversed upon withdrawal of IPTG for 72 h (17Sheng H. Williams C.S. Saho J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6628-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The reversibility of Ras-induced down-regulation of Smad4 was examined after withdrawal of IPTG from transformed RIE:iRas cells. RIE:iRas cells were first treated with IPTG for 72 h, then IPTG was withdrawn, and cell lysates were obtained after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The full-length Smad4 protein was barely detectable whereas the Smad4* band was abundant after 72 h of IPTG treatment (Fig.2 B, lane1). By 48 h after withdrawal of IPTG, Smad4 expression was restored coincident with the disappearance of the smaller protein band. The increase in Smad4 inversely correlated with the level of oncogenic Ras. The TGF-β-induced complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 was restored along with restoration of the Smad4 level (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that the inhibition of complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 occurs through oncogenic Ras-mediated down-regulation of Smad4 in the RIE:iRas cells. To analyze the effect of oncogenic Ras on TGF-β antiproliferative responses, a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was performed after treating the RIE-iRas cells with or without IPTG in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 3 A). TGF-β inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by ∼50% in the absence of IPTG throughout the entire period of study. Induction of activated Ras by IPTG reduced the degree of TGF-β-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis in a time-dependent manner. By 72 h after IPTG exposure TGF-β inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by only 20% of control. However, upon withdrawal of IPTG, a partial rescue of TGF-β-mediated inhibition in [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed. Significant partial recovery of TGF-β-mediated inhibition in [3H]thymidine incorporation occurred when Smad4 was expressed by adenoviral FLAG-Smad4 transduction in the presence of IPTG (Fig. 3 B). Activation of Ras also resulted in a decreased level of exogenously expressed F-Smad4 as shown in Fig. 3 C. The incomplete restoration of the TGF-β response may be due to the degradation of both the exogenous F-Smad4 and the endogenous Smad4 in the presence of activated Ras. This experiment confirms that activation of Ras causes the expected loss of TGF-β growth-inhibitory responses in these cells. These results are consistent with the previously reported findings in cells that are constitutively transformed by activated Ha-Ras (13Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 19Filmus J. Zhao J. Buick R.N. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 521-526PubMed Google Scholar, 20Winesett M.P. Ramsey G.W. Barnard J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because steady-state levels of Smad4 were decreased after the activation of oncogenic Ras, but the mRNA levels remained unchanged, we examined the degradation rate of Smad4 in the presence and absence of Ras induction. Cells were treated with (+/−)-IPTG for 60 h and pulsed with [35S]methionine and then chased in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine (Fig.4, A and B). The rate of decay of Smad4 in the presence of IPTG was more rapid than in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 4 C). The half-life of Smad4 in the absence of activated Ras was ∼8 h (t 12 ∼8 h), whereas the half-life of Smad4 in the presence of IPTG was ∼3 h (t 12 ∼3 h). In addition, the steady state level of Smad4 in the absence of IPTG remained almost constant as compared with the decreased level in the presence of IPTG. These results suggest that Smad4 is less stable and undergoes more rapid degradation in the presence of activated Ras. The majority of protein turnover outside the lysosomal compartment occurs via the 26 S proteasome by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (21Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 30: 405-439Crossref Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Missense mutation in the MH1 domains of Smad2 and Smad4 undergo rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (22Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To confirm whether the Ras-mediated decrease in the endogenous Smad4 level is through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, the effect of ALLN, an inhibitor of proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome, on IPTG and/or TGF-β-treated RIE:iRas cells was examined. ALLN had no effect on TGF-β-induced complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 (Fig. 4 A, top panel,lanes 5 and 6). As described above, down-regulation of Smad4 expression and Smad4 complex formation by oncogenic Ras was accompanied by an increase in the level of Smad4* (lane 7). However, Smad4 degradation and the decrease in Smad2/3 and Smad4 complex formation were prevented by treatment of the cells with ALLN in presence of IPTG (lane 8). The TGF-β-induced carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 and the relative expression levels of Smad2 or Smad3 remained unchanged under identical experimental conditions (Fig.5 A). In a similar experiment, lactacystin, a highly specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, was used (23Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Addition of lactacystin restored the level of Smad4 in the IPTG-treated cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). These results suggest that oncogenic Ras causes a decrease in complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 by degrading Smad4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Oncogenic Ras propagates a signal through the activation of protein kinases including the ERK-MAP kinases. Treatment of the cells with PD98059 (an inhibitor of the MEK/ERK pathway) completely prevented Ras-induced degradation of Smad4 and restored TGF-β-mediated complex formation between Smad4 and Smad2/3 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). In contrast, SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity) failed to inhibit Smad4 degradation and subsequent restoration of its complex formation (lanes 11 and 12). Another MEK inhibitor, U0126, showed similar results as PD98059 (data not shown). These results indicate that the MEK/ERK pathway is involved in Smad4 degradation after Ras activation. The ability of Smads to regulate specific transcriptional programs in response to TGF-β requires nuclear translocation of Smad4 to functionally cooperate with other transcription factors (24Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1745-1754Crossref Google Scholar). To test whether oncogenic Ras-mediated degradation of endogenous Smad4 can interfere with its nuclear accumulation, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on RIE:iRas cells treated with or without IPTG and/or TGF-β. As expected, nuclear localization of Smad4 in response to TGF-β1 was observed in the absence of IPTG (Fig.6 A). However, nuclear accumulation of Smad4 in response to TGF-β was dramatically reduced from 89 to 29% after induction of oncogenic Ras by IPTG. This translocation of Smad4 to the nucleus was restored 72 h after withdrawal of IPTG, correlating with the restoration of complex formation between Smad4 and Smad2/3. These observations indicate that Ras activation causes degradation of Smad4, resulting in the inhibition of Smad4 complex formation and decreased Smad4 nuclear translocation. To investigate whether activated Ras-mediated inhibition in the nuclear accumulation of Smad4 has any functional consequences on transcriptional activation, RIE:iRas cells were co-transfected with p3TP-Lux reporter (25Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), which is highly responsive to TGF-β. Treatment of the cells with TGF-β enhanced the promoter activity in the RIE:iRas cells in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 6 B,top panel). IPTG treatment of the cells significantly reduced the TGF-β-induced reporter activity. Cotransfection with Smad4 partially restored TGF-β-mediated induction in 3TP-Lux promoter activity in the presence of IPTG in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, the exogenously expressed HA-tagged Smad4 levels were also decreased in the presence of activated Ras (Fig. 6 B, bottom panel). Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism by which oncogenic Ras suppresses TGF-β transcriptional signaling and growth inhibition by targeting Smad4 for degradation. Activating mutations of the Ki-ras gene occur with high frequency during the progression from adenoma to carcinoma in the colon and probably contribute to tumor progression (7Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). Cells harboring oncogenic Ras mutations often acquire a loss of TGF-β antiproliferative responses. Although previous data have suggested a mechanism for oncogenic Ras-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling by down-regulating Smad2/3 nuclear accumulation (13Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), they do not appear to fully explain the broad spectrum of the effects of activated Ras on TGF-β signaling. Ras and TGF-β interactions may contribute to the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells. Here we have further investigated the molecular mechanism by which oncogenic Ras inhibits TGF-β signaling. Our results demonstrated that Smad4 was degraded in the presence of activated Ras through the MEK/ERK pathway. This decrease in Smad4 resulted in decreased complex formation between Smad2/3 and Smad4 and a decrease in Smad4 nuclear translocation. Reversal of activated Ras restored Smad4 levels and partially restored TGF-β growth-inhibitory responses. Exogenous expression of Smad4 largely restored the TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and TGF-β-mediated transcriptional responses. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant role for proteasome-mediated regulation of Smad proteins. Smurf2, a member of the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligase, was shown to target both Smad1 and Smad2 for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (26Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J.

Previous studies have shown that a missense mutation in the MH1 domains of Smad2 and Smad4 identified in some colorectal and pancreatic cancers results in rapid degradation of these mutant Smads through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (22Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The half-life of Smad4 containing an arginine mutation in the MH1 domain was reported as 1.5 h as compared with the 6-h half-life of wild-type Smad4 when overexpressed in COS1 cells (22Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the present study we observed that the half-life of wild-type Smad4 was decreased from 8 to 3 h as a result of oncogenic Ras expression. Our results showing that the Ras-mediated decrease in Smad4 levels is abrogated by the treatment with ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitors suggest that the decrease in Smad4 is mediated by proteasomal degradation. Thus targeting of Smads for ubiquitin-mediated degradation may be a common mechanism whereby cancer cells abrogate the Smad tumor suppressor function. The appearance of the smaller molecular weight protein band (Smad4*) that is recognized by the anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibody after induction of Ras is consistent with the process of protein degradation, and this Smad4* also coprecipitates with Smad2/Smad3. Whether this fragment may have any dominant negative effect on TGF-β/Smad signaling is an interesting question that is currently under investigation. We observed a near-complete degradation of endogenous Smad4 by 72 h after the induction of Ras. This degradation appears to be dependent on ERK/MAP kinase activation as suggested by the abrogation of this effect with two different MEK inhibitors. Smad4 functions as an inhibitor of Ras-dependent ERK signaling activity in Ras-transformed keratinocytes, and loss of Smad4 function in these cells results in hyperactivation of ERK signaling and progression to undifferentiated carcinomas (16Iglesias M. Frontelo P. Gamallo C. Quintanilla M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, by causing Smad4 degradation, Ras activation may prevent the inhibitory modulation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. This may provide an autostimulatory mechanism that could result in excessive activation of Ras/MEK/MAP kinase and thereby promote a more aggressive malignant phenotype. Previous reports have described that neoplastic transformation of intestinal, lung, liver, or mammary epithelial cells confers resistance to antiproliferative responses to TGF-β (28De Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that degradation of Smad4 by activation of Ras results in a dramatic decrease in the complex formation with Smad2/3, and subsequently translocation of Smad4 to the nucleus is inhibited. Smad signaling is essential for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition (28De Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies indicated that over-expression of Smad4 results in a significant recovery of TGF-β-mediated inhibition in [3H]thymidine incorporation and TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses despite the presence of the oncogenic Ras. This incomplete recovery of TGF-β responses may be due to the partial degradation of the exogenously expressed Smad4 along with the endogenous Smad4 and/or as a result of the persistent inhibitory phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in the linker region as described previously by Kretzschmar et al. (13Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In addition, transformation of the RIE-1 cells with the rasoncogene causes other effects such as an increase in cyclin D1 that may be sufficient to partially overcome TGF-β growth-inhibitory effects (29Shao J.

Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We conclude that oncogenic Ras may block Smad-dependent antiproliferative responses to TGF-β in epithelial cells by two different mechanisms: 1) by early termination of Smad signaling through Smad4 degradation (our data) and 2) by negative regulation of Smad2/3 through phosphorylation in the linker region (13Kretzschmar M.

https://openalex.org/W2048404650,"DOC-2/DAB2 (differentially expressed in ovariancarcinoma-2/disabled2) appears to be a potential tumor suppressor gene with a growth inhibitory effect on several cancer types. Previously, we have shown that DOC-2/DAB2 suppresses protein kinase C-induced AP-1 activation, which is modulated by serine 24 phosphorylation in the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2. However, the functional impact of the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2, containing three proline-rich domains, has not been explored. In this study, we examined this functional role in modulating signaling mediated by peptide growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, particularly because it involves the interaction with Grb2. Using sequence-specific peptides, we found that the second proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2 is the key binding site to Grb2 in the presence of growth factors. Such elevated binding interrupts the binding between SOS and Grb2, which consequently suppresses downstream ERK phosphorylation. Reduced ERK phosphorylation was restored when the binding between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 was interrupted by a specific peptide or by increasing the expression of Grb2. Furthermore, the C terminus of the DOC-2/DAB2 construct can inhibit the AP-1 activity elicited by growth factors. We conclude that DOC-2/DAB2, a potent negative regulator, can suppress ERK activation by interrupting the binding between Grb2 and SOS that is elicited by peptide growth factors.

Using the same technique, our laboratory cloned the rat homologue from a degenerated prostate gland.

Taken together, these data indicate that DOC-2/DAB2 is a potent growth inhibitor. We examined the mechanism(s) of the DOC-2/DAB2-elicited growth inhibitory pathway in prostate cancer cell lines. We found that phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 at the extreme N-terminal region by protein kinase C suppresses AP-1 activity. Specifically, the phosphorylation of serine 24 in the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 is the key amino acid residue modulating its inhibitory effect (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J.

Hsieh, manuscript submitted.which suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 is involved in the RAS-mediated signal pathway. The C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2, on the other hand, interacts with Grb2, which is an adapter protein critical in bridging signal transduction between the activated protein receptor tyrosine kinase (RPTK) and the RAS-mediated MAP kinase cascade (8Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 432-442Google Scholar, 9Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the binding between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 is undefined. Therefore, we investigated this relationship using two RPTK ligands: epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT3). We demonstrated in four different cell lines that RPTK activation increases the binding of DOC-2/DAB2 (particularly the C terminus) to Grb2. This binding further leads to a decrease in the activation of the downstream effector, ERK phosphorylation, and AP-1-mediated gene transcription. Our data illustrate the underlying mechanism of the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 in modulating RPTK activation. A rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. C4-2, NbE, and COS cells were maintained in T medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (3Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Four peptides were synthesized corresponding to the protein sequence of DOC-2/DAB2: PPQ (amino acids 619–627); PPK (amino acids 714–722); PPL (amino acids 663–671); and LLL (amino acids 663–671, the substitution of proline with leucine).

For peptide transfection, cells were plated in a 24-well plate with serum-free medium for 24 h. ChariotTM reagent (Active Motif) was mixed with 100 ng of different oligopeptides according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 h after transfection, cells were treated with growth factors, and cell lysate was prepared at the indicated time. After transfection, cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml of EGF or recombinant NT3 (Upstate Biotechnology). The cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with 1% of Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) at the indicated time. After a low speed spin, 0.4 ml of supernatant was separately incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 60 µl of GST-Grb2-glutathione Sepharose or GST-glutathione Sepharose. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed twice with the lysis buffer, dissolved in the sample buffer, and then subjected to Western blot analysis probed with either monoclonal antibody against DOC-2/DAB2 (αp96) (Transduction Laboratories) or against the T7 tag (αT7) (Novagen). The cells were co-transfected with both DOC-2/DAB2 expression vectors and 0.6 µg of Grb2 expression vector (pHM6-Grb2). Using the same treatment protocol, cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer.

The pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer, dissolved in sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis detected by the antibody against T7 tag (αT7). Transfected cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml of EGF or NT3 for 10 min and were collected in 70 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (with 1% of Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors). After a low speed spin, 20 µl of supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis. The filter was probed with the antibody against phosphorylated ERK p44/42 (New England Biolab), and the same filter was stripped and reprobed with antibodies against either total ERK 1/2 (p44/42) or p42 (New England Biolab). The AP-1-Luciferase reporter construct (−73/+63-Col-Luc) (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and internal control β-gal vector (pCH110) were used with various DOC-2/DAB2 cDNA expression vectors. The cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml of EGF or recombinant NT3 for 16 h. Both luciferase and β-galactosidase were assayed (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The data from the reporter gene activity were normalized with β-galactosidase activity. In a previous study (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we showed that the C terminus, but not the N terminus, of DOC-2/DAB2 binds to Grb2. In this study, we investigated the effect of growth factors on this binding. Because DOC-2/DAB2 is expressed in brain tissue (4Schwahn D.J. Medina D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1171-1178Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and prostate epithelia (3Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we chose two RPTK systems: NT3/trkC cascade in PC12 cell and EGF/EGFR cascade in C4-2 cells. PC12 cells were co-transfected with pAC-CMV-trkC and T7-p82 cDNAs and then treated with NT3 (50 ng/ml) for the indicated time. The cell lysate was prepared and subjected to Grb2-GST binding assay. As shown in the upper panel of Fig.1A, a basal level interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 was detected in the PC12 cells; a similar result was shown previously (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, binding of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2 increased 5 min after treatment with NT3, and increased binding remained constant throughout the entire course of treatment. This indicates that trkC activation can immediately increase the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2. The same expression levels of DOC-2/DAB2 expression were detected in each lane (Fig. 1 A, lower panel), and this rules out the possibility of a transfection artifact. In the other RPTK signaling system (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), increased binding of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2 occurred in a time-dependent manner in a prostatic epithelial cell line (C4-2) treated by EGF. Also, as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1 B, an equal amount of DOC-2/DAB2 protein expression was detected at each time point. There was difference in the Grb2 binding kinetics between NT3-treated PC12 cells and EGF-treated C4-2 cells. For example, EGF showed a slower rate of Grb2 binding than did NT3. Peak binding of Grb2 occurred 20 min after EGF treatment, compared with 5 min after NT3 treatment. Such difference may influence the effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on the downstream pathway mediated by these two growth factors. In addition to data obtained from the in vitro binding assay, we used co-immunoprecipitation to examine the intracellular interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2. As shown in Fig. 1(C and D), the complex containing DOC-2/DAB2 significantly increased in the presence of either NT3 or EGF compared with the control. EGF also increased the intracellular interaction between the Grb2 and DOC-2/DAB2. Data from both Grb2 and co-immunoprecipitation assays indicate that the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 was enhanced under the stimulation of peptide growth factors, which suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 may play a regulatory role in RPTK-mediated signaling. As we described, the C terminus but not the N terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 interacts with Grb2 (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether growth factors increase the affinity of the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2, we performed Grb2 binding assay using the N-terminal deletion mutant of DOC-2/DAB2 (T7-ΔN). We wanted to validate this interaction using different cell types. Therefore, COS cells were reconstituted with trkC in the presence of either T7-p82 or T7-ΔN construct. As expected, stimulation with NT3 significantly increased the binding of Grb2 to both DOC-2/DAB2 and the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 (Fig.2A). This elevated binding was not caused by variable expressions of T7-p82 or T7-ΔN proteins because equal amounts of these proteins were detected. Similarly, Grb2 binding to DOC-2/DAB2 or to the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 also increased with EGF treatment (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that the binding domain of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2 is located in the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2. There are three proline-rich domains in DOC-2/DAB2 with the same consensus sequence as the SOS binding site to Grb2. Therefore, all three domains may be involved in Grb2 binding. To compare the binding affinity of these proline-rich sequences, four oligopeptides were synthesized according to the DOC-2/DAB2 protein sequence: PPQ (amino acids 619–627); PPL (amino acids 663–669); LLL (amino acids 663–669 with all proline residues substituted with leucine residues); and PPK (amino acids 714–722). Using the in vitro GST-Grb2 binding assay, the PPL peptide blocked the binding of either T7-p82 or T7-ΔN proteins to GST-Grb2, whereas the PPQ peptide had no effect (Fig.3A). Moreover, we prepared cell lysates from NbE cells (a normal rat prostatic epithelial cell line with the endogenous expression of DOC-2/DAB2 proteins) to determine the in vitro binding of DOC-2/DAB2 proteins to Grb2. As shown in Fig. 3 B, PPL effectively blocked the binding in a dose-dependent manner compared with the other two peptides (i.e. PPQ and PPK). The effective dose of PPL in COS and NbE cells was very similar, suggesting that the binding kinetics of these proteins remains consistent in different cell lines. The proline residues in this domain are critical for binding because the peptide with leucine substitution (i.e. LLL) cannot affect the binding between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 (Fig. 3 B). These data clearly indicate that the second proline-rich domain in the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 is the key interactive site with Grb2. DOC-2/DAB2 interrupts the binding of Grb2 with SOS Interaction between the Grb2 protein, and the activated receptor can initiate translocation of a group of proteins, namely guanine nucleotide exchange factors (such as SOS), which modulate the GTPase activity of RAS. As shown in Fig. 4, stimulation with EGF increased the binding of Grb2 to SOS in COS cells with no detectable levels of DOC-2/DAB2. However, increased expression of p82 levels in COS cells diminished the binding of Grb2 to SOS, which indicates that DOC-2/DAB2 and SOS compete for the same SH3 site in Grb2. Grb2 is a key adapter protein for the growth factor-induced MAP kinase pathway (11Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). To understand the impact of the interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 on this pathway, we examined the phosphorylation status of ERK kinase in the presence of DOC-2/DAB2. Upon the treatment of growth factors, ERK phosphorylation reflected the activation of ERK kinase (12Robbins D.J. Cheng M. Zhen E. Vanderbilt C.A. Feig L.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). ERK activation is transient. It peaks at 10 min and then returns to a basal level within 30 min. As shown in Fig.5A, the basal level of phosphorylated ERK was very low in PC12 cells without NT3 treatment. The addition of DOC-2/DAB2 did not alter this level. In contrast, increasing phosphorylation of ERK1 (44 kDa) and ERK2 (42 kDa) was detected in PC12 cells 10 min after NT3 treatment. Furthermore, NT3-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 decreased profoundly in the presence of either full-length DOC-2/DAB2 (T7-p82) or the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 (T7- ΔN). Such a change was not caused by the decrease of ERK1/2 protein levels (Fig. 5 A,middle and lower panel). Without EGF treatment, the basal level of ERK2 phosphorylation was lower in C4-2 cells than in PC12 cells (Fig. 5 B). With EGF treatment, phosphorylation levels of ERK kinases, mainly ERK2 (42 kDa), were elevated. The presence of either T7-p82 or T7-ΔN dramatically suppressed EGF-induced ERK2 phosphorylation. However, the steady-state levels of the ERK2 protein remained the same. These data indicate that ERK2 phosphorylation was inhibited when DOC-2/DAB2 proteins decrease the availability of Grb2 to SOS. Decreased ERK phosphorylation appears to be a potent downstream event that results from the binding between DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2. We examined whether increased expression of Grb2 restores the ERK phosphorylation status in cells treated with growth factors. As shown in Fig. 5(C and D), in the absence of either NT3 or EGF, transfection of the Grb2 expression vector failed to induce ERK phosphorylation because Grb2 alone is not capable of activating the growth factor-induced downstream signal pathway (8Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 432-442Google Scholar). In contrast, in either EGF-treated C4-2 or NT3-treated PC12 cells, transfection of the Grb2 expression vector did restore the decreased ERK phosphorylation induced by T7-p82 proteins. This suggests that DOC-2/DAB2 binding to Grb2 is a key step in inactivating ERK phosphorylation. Because the second proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2 is a key binding site to Grb2, we investigated whether blocking this binding also affects the ERK phosphorylation status in cells stimulated with growth factors. To do this, NbE cells were transfected with either PPL or LLL peptide, and the ERK phosphorylation status in EGF-treated NbE cells was determined. As shown in Fig. 6(A and B), minutes after EGF treatment, the ERK2 phosphorylation increased about 3–4-fold compared with basal level. PPL enhanced ERK2 phosphorylation about 20-fold. It peaked 10 min after EGF treatment, whereas LLL failed to have the same effect, indicating that PPL can specifically prevent the sequestering Grb2 by the second proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2. These “free” Grb2 molecules amplify signal transduction via the downstream cascade, such as the activation of ERK kinase. Similarly, PPL but not LLL can also antagonize the inhibitory effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on EGF-induced gene transcription (Fig. 6 C). The overall activity of the reporter gene in this experiment was lower than usual because cell death became more apparent when cells were incubated with both LipofectAMINE and ChariotTM transfection agents. Nevertheless, these data further indicate that one mechanism of DOC-2/DAB2 is to balance the growth factor-induced signal by modulating the availability of effector protein such as Grb2. To determine whether the binding of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2 has any impact on RPTK-mediated gene activation, we chose the AP-1 reporter gene assay. AP-1 is activated in PC12 cells upon treatment with neurotrophin (13Gutacker C. Klock G. Diel P. Koch-Brandt C. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and it is the downstream target of RPTK via Grb2 and ERK (14Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Suppression on ERK activation indicates that RPTK-induced AP-1 activation may also be affected. As shown in Fig. 7A, NT3 induced activation of the AP-1 reporter gene in PC12 cells. In the presence of increasing amounts of T7-p82, the NT3-induced AP-1 activity was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. In C4-2 cells, the EGF-induced AP-1 activation was also suppressed by T7-p82 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B). From these results, we believe that the C-terminal recombinant protein has the same inhibitory effect on AP-1 as native DOC-2/DAB2. As depicted in Fig. 7 (C and D), both T7-p82 and T7-ΔN inhibited NT3- and EGF-induced AP-1 activity with similar magnitude. Thus, the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2, which contains the Grb2-binding domain(s), is critical to modulate the RPTK-mediated gene expression that is mediated through ERK phosphorylation. Grb2 is a potent adaptor protein. It contains both SH2 and SH3 domains in modulating RPTK-elicited signaling. The SH2 domain directly recognizes phosphotyrosine motifs and is thereby recruited to activated, phosphorylated RPTK. This interaction helps the recruitment of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (i.e. SOS) through the binding of the SH3 domain, which subsequently stimulates RAS-GTP binding. The RAS-mediated MAP kinase cascade, a key pathway controlling growth and differentiation, further leads to gene transcription by activating several transcription factors. We and others have shown that DOC-2/DAB2 can interact with Grb2 through its C terminus (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of this interaction has not been elucidated. In this study, we manipulated PC12 cell lines without DOC-2/DAB2 expression such as C4-2 and with different DOC-2/DAB2 cDNA constructs. We found that activation of RPTK by its own ligand also increases the binding of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2, which interrupts the binding of SOS to Grb2 (Figs. 1 and 4). We also demonstrated that the second proline-rich domain in the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 protein is the key site responsible for the Grb2 binding that prevents a sequential change in the downstream region of the RPTK-mediated pathway (Figs. 3 and 5), including suppressing ERK phosphorylation. We used a cell line (NbE) that expresses endogenous DOC-2/DAB2 to demonstrate the interaction between endogenous DOC-2/DAB2 and Grb2 proteins. We showed that this interaction appears to be sequence-specific because only peptides with the same sequence as the second proline-rich domain of DOC-2/DAB2 can interrupt Grb2 binding, whereas substitution of key proline residues with leucine residues abolishes its inhibitory function (Fig. 3). Moreover, increasing Grb2 expression in C4-2 cells by using the transient transfection of the Grb2 expression vector alters the inhibitory effect of DOC-2/DAB2 (Fig.5). We conclude that this inhibitory effect on the MAP kinase pathway results from sequestering Grb2 away from recruiting downstream signaling effectors such as SOS. Therefore, DOC-2/DAB2 represents a potent homeostatic factor that modulates many exogenous stimulus-mediated signal pathways. To characterize the effect of DOC-2/DAB2 on the RPTK-mediated pathway, we studied two classic ligands in three different cell lines. NT3, which interacts with its receptor trkC, is an important neurotrophin for neuronal development and plasticity. Because other members of the disabled family (i.e. DAB1) have been associated with neuronal development (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and DOC-2/DAB2 is present in brain tissue, we employed PC12 cells (a well established cell model for studying neuronal differentiation) to examine the possible role of DOC-2/DAB2 in NT3-induced signaling. Our results (Figs. 1 Aand 3 A) demonstrate that DOC-2/DAB2 can block the transient activation of ERK kinase that is considered a mitogenic signal (18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar) even though neurotrophins can induce a sustained activation of ERK kinase, which can last for several hours in PC12 cells and is related to neuronal differentiation (19York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). However, we failed to observe any inhibition of the second phase of ERK activation in the presence of DOC-2/DAB2 (data not shown). These results imply that DOC-2/DAB2 may modulate the mitogenic effect of NT3. This function differs from DAB1 protein in neuronal cells. EGF, a potent mitogen for cell growth, elevation, and EGFR amplification and/or mutation is associated with the progression of many cancer types (20Khazaie K. Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) including prostate cancer (21Ware J.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Data from our laboratory and others indicate that DOC-2/DAB2 is a tumor suppressor, which is absent in many cancer types (1Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A.

Xu X.-X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 may block EGFR-mediated signaling by sequestering Grb2 (Fig. 1) from the upstream of the cascade. This blocking essentially deactivates several key effectors such as ERK and AP-1 (Figs. 3 and 7). Several studies show that unregulated activation of ERK can cause cell transformation (22Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that AP-1 activation is crucial to angiogenesis and neoplastic invasion (23McCarty M.F. Med. Hypotheses. 1998; 50: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, our recent publication indicates that the serine 24 phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 inhibits protein kinase C-mediated gene activation (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Taken together, we believe that DOC-2/DAB2 represents a unique negative regulator. Upon exogenous stimulus, it demonstrates multiple actions on signaling cascade. The underlying mechanism regarding the increased affinity of DOC-2/DAB2 to Grb2 by growth factors is still unknown. Our data (Figs. 1 and 2) indicate that this is a rapid event and that the steady-state levels of DOC-2/DAB2 do not change. Therefore, post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, is likely. Unlike with DAB1 (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we did not detect any tyrosine phosphorylation in DOC-2/DAB2 (data not shown). Xieet al. (24Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) report that colony-stimulating factor-1 induces serine phosphorylation in DOC-2/DAB2, but they did not determine the key amino acid(s) responsible for this event. We demonstrated that the phorbol ester also induces serine phosphorylation in the N terminus but not in the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 (7Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, post-translational modification of DOC-2/DAB2 may play a role in this event because there are several potential ERK phosphorylation sites in the C terminus of DOC2/DAB2 (24Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Alternatively, however, we cannot rule out that the presence of other factor(s) may facilitate this interaction upon stimulation with growth factors. Therefore, more detailed study is warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2139339609,"NIK, a recently identified Nck-interacting kinase, acts upstream of the MEK kinase MEKK1 to activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK. We now show that NIK binds to and divergently activates the plasma membrane Na+-H+exchanger NHE1. In a genetic screen, NHE1 interacted with NIK at a site N-terminal (amino acids 407–502) to the Nck-binding domain, and this site is critical for its association with NHE1 in vivo. NIK also phosphorylates NHE1; however, the phosphorylation sites, which are distal to amino acid 638, are distinct from the NIK-binding site on NHE1 (amino acids 538–638). Expression of wild-type, but not a kinase-inactive, NIK in fibroblasts increased NHE1 phosphorylation and activity. The kinase domain of NIK, however, was not sufficient for this response in vivo. Full phosphorylation and activation of NHE1 required both the kinase and the NHE1-binding domains of NIK, suggesting that the NHE1-binding site functions as a targeting signal. The functional significance of an interaction between NIK and NHE1 was confirmed by the ability of a kinase-inactive NIK to selectively inhibit activation of NHE1 by platelet-derived growth factor but not by thrombin. Moreover, although NIK activates JNK through a mechanism dependent on MEKK1, it phosphorylated and activated NHE1 independently of MEKK1. These findings indicate that NIK acts downstream of platelet-derived growth factor receptors to phosphorylate and activate NHE1 divergently of its activation of JNK.

Each of these modules includes a hierarchy of kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, that are activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs),1 which in turn are activated by MKK kinases (MKKKs) (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase modules are regulated by plasma membrane receptors for growth factors, hormones, and cytokines (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin.

The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase modules by receptor tyrosine kinases is probably best understood, and this is mediated by the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Nck (3Avruch J. Mol. Cell.

Adaptor proteins relay signals to divergent signaling pathways by the binding of their SH2 domains to a phosphotyrosine moiety and the binding of their SH3 domains to proline-rich sequences in effector molecules. The adaptor protein Nck interacts via its single SH2 domain with activated tyrosine kinase receptors and with insulin receptor substrate-1 (5Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The biological significance of the association of Nck with these effector proteins, however, is not known. Recently, Skolnik and co-workers (13Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) determined that the SH3 domains of Nck also bind to a novel serine/threonine kinase, NIK (Nck-interacting kinase). Subsequent studies identified Misshapen (Msn) as a Drosophila homolog of NIK (14Su Y.C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and determined a direct association between Msn and Dock, the Drosophila homolog of Nck (15Ruan W. Pang P. Rao Y. Neuron. 1999; 24: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NIK belongs to the SPS1 family of Ste20-related serine/threonine kinases, which includes the germinal center kinase (GCK) and hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (16Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These related kinases have N-terminal kinase domains, C-terminal regulatory domains, and no binding domains for Rac or Cdc42 GTPases. In contrast, members of the PAK family of Ste20-like kinases have N-terminal regulatory domains, C-terminal kinase domains, and a p21 binding domain for Rac and Cdc42 (18Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 19Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although the upstream regulation of NIK has not been clearly elucidated, NIK and Msn directly interact with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor TRAF1 and with the adaptor proteins Nck and Dock, respectively (13Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Ruan W. Pang P. Rao Y.

Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently NIK kinase activity was shown to be activated by EphB1 and EphB2 receptors (22Becker E. Huynh-Do U. Holland S. Pawson T. Daniel T.O. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, genetic analysis indicates that Msn acts downstream of Frizzled receptors and Disheveled to mediate Wnt signaling (23Paricio N. Feiguin F. Boutros M. Eaton S. Mlodzik M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4669-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Downstream, NIK couples to the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) through a MEKK1- and MKK4-dependent pathway (13Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regulatory domain of NIK interacts with MEKK1, and NIK activation of JNK is inhibited by dominant-inactive MEKK1 and MKK4 (13Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We have determined that the Na+-H+ exchanger, NHE1, is also a downstream target of NIK. NHE1 is a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane ion exchanger that regulates intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and cell volume through an electroneutral exchange of extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+. The structural topology of NHE1 includes a series of 12 membrane-spanning α helices that collectively function in ion translocation and a relatively long (300 amino acids) C-terminal cytoplasmic regulatory domain (24Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain binds to a number of regulatory proteins (25Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The association between NHE1 and NIK was determined by using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with the NHE1 C-terminal regulatory domain, and an in vivo association was confirmed in fibroblasts. We found that NHE1 is a substrate for NIK kinase activity; however, an NHE1-binding site C-terminal to the kinase domain of NIK and a NIK-binding site N-terminal to the phosphorylation domain of NHE1 are required for this response, indicating that the kinase activity of NIK is not sufficient, but that a direct binding between these proteins is also required. We also found that NIK kinase activity is required for activation of NHE1 by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Moreover, although we previously reported that NHE1 acts downstream of MEKK1 in a pathway regulated by Rac and Cdc42 GTPases (32Hooley R., Yu, C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), our current findings indicate that NIK activates NHE1 independently of MEKK1. Myc-tagged wild-type NIK and kinase-inactive NIK containing a D152N substitution in the catalytic domain (NIK-D152N) subcloned into pRK5 were provided by E. Y. Skolnik (New York University Medical Center) and previously characterized (13Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation, wild-type NIK was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (pB-NIK). A truncated NIK containing only the N-terminal kinase domain (amino acids 1–357) (NIKΔ357) was obtained by restriction digestion of pB-NIK with ClaI and PstI and subcloned into the FLAG-tagged pCMV-Tag2A vector (Stratagene). A truncated NIK containing the N-terminal kinase domain and the NHE1-binding domain (amino acids 1–533) (NIKΔ533) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, incorporating a BamHI restriction site on the 5′ end and aHindIII site on the 3′ end, and subsequently cloned in-frame into pCMV-Tag2A. Myc-tagged dominant-activated p160ROCK (ROCKΔ3) and PAK(T423E) were provided by S. Narumiya (Kyoto University) and J. Chernoff (Research Institute of Scripps Clinic), respectively, and were previously characterized (30Tominaga T. Narumiya S. Barber D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 33Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). HA-tagged wild-type MEKK1 and kinase-inactive MEKK1 (D1369A) were obtained from M. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), HA-tagged mutationally activated RacL61 was obtained from M. Symons (Picower Institute for Medical Research), and HA-tagged JNK was provided by M. Karin (University of California San Diego). The full-length C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human NHE1 (amino acids 503–815) and C-terminal fragments containing truncations or deletions were subcloned into pGEX vector, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with NHE1 were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously described (30Tominaga T. Narumiya S. Barber D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 (nucleotides 1536–2463) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified incorporating an NdeI site on the 5′ end and a BamHI site on the 3′ end and subsequently cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the yeast expression vector pAS2.1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Using common techniques (34Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), the yeast strain Y190 was first transformed with the resulting vector, pKWN8, and then with a 9.5-days post-conception murine cDNA fusion library in the VP16 acidic activation domain expression vector pVP16 (courtesy of S. Hollenberg, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Seattle, WA). 1.8 × 106 transformants were plated on minimal dextrose medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 1 week. Positive clones were streaked for single isolates and tested for β-galactosidase expression. To help eliminate false positives, we routinely re-transformed the isolated plasmid into Y190 pKWN8 to confirm the interaction and swapped the bait and prey between GAL41–147 and VP16 acidic activation domain vectors. The library plasmid was then isolated using cycloheximide counter-selection and transferred from yeast into bacteria, and the cDNA insert was sequenced and analyzed using the BLAST algorithm with the NCBI nucleotide data base. Chinese hamster lung CCL39 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). CCL39 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish, maintained for 18 h, and transfected with the indicated cDNAs (3–6 µg) using the Transfast method (Promega). The cells were maintained in transfection medium for 6 h and then transferred to DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were used 18 h after transfection. HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 in 100-mm dishes for 18 h and then transfected with 4–6 µg of DNA using the Superfect transfection method (Qiagen). pcDNA3.1 vector was used to balance total transfected DNA. COS-7 cells stably expressing NHE1 tagged at the C terminus with an HA epitope were established by co-transfection of pRSV-neo (1.0 µg) with NHE1 plasmid (10 µg of pCMV-NHE1) using the LipofectAMINE transfection method (35Tominaga T. Barber D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2287-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cell clones were screened for the localization of NHE1 in the plasma membrane by indirect immunofluorescence and for the abundance of NHE1 by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using anti-HA IgG 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-NIK or FLAG-tagged truncated NIK were maintained for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml aprotinin). The total cell lysate was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-protein assay. 500 µg of the total cell lysate was incubated with GST-NHE1 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. The binding of NIK to GST-NHE1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies. Wild-type COS-7 cells and COS-7 cells stably expressing NHE1-HA were transfected with Myc-NIK or FLAG-tagged truncated NIK using the LipofectAMINE transfection method (35Tominaga T. Barber D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2287-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were maintained for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed as described above. Cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose or with anti-chicken IgY-agarose, normalized to total protein concentration, and incubated with anti-HA antibodies (12CA5;Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-NHE1 antibodies for 60 min at 4 °C. The NHE1 antibody was developed by our laboratory and generated in chickens using a fusion protein of residues 639–815 (GST-NHE1 639–815, obtained from Larry Fliegel, University of Alberta). The immune complexes were collected after incubation with protein A-Sepharose or anti-IgY-agarose (60 min; 4 °C), washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. The presence of NIK and the abundance of NHE1 in the immune complexes were determined by immunoblotting with anti-NHE1, anti-NIK (Santa Cruz), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG (Sigma), or anti-HA antibodies. In vitro-translated NIK was produced by using the transcription/translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Briefly, 50 µl of in vitro translation mixture (37.5 µl of transcription/translation (TNT) lysate, 2 µl of reaction buffer, 1 µl of TNT RNA polymerase, 1 µl of amino acid mixture without methionine, 2 µl of [35S]methionine, 1 µl of RNase ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 µg of pB-NIK, and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 µl) was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. In vitro-translated 35S-labeled NIK was resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography. In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating 35S-labeled NIK with GST-NHE1 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with binding buffer. The bound complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Total cell lysates from HEK293 cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged NIK, PAK(T423E), ROCKΔ3, or NIK-D152N were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and immunoprecipitated with 5 µl of anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). For determining JNK kinase activity, coexpressed HA-tagged JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA IgG 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The immune complexes were collected after centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. An aliquot of the immune complex was used for immunoblotting to determine the expression of transfected kinases. For kinase reactions, the immune complex was washed once with wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with 5 µg of myelin basic protein, GST or GST-NHE1 (638), GST-NHE1 (501), or c-Jun as indicated. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 µl of pre-mixed kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 1 µmNa3VO4, 10 µm ATP, 0.5 µCi of [λ-32P]ATP) and maintained at 30 °C for 20 min. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Substrates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and incorporation of 32P was determined by autoradiography. COS-7 cells stably expressing HA-tagged NHE1 were transfected with NIK, NIK-D152N, NIKΔ357, or NIKΔ533, serum-starved for 18 h, and then incubated with phosphate- and serum-free medium for 2 h. Cells were labeled by adding [32P]orthophosphate (100 µCi/ml) for an additional 3 h. After the labeling period, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 12.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm ATP, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors). The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, precleared with protein A-Sepharose, normalized to total protein concentration, and then incubated with anti-HA IgG (12CA5;Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. One-third of the immunoprecipitated proteins was used for immunoblotting to detect NHE1 expression. NHE1 activity and pHi were determined in populations of CCL39 fibroblasts and HEK293 cells as previously described (35Tominaga T. Barber D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2287-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 36Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4721-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by imaging single CCL39 cells. For cell populations, cells plated on glass coverslips were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% serum for 16–18 h, transferred to a nominally HCO 3−-free Hepes buffer, and loaded with 1 µm acetoxymethyl ester derivative of the pH-sensitive dye 2,7-biscarboxylethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C without CO2. The Hepes buffer contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm Mg2Cl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, and 30 mm Hepes titrated to pH 7.4. The coverslips were placed in a thermostatically controlled (37 °C) cuvette holder within a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorometer and perfused at a continuous flow rate of 2 ml/min using a 4-channel peristaltic pump. 2,7-Biscarboxylethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein fluorescence was measured by alternately exciting the dye at 500 and 440 nm at a constant emission of 530 nm. Fluorescence ratios were converted to pHi by calibrating each experiment with 10 µmnigericin (Molecular Probes) in 105 mm KCl, as previously described (37Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated activation of NHE1 was determined by including thrombin (30 nm; Enzyme Research Labs) or PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) during the prepulse and acid recovery periods. NHE1 activity was determined by measuring the pHi recovery from an acid load induced by prepulsing cells for 10 min with 30 mm NH4Cl (38Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The pHi-dependent rate of pHirecovery (dpHi/dt) was calculated by evaluating the derivative of the slope of the time-dependent pHi recovery at pHiintervals of 0.05. To determine single-cell NHE1 activity, cells were plated onto 10-mm glass coverslips at 35% confluency in 35-mm wells, then transfected 24 h before pH analysis with 1.6 µg of pRK5-NIKD152N and 0.4 µg of pIH3-CD8, a plasmid expressing the CD8+ antigen (courtesy of Dr. Brian Seed, Harvard University), using a 5:1 ratio of Superfect reagent (Quiagen, Valencia CA). Immediately after transfection, the cells were transferred into DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS overnight. The following day, cells were loaded with 2,7-biscarboxylethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein as described above, and coverslips were placed in a superfusion chamber mounted on a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope interfaced with an imaging workbench (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Cells were washed briefly with anti-CD8+ antigen-coated Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) in solution 1 (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 0.33 mmNaH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with Tris base). Bead-coated cells were identified visually. To induce an intracellular acid load, cells were perfused first with solution 2, in which 30 mm NaCl was replaced with NH4Cl, followed by solution 3, in which NaCl was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine. Cells were excited at 490 and 440 nm and emitted fluorescence measured at 530 nm. Measurements were taken every 10 s over a 5-min period after the onset of Na+-dependent recovery. Intracellular pH was estimated by in situ calibration of theF 490/F 440 fluorescence ratio using the nigericin high K+ method (37Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). On each coverslip, the recovery of from 4 to 8 transfected cells was monitored, averaged, and compared with the recovery of from 4 to 8 nontransfected cells examined in parallel. Four coverslips were assayed, creating 4 sets of averaged data, for a total of 16–32 cells in each control and experimental group. For these four sets of averaged data, the rate of pH change was compared with the internal pH using a scatter plot, and the best linear fit of the data was determined. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 functions as a regulatory domain to confer changes in ion translocation by the transmembrane domain. We previously used a genetic screen to identify a novel Ca2+-binding protein, CHP, which binds directly to the C terminus of NHE1 to regulate ion translocation (27Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To identify additional NHE1-interacting proteins, we used the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of rat NHE1 (amino acids 512–820) as bait to screen a 9.5–10.5 days post-conception embryonic library. Positive clones detected by a combination of HIS3 and β-galactosidase expression were selected and analyzed. Two out of 30 selected clones revealed a partial sequence (amino acids 407–520) of the serine/threonine kinase NIK. The yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that a NIK fragment between amino acid residues 407 and 520 was sufficient for binding to NHE1. As shown in Fig.1, adjacent to the NHE1-binding site are N-terminal proline-rich motifs that bind to Nck, and overlapping the Nck- and NHE1-binding sites is a binding site for TRAF1 (21Liu H. Su Y.C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Additionally, at the distal C terminus is a MEKK1-binding site that is critical for NIK activation of JNK (13Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Further confirmation of the NHE1-binding site was obtained by using a pull-down assay. Lysates prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressing either a C-terminal-truncated NIKΔ533, which contains both the N-terminal kinase domain and the NHE1-binding domain, or a C-terminal-truncated NIKΔ357, which contains the kinase domain but not the NHE1-binding domain, were incubated with GST alone or with GST-NHE1 (503). Although the expression of both constructs in total cell lysates was comparable, the binding of NIKΔ533 was more than 10-fold greater than that of NIKΔ357 (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.2 A, full-length NIK also bound to NHE1 in a similar assay.Figure 2NIK-binding site on NHE1. A and B, GST-NHE1 fusion proteins were incubated with lysates prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressing full-length Myc-NIK (A) or kinase inactive Myc-NIK-D152N (B). Bound NIK was precipitated and visualized by immunoblotting as described in Fig. 1 B. The NHE1 fusion proteins included C-terminal amino acid residues 503–815, 538–815, 503–670, and 638–815. C, 35S-labeled in vitro-translated NIK was incubated with GST-NHE1 fusion proteins containing C-terminal residues as indicate"
https://openalex.org/W2007785530,"Rho family members play a critical role in malignant transformation. Anchorage-independent growth and the ability to avoid apoptosis caused by loss of anchorage (anoikis) are important features of transformed cells. Here we show that constitutive activation of Rac1 inhibits anoikis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. Constitutively active Rac1-V12 decreases DNA fragmentation and caspase activity by 50% in MDCK cells kept in suspension. In addition, expression of Rac1-V12 in MDCK cells in suspension conditions causes an increase in the number of surviving cells. We also investigated the signaling pathways that are activated by Rac1 to stimulate cell survival. We show that expression of Rac1-V12 in MDCK cells in suspension stimulates a number of signaling cascades that have been implicated in the control of cell survival, including the p42/44 ERK, p38, protein kinase B, and nuclear factor κB pathways. Using specific chemical or protein inhibitors of these respective pathways, we show that Rac1-mediated cell survival strongly depends on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and that activation of ERK, p38, and NF-κB are largely dispensable for Rac1 survival signaling. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that Rac1 can suppress apoptosis in epithelial cells in anchorage-independent conditions and suggest a potential role for Rac1-mediated survival signaling in cell transformation.

Using specific chemical or protein inhibitors of these respective pathways, we show that Rac1-mediated cell survival strongly depends on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and that activation of ERK, p38, and NF-κB are largely dispensable for Rac1 survival signaling. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that Rac1 can suppress apoptosis in epithelial cells in anchorage-independent conditions and suggest a potential role for Rac1-mediated survival signaling in cell transformation. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase Madin-Darby canine kidney doxycycline protein kinase B nuclear factor κB activating transcription factor-2 glycogen synthase kinase-3 Members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins mediate a large number of biological processes that are stimulated by growth factors, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. The functions that are regulated by these GTPases include the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the regulation of lipid metabolism, gene transcription, and vesicle trafficking (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases also play an important role in cell transformation (2Symons M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For example, we showed that expression of a constitutively active (hydrolysis-defective) Rac1 mutant in Rat1 fibroblasts induces serum- and anchorage-independent growth and is tumorigenic in nude mice (4Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a dominant negative Rac1 mutant that is impaired in GTP binding inhibited the serum- and anchorage-independent growth of Ras-transformed Rat1 cells (5Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been made by a number of other laboratories (6Khosravi-Far R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Ras-induced activation of Rac1 is thought to occur via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 (8Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The PI3K-Rac1 branch of Ras signaling appears to function largely independently from the Raf/MEK/ERK and the RalGDS/Ral pathways (8Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D.

Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutively active versions of Rac1 and Raf strongly synergize with each other in cell transformation (4Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 6Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rac1 can also cooperate with Raf to activate ERK (10Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 11Leng J. Klemke R.L. Reddy A.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37855-37861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting one possible mechanism that could contribute to Rac1-induced cell transformation. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 strongly activates the transcription factor NF-κB (12Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), suggesting that NF-κB may play a role in Rac1-stimulated transformation. In line with this idea is the observation that NF-κB is required for transformation by oncogenic Ras (14Jo H. Zhang R. Zhang H. McKinsey T.A. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. Ballard D.W. Liang P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that Rac is essential for Ras-induced NF-κB activation (12Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1 also activates and/or modulates a number of other signaling events that have been implicated in growth control. These include the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways and the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). The precise role of any of these signaling elements in Rac1-stimulated cell proliferation remains to be elucidated (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 3Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Many mammalian cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells, are dependent on integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrix for cell survival and proliferation. The acquisition of anchorage-independent growth is considered to be a hallmark of cell transformation (15Freedman V.H. Shin S.I. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In normal epithelial and endothelial cells, prevention of cell attachment to extracellular matrix results in the rapid activation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) (16Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 17Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). This form of apoptosis is also termed anoikis (16Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Thus, anoikis may represent an important defense mechanism of the organism against aberrant cell proliferation and migration (18Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar, 19Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Rac1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell survival, but its precise role in survival signaling remains highly controversial. For instance, studies in hematopoietic cells have shown that expression of constitutively active Rac in some conditions can induce apoptosis (20Lores P. Morin L. Luna R. Gacon G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Kawazoe N. Watabe M. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Nakaya K.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A similar situation holds for fibroblasts (24Esteve P. Embade N. Perona R. Jimenez B. del Peso L. Leon J. Arends M. Miki T.

In this paper, we investigate the role of Rac1 in epithelial cell survival in suspension. For this study we use the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell line, a well established system for the study of anoikis (16Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 29Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 30Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our results show that expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 protects MDCK cells against anoikis and that PI3K plays an important role in this Rac1-mediated survival function. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, supplemented with 20 ng/ml doxycycline (DC) (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To achieve transgene expression, MDCK cells were cultured in media containing 0–200 pg/ml DC 24 h prior to the experiments. Immunoblotting was performed with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-phospho-ERK p42/44 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho ATF-2 (Thr71), anti-phospho GSK-3 (Ser9) (New England Biolabs), anti-IκBα, anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-Myc tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A secondary antibody blot was performed with either an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (at 1:2000 dilution). The following small molecule inhibitors were used: MEK inhibitor U0126 (Promega), p38 inhibitor SB203580, and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem). The establishment and characterization of MDCK cell lines expressing constitutively active Rac1-V12 and dominant negative Rac1-N17 in a tetracycline-repressible fashion have been described previously (32Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To establish MDCK cell lines that inducibly express an IκBα super-repressor mutant (IκBαM), we generated a tetracycline-repressible expression construct containing the IκBα-S32A,S36A double mutant cDNA (33Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 35Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) by cloning it in the pTRE2 vector (CLONTECH). The pTRE2-IκBαM construct was co-transfected with the zeocin resistance marker, pCMV-ZEO (Invitrogen), into MDCK-Rac1-V12 and the T23 tet-off parental cells. MDCK-Rac1-V12 cells transfected which failed to integrate the IκBαM construct were used as a selection marker control. Clonal populations were selected in 500 µg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα antibody (UBI). Cells were induced for 24 h as a monolayer and subsequently trypsinized and cultured in suspension on ultra low cluster plates (Costar) at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml for 0–18 h. Cells were then pelleted and lysed for 30 min. The level of DNA fragmentation was quantified using the Cell Death ELISA kit (quantifying histone-associated DNA fragments) using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Roche). Lysates assayed were equivalent to 7.5 × 104 cells. Cells were induced and cultured as for the DNA fragmentation assay, except that extracts were collected from 6 × 105 cells and harvested at 0, 4 and 6 h in suspension. Extracts were assayed for caspase activity using the ApoAlert Caspase-8 Fluorescent Assay Kit using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). This kit measures the fluorescence of the IETD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) cleavage product and in addition to caspase 8 also reflects the activities of caspases 9 and 10 (36Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysis buffer was composed of 1% triton, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm TRIS-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Extracts were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted. Blots were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NF-κB promoter activity was assayed using two types of luciferase constructs driven either by a wild-type or mutant E-selectin-promoter (37Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a promoter containing five NF-κB binding elements (pNF-κB luc, Stratagene). As an internal control, reporter constructs were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pRL-CMV, Promega). MDCK cells were plated on 35-mm dishes and were 50–60% confluent on the day of transfection. Transfections with the E-selectin-promoter constructs were carried out using the GenePorter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems). Reporter and control plasmids were mixed with GenePorter reagent at a ratio of 1:3 and added to the cells in the absence of serum for 4 h. Transfections with pNF-κB luc were carried out with Effectine reagent (Qiagen) using a protocol that is optimized for MDCK cells. The cells were incubated for 4–5 h in the presence of serum using a ratio of 1 µg of total DNA (950 ng of pNF-κB luc and 50 ng of pRL-CMV) to 5 µl of Effectine reagent, yielding an estimated transfection efficiency of 20–25% as determined using a green fluorescent protein control plasmid. For both protocols, transfected cells were divided into two pools (kept in either 0 or 20 ng/ml DC) that were incubated in monolayer for 24 h and subsequently split and cultured in monolayer or suspension at a density of 1.5 × 105/ml for an additional 18 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested and assayed for NF-κB activity by measuring the level of reporter and control luciferase activity using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). In vitro kinase assay kits (New England Biolabs) were used to assess the levels of p38 and PKB/Akt activity in MDCK suspension cells. Extracts were made from1.5 × 106 cells that were induced and cultured in suspension for 2 h as described above, using the lysis buffer as supplied by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation of either activated p38 or total PKB was carried out for at least 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer, and kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 200 µm ATP and 2 µg of ATF-2 or 1 µg of GSK-3 to assay for p38 and PKB activity, respectively. The reactions were then terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred as described above and blotted with either anti-phospho ATF-2 or anti-phospho GSK-3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (New England Biolabs). We have studied the role of Rac1 in cell survival in anchorage-independent conditions using stable cell lines that express constitutively active Rac1-V12 or dominant negative Rac1-N17 under the control of a tet-repressible promoter in MDCK cells (38Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 39Barth A.I. Pollack A.L. Altschuler Y. Mostov K.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These cell lines have the dual advantage of displaying relatively homogenous levels of expression after induction of the transgene, in addition to allowing regulation of transgene expression levels by titration of the concentration of DC in the medium (32Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Upon complete removal of DC from culture medium for 42–48 h, these cells show expression levels of Rac1-V12, which are similar to that of endogenous Rac1 (Fig.1A). Culture of these MDCK cells in suspension does not significantly alter transgene expression levels in the absence of DC (data not shown). MDCK cells readily undergo apoptosis when cultured in suspension conditions, as indicated by a number of criteria, including increased DNA fragmentation, annexin V staining, and caspase activation (16Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 30Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the absence of Rac1-V12 expression, MDCK cells cultured in suspension for 18 h show significant DNA fragmentation (an ∼40-fold increase over monolayer conditions) (Fig. 1 B). Cells expressing Rac1-V12 exhibit decreased levels of DNA fragmentation, and this decrease correlates with Rac1-V12 expression levels (Fig. 1 B). Complete removal of DC lowers DNA fragmentation to about 50% of that obtained in cells cultured in the presence of 20 ng/ml DC. This Rac1-V12-induced inhibition of DNA fragmentation is detectable as early as after 8 h in suspension conditions (Fig. 1 C). We also used caspase activation as a read-out for apoptosis. Prevention of attachment of MDCK cells rapidly stimulates caspase activity, measured by the fluorescence of caspase 8 substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1 D). Expression of Rac1-V12 inhibits suspension-induced caspase activation by ∼50% (Fig. 1 D). This level of inhibition is comparable with the reduction in the extent of DNA fragmentation caused by Rac1-V12 (Fig.1 B). The inhibitory effect of Rac1-V12 on anoikis was confirmed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling stain (data not shown). We also verified that DC itself had no effect on apoptosis. Removal of DC from parental MDCK cells has no effect on either the extent of suspension culture-induced DNA fragmentation or caspase activation (Fig. 1, C and D). To confirm that Rac1 enhances the survival potential of MDCK cells in suspension, we performed a viability assay. Cells expressing Rac1-V12 and controls were kept in suspension for 18 h and then replated onto normal tissue culture dishes. Cell viability was quantified by the sulforhodamine B assay (40Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8663) Google Scholar). Whereas only 40% of the control cells are viable, up to 80% of the RacV12 expressing cells survived after culture in suspension (data not shown). In contrast, continuous expression of the Rac1-V12 transgene had no significant effect on the growth properties of adherent MDCK cells in monolayer conditions over a 72-h period (data not shown). We also examined the effect of inhibiting the activation of endogenous Rac1 on anoikis. MDCK cells induced to express Rac1-N17 transgene display a 2-fold higher DNA fragmentation in suspension relative to control cells (Fig. 2A). Rac1-N17 expression also led to a marked increase in apoptosis in adherent cells. These data, together with our results that Rac1-V12 increases cell survival in suspension conditions, strongly indicate a role for Rac1 in the regulation of anoikis. We next investigated the signaling mechanisms that are utilized by Rac1 to stimulate cell survival in suspension. Rac1 has been shown to stimulate the activity of NF-κB (12Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and this transcription factor plays an important role in the control of cell survival (41Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether Rac1-V12 can activate NF-κB in MDCK cells in suspension conditions, we used a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter, E-selectin-luc (37Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the NF-κB activity in control cells was dramatically attenuated in suspension conditions, cells that express Rac1-V12 in suspension maintain a level of NF-κB activity that is similar to that observed in adherent conditions (Fig.3A). An E-selectin promoter construct in which two of the three NF-κB binding sites are mutated and that is no longer responsive to NF-κB (37Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was largely unaffected by Rac1-V12 expression (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained using a different NF-κB-responsive luciferase construct, containing a minimal promoter with five upstream canonical NF-κB elements (Fig. 3 B). In resting cells, NF-κB is kept in the cytosol as a complex with IκB inhibitory proteins. Activation of NF-κB involves phosphorylation of IκB on two serine residues by the IκB kinase complex, leading to proteolytic degradation of IκB. Subsequently, free NF-κB can enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription. To test whether NF-κB contributes to Rac1-mediated inhibition of anoikis, we established a set of MDCK cell lines that inducibly express a super-repressor mutant of IκBα (IκBα-S32A,S36A or IκBαM) (33Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 35Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) from the same tetracycline-repressible promoter used for the Rac1-V12 transgene (see “Experimental Procedures”). IκBαM cannot be phosphorylated and remains constitutively bound to NF-κB in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing nuclear entry of NF-κB and subsequent transcription of NF-κB target genes. Co-expression of IκBαM with Rac1-V12, for a representative set of cell lines tested (C3, C4, and A6) strongly inhibits Rac1-V12-induced activation of NF-κB when compared with a Rac1-V12-expresssing control cell line (C4) (Fig. 3 B). The level of inhibition of NF-κB activation roughly correlates with IκBαM expression levels (Fig.3 B, inset). The basal level of NF-κB activity, measured in the presence of doxycycline, is similar in the lines that co-express IκBαM with Rac1-V12 and the one that only expresses Rac1-V12. In two of the cell lines (MDCK-Rac1-V12/IκBαM-C3 and -C4), co-expression of IκBαM inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activity to below the level that is obtained in the absence of Rac1-V12, indicating that the expression level of IκBαM in these lines is sufficient to inhibit basal, nonstimulated transcriptional activity. Interestingly, however, cell lines that co-express Rac1-V12 and IκBαM show a similar degree of resistance to anoikis to that of cell lines that express Rac1-V12 only (Fig. 3 C). In particular, a cell line that displays total inhibition of Rac-V12-induced NF-κB activation (Rac1-V12/IκBαM-C4) still shows strong protection from anoikis. These experiments indicate that activation of NF-κB is dispensable for Rac1-mediated inhibition of anoikis. The Raf-MEK-p42/44 ERK cascade is an extensively characterized effector pathway that is activated by the Ras proto-oncogene. Activation of this pathway contributes to cell cycle progression as well as cell survival (42Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 43Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence that Rac1 can directly activate the ERK pathway, Rac1 can synergize with Raf to activate ERK (10Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H.

In light of these studies, we examined the role of ERK in Rac1-mediated inhibition of anoikis. In adherent MDCK cells, ERK appears to be activated in a constitutive fashion, as suggested by high levels of phosphorylated ERK (Fig.4A). This high level of ERK activation persists in cells that are serum-starved for 48 h (data not shown). MDCK cells expressing Rac1-V12 do not significantly increase the level of phospho-ERK. Interestingly, cell detachment of control MDCK cells from extracellular matrix in the presence of 10% serum leads to rapid down-regulation of ERK activation, followed by a slow recovery (Fig. 4 A). Rac1-V12-expressing cells, however, maintain a much higher level of phospho-ERK in comparison with cells that are kept in doxycycline, indicating that expression of Rac1-V12 strongly stimulates ERK activity in suspension conditions. To examine the role of ERK signaling in Rac1-mediated cell survival, we used the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126 (44Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S.

In the presence of 10 µm U0126, ERK activation in suspension cultures was almost completely inhibited in both MDCK-Rac1-V12 and control cells (Fig. 4 B). We verified that at this concentration, Rac1-V12 transgene expression was not significantly affected (Fig.4 C). At higher concentrations (30–100 µm), however, Rac1-V12 transgene expression was strongly inhibited (data not shown). Even in the absence of ERK activation, Rac1 still fully protects suspension cells from anoikis (Fig. 4 D), indicating that ERK activation is dispensable for Rac1-induced cell survival in suspension. Activation of Rac1 has been shown to stimulate both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 stress kinase cascades (45Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

https://openalex.org/W1993912281,"Monoamine oxidase is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that catalyzes the deamination of a number of neurotransmitters and dietary amines. To determine the roles of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids on the activity and solubility of human monoamine oxidase (MAO B), 10 sequential mutants were made with stop codons at amino acid positions 511, 504, 498, 492, 486, 481, 476, 467, 417, and 397, respectively. All truncated mutants were expressed in Sf21 insect cells using baculovirus, and the enzyme kinetic parameters were determined. Truncations at amino acid positions 511, 504, and 498 slightly decreased MAO B catalytic activity and had no significant changes on deprenyl inhibition. Further deletions up to amino acid 417 decreased the specific activity 10–100-fold without significant changes of the K mfor phenylethylamine or dopamine or the IC50 for deprenyl and clorgyline. The truncation mutant C397, which lacks covalently attached FAD, was inactive. Progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations up to position 481 were correlated with increased solubility of MAO B mutants. 47% of the activity of the truncated C481 was found in the 105,000 × g supernatant in the absence of detergent. However, further truncated mutants, C476, C467, and C417, remained associated with the membrane fraction. In contrast to crude homogenate, the water-soluble C481 mutant was rapidly inactivated at 4 °C and 37 °C, which indicates that the membrane environment is required for the stability of MAO B. Expression of the green fluorescent protein-MAO B C481 fusion protein revealed that this mutant was located in the cytoplasm, whereas its counterpart in MAO A, truncated mutant C490, was located on the mitochondria. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 417–520 of MAO B are not directly involved in the active site but are required for maintaining the appropriate conformation and interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane. The different solubilities of the various carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants indicate that the interaction of MAO B with mitochondrial membrane is not simply anchoring through the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic tail. Further, our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal of MAO A and B plays different roles in mitochondrial attachment.

Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). MAO A and B are encoded by different genes (2Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MAO A preferentially oxidizes serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and is irreversibly inhibited by low concentrations of clorgyline. MAO B preferentially oxidizes phenylethylamine (PEA) and benzylamine, and it is irreversibly inactivated by low concentrations of pargyline and deprenyl. Dopamine, tyramine, and tryptamine are common substrates for both MAOs. MAO A and B consist of 527 and 520 amino acids, respectively, and have a 70% identity (2Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L.

Each type of enzyme has a FAD covalently linked to a cysteine residue, Cys-406 in MAO A and Cys-397 in MAO B, through an 8α-(S-cysteinyl)-riboflavin (5Walker W.H. Kearney E.B. Seng R.L. Singer T.P.

MAO A and MAO B exhibit identical exon-intron organization, and they are probably derived from the duplication of a common ancestral gene (7Grimsby J. Chen K. Wang L.-J. Lan N. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The physiological role of MAO in neurotransmitter metabolism and its relation to behavior was recently reviewed (1Shih J.C. Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MAOs lack the typical amino-terminal hydrophobic region flanked by the positively charged residues, which is common to a large group of outer mitochondrial anchored proteins (10Shore G.C. McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Steenaart A.E. Nguyen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 55 amino acids in the amino-terminal of the rat MAO B had no effect on the targeting and insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane after expression in mammalian cells (11Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial anchoring of rat liver MAO B was shown to be within the carboxyl-terminal residues 492–520 by the fusion of this segment to a carboxyl terminus of cytochrome b5, which directed this chimeric protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane (11Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the truncation mutant of human MAO A lacking the putative membrane anchor (the last 24 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues) was still found in the membrane fraction (12Weyler W. J. Neural Transm. 1994; 41 (suppl): 3-15Google Scholar). A particular importance of the carboxyl-terminal portions of MAOs for catalytic activity was demonstrated in a study of MAO A/MAO B chimeric proteins (13Chen K. Wu H.F. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The partial model of MAO did not provide any information on the structural elements interacting with the outer mitochondrial membrane because of the lack of sufficient homology of MAO to proteins with known three-dimensional structure (14Wouters J. Baudox G. Proteins. 1998; 32: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The structure of maize flavin-containing polyamine oxidase was recently solved (15Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Structure. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This soluble enzyme has about 20% homology to MAO and lacks a corresponding carboxyl-terminal stretch of about 50 amino acids found in MAO. This further suggests a possible carboxyl-terminal anchoring of MAO to membrane. In the last decade, MAO has been expressed in mammalian cell lines (16Lan N.C. Chen C.H. Shih J.C. J.

However, these expression systems have limitations including a low level of expression (mammalian cells and yeast), lack of covalently attached FAD, or proper folding of MAO (bacteria). In the present study, we report the solubilization and the purification of catalytically active MAO B expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The advantages of this expression system for MAO are the simplicity and the efficiency of producing large quantities of enzyme needed for crystallization and structural studies. We have studied the role of the carboxyl-terminal 123 amino acids of human MAO B by generating 10 sequential truncation mutants spanning amino acid positions 397–520. We constructed recombinant baculovirus, expressed the truncated mutants in insect cells, and analyzed the role of the carboxyl-terminal region on activity, solubility, and stability of this enzyme. Using specific and common substrates and inhibitors, we show that the carboxyl-terminal end is essential for interaction with the membrane but not directly involved in the active site of MAO B. All chemicals (analytical grade) were obtained from Sigma. Insect cell culture media components were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Gentamycin, antibiotic-antimycotic, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. C8POE was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). A cDNA clone encoding human MAO B (2Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proper orientation of the insert was verified by digesting the vector with restriction enzymes and sequencing. Recombinant MAO B encoding virus was produced by homologous recombination on the cotransfection of Sf21 cells with the vector and linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen) using the calcium phosphate method. Recombinant baculovirus was isolated by plaque purification and amplified by infection of insect cells at a multiplicity of infection of one (MOI = 1). After three to four passes, a viral stock with a titer of 108plaque-forming units/ml was produced. Fusion constructs of GFP with MAO A and MAO B and their respective truncation mutants at position 481 (C481 for MAO B and C490 for MAO A) were prepared by subcloning the cDNA encoding human MAO isoenzymes in toEcoRI and KpnI restriction sites of the BioGreen pAcHTL-A plasmid (PharMingen). The single- or double-stop codons were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the positions indicated below directly into pVL1392-hMAOB.

(Stop codons are underlined and mutagenic bases are indicated in bold.) The amino acid sequences for the carboxyl-terminal segments of MAO B and all truncation mutants are shown in Fig.1. Small scale expression of carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of MAO B was carried out in an adherent culture of Sf21 cells. 150-mm cell culture dishes were seeded with 20 × 106 Sf21 cells, and recombinant virus was added at MOI = 2. The cells were incubated at 27 °C for 72–80 h and then harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g. Large scale expression of MAO B was carried out in a suspension culture of Sf21 cells using five 1 liter spinner flasks (Kontes). The Sf21 cells at a density of 1.8–2.0 × 106cell/ml (2.5 liters of total volume of suspension) were infected with high titer recombinant MAO B baculovirus stock at MOI = 1. Cells were harvested 75–80 h post-infection by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed once with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) to remove serum proteins from the growth medium. After resuspending Sf21 cells in homogenization buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the cells were lysed in a glass/Teflon loose fitting homogenizer. Mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation of homogenate between 1,000 × g for 5 min and 20,000 × g for 20 min and washed twice. 85% of the original MAO B activity was found in crude homogenate, which can be stored several months at −80 °C without any loss of activity. Enzyme activity was determined radiochemically using [14C]PEA as substrate (6Wu H.-F. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar). When dopamine was used as the substrate, the reaction products were separated and quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection. In a typical dopamine assay, the reaction is carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 20 min. The assay mixture contained enzyme preparation, and the reaction was started by the addition of dopamine (0.5–2.0 mm final concentration, depending on K m) in a total volume of 200 µl. The conversion of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaldehyde to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was carried out by adding to the reaction mixture 1 unit of yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase, NAD (5 mm), dithiothreitol (50 nm), and nicotinamide (5 µm). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 µl of ice-cold solution of 0.2 n perchloric acid containing 10 mm sodium metabisulfite and 5 mmEDTA. After mixing with a Vortex, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of HPLC mobile phase containing 1 µmisoproterenol as an internal standard. HPLC separation of dopamine assay mixture was performed at ambient room temperature on a 150 × 4.6-mm reverse phase analytical column packed with C-18 spherical 3-µm particles (Luna II, Phenomenex). A 4 × 3-mm C18 guard cartridge was installed between the Shimadzu automated sample injector and the analytical column. A 50-µl aliquot of the prepared sample was injected onto the column. The mobile phase contained 75 mmmonobasic sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.8, 1 mm sodium octyl sulfate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 13.5% (v/v) acetonitrile. The column flow rate was 1 ml/min. The electrochemical detector was set at +0.7 V. The signal from the detector was integrated by peak area using Class VP software (Shimadzu). Standards of dopamine and DOPAC were injected onto the column for calculation of an unknown amount of reaction product. The inhibitory effects of deprenyl and clorgyline on the activity of MAO B and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants were estimated by using [14C]PEA as substrate. The enzyme preparations were preincubated in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitors for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the determination of activity. All catalytic measurements were carried out in triplicates, and mean values are shown; all standard errors of the mean (S.E.) were less than 5–10%. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) with modifications (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Whole cell homogenates or proteins at various stages of purification were denatured by boiling for 5 min in sample buffer (60 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerin, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The samples were subjected to 0.75-mm gels consisted of 4% stacking and 10% separating gels using Bio-Rad Miniprotean gel apparatus. The separation was carried out at constant current at 30 V for stacking gels and at 100 V for separating gels. Electrotransfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) was carried out at 4 °C in transfer buffer containing 15.6 mm Tris base, 100 mm glycine, and 15%(v/v) methanol at constant current of 120 V for 90 min. Immunodetection of MAO B was performed at ambient room temperature. Nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with blocking buffer containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in TBS (10 mmTris/Cl buffer, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h. Nitrocellulose membrane was washed three times for 10 min in TBS and incubated with rabbit anti-MAO B serum (diluted 1:2000 in TBS containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) overnight. The nitrocellulose membrane was rinsed three times for 10 min with TBS and incubated for 2 h with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled antibody) at 1:2000 dilution in TBS containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Finally, the filter was rinsed three times for 10 min with TBS, and the membrane was developed with diaminobenzidine solution (50 ml of TBS containing 50 mg of diaminobenzidine and 30 µl of 30% (v/v) H2O2). The reaction was stopped by rinsing the membrane with water. Protein was determined by the bicinchronic method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fluorescent microscopy of GFP-MAO fusion proteins was performed on a DM IRB inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with I3 blue (excitation range, 450–490 nm), N2.1 green (excitation range, 515–560 nm), and UV/blue/green filter (excitation range, 400/20, 495/15, and 570/20 nm) cubes (Chroma). 75 h post-infection, insect cells were harvested, centrifuged for 3 min at 750 ×g, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and seeded on a glass slide. To visualize mitochondria, the cell suspension was incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) in TBS for 10 min. Expression of MAO B in Sf21 insect cells is shown in Fig.2. Baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells resulted in the appearance of a major band with aM r of 60 kDa compared with mock-infected cells on the SDS gel. The MAO B band was found to represent up to 25% of total protein in membrane preparations. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and MAO B was extracted by the addition of C8POE in four steps using increasing detergent concentrations (5.0, 7.0, 15.0, and 17.5 mm). After incubating for 1 h at room temperature on a rotary shaker, mixtures were centrifuged for 1 h at 105,000 × g. Most of the MAO B (45% yield by activity) was recovered in the soluble S100 supernatant of extracts containing 15 and 17.5 mm C8POE. Extraction at lower concentrations of detergent (5.0 and 7.0 mm, which are slightly below the critical micellar concentration) was not sufficient to solubilize the MAO B but was beneficial for removing impurities, which interfere with further purification by absorption chromatography. Increasing the detergent to a higher concentration than 17.5 mm during solubilization did not lead to an increase in solubility; instead it inhibited enzyme activity. Solubilized MAO B was mixed with 100 ml of 50% (v/v) suspension of hydroxyapatite (Biogel HT, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm C8POE. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and resuspended four to five times during this incubation. Hydroxyapatite was collected by low speed centrifugation (5 min at 1,000 × g), and after washing with equal volumes of absorption buffer, the protein was eluted with phosphate buffer containing 10 mm C8POE by a stepwise increase in the concentration of the phosphate buffer (100, 200, 300, and 400 mm). Fractions at 100 and 150 mm phosphate buffer (end concentration) containing the bulk of MAO B activity (27% overall yield) were combined, and the buffer was exchanged to 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm C8POE by concentration in Amicon pressurized cells using YM-100 membrane. Concentrated MAO B with a protein concentration of up to 15 mg/ml was stored at −80 °C after the addition of 50% (v/v) glycerol to prevent aggregation. The purity of the final preparation was more than 95% in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2). The typical yield from 5 liters of Sf21 insect cell culture was 10–15 mg of electrophoretically homogeneous MAO B. Small scale expression was conducted in an adherent cell culture of Sf21 cells at MOI = 2 for all carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants and full-length wild type MAO B. At 75 h post-infection with recombinant baculovirus, cells were harvested, washed, and lysed with several strokes in glass/Teflon homogenizer in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Crude cell homogenates were used for activity assays and electrophoretic analysis. Specific activities of carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant proteins compared with wild type MAO B are shown in Fig. 3 A. There was a slight decrease in specific activity for C511, C504, and C498 and a large decrease (>10-fold) for the C492, C486, C481, C476, C467, and C417 mutants. C397 mutant protein lacking covalently attached FAD was completely inactive despite the fact that the protein was expressed to the same level as wild type MAO B. The level of expression for all mutant proteins was approximately the same as full-length wild type MAO B as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-human MAO B antibody (Fig. 3 B). There was no difference in expression patterns between carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants containing one (C511, C504, C498, C492, C486, C467, and C417) or two stop codons (C481, C476, and C397). A stepwise gradual decrease of the molecular weight of the MAO B band was correlated with the progression of truncations. No trace of full-length MAO B could be detected in cell homogenates of carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants by Western blot analysis. Table I summarizes the results of catalytic characterization of MAO B and its carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant proteins using PEA and dopamine as specific and common substrates, respectively. The effects of irreversible MAO inhibitors, deprenyl and clorgyline, were also studied. A slight decrease in V max for PEA (4-fold) and dopamine (2-fold) was found in carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants up to position 498. Further truncations of MAO B lead to a 10–100-fold drop in V max values. A larger decrease in V max was observed with PEA, a MAO B-specific substrate, when compared with dopamine, the common substrate for both types of MAO. The decrease inV max, however, was not associated with changes in K m, which were almost the same for all carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant proteins as for the full-length MAO B. On the other hand, a gradual increase in K m for dopamine was observed with progression of truncations up to position 476. The C481 and C476 mutant proteins have 5–6-fold increases inK m for dopamine compared with the full-length enzyme. Further truncation mutants (C467 and C417) displayedK m values for dopamine 1.5–2.0 times higher than those of nontruncated MAO B. Similarly, an increase in IC50for deprenyl and clorgyline was observed in inhibition experiments with carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants up to position C476 (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters and IC50 values of MAO B and its carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants expressed in Sf21 cellsEnzymeSubstrateInhibitor1-aInhibition experiments were carried out using 10 µm PEA as substrate.[14C]PEADopamineDeprenyl IC50 10−9mClorgyline IC50 10−7mKmV maxK mV maxµmnmol/min/mgµmnmol/min/mgMAO B1.53 ± 0.588.52 ± 0.1793 ± 44.83 ± 0.0123.80 ± 0.0854.72 ± 1.07C5111.16 ± 0.086.49 ± 0.1976 ± 64.86 ± 0.0153.75 ± 0.353.71 ± 0.93C5041.50 ± 0.664.41 ± 0.26103 ± 43.05 ± 0.0114.27 ± 0.086.07 ± 1.97C4982.06 ± 0.951.99 ± 0.25225 ± 122.51 ± 0.0106.98 ± 1.576.03 ± 1.78C4921.41 ± 0.340.43 ± 0.07200 ± 150.43 ± 0.0146.60 ± 0.577.43 ± 0.48C4861.85 ± 0.510.107 ± 0.017202 ± 110.21 ± 0.096.76 ± 2.0912.7 ± 2.4C4812.15 ± 0.520.054 ± 0.022495 ± 150.165 ± 0.01319.65 ± 3.1519.38 ± 5.56C4762.19 ± 0.550.049 ± 0.008601 ± 180.185 ± 0.00520.35 ± 4.3515.86 ± 3.04C4671.53 ± 0.590.279 ± 0.076193 ± 120.180 ± 0.0117.86 ± 0.806.71 ± 0.91C4171.73 ± 0.330.086 ± 0.009157 ± 70.110 ± 0.0034.91 ± 0.207.86 ± 1.54C3971-bNo measurable activity of the C397 mutant protein was detected with both substrates.——————K m and V max values of the wild type and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” V maxis expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein.

Homogenates of Sf21 insect cells after the expression of MAO B and carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were resuspended in the same volume as the original homogenate. MAO B activity in homogenate, S100 supernatant, and pellet samples was measured using dopamine as substrate. The activities of MAO B retained in S100 extracts are summarized in Fig.4 A. The full-length MAO B and C511, C504, and C498 mutant proteins were in pellets after ultracentrifugation as demonstrated by the lack of significant activity found in the S100 fraction. The carboxyl-terminal truncated mutants C492, C486, and C481 show increased activity in the S100 soluble fraction: 10.1, 22,3, and 47.8% of activity in crude homogenates, respectively. However, significant activities of the truncation mutants C476, C467, and C417 were found again in the membrane fraction. The retention of the C481 truncated protein in S100 extract was further analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Fig.4 B). Full-length MAO B was tightly associated with the membrane fraction, whereas the C481 protein after ultracentrifugation was found distributed evenly in the S100 extract and membrane fraction.

The Rho polypeptide has a distinct RNA binding domain of known structure as well as an ATP binding domain for which a structure has been proposed based on homology modeling. Treatment of Rho with H2O2 in the presence of Fe-EDTA caused single-cut cleavage at a number of points that coincide with solvent-exposed loops in both the known and predicted structures, thereby providing support for the validity of the tertiary and quaternary structural models of Rho. The binding of ATP caused one distinct change in the cleavage pattern, a strong protection at a cleavage point in the P-loop of the ATP binding domain. Binding of RNA and single-stranded DNA (poly(dC)) caused strong protection at several accessible parts of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding (OB) fold in the RNA binding domain. RNA molecules but not DNA molecules also caused a strong, ATP-dependent protection at a cleavage site in the predicted Q-loop of the ATP binding domain. These results suggest that Rho has two distinct binding sites for RNA. Besides the site composed of multiples of the RNA binding domain, to which single-stranded DNA as well as RNA can bind, it has a separate, RNA-specific site on the Q-loop in the ATP binding domain. In the proposed quaternary structure of Rho, the Q-loops from the six subunits form the upper entrance to the hole in the ring-shaped hexamer through which the nascent transcript is translocated by actions coupled to ATP hydrolyses.

Both sequence and functional analyses have shown that Rho polypeptide has two distinct functional domains; one domain is the N-terminal RNA binding domain of residues 1–130 (RNA-BD),1 and the other is C-terminal adenosine triphosphate binding domain of residues 131–419 (ATP-BD). Sequence comparison of Rho with other proteins indicates that it has ribonucleoprotein-like motifs in the RNA-BD and several motifs that are characteristic of ATPases in the ATP-BD (reviewed in Ref. 7Richardson J.P.

A model for the tertiary structure of the Rho ATP-BD has also been proposed based on the close sequence similarity of that part of Rho with the corresponding part of the α and β subunits of the F1-ATPase (13Wood T.C. Theory and Application of Protein Homology.Doctoral dissertation. University of Virginia, 1999Google Scholar). A model for the quaternary structure of hexameric Rho has also been proposed (7Richardson J.P. J. Biol.

More recently, a low resolution, three-dimensional model of Rho has been constructed from the analysis of electron microscopic images of Rho stained with uranyl acetate (16Yu X. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This model places the six RNA-BDs at one end of a ring-shaped structure with a C6 symmetry. Although the precise orientation of the RNA binding clefts of the individual domain is uncertain, they are known to come together in the hexamer to form a single continuous cleft that is large enough to protect 60 nucleotides of poly(C) from cleavage by RNase A (4Bear D.G. Hicks P.S. Escudero K.W. Andrews C.L. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In its function as a termination factor, Rho binds initially to an attachment site, called rut (for Rho utilization), on the nascent RNA (1Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznidoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 822-848Google Scholar). This interaction presumably involves a direct interaction between the rut sequence on RNA and the RNA-binding site that extends across several RNA-BDs in the hexamer. Termination then occurs as a result of subsequent interactions of Rho with the RNA. These interactions are coupled to ATP hydrolysis and permit Rho to translocate toward the 3′ end of the transcript. Several mechanistic models have been proposed to account for the ATP-driven interaction of Rho with the RNA. In two of the models (18Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the interactions between Rho and RNA involve only contacts of the RNA with RNA-BDs in various subunits. The third model (7Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) involves contacts in the ATP-BD as well. It has been proposed that Rho has two types of RNA-binding sites (20Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); one type is a primary site that is able to bind single-stranded polynucleotides (RNA or DNA), and the other type is a secondary site that is RNA-specific and that is coupled to interactions with ATP, the hydrolysis substrate. This proposal was based on enzymatic studies in which various polynucleotides were used to activate ATP hydrolysis (20Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no direct demonstration has been made yet to identify a distinct RNA-specific site on Rho. The binding of poly(dC) by hexameric Rho is competitive with the binding of poly(C) (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and oligo(dC) binds to the isolated RBA-BD almost as well as does oligo(C) (21Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the proposed primary site is very likely composed of the RNA-BD from multiple subunits. The putative secondary site, however, could also be located in RNA-BDs and coincide with conformational changes in some of the subunits, or alternatively, it could be located elsewhere within the Rho hexamer. The results in this paper address this question. In this study, we used a protein footprinting method similar to the one developed by Heyduk and Heyduk (22Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to determine whether the binding of various ligands alters the portions of the Rho polypeptide that are exposed to solvent. In this method, mixtures of H2O2 with Fe-EDTA were used to cause partial chemical cleavage of the protein backbone. Because these reagents cleave proteins preferentially at solvent-accessible sites, this reaction was first used to test for predictions of the structural models. This method was then used to identify possible points of contact with various ligands. Both RNA and DNA caused protection at exposed parts of the OB fold in the RNA-BD, whereas only RNA caused the exposed Q-loop in the ATP-BD to be protected. These observations in conjunction with measurements of ATP hydrolysis suggest that the secondary binding site is at or near the Q-loop. All nucleotides were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Poly(C), poly(U), and poly(A) were purchased from Miles Laboratories, Inc. Poly(dC) was purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Eight-residue-long oligocytidine ((Cp)7C) was purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Oligonucleotides (U) and (A) ((Np)7N) were prepared previously (20Richardson J.P. J. Biol.

Endoproteinase Lys-C and 3,3-diaminobenzidine were products of Sigma. E. coli Rho protein was overexpressed from plasmid pCB111 and purified according to the previously published procedure (23Nowatzke W.L. Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The peptide corresponding to Rho N-terminal sequence, MNLTELKNTPVSELIT, was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Roger Roeske, Department of Biochemistry, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, as previously described (24Dolan J.W. Marshall N.F. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5747-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence, KTNDDFFEMMKRS, was synthesized by Research Genetics, Inc. Each peptide had an additional cysteine at the C-terminal end. They were reacted to Imject® maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) following the manufacture's instructions. Rabbit antisera were raised against the two conjugated peptides by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. The collected sera were lyophilized for storage and redesolved in 50% glycerol before use. The secondary antibody, the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. The different λ cro RNA derivatives were synthesizedin vitro by transcription of plasmid pIF2 using T7 RNA polymerase (25Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three DNA templates were prepared by linearizing plasmid pIF2 with either TaqI, BstXI, orBglII restriction enzymes and purified as described in Burgess and Richardson (26Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts from these DNA templates were then synthesized and purified as described by Gan and Richardson (27Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each 20-µl reaction mixture contained 0.58 µm Rho hexamer (3.2 µg), 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm potassium acetate. The concentrations of magnesium acetate, adenine nucleotides, and polynucleotides were specified in each experiment. The cleavage was initiated by adding freshly prepared 10× (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2, EDTA (pH 8.0), and H2O2 to reach a final concentration of 1, 2, and 15 mm, respectively. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by adding 6 µl of 4× SDS loading buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.4% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol, 0.4m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 m thiolurea). The products were then separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel composed of a 5% stacking gel, a 10% spacer gel, and a 16.5% separation gel in a Tricine/SDS system (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10469) Google Scholar). Rho peptide fragments cleaved at Met residues were prepared by digestion of 2 µg of Rho in 20 µl of 10 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid for 40 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of deionized distilled water. The products were lyophilized and redesolved in 1× SDS loading buffer before use. Fragments cleaved at Lys residues were prepared by incubation of 2 µg of Rho with 25 ng of Lys-C in 20 µl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 8 m urea at 37 °C for 15 min. After the electrophoresis, the separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, BA 83, 0.2 µm). The electrophoretic transfer was carried out using a Genie electrophoretic blotter (Idea Scientific) at 12 V for 2 h in the electroblotting buffer at 22 °C (25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol, pre-chilled to 4 °C). All the subsequent procedures were done at room temperature. The membranes were air-dried and then treated for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4). The membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with agitation in 30 ml of a solution containing antiserum raised against either the Rho N-terminal or C-terminal peptide conjugate diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer. The blots were then washed three times for 10 min each with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for another 1.5 h in a 1:500 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in the blocking buffer. After washing three times as before, the blots were developed in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mg 3,3-diaminobenzidine, 0.025% CoCl2, 0.02% NiCl2, and 0.03% H2O2. The blots were scanned and analyzed with IMAGEQUANT (Molecular Dynamics) to obtain the integrated intensity of each cleavage result. These data were then transferred to Microsoft EXCEL and quantified further. The differences in sample loading and cleavage efficiency were corrected based on methods described previously (29Heyduk T. Heduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Loizos N. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23378-23386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The percentage differences in cleavage intensity (protection) were calculated using the equation (I complex −I Rho)/I rho × 100, whereI complex is the corrected intensity for Rho in complex with other ligands, and I Rho is the corrected intensity for Rho alone or as indicated in each experiment. The percentage protection values presented were generated by averaging the results from at least three independent experiments. The ATPase activities of Rho induced by the binding of various nucleic acid ligands were determined as described by Nowatzke and Richardson (31Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 80 ng of Rho was incubated with 1 mm ATP at 37 °C for 5 min in 100 µl of the footprinting buffer (40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate) and RNA as indicated for each reaction. Treatment of proteins with a solution containing H2O2 and Fe(II)-EDTA causes partial cleavage of the polypeptide chain at solvent-exposed segments (22Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Heyduk T. Heduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The procedure is thus useful for probing the structure of proteins and for locating exposed regions that become blocked upon binding of ligands. To apply this approach to the structure and function of Rho factor, we first tested several conditions to find a reaction procedure that allowed partial cleavage of Rho during a relatively short incubation. Under our standard conditions, ∼25% of the polypeptides were cleaved after 5 min (Fig. 1). This extent was low enough to avoid more than one cut per molecule (22Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Bernowitz M. Senear D. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 30: 133-181Google Scholar) but high enough to generate an array of distinct products. We found in the preliminary experiments that ascorbic acid, which was used in previously published procedures (22Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Heyduk T. Heduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also, although Fe(II) was used in all the experiments presented here, we obtained identical results with Fe(III). Thus we conclude that the cleavages are caused by actions of the iron-activated H2O2 on the protein and probably not from hydroxyl radicals. To locate the positions of the cleavage sites, we used an indirect immunological detection method (Western blot) to visualize the fragments ending at the N terminus or those ending at the C terminus, depending on the antiserum used (Fig. 2,A and B). One antiserum was raised against a synthetic conjugate containing the N-terminal 16 residues of Rho attached to a carrier protein (keyhole limpet hemocyanin). The other was raised against a similar conjugate with the C-terminal 13 residues of Rho. One drawback of this Western blot approach is that peptides smaller than 150 residues are not retained on the nitrocellulose membranes and are thus not detected. However, we could detect fragments produced by cleavages in the N-terminal two-thirds of Rho by using the C-terminal antiserum (Fig. 2 A) and fragments produced by cleavages in the C-terminal two-thirds of Rho by using the N-terminal antiserum (Fig. 2 B). Thus, by running the fragments on two gels simultaneously and using both antisera, we were able to locate cleavage sites all across the Rho polypeptide except for the 30 residues closest to the two termini. Cleaved peptides from these two regions could not be resolved from the major uncut protein. Molecular weight markers were generated by residue-specific partial digestion (lanes CNBr and LysC in Fig. 2,A and B) and were used to create standard curves that could relate the electrophoretic mobility to the position of cleavage within a few residues by interpolation. A cleavage profile (Fig. 2 C) for most of Rho polypeptide was generated by combining the two separate profiles of the Rho-alone lanesin Fig. 2, A and B. This profile revealed that Rho was cleaved with H2O2/Fe-EDTA complex at several distinct points throughout the polypeptide. However, there were also large stretches of residues that were quite resistant to cleavage. Because the H2O2/Fe-EDTA complex cleaves preferentially at solvent-exposed regions of a protein, this procedure allowed us to identify parts of Rho that are solvent-exposed. Fig.2 D is a diagram showing the positions of the known α helices and β strands of the RNA-BD as well as the positions of the predicted α helices and β strands in the model of the ATP-BD. The positions of cleavage are placed above the diagram as black bars. This alignment shows that nearly all of the major cleavage points are in regions connecting known or predicted secondary structural elements. In the Rho RNA-BD, the segments of Rho most susceptible to the cleavage were near 61 on loop L12, which connects β strands 1 and 2, near residue 70 on loop L23, which connects β strands 2 and 3, near residue 85 on the α helix α34 (part of loop L34) that connects β strands 3 and 4, and near residue 105 on loop L45, which connects β strands 4 and 5 (8Allison T.J.

Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the ATP-BD, the parts of Rho that were accessible to the chemical cleavage include the P-loop near residue 179, the Q-loop near residue 285, and the R-loop near residue 324. Fig. 2 D also shows that not all known or predicted loops connecting secondary structure elements were cleaved to the same extent. The fact that there was very little cleavage in the middle part of Rho suggests that this region is structurally very compact. Also, many of its loops may be involved in subunit-subunit interaction. With the protein concentration and buffer conditions used in the cleavage reactions, Rho subunits associate predominantly into a hexameric form. This was confirmed by measuring the sedimentation coefficient of Rho at the same concentration and ionic strength as was used in the footprinting assays (data not shown). Rho binds three ATP molecules per hexamer with high affinity (K d ≈ 0.2 µm) and perhaps three more ATPs with a lower affinity (35Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Stitt and Xu show that the three tightly bound ATPs on each Rho hexamer are rapidly hydrolyzed when RNA is added (37Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of ATP and other adenosine nucleotides has any effect on the cleavage pattern of Rho by the H2O2/Fe-EDTA complex, we conducted separate footprinting reactions in the presence of 1 mm ATP, ATPγS, ADP, or AMPPNP. Fig. 3shows the cleavage products detected with the N-terminal-specific antiserum. The only significant change in cleavage intensity observed was near residue 179, which is on the highly conserved P-loop, a part of the Rho polypeptide that is expected to have a close contact with the β and γ phosphate of ATP (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar, 38Story R.M. Steitz T.A.

The decrease in the cleavage intensity at this site upon ATP binding was also detected using the C-terminal-specific antiserum (data not shown). No significant change in cleavage intensity in other parts of Rho was evident with either antiserum. ATP and ATPγS gave much stronger protection than did ADP and AMPPNP. The differences in the cleavage intensity that resulted from ligand binding compared with that of Rho alone were calculated. The averaged value of the percentage protection ((I complex −I Rho)/I rho × 100) at residue 179 by each ligand is summarized in Fig. 3. These results provide direct evidence that ATP and ADP interacts with the P-loop of Rho without RNA present and that ATP protects the P-loop from the cleavage by the H2O2/Fe-EDTA complex better than does ADP. We next used partial cleavages with H2O2/Fe-EDTA to probe for changes in Rho upon the addition of various synthetic RNA and DNA molecules. We first used the C-terminal-specific antiserum to detect the fragments arising from cleavage in the RNA-BD. Rho is known to bind to single-stranded C-rich RNA and DNA molecules (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major part of this interaction is believed to occur in an extensive cleft formed by an arrangement of the RNA-BDs in hexameric Rho. When Rho and ATPγS were mixed with saturating amounts of poly(C) or poly(dC) and the mixture was treated with H2O2and Fe-EDTA, there was a significant decrease in the cleavage of several of the readily accessible parts of the RNA-BD (Fig.4A; compare lanes 2and 3 with lane 1). These cleavage points that became protected were at or near residues 62, 85, and 105 on the L12, α34 (part of L34), and L45, respectively. The percentage of protection at each site is summarized in Fig. 4 A. Poly(dC) was just as effective as poly(C) in the extent of protection at the three sites, suggesting that the two polymers bind similarly in this domain. The extent of protection at each of the three positions by poly(C) and poly(dC) was about the same, suggesting a nearly uniform interaction at each of these different points. Poly(U), which binds to Rho much less tightly than Poly(C) (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), gave partial protection at the three points, whereas Poly(A), which has a very weak interaction with Rho (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), did not give significant protection (Fig. 4 A,lanes 5 and 6). Strong protection at these same elements in the RNA-BD was also observed when Rho was mixed with a full-length λ cro gene transcript, a natural RNA that is terminated by the action of Rho (Fig.4 C). Identical protection was achieved with a shorter λcro transcript that extended only just through most of thecro gene rut site (Fig. 4, B andC), but no protection was found with a partial transcript lacking the rut sequence (Fig. 4, B andC). Thus, these results with natural transcripts as well as those with synthetic polymers showed that extensive protection of loop regions in the RNA-BD correlates with high affinity binding of these polymers to Rho (17Galluppi G.R.

PolyNeu5Ac chain is now known to regulate homophilic NCAM-NCAM adhesion and is shown to be crucial to synaptic plasticity in the developing and adult brain, thereby playing a critical role in various relevant pathophysiological events in vertebrates (see for example, Ref. 1Muhlenhoff M.

PolySia is also known to occur primarily on NCAM in embryonic tissues, and if not exclusively, NCAM is a major carrier of this unique polymer in mammals. A large amount of data suggesting a complex, coordinated process of biochemically detectable changes in the molecule and morphological changes that govern the development of the nervous system are available, and the presence of distinguishable NCAM glycoforms differing in the content of Sia has been detected. Many of important biological and pathophysiological regulatory effects of the Sia content of NCAM on neural cellular events are governed by the degree of polymerization (DP) of polyNeu5Ac. However, until now the presence of the oligo/polyNeu5Ac residues in different glycoforms of NCAM has been only qualitatively referred to as different terminology in the literature as follows: (1) adult form (A-form) NCAM versusembryonic form (E-form) NCAM (the former contains only one-third of the Sia content of the latter) (2Hoffman S.

Quantitative information on the length or DP versatility of polySia chains is considered important in understanding the molecular mechanism of biosynthesis of polySia chains and “coarse and fine tuning” of the adhesive behavior of the neural cells by a wide spectrum of glycoform structure of NCAM. Details of such information cannot be obtained using biochemical probes including anti-polySia antibodies and endo N-acylneuraminidase. We hypothesize that the possible presence of a continuum glycoform profile in certain functional glycoproteins is important in coarse and fine tuning of “protein-based functions,” particularly in higher animals. Thus, the present study of determination of DP and distribution of oligo/polySia chains on NCAM represents one of the pilot studies for Glycome Project that complements the Genome-based Proteome Project. The present paper has for its objective the investigation of the length or DP of polySia chains on various stages of embryonic chicken brain using the recently developed ultrasensitive and selective method. To validate our strategy of DP determination of glycan chain-bound polySia, we carried out a kinetic study of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of free oligo- and polySia with definite DP values and compared the stability of α2→8 sialosyl linkages with those of α2→3 and α2→6 sialosyl linkages in model compounds. From the analysis of the experimental results, it has been concluded that hydrolysis of all internal α2→8-linked sialosidic linkages in polySia takes place at the same rate, which is significantly slower than the sialosyl bond of the proximal Sia residue linked α2→3 to the Gal of the core glycan chain in NCAM, i.e. (Neu5Ac)n− 1Neu5Acα2→3Galβ1→ under the conditions used in this study. The results and interpretation of this study may argue against previous evidence of polySia chains that the DP of the polySia chain on NCAM is as large as or even larger than 100 (45Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L. Glick M.C. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9443-9448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that polyNeu5Ac chains with high DP are extremely labile to hydrolytic breakdown even at near neutral pH (46Manzi A.E. Higa H.H. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23617-23624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neu5Ac dimer (Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Ac) was a gift from Nihon Gaishi (Handa, Japan). Neu5Acα2→3Galβ1→4Glc and Neu5Acα2→6Galβ1→4Glc were purchased from Glyko (Novato, CA). Colominic acid was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Two polySia samples with discrete DP values, i.e. (Neu5Ac)10 and (Neu5Ac)21, and three other polyNeu5Ac samples of which the major components are (Neu5Ac)41, (Neu5Ac)67 + (Neu5Ac)68, and (Neu5Ac)76 were prepared by chromatographic separation of a controlled hydrolysate of commercially available colominic acid on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (47Nomoto H. Iwasaki M. Endo T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Matsumura G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or by direct HPLC fractionation of commercial colominic acid without pre-hydrolysis on a MonoQ HR 10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or a DNAPac PA-100 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) column. For some samples of (Neu5Ac)n the n values were determined by the HPAEC-PED method after pre-hydrolysis at 50 °C; this pre-hydrolysis was necessary to obtain a homologous series of peaks for (Neu5Ac)n, n = 1 ton, to determine n. For all samples examined,n values determined by the new DMB/HPLC-FD method were identical with those determined by HPAEC-PED. Total Neu5Ac was determined after maximal hydrolytic liberation of free Neu5Ac in 0.1m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C by reverse-phase HPLC of the DMB derivative of Neu5Ac as described previously (48Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29968-29979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or by HPAEC-PED without derivatization (49Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Ac, Neu5Acα2→3Galβ1→4Glc, and Neu5Acα2→6Galβ1→4Glc (200 ng∼1 µg) were hydrolyzed in 0.02m trifluoroacetic acid at 50 °C or in 0.1 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C in total volume of 80 µl. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 µl of 0.2 m NaOH at appropriate time intervals. Two polySia samples with the discrete DP values, (→8Neu5Acα2→)10 and (→8Neu5Acα2→)21, were hydrolyzed in 0.02m trifluoroacetic acid at 50 °C. Mono- and oligo/polyNeu5Ac formed were quantified by HPAEC-PED (cf. Ref. 49Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Derivatization of polySia at the reducing end with the fluorogenic reagent DMB originally used for the labeling of Sia (50Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) was carried out in the reaction mixture containing, finally, 2.7 m DMB (Dojinbo, Kumamoto, Japan), 9 mm sodium hydrosulfite, 0.5 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm trifluoroacetic acid, and a given Sia-containing reactant at 10 °C for 48 h. The reaction was stopped by adding one-fifth volume of 1 m NaOH to hydrolyze lactones formed during the reaction (51Cheng M.-C. Lin S.-L. Wu S.-H. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 52Zhang Y. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For HPAEC-PED analysis, a DX-500 ion chromatography system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) was used with an ED-40 electrochemical detector and a CarboPac PA-100 column. Elution of oligo/polySia was performed at 1 ml/min with a concentration gradient of NaNO3 as described previously, whereas the concentration of NaOH was always kept at 0.1 m (49Zhang Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 53Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For DMB/HPLC-FD, a Hewlett-Packard HPLC system series 1100 was used with a DNAPac PA-100 column and a fluorescence detector set at 372 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission (54Lin S.-L. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 329: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Elution was performed at 1 ml/min with segments of linear gradient of NaNO3 made by introducing 1m NaNO3, 2, 2, 3, 10, 20, 25, and 35% in water at 0, 3, 6, 14, 28, 43, and 95 min, respectively. PolySia-containing glycopeptides were prepared and purified from embryonic chicken brain (E5∼E21) as described previously (48Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29968-29979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The samples were eluted under a slightly included peak earlier than commercial colominic acid (DP 100) from a Sephacryl S-200 column and under a peak eluted with higher concentrations of NaCl than for colominic acid from a MonoQ HR 10/10 column. Special attention was directed to the questions and assessment of the reliability and validity of the data obtained using a newly developed method of polySia analysis. To answer the question as to whether this DMB/HPLC-FD method can detect an original sample of polySia with high DP and give its correct DP value was most important because the derivatization was carried out under acidic conditions in which partial cleavage of inter-residue sialosyl linkages was unavoidable. For this purpose, we used polyNeu5Ac samples separated from colominic acid by anion-exchange chromatography, and the DP values of their major components were determined by HPAEC-PED (see “Experimental Procedures”). The chromatographic profiles obtained by the DMB/HPLC-FD method described under “Experimental Procedures” are given in Fig. 1, a–d. A series of lower DP fragments were detected in each case, but the original major components, (Neu5Ac)41, (Neu5Ac)53, (Neu5Ac)67 + (Neu5Ac)68, and (Neu5Ac)76 remained intact as the most prominent peaks of quinoxalinone adducts, i.e.(Neu5Ac)40-Q, (Neu5Ac)52-Q, (Neu5Ac)66-Q + (Neu5Ac)67-Q, and (Neu5Ac)75-Q after the DMB reaction. These results showed that the method can be used for the DP determination of free polySia chains with DPs as high as 76. Changes in the polySia content in NCAM have been studied extensively and intensively during the pre- and post-hatching development of central nervous system tissue in vertebrates including chicken and frog (e.g. Ref. 7Sunshine J. Balak K. Rutishauser U. Jacobson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5986-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, no quantitative information about the developmental stage-dependent changes in the DP of polySia chains is available until now, so that we have applied the DMB/HPLC-FD method to the analysis of polySia chains of NCAM in the samples prepared from embryonic chicken brain at different stages of development. In the present study, polySia-containing glycopeptides were prepared through exhaustive digestion with nonspecific bacterial protease, gel-filtration, and anion-exchange chromatography of the delipidated homogenates of chicken brains at stages E5, E6, E10, E12, E14, E16, E18, and E21 (referred to as 5-, 6-, 10-, 12-, 14-, 16-, 18-, and 21-day after fertilization) by the previously published method and compared with respect to size and distribution of their polySia chains. We analyzed for possible depolymerization of polySia during preparation and purification of samples using model polySia compounds and the HPAEC-PED method. We found that in medium at pH 8.0, used throughout purification, no cleavage of the α2→8 sialosyl linkage was detected during a 3-day incubation at 37 °C. From the results obtained we can conclude that throughout all stages of embryonic development, polysialylated NCAM glycoforms with polySia DP as long as 50 are expressed (Fig. 2, a–d), and although those with a DP > 50 are detectable at some stage (Fig.2 d), they are in much smaller proportion. The distributions of distinct NCAM glycoforms with varying DP polySia chains were estimated at different developmental stages of chicken brain and are shown in Fig. 3. First, NCAM with lower DPs (5 < DP < 10) polySia appeared to be more abundant at early stages of development (E5 and E6) and increased again at late stages (E18 and E21). Second, the highly polymerized form of polySia chains with DP 40, although relatively low over the entire stage of embryonic development, appeared to be most abundant, abounding at around E12 and declining steadily from E14 to the final stage (E21). Third, NCAM glycoforms with a DP greater than 21 increased until the 10th embryonic day and were rather constant between E10 and E16 but decreased significantly from E18. These changes in NCAM glycoforms with varying DPs of polySia chains are considered to be critically important in fine-tuning NCAM-NCAM adhesive interaction-associated cellular events at the defined sites during development, although the complex regulatory mechanism responsible for such fine-tuning remains as one of the most challenging problems confronting us.Figure 3Distribution of polySia chains in different DP ranges are analyzed by the DMB/HPLC-FD method for polySia-glycopeptide samples derived from different stages of embryonic development of chicken brain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The chromatographic peaks are well resolved as shown in Fig. 2, but none of these chromatographic patterns are characterized by a damped oscillating fashion with increasing retention time as seen in Fig. 1 for authentic (Neu5Ac)n samples. Instead, regularly protruded peaks are seen in each of chromatograms centering at the retention times near at 50 min (in Fig. 2 a), 44 min (in Fig.2 b), 37 min (in Fig. 2 c), and 46 min (in Fig.2 d). These results are accounted for by the presence of at least two heterogeneous but discrete groups of polySia chains with different DPs. Such unique elution patterns observed in DMB/HPLC-FD analysis were also considered to represent certain kinetic profiles suggesting that particular sialosyl linkages were hydrolyzed at significantly faster rates than α2→8-sialosyl bonds in polySia chains. To further confirm the presence of the discrete groups of polySia chains differing in their average DPs, two pairs of NCAM-derived polySia glycopeptides that were partially resolved by using a MonoQ HR 10/10 column into the high M rfractions at two different developmental stages (E18 and E21) were analyzed by the DMB/HPLC-FD method. As shown in Fig.4of our previous paper (51Cheng M.-C. Lin S.-L. Wu S.-H. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the MonoQ HR 10/10 elution profile for E21 exhibited a minor but definitely partially resolved peak (labeled Q2) eluting with retention times of 38–43 min, just ahead of the major peak (labeled Q1), eluting at 44–52 min. For E18, a similar although less clear trend was seen, and the corresponding major and minor fractions were separately collected and labeled Q1 and Q2, respectively. These two pairs of NCAM-derived polySia-containing glycopeptide fractions were subjected to DMB/HPLC-FD analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 4,a and b, for E18. and c andd, for E21. The major retarded peaks (Q1) exhibited on a MonoQ HR 10/10 elution profiles of Pronase polySia glycopeptides isolated from E18 and E21 chicken brains are characterized as containing triantennary core N-glycans on which two arms are substituted by oligo/ polySia chains, i.e.(→8Neu5Acα2→)m and (→8Neu5Acα2→)n, andm + n = 50. Elution patterns shown in Fig. 4, a and c, also indicate that only a relatively small portion of the polySia chains has a DP ∼40 and oligo/polySia chains have a high degree of heterogeneity (chain length variability), although a net negative charge is likely almost constant. Data published previously (56Kudo M. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Shiokawa K. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32667-32677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and unpublished results (S. Inoue) indicate the presence of an arm with an unsubstituted terminal Gal residue on the major triantennary N-glycan bearing oligo/polySia chains. The minor component, Q2, derived from E18 exhibited a unique chromatographic profile (Fig. 4 b), and this fraction can be characterized as containing triantennary glycan chains consisting of two oligo/polySia chains,i.e. (→8Neu5Acα2→)p and (→8Neu5Acα2→)q, p + q = 30, with DPs of 14∼27 predominant. Developmental stage-dependent complex chromatographic patterns observed in this study using the ultrasensitive DMB/HPLC-FD method certainly represent the distinct difference in polysialylation patterns in NCAM from different stages of chicken embryos. During the entire period of embryonic development, a homologous series of NCAM glycoforms categorized by at least two heterogeneous but discrete groups of polySia chains with different DPs are expressed, and their relative abundance is responsible for generating protrusion of a bunch of resolved peaks on chromatograms (Fig. 2). To determine the apparent rate constants of mild acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of ketosidic linkages, appearance of monomeric Neu5Ac and appearance and disappearance of lower oligoNeu5Ac with time were measured in 0.02 m trifluoroacetic acid at 50 °C (some compounds were also measured in 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid and 80 °C) using the HPAEC-PED method. The rate constants for Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Ac, Neu5Acα2→ 3Galβ1→4Glc and Neu5Acα2→6Galβ1→4Glc were evaluated by a simple first-order rate equation, and those for (→8Neu5Acα2→)10 and (→8Neu5Acα2→)21 were calculated by Equation 1. kapp=−2.303×t−1×[log{(n−1)−(Eq. 1) (n−1)2+(n−2)(N1/Nn−n)}−log(n−2)]Details of the formulation and assumption used are given under “Discussion.” The results are summarized in Table I.Table IApparent first-order rate constants, kapp, of mild acid hydrolysis of ketosidic bonds of Neu5Ac ketosidesCompoundReaction conditionsk appmin−1Neu5Acα2→3Galβ1→4Glc50 °C in 0.02 m TFA0.005780 °C in 0.1m TFA0.19Neu5Acα2→6Galβ1→4Glc50 °C in 0.02 m TFA0.003680 °C in 0.1m TFA0.12Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Ac50 °C in 0.02m TFA0.001480 °C in 0.1 mTFA0.033(→8Neu5Acα2→)1050 °C in 0.02m TFA0.0020(→8Neu5Acα2→)2150 °C in 0.02 mTFA0.0023TFA, trifluoroacetic acid.

This method was validated to be a method to analyze accurate DP values using authentic samples of α2→8-linked polyNeu5Ac with defined DP values up to 76 and to exhibit high sensitivity with detection thresholds of 1.4×10−15 mol (1.4 fmol) per resolved peak. Our results showed that the previously reported estimate of DP of the polySia chains of NCAM (45Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L. Glick M.C. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9443-9448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is questionable. We also noted that acid lability of polySia chains against hydrolytic cleavage of the inter-residue linkages might not be correctly understood. It is generally believed that polySia chains are substantially labile under mild acidic and even at near neutral conditions, and the labi"

Aggregation and the expression of adhesion molecules are mediated by relayed pulses of cAMP. Cells also respond to cAMP with a short cGMP pulse. We find that CF slowly down-regulates the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse by inhibiting guanylyl cyclase activity. A 1-min exposure of cells to purified CF increases the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse. CF does not affect the cAMP receptor or its interaction with its associated G proteins or the translocation of the cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase to the membrane in response to cAMP. Pulsing streaming wild-type cells with a high concentration of cAMP results in the formation of small groups, whereas reducing cAMP pulse size with exogenous cAMP phosphodiesterase during stream formation causes cells to form large groups. Altering the extracellular cAMP pulse size does not phenocopy the effects of CF on the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse size or cell-cell adhesion, indicating that CF does not regulate cGMP pulses and adhesion via CF's effects on cAMP pulses. The results suggest that regulating cell-cell adhesion, the cGMP pulse size, or the cAMP pulse size can control group size and that CF regulates all three of these independently.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Defects in cell number regulation can cause severe problems such as cancer; however, little is known about how cell number and group size are regulated in multicellular organisms. The unicellular eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum is an excellent model system for the study of cell number regulation.Dictyostelium are haploid amebae that live on soil surfaces and eat bacteria (2Maeda R.

Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, New York1975Google Scholar). When Dictyostelium outgrows its food supply, the starving cells signal other cells by secreting an array of factors such as the glycoprotein conditioned medium (CM)1 factor (2Maeda R. Inouye K.

After more and more cells in a population have starved, the extracellular conditioned medium factor reaches a threshold. This permits the cells to aggregate using relayed pulses of cAMP as a chemoattractant. When a pulse of cAMP arrives at a starved Dictyostelium cell that is in the presence of high levels of conditioned medium factor, a burst of cAMP is released by the cell to relay the signal. The cell moves toward the source of cAMP, and the expression of specific classes of genes is altered. The incoming cAMP pulse is sensed by the serpentine receptor cAR1. cAR1 activates Gβγ, which subsequently activates cytosolic factors such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt/protein kinase B, and CRAC thereby transiently activating adenylyl cyclase, while Gα2 activates guanylyl cyclase to generate a rapid cGMP pulse, with a peak at ∼10 s and a return to baseline at ∼30 s (8Firtel R.A.

The aggregating cells form streams that flow toward the aggregation center. If the cell density is high, the streams break into groups (22Shaffer B.M. Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1957; 98: 393-405Google Scholar). This process forms a number of groups of cells, with each group developing into a fruiting body containing a mass of spore cells held on top of a cellular stalk (2Maeda R. Inouye K. Takeuchi I.

For example, streamer F cells, which have a defect in the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) and have abnormally large cAMP-induced cGMP pulses, form streams that do not break up and thus form abnormally large aggregates (28Ross F.M. Newell P.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 127: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar, 31Newell P.C. Liu G. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Coukell M.B. Cameron A.M. Dev.

Mutants with a disruption ofDdmek1 have a decreased guanylyl cyclase activity, a small cAMP-stimulated cGMP pulse, and form small groups and fruiting bodies, although this appears to be caused by the formation of small aggregation territories rather than excessive breakup of streams in normal sized aggregation territories (33Ma H. Gamper M. Parent C. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4317-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells with abnormally high levels of extracellular cAMP PDE, which significantly represses the extracellular cAMP pulses, form small fruiting bodies (29Riedel V. Gerisch G. Muller E. Beug H. J. Mol.

Two transformants, smlA − andcountin −, have normal growth, differentiation, and aggregation territory sizes but form smaller and larger aggregates and fruiting bodies, respectively (24Brock D.A.

The significant feature of these two mutants is that their cell number regulation depends on the concentration and function of a secreted cell number-regulating factor, a 450-kDa protein complex called counting factor (CF) (24Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Brock D.A. Buczynski F. Spann T.P. Wood S.A. Cardelli J. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2569-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).smlA −, a CF gain-of-function mutant, oversecretes CF, resulting in streams breaking up into many small groups that form small fruiting bodies. Knocking out countin, a 40-kDa component of CF which is essential for its activity, has the opposite effect of knocking out smlA: the countin knockout cells form unbroken streams and thus huge groups and fruiting bodies (24Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CF modulates group size at least in part by inhibiting cell-cell adhesion (36Roisin-Bouffay C. Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). High levels of CF repress cell-cell adhesion, resulting in aggregation streams dissipating and breaking up into small groups. Low levels of CF increase cell-cell adhesion, causing streams to remain intact and form large groups. In this report, we show that CF regulates group size by regulating both the cAMP-induced cAMP and cGMP pulses via a diverging pathway that acts downstream of the activation of G proteins by cAR1. Altering just the cGMP pulse size can regulate group size (28Ross F.M. Newell P.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 127: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar, 31Newell P.C. Liu G.

Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4317-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and we found that altering just the cAMP pulse size during stream formation can also regulate group size by breaking up the aggregation stream. Changing the size of the extracellular cAMP pulses does not phenocopy the effects of CF on the size of the cAMP-induced intracellular cGMP pulses and cell-cell adhesion, suggesting that CF does not regulate cGMP pulses and adhesion via its effects on cAMP pulses. Dictyostelium thus appears to regulate group size using several different mechanisms simultaneously. Cell culture, development of cells, and preparation of CM from starving cells were performed as described by Jain et al. (37Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

After 2 h, the filter pads were transferred to new plates and placed on filter papers soaked with either PBM or PDE. Submerged culture was also performed as described by Brock et al. (34Brock D.A.

When indicated, 0.9 µl of buffer or 15 µm cAMP was added gently to a well (final concentration, 30 nm). Preimmune and immune antisera against countin were applied at a 1:300 dilution (24Brock D.A.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the concentration of cGMP was determined using a [3H]cGMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To study the effect of cAMP pulses on cAMP-induced cGMP pulses, Ax4 cells were treated with beef heart cAMP PDE (0.01 unit/ml, Sigma), PBM, or cAMP pulses (final concentration, 30 nm) every 6 min for 5 h starting 1 h after starvation. The cAMP-induced production of cAMP was measured in the absence of dithiothreitol following Van Haastert (39Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 6 h, stimulated with 10 µm 2′-deoxy-cAMP (a functional cAMP analog that does not interfere with the subsequent cAMP assay), and lysed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 min. cAMP concentrations were determined using a [3H]cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cAMP binding to cells was performed following Kesbekeet al.

The effect of cAMP on the binding of [3H]GTP to membranes was measured following Snaar-Jagalska and Van Haastert (40Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 287-294PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that instead of spinning membranes through silicone oil, membranes were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 × g. cAMP-induced high affinity GTPase activity was measured following Brazill et al. (41Brazill D.T. Gundersen R. Gomer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), adding the creatine phosphokinase to the mixture immediately before use. GTPγS-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity was measured following Snaar-Jagalska and Van Haastert (42Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van-Haastert P.J.M.

After neutralization, the formation of cGMP by guanylyl cyclase was determined using a [3H]cGMP assay kit. cGMP-specific PDE was assayed following Van Haastert et al.(43Van Haastert P.J.M. Van Walsum H. VanderMeer R.C. Bulgakov R. Konijn T.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 25: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were starved in PBM at 1 × 106 cells/ml for 6 h, collected by centrifugation, washed twice, resuspended in PB (3 mm Na2HPO4, 7 mmKH2PO4, pH 6.5) at 5 × 107cells/ml, and lysed through a 5-µm filter. The assay mixture was incubated for 20 min at 22 °C to allow hydrolysis of cGMP to GMP by the cGMP PDE. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 2 min. To convert GMP to guanosine, 100 µl of 1 mg/ml snake venom (Ophiophagus hannah, Sigma) was added followed by incubation at 22 °C for 30 min. 1 ml of anion exchanger (1 part AG 1-X2 (Bio- Rad) + 2 parts ethanol) was added, and the mixture was shaken gently for 15 min. The anion exchanger was pelleted, and 500 µl of supernatant was used to measure the guanosine radioactivity. Cell-cell adhesion was measured following Roisin-Bouffay et al. (36Roisin-Bouffay C. Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Ax4 cells were starved at 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBM buffer on a shaker. At 2, 4, and 6 h after starvation, 500 µl of cells was mixed with 500 µl of PBM and vortexed for 20 s. 500 µl of the diluted cell sample was then added to a new Eppendorf tube and rotated on a Labquake rotator for 1.5 min. Adhesion was measured by counting both the total number of cells and the number of single cells with a hemacytometer. One of the first observed responses of aggregating Dictyostelium cells to a cAMP pulse is a rapid cGMP pulse, with a peak at ∼10 s and a return to base line at ∼30 s (44Newell P.C. Europe-Finner G.N. Small N.V. Liu G. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 123-127PubMed Google Scholar, 45Van Haastert P.J.M. De Vries M.J. Penning L.C. Roovers F. Van der Kaay J. Erneux C. Van Lookeren Campagne M.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Alterations of cGMP pulse size affect group size in Dictyostelium, with large cGMP pulses causing the formation of large groups (28Ross F.M. Newell P.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 127: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar, 31Newell P.C. Liu G. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Ma H. Gamper M. Parent C. Firtel R.A.

To determine if CF regulates group size by regulating the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse, we examined the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse in Ax4 parental,smlA −, andcountin − cells. As observed previously, stimulating Ax4 cells with cAMP generated a cGMP pulse with a peak at ∼10 s and a return to basal levels at ∼30–40 s. With the same stimulus, countin − cells generated a much larger cGMP pulse, whereas smlA − cells responded with a very small cGMP pulse (Fig.1 A). smlA knockouts in a DH1 background also had a very small cGMP pulse (data not shown). Thus, we hypothesized that CF is capable of inhibiting the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse. To verify our hypothesis, we measured the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse in Ax4 cells in the presence or absence of anti-countin antibodies. We found previously that adding anti-countin antibodies to developing cells essentially eliminate CF in the medium (24Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Compared with the control cells treated with preimmune serum, cells exposed to anti-countin antibodies for 4 h had a significantly larger cAMP-induced cGMP pulse (Fig. 1 B). This suggested that extracellular countin regulates the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse. Regulation of the cGMP pulse by CF could be caused either by a regulation of the guanylyl cyclase or the cGMP PDE. Compared with wild-type cells, countin − cells had a higher GTPγS-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity, whereassmlA − cells had a lower GTPγS-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity (Fig.2 A). BothsmlA − and countin −cells had higher cGMP PDE activities than parental cells (Fig.2 B). To determine if the cGMP PDE is in the CF signal transduction pathway, we starved Streamer F cells (which have a defective cGMP PDE) and control cells on pads soaked with either wild-type CM, which contains a normal amount of CF, orsmlA − CM, which contains abnormally high levels of CF. Compared with wild-type CM, smlA − CM induced a 1.5-fold increase in the number of groups formed by wild-type cells and a 1.6 ± 0.3 -fold increase in the number of groups formed by Streamer F cells. This indicated that Streamer F cells respond to CF. Together, the data suggest that cells developing in the presence of abnormally high or low levels of CF both have higher levels of cGMP PDE activity, but the presence of the cGMP PDE is not necessary for the CF effect on group size; the levels of the GTPγS-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity roughly match the observed effects on the size of the cGMP pulse. StarvingDictyostelium cells secrete cAMP and use it to coordinate development. A number of Dictyostelium mutants with abnormal aggregate sizes have defects in their cAMP signal transduction pathway (29Riedel V. Gerisch G. Muller E. Beug H. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Faure M. Podgorski G.J. Franke J. Kessin R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether CF regulates the cAMP pulse, the cAMP-induced cAMP signal relay was measured in wild-type,smlA −, andcountin − cells. ThesmlA − cells had a much stronger cAMP signal relay than the parental wild-type Ax4 cells, whereas the cAMP signal relay in countin − cells was much weaker (Fig.3 A). Whencountin − cells were exposed for 1 min to purified CF, there was a 40% increase in the size of the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse (Fig. 3 B). countin − cells were also treated for 5 min with either wild-type orsmlA − CM. These also increased the cAMP signal relay significantly, whereas exposure of thecountin − cells tocountin − CM (which contains no functional CF) had no effect (data not shown). Similar 5-min treatments ofcountin − cells with wild-type orsmlA − CM had no significant effect on the cAMP-stimulated cGMP pulse size. These data suggest that the presence of CF potentiates the size of the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse and that CF affects cAMP-stimulated cAMP accumulation within 1 min but requires several hours to affect the cGMP pulse. Further studies demonstrated that CF regulates cAMP-induced cAMP pulsing by controlling GTPγS-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. 2T. Gao, L. Tang, and R. Gomer, manuscript in preparation. To examine where in the pathway CF regulates cAMP signal transduction, we first studied whether CF affects the availability of cAMP receptors. Binding of cAMP to its receptors was measured in nearly saturated ammonium sulfate for starved Ax4 cells in the presence or absence of anti-countin antibody. Under these conditions, the level of cAMP receptors was not affected by exposure of cells to the anti-countin antibodies for 4 h (TableI). We next examined whether CF regulates the interaction between the cAMP receptor and G proteins, a downstream event of cAMP receptor activation (39Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48Theibert A. Devreotes P. J. Biol.

There was no significant difference in cAMP binding in phosphate buffer to membranes from parental, smlA −, orcountin − cells or between Ax4 cells exposed to preimmune or immune anti-countin antibodies (TableII). However, we did see that the presence of antibodies, both immune and preimmune, affected cAMP binding.Table IEffect of CF on [3H]cAMP binding to cellsPreimmuneAnti-countin[3H]cAMP binding100105 ± 12Cells were starved for 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W1982850154,"The CXC chemokine, melanoma growth stimulatory activity/growth-regulated protein, CXCL1 is an important modulator of inflammation, wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. Transcription of CXCL1 is regulated through several cis-acting elements including Sp1, NF-κB, and an element that lies immediately upstream of the NF-κB element, the immediate upstream region (IUR). A transcription element data base search indicated that the IUR element contains a binding site for the transcriptional repressor, human CUT homeodomain protein/CCAAT displacement protein (CDP). It is shown here that in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, complexes obtained with the IUR oligonucleotide probe are supershifted by anti-CDP antibodies and that a CDP polypeptide containing a high affinity DNA binding domain binds to the sequence GGGATCGATC in the IUR element. In Southwestern blot analyses, oligonucleotides containing the wild-type IUR sequence, but not a mutant oligonucleotide with substitutions in the GGGATCGATC sequence, bind a 170–180-kDa protein. Furthermore, overexpression of the CDP protein blocks CXCL1promoter activity in reporter gene assays, whereas overexpression of an antisense CDP construct leads to a significant increase inCXCL1 promoter activity. Mutations in the IUR element, which map in the putative CDP-binding site, inhibit the binding of CDP to the IUR element and favor increased transcription from theCXCL1 promoter. Based on these results, we propose that transcriptional regulation of the CXCL1 gene is mediated in part by CDP, which could play an important role in inflammatory processes and tumorigenesis.

TheCXCL1 gene is not constitutively expressed in normal retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) but can be induced by cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α and bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, Hs294T malignant melanoma cells exhibit high, constitutive levels of CXCL1 mRNA and protein. IL-1 treatment of Hs294T cells does not significantly increase the already elevated transcription of the gene, although it does appear to stabilize CXCL1 mRNA (6Shattuck R.L. Wood L.D. Jaffe G.J. Richmond A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 791-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the CXCL1 gene is regulated largely through a 306-bp minimal promoter situated immediately upstream of the transcription start site. The four cis-acting elements comprising the minimal promoter include a TATA box (−25 to −30 bp), an NF-κB-binding site (−67 to −77 bp), an AT-rich HMGI(Y)-binding element nested within the NF-κB site, an immediate upstream region (IUR) (−78 to −96 bp), and a GC-rich SP1-binding site (−117 to −128 bp) (7Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol.

In RPE cells, IL-1 induction results in increased nuclear levels of NF-κB p65 (RelA) and NF-κB p50 subunits (9Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar). This is a consequence of an IL-1-induced activation of the IκB kinases (IKK1/IKK2) and subsequent phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of the IKK substrate, IκB. In Hs294T cells, constitutively high nuclear levels of the p50 and p65/RelA proteins can be correlated with constitutive activity of IKK1/IKK2 and enhanced degradation of the IκB protein (10Devalaraja M.N. Wang D.Z. Ballard D.W. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1372-1377PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB element therefore represents a crucial, inducible component of the putative CXCL1 enhanceosome. The IUR is an ∼20-bp sequence that is located immediately upstream of the NF-κB element in the CXCL1 promoter. Previously, we demonstrated that in addition to the NF-κB, the IUR element is essential for basal as well as cytokine-induced expression of theCXCL1 gene. In particular, point mutations within a putative TCGAT motif of the IUR element abolished basal and IL-1-induced transcription in reporter gene assays with RPE and Hs294T cells (8Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), these mutations blocked the ability of this element to compete with a constitutive, IUR-specific complex in RPE and Hs294T nuclear extracts. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analyses revealed that at least one protein having a relative molecular size of 115 kDa bound the IUR element in a sequence-specific manner (5Luan J. Shattuck-Brandt R. Haghnegahdar H. Owen J.D. Strieter R. Burdick M. Nirodi C. Beauchamp D. Johnson K.N. Richmond A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Purification of the 115-kDa IUR-specific protein by oligonucleotide affinity chromatography revealed its identity as the poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and demonstrated that it plays a role in the activation of theCXCL1 promoter (11Nirodi C.S.

In this study, the CXCL1 promoter was analyzed within a transcriptional element data base (Transfac) using a web-based search engine, the Transcription Element String Search (TESS). The search identified the CXCL1 IUR element as a putative binding site for the human CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) that is highly homologous to theDrosophila CUT protein. Genetic studies first identified the CUT locus as an important determinant of cell type specificity in Drosophila melanogaster (12Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

The data indicate that the IUR can bind a protein having a molecular size of 170 kDa and that this protein is the 170-kDa CDP. In EMSAs, recombinant CDP polypeptides bound the IUR element in a sequence-selective fashion. In co-transfection experiments, overexpression of the CDP protein inhibited CXCL1 promoter activity, whereas overexpression of antisense CDP mRNA inducedCXCL1 promoter activity 5-fold over the control. These results indicate that the transcription of the CXCL1 gene is negatively regulated by the CCAAT displacement protein. Hs294T melanoma cells are a continuous cell line established from a human melanoma metastatic to the lymph node. These cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). RPE cells are normal retinal pigment epithelial cells that were cultured by Dr. Glenn Jaffe from the North Carolina Organ Donor and Eye Bank within 24 h of death (30Jaffe G.J. Richmond A. VanLe L. Cheng Q.C. Shattuck R.L. Wong F. Roberts W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2776-2785PubMed Google Scholar). RPE and Hs294T cells were cultured as described previously (9Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar). The CXCL1minimal promoter region (−306 to +45 bp), which was originally constructed in a CAT reporter system (7Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was inserted in the pGL2 Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutant reporter mIUR.Luc was generated by using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutagenic oligonucleotide employed for this purpose had the sequence: 5′-cgggaATGaCctggaactccgggaatttccctggcc-3′. Uppercase letters represent nucleotide replacements in the GGGATCGATC motif of the IUR element, which is underscored. The reporter vectors, p2RT.Luc, p2mRT.Luc, and p2dRT.Luc, were generated by insertingXhoI/HindIII-flanked oligonucleotides in theXhoI and HindIII sites of pGL2. The oligonucleotide sequence for the wild-type reporter construct, 2 RT.Luc, was 5′-tcgaggggatcgatctggaactccgggatcgatctggaactcctggcccgggggctccgggctttccagccccaaccatgcataaaaggaagctta-3′. The underscored letters represent the GGGATCGATC motif of the IUR element.

The underscored letters represent the truncated IUR motif in which the 5′-GGGA sequence has been deleted. An expression vector containing the full-length CDP cDNA in the sense orientation (pMX.HSCDP) and another with the CDP cDNA in the antisense orientation (pMXASCDP) were previously described (19Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All reporter and expression constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against the CDP protein as well as recombinant CDP polypeptides have been characterized previously, and the specificity of these antibodies to the various domains of the CDP protein has been demonstrated (31Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24862-24868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously. All extracts contained a 1× concentration of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 2R oligonucleotide, 5′-gggatcgatctggaactccgggatcgatctggaactcc-3′, was radiolabeled by extension of an annealed primer, 5′-ggagttccagatc-3′. The probe 2mR had the oligonucleotide sequence 5′-gggaagtacctggaactccgggaagtacctggaactcc-3′ and was primed by an oligonucleotide primer, 5′-ggagttccaggta-3′. (Underscored letters represent the nucleotide replacements in the GGGATCGATC motif of the IUR element.) The probe 2dR, 5′-cctcgatctggaactcctcgatctggaactccggatgc-3′, was primed with 5′-gcatccggagttcca-3′. The primed oligonucleotide probes were then radiolabeled with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase, dNTPs, and [α-32P]dCTP. The probe containing the NF-κB-binding site 5′-agttgaggggactttcccaggc-3′ was from Promega (Madison, WI) and was radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A typical binding reaction involved a 15-min preincubation with 10 µg of nuclear extract, 2 µg of the nonspecific competitor poly(dI·dC), 200 ng of single-stranded oligonucleotide, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, followed by a 20-min incubation with 50,000 cpm (40 fmol) of radiolabeled probe. In oligonucleotide competitions, 1000-fold molar excess of cold, double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the preincubation mix. In some oligonucleotide competition experiments, the CDP-binding site oligonucleotide (wCDP) used had the upper-strand sequence, 5′-aaaagaagcttatcgataccgt-3′. Mutations in the CDP-binding site, previously shown to affect binding to the CDP DNA binding domains (18Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), were included in the oligonucleotide (mCDP) that had the following sequence, 5′-aaaagaagcttatTCataccgt-3′. Underscored letters represent the core CDP-binding motif, and uppercase letters indicate the nucleotide replacements in this sequence. In supershift analyses, antibodies raised against CDP domains other than the DNA binding domain (W, A, N) were added after the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 10 min at room termperature prior to electrophoresis. In cases where the antibody was against the CDP DNA binding domain (AK), the antibody was included in the preincubation reaction. The concentration of antibody in each EMSA reaction was 2 µg/10 µg nuclear extract. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis for 2 h at 170 V on a 4% native, polyacrylamide gel, which was later dried and processed for autoradiography. In cases where purified CDP polypeptides were used, the reaction mixture contained no cold competitor, and the complexes were resolved on a 6% native acrylamide gel. Nuclear extracts (25 µg) were heated at 90 °C for 3 min in 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol, resolved on 4% stacking, 8% resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For Southwestern analysis, membranes were rocked for 15 min in PBS, blocked for 4 h at room temperature with buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mg/ml skim milk powder, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 µg/ml native salmon sperm DNA), and incubated overnight at room temperature in up to 2 ml of buffer A + 107 cpm (8–10 pmol) of radiolabeled probe. Probes used were either 2R, 2mR, or 2dR which are described under the “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays.” Membranes were subjected to three washes of 15 min each at room termperature in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 g/liter skim milk powder, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40, prior to drying and autoradiography. For Western analysis, following transfer, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk (TBST) and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-CDP antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 (0.8 µg/ml) using standard procedures. The specificity of this antibody has been demonstrated previously (31Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24862-24868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Hs294T or RPE cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105. The following day, cells at nearly 70% confluency were transfected using the LipofectAMINE/Plus method (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 µg of the reporter construct pGL2.CXCL1, pGL2mIUR, pGL2.2mRT, or pGL2.2RT, and whenever necessary, 1 µg of the CDP expression vector either pMXHSCDP or the CDP antisense construct pMXASCDP. In addition, all samples received 1 µg of pCMV-β-gal. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementing with either pGL2 or pUC19 vector DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). All values were normalized to β-galactosidase expression to correct for transfection efficiency. Each experiment was performed 3–6 times, with 3–4 different plasmid preparations. Each time the samples were in duplicate. The transfection efficiency of the sense and antisense CDP constructs was about 45–60%. Mean values and standard deviation was determined from 3 to 6 separate experiments. Student's paired t test pvalues were determined using Microsoft Excel. The immediate upstream region (IUR) has been described previously as essential for CXCL1 transcription. It has been shown earlier that this element contains a TCGAT motif, which is essential for binding to a 115-kDa protein. The factor binding to this element has been purified by oligonucleotide affinity chromatography and has been identified by mass spectroscopy/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectroscopy as PARP (11Nirodi C.S. NagDas S. Gygi S. Olson G. Aebersold R. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9366-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the IUR binds a second transcription factor that has specificity to the GGGATCGATC motif of the IUR element and negatively regulates CXCL1 gene transcription. In order to identify putative transcription factor-binding sites in the IUR element (−96 to −78 nt) of the CXCL1 promoter, we employed a web-based search engine, TESS (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) (32Schug J Overton G.C. TESS: Transcription Element Search Software on the WWW, Technical Report CBIL-TR-1997–1001-v0,0. of the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 1997Google Scholar), and analyzed the sequence corresponding to −130 bp to +20 of the minimal CXCL1 promoter (Fig.1). In particular, our objective was to identify putative transcription factor-binding sites within the sequence extending from −96 to −78 nt (underscored lettersin Fig. 1) which we designate here as sequence R. The search was restricted to a maximum of 20% mismatch within an element length of 6 nucleotides or greater. As a negative control, a mutant promoter sequence with replacements in the TCGAT motif of the IUR element was also used. Fig. 1 describes the sequences identified in the −130 to +20 nt region by the TESS search. In addition to the previously characterized Sp1 and NF-κB sites, an 8-nt sequence (−94 to −87 nt) located within the IUR element exhibited a 100% match with the putative binding site for the transcriptional repressor, CDP. The CDP-binding site was not detected by a similar search of the mutant promoter sequence in which the TCGAT motif was altered. The consensus sequence for the CDP-binding element is (T/G)ATCGAT(C/A). This consensus sequence perfectly matches the GATCGATC motif in the IUR element. Other putative sites identified by the search included binding sites for the transcription factors, Sp1, C/EBPβ, opaque-1, anddorsal. In particular, putative Sp1, opaque, and C/EBP β sites were detected within the −100 to −77-nt region of theCXCL1 promoter. We first examined sequence-specific binding to the IUR element. Fig.2 A describes the nucleotide sequence −96 to −67 nt of the CXCL1 promoter.Uppercase letters represent the 20-bp IUR element, which we designate here as sequence R. Lowercase letters represent the adjacent NF-κB element. The TCGAT motif isunderscored. Oligonucleotide probes containing a single copy of the sequence R showed weak binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. However, probes containing two tandem copies of sequence R showed significantly stronger binding (data not shown). Fig.2 A shows the sequence of the oligonucleotide probes 2R and 2mR used in binding experiments in this study. The oligonucleotide probe 2R contains two tandem copies of the wild-type IUR sequence. The oligonucleotide probe 2mR contains multiple nucleotide replacements in the TCGAT motif each indicated by an asterisk. Theunderscored letters indicate the TCGAT motif. In Fig. 2 B, sequence-specific binding to the 2R and 2mR oligonucleotides is examined. Nuclear extract from RPE cells was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay on 4% native acrylamide gels (Fig. 2 B) for binding to32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the 2R (lanes 1–3) or the 2mR sequence (lanes 4–6). Two specific complexes were generated by the 2R probe but not the 2mR probe (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and4). The 2R-specific complexes were then competed with 1000-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide corresponding to either the wild-type (2R) or the mutant (2mR) sequences. The complexes with the 2R probe were resistant to competitions with 1000-fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide 2mR (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) but were completely eliminated by a similar excess of the 2R oligonucleotide. Since the only difference between the two oligonucleotide probes is the sequence of the TCGAT motif, the results of this experiment indicate that these complexes are specific to the TCGAT motif of the IUR element. In order to determine the relative molecular sizes of the factors interacting with the 2R probe, nuclear extract from RPE cells was examined for binding to the 2R oligonucleotide probe using Southwestern blot analysis. RPE nuclear extracts were first resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were incubated with 32P-labeled 2R probe. Similar blots probed with the 2mR oligonucleotide probe served as a negative control. Results of such an experiment are represented in Fig.2 C. The 2R oligonucleotide bound to two distinct proteins having relative molecular sizes of 170 and 80 kDa (lane 2). However, when probed with the 2mR oligonucleotide, no binding was detected in these extracts (lane 4). The results are consistent with data from the EMSA experiment in which the 2R oligonucleotide was bound by two specific complexes, whereas the 2mR oligonucleotide probe failed to bind any complex. The data together indicate that binding of both polypeptides appears to be specific to the TCGAT motif of the IUR element because mutations in this motif appear to block binding to the IUR element. Results from a transcription element search indicated that the IUR element contained a binding site for the CDP, which has a molecular size of 170–180 kDa. One of the proteins that bound to the 2R oligonucleotide probe also migrated with a relative molecular size of 170 kDa. We next examined the expression of CDP in RPE nuclear extracts using anti-CDP antibody in order to verify the presence of CDP in RPE nuclear extracts and determine the relationship of the two proteins p170 and p80 that bound to the 2R probe in Southwestern blot analysis. We reasoned that if the antibody detected only the 170-kDa polypeptide then the 80-kDa polypeptide was unrelated to CDP and distinct from it. However, if it recognized both polypeptides it would mean that the 80 kDa polypeptide was either a cleavage product of the 170-kDa CDP or antigenically similar to it. We examined RPE nuclear extracts by Western blot analysis using anti-CDP antibodies. In Fig. 2 D, RPE extracts were first electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the blots were incubated with antibodies raised against the C-terminal domain of the CDP protein. The data indicate that anti-CDP antibody detected two polypeptides with molecular sizes 170 and 80 kDa in RPE nuclear extracts, a result that closely resembled the binding data from the Southwestern blot analysis using the 2R oligonucleotide probe in Fig.2 C. Taken together, results from the TESS analysis and the Southwestern and the Western blot assays suggest the possibility that the 80-kDa polypeptide may be a specific cleavage product of the 170-kDa CDP protein or an alternatively spliced product of the CDP gene, analogous to the 76-kDa CDP spliced product, CASP (33Lievens P.M.J. Tufarelli C. Donady J.J. Stagg A. Neufeld E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). If CDP indeed binds to the IUR element, we reasoned that it should be present in the complexes associated with the 2R oligonucleotide probe in EMSA. Furthermore, recombinant CDP should be able to bind specifically the 2R oligonucleotide probe in EMSA. We employed three approac"

The 38-kDa protein was distinguished from ρ-crystallin expressed in the lenses of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and European common frog (Rana temporaria) immunochemically. Although the N terminus of the 38-kDa protein was blocked, the analyses of partial amino acid sequences showed that the protein was ζ-crystallin. Analysis of cDNA sequence encoding ζ-crystallin of the tree frog lens demonstrated that the deduced protein consisted of 329 amino acids including initial methionine and having 62.2 and 62.9% identity with ζ-crystallin of camel and guinea pig lenses, respectively. The molecular mass of the deduced structure was calculated to be 35,564 Da. ζ-Crystallin of the tree frog lens exhibited the intrinsic enzymatic activity of quinone reductase (EC 1.6.99.2, NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase). The crystallin specifically catalyzed the reduction of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (K m, 42 µm) using NADPH (K m, 60 µm) as a cofactor. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by dicumarol, anti-coagulant drug, with IC50 of 4 µm. On gel filtration chromatography, the crystallin was recovered as 150-kDa molecular mass complex, indicating that the crystallin was homotetramer consisting of 38-kDa subunits.

In vertebrates, α-, β-, and γ-crystallins are known as common crystallins. On the other hand, taxon-specific crystallins are also present in the lenses of some vertebrates and invertebrates. The taxon-specific crystallins were converted from various enzymes during evolution. For example, ε-crystallin of duck lens, δ-crystallin of chicken lens, and τ-crystallin of turtle lens retain intrinsic activity of lactate dehydrogenase, argininosuccinate lyase, or α-enolase, respectively (1Wistow G.

Aldo-keto reductases such as aldose reductase, aldehyde reductase, and prostaglandin F synthase are monomeric enzymes having molecular masses ranging from 30 to 40 kDa (5Wermuth B. Prog. Clin. Biol.

These enzymes catalyze the reduction of a variety of carbonyl compounds including 9,10-phenanthrenequinone using NADPH as a cofactor. ρ-Crystallin is also monomeric protein having a molecular mass of 36 kDa and maintains NADPH binding capacity, but the crystallin completely lost the enzymatic activity. Even in Japan, 39 species of the frogs and toads were classified into 5 genera on traditional taxonomy using bone morphology, etc. (8Maeda N. Matsui M. Frogs and Toads of Japan. 2nd Ed. Bun-Ichi Sogo Shuppan Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan1990: 8-9Google Scholar). However, the information for taxon-specific crystallin was limited to the Rana group. In this study, we chose Japanese tree frog (Hyla japonica) as the first approach for the new biochemical classification of frogs and toads based on taxon-specific crystallin structure. Indeed, a new type of taxon-specific crystallin was found in the tree frog lens, and here we will report the characterization of the structural, immunochemical, and enzymatic properties of the crystallin. The complete nucleotide sequence of its cDNA is also described. The Japanese tree frog was captured at a rice field in Fukui-plains, Japan. Lenses were removed and stored at −80 °C. Superdex G-200 and the low molecular weight marker kit were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Martrex Gel Orange A was purchased from Amicon (MA). Dicumarol, human IgG, ovalbumin, and myoglobin were obtained from Sigma. NADPH (NADH) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co. (Japan) and Nakalai Tesque (Japan), respectively. Other reagents were of highest grade. Japanese tree frog lens (40 mg) was homogenized in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.5% glycerol, and 0.005% NaN3. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The recovered supernatant was applied to a Superdex G-200 column (1.6 × 70 cm). Gel filtration chromatography was performed with the above buffer at room temperature. Quinone reductase-active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was applied on a Martrex Gel Orange A column (0.4 × 3 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A at room temperature. Quinone reductase was recovered by affinity elution chromatography using NADPH under the following conditions: flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; first washed with 140 ml of Buffer A and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 mm NADPH in 200 ml of Buffer A; detection, 280 nm. Quinone reductase activity was determined by the method of Rao et al. (9Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assay mixture (300 µl) contained 150 µl of 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 µl of 10 mm9,10-phenanthrenequinone ethanol solution, 3 µl of 30 mmNADPH, 45.5 µl of water, and 100 µl of enzyme solution per well of a microplate (96 wells). The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme solution, and the rate of oxidation of NADPH at 30 °C was measured at 340 nm using a microplate reader (model EL340, Bio-Tek). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that caused oxidation of 1 µmol of NADPH per min. The value of 62,200 was used as molecular extinction coefficient of the nucleotide. The light path length of 300 µl of the assay mixture in a well of microplate is 1 cm. The concentration of protein was determined by the dye-binding method described by Bradford (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE1(12.5% total acrylamide) of the enzyme was carried out by the method of Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) under reduced conditions. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R-250. Western blotting was carried out with anti-ρ-crystallin antibodies according to the method described previously (4Fujii Y. Watanabe K. Hayashi H. Urade Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9914-9923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of N terminus of the purified protein was carried out by the automated Edman degradation using a protein sequencer (477A, Applied Biosystems) equipped with high performance liquid chromatography (130A). For determination of partial amino acid sequences, the purified protein (100 µg) was digested with 1 µg of lysyl endopeptidase in 100 µl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 24 h. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 5 µl of trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK Super ODS column (Tosoh, Japan) under the following conditions: flow rate, 1 ml/min; temperature, 50 °C; solvent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 80% acetonitrile containing 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid; gradient, 0% B in 5 ml, 0–60% in 120 ml; detection, 215 nm. The amino acid sequences of several purified peptides were determined by the method described above. The total RNA of the tree frog lens (40 mg) was prepared by the method of acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). mRNA was purified using oligo(dT)20 latex (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (13Kuribayashi K. Hikata M. Hiraoka O. Miyamoto C. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1988; 19: 61-64PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA library of the tree frog lens was prepared with cDNA synthesis kit and cDNA PCR library kit (Takara, Japan) (14Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of the library have CA (5′-AGCGCGTGGTACCATGGTCTAGAGTCGACTAAGTAGGT-3′) and RA (5′-CTGATCTAGACCTGCAGGCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) linkers at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Based on the determined partial amino acid sequences Gly185-Leu-Asn-Leu-Val-Met-Gln and Ile299-Gly-Pro-Glu-Tyr-Pro, degenerate primers UP1 (5′-GGNYTNAAYYTNGTNATGCAR-3′) and LP1 (5′-TARTAYTCNGGNCCDAT-3′) were synthesized, respectively, and used for amplification of the frog ζ-crystallin cDNA by degenerate PCR. By using the same primers, the PCR product was analyzed by direct sequencing. Referring to the partial nucleotide sequence obtained, primers LP2 (5′-GGGGTACCATTGCAGAGGTTACAATTGGCC-3′), UP2 (5′-GGGGTACCATGCAGAATGGAGCCCACAAAG-3′), and UP3 (5′-GGGGTACCAAGGAGACCAGTATTATCGG-3′) were newly designed. For the determination of upstream sequence of the cDNA encoding ζ-crystallin, the PCR product generated with LP2 and CA primer (5′-CGTGGTACCATGGTCTAGAGT-3′) was inserted into pUC19 predigested withBamHI and KpnI, and resultant subclones were analyzed. For determination of downstream sequence including terminal codon, the PCR product generated with UP2 and RA primer (5′-CTGATCTAGACCTGCAGGCTC-3′) was also analyzed by direct sequencing using UP3. Northern and Southern blot analyses were performed by standard procedures. For Northern blot analysis, 5 µg of total RNA purified from various tissues of H. japonica were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.0% formaldehyde. After transfer of RNA onto a nylon membrane, the membrane was probed with the 32P-labeled 989 bp of ζ-crystallin cDNA fragment spanning 69–1058, in a solution containing 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% SDS, 100 µg/ml single-stranded salmon testis DNA, and 50% formamide for 16 h. Washing was done three times at 68 °C with a solution composed of 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 30 min. The filter was exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 8 h. The size of the ζ-crystallin was estimated by the positions of rRNAs and in vitro transcripts of known genes. As an internal loading control, the β-actin expression was detected by cross-hybridization to the32P-labeled human β-actin probe as above, except that a solution composed of 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS was used for washing. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA prepared from the liver of H. japonica by proteinase K treatment was purified with phenol/chloroform extraction. Sixty hundred µg of DNA digested with various restriction enzymes were run on 0.7% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane and probed with the32P-labeled 230-bp EcoRV fragment of the ζ-crystallin cDNA at 68 °C, in a solution containing 1m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% SDS, and 100 µg/ml single-stranded salmon testis DNA for 16 h. Washing was done three times at 68 °C with a solution composed of 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 30 min. The filter was exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 140 h. On an SDS-PAGE (Fig.1A), the protein-staining profile of the crude extract of Japanese tree frog lens (lane 1) was similar to that of Japanese bullfrog lens (lane 2). ρ-Crystallin of the bullfrog lens was clearly recognized as a single band with 36 kDa, and a taxon-specific crystallin with similar size to ρ-crystallin was also recognized in the tree frog lens. However, the molecular mass of the taxon-specific crystallin of the tree frog lens was estimated to be 38 kDa, which was 2 kDa higher than that of ρ-crystallin (36 kDa). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the 38-kDa crystallin did not cross-react with anti-ρ-crystallin antibody, and a slight amount of ρ-crystallin was detectable in the tree frog lens (Fig. 1 B). As to lenses of black-spotted pond frog (Rana nigromaculata) and wrinkled frog (Rana rugosa), the results of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were essentially identical to those of the bullfrog lens (data not shown). On a gel filtration chromatography (Fig.2), the crystallin of the tree frog lens was recovered in a molecular mass of 150 kDa, indicating that the crystallin was a tetramer consisting of 38-kDa subunits. The elution profile of quinone reductase (Fig. 2 A) was completely parallel to that of the crystallin (Fig. 2 B). ρ-Crystallin, monomeric protein, of the bullfrog lens was eluted just ahead of γ-crystallin. At final step, the crystallin was co-purified in a single band with quinone reductase activity by NADPH affinity elution chromatography using Martrex Gel Orange A (Fig.3). Thus, the crystallin was purified as quinone reductase with a specific activity of 5.71 units/mg of protein, and the yield was 44%. Based on densitometric analysis of the SDS gel (Fig. 1 A), the content of the crystallin was estimated to be 7.4% of total water-soluble protein of the lens.Figure 3NADPH affinity elution chromatography of ζ-crystallin of the tree frog lens. A, the pooled fraction (15.5 ml, 1.77 mg of total protein) described in the legend of Fig. 2 was dialyzed and applied to a Martex Gel Orange A column (0.4 × 3 cm). Fractions (3.5 ml/tube) were collected with flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. Linear gradient of NADPH was started at fraction 22. Protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm (solid line), and quinone reductase activities (closed circles) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions indicated by thethick solid line with ζ were pooled as the purified crystallin and quinone reductase. B, SDS-PAGE of all fractions from 1 to 35 was performed under reducing condition. Protein bands were stained with CBB R-250. The purified ζ-crystallin is indicated by arrow with ζ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified 38-kDa crystallin of the tree frog lens was repeated, but no amino acid residue was detected, indicating that the N terminus was blocked. Partial amino acid sequences of five peptides derived by lysyl endopeptidase digestion showed that the crystallin was homologous to taxon-specific ζ-crystallins of camel and guinea pig lenses with the intrinsic quinone reductase activity (15Rodokanaki A. Holmes R.K. Borras T. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 78: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Gonzalez P. Rao P.V. Nunez S.B. Zigler Jr., J.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 773-781PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding ζ-crystallin of the tree frog lens had 1,223-base pair nucleotides including a 987-base pair open reading frame (Fig.4). The primary structure composed of 329 amino acids including initial methionine was deduced and showed 62.3 and 62.9% identity to those of ζ-crystallins of Camelusand Cavia, respectively. The molecular mass of the crystallin was calculated to be 35,564 Da. When 9,10-phenanthrenequinone was used as the substrate for quinone reductase, ζ-crystallin of the tree frog lens showed a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the presence of NADPH as a cofactor (Fig. 5). TheK m value for the substrate was estimated to be 42 µm. Dicumarol, anti-coagulant drug, strongly inhibited the enzymatic activity with an IC50 of 4 µm(data not shown). The substrate specificity of ζ-crystallin of the tree frog was summarized in Table I. The crystallin preferred 9,10-phenanthrenequinone as the best substrate and specifically required NADPH as a cofactor. Dichlorophenyl indophenol was also a substrate, but 1,4-quinones such as menadione,p-quinone, 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone were not good substrates for the crystallin. The substrates for aldo-keto reductase such asp-nitrobenzaldehyde, xylose, prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin H2, except 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, were hardly reduced.Table ISubstrate specificity of quinone reductase/ζ-crystallin from Japanese tree frog lensCompoundsConcentrationRelative activitymm% (Km in mm)Substrates9,10-Phenanthrenequinone0.05100 (0.042)Dichlorophenyl indophenol0.19.6 (0.15)Menadione (vitamin K3)0.13.4p-Quinone0.12.42-Chloro-1,4-benzoquinone0.11.82-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone0.11.61,2-Cyclohexanedione31.5CofactorsNADPH0.3100 (0.060)NADH0.31.59,10-Phenanthrenequinone-reducing activity (209 milliunits/300 µl of assay mixture) was taken as 100%, and reducing activities for other substrates were indicated as relative activity (%).

Prostaglandin D2, E2, and H2 reducing activities were estimated by the method of Watanabe et al. (22Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the present assay buffer of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, instead of 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5.

Dichlorophenyl indophenol-reducing activity was determined as a decrease in absorbance at 630 nm. The value of 21,090 was used as molecular extinction coefficient of the substrate at 630 nm. Prostaglandin D2, E2, and H2 reducing activities were estimated by the method of Watanabe et al. (22Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

NADPH and NADH were estimated with 50 µm 9,10-phenanthrenequinone as a substrate. The distribution of the ζ-crystallin mRNA was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Among the tissues analyzed, the expression was detected only in the lens, showing a single transcript species of ∼1,300 nucleotides in length (Fig.6). The size of the ζ-crystallin transcript corresponded well with that of the isolated cDNA. Other tissues were negative for the expression even after longer exposure (data not shown). These data indicated that the ζ-crystallin gene is expressed specifically in the lens of H. japonica. The expression level is high but not so extraordinary, because 5 µg of lens total RNA was sufficient for the detection by 8 h of exposure to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen. Genomic Southern blot analysis was carried out to see if the ζ-crystallin gene is present in multiple copies in the H. japonica genome. As shown in Fig. 7, the radiolabeled 230-bp EcoRV fragment of the ζ-crystallin cDNA spanning 828–1058 detected two or three bands in each lanes. It is likely that the gene copy number in H. japonica is one or at most three, rather than highly multiple, although the genomic structure of the ζ-crystallin gene of H. japonica is not yet clear. We demonstrated that ζ-crystallin, as a new type of taxon-specific crystallin in amphibian, was expressed in the lens of Japanese tree frog (H. japonica). On the other hand, ρ-crystallin is known as the taxon-specific crystallins of Japanese bullfrog (R. catesbeiana) (4Fujii Y. Watanabe K. Hayashi H. Urade Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9914-9923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and European common frog (R. temporaria) (3Tomarev S.I. Zinovieva R.D. Dolgilevich S.M. Luchin S.V. Krayev A.S. Skryabin K.G. Gause Jr., G.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 171: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, ρ-crystallin is present in the lenses of black-spotted pond frog (R, nigromaculata) and wrinkled frog (R, rugosa). There is also the possibility that different types of crystallins are present in the lenses of frogs in other genera. As shown in Fig. 1, the difference between Japanese tree frog and bullfrog lenses was focused on the expression of each individual taxon-specific crystallin, ζ-crystallin and ρ-crystallin, respectively. It seems probable that, during evolution from a common ancestor family, Hyla selected quinone reductase as ζ-crystallin, whereas Rana chose aldo-keto reductase as ρ-crystallin. Therefore, these enzymes have presumably served as housekeeping enzymes before their conversion to crystallin in lens. Interestingly enough ζ-crystallin, characteristic of camelid and hystricomorph rodents, is expressed in a phylogenetically distant amphibian H. japonica lens. On the other hand, only ρ-crystallin has previously been known as taxon-specific crystallin of frogs. The life history and environment of Hyla are similar to those of Rana and distinctly different from those of camel and guinea pig. The evolutionary reason of the peculiar occurrence of ζ-crystallin in Hyla, Camelus,and Cavia is presently unknown. ρ-Crystallin belongs to the superfamily of aldo-keto reductase, but the crystallin lost enzymatic activity probably during its molecular evolution (4Fujii Y. Watanabe K. Hayashi H. Urade Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9914-9923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ζ-Crystallin of the tree frog lens as well as those of camel and guinea pig lenses (9Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Duhaiman A.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar) showed intrinsic enzymatic activity of quinone reductase. It is expected that overexpression of quinone reductase as ζ-crystallin does not affect the physiological functions of lens. However, it is known that structural disorder of ζ-crystallin with catalytic defect causes congenital nuclear cataract in the lens of the strain 13/N guinea pig (18Hung Q.L. Du X.Y. Stone S.H. Amsbaugh D.H. Datiles M. Hu T.S. Zigler Jr., J.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Rao P.V. Zigler Jr., J.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the structure with enzymatic activity might be involved in function of the ζ-crystallin in lens. Although, ρ-crystallin lost enzymatic activity, it is interesting that ζ- and ρ-crystallins retain NADPH-binding capacity as a common character. The tree frog lives on leaves and twigs of small shrubs and grasses in non-breeding seasons and on a waterside in breeding seasons. The bullfrog always lives on a waterside. Because, the waterside is an environment with much ultraviolet radiation, there is the possibility that NADPH in lenses of both frogs efficiently absorbs ultraviolet light and protects from toxicity caused by the irradiation. Interestingly, the nucleotide is present as crystallin binding form at least in Ranafrogs 2H. Kimoto, Y. Fujii, K. Ishikawa, and N. Nakai, unpublished data. as well as in guinea pig (20Rao P.V. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Zigler Jr., J.S. Rao P.V. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These situations suggest that both frogs, which are not able to live away from the waterside, may be adapted to an ultraviolet-rich environment. In hystricomorph rodents and camelids, ζ-crystallin gene is active in various tissues, besides lens (15Rodokanaki A. Holmes R.K. Borras T. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 78: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Gonzalez P. Rao P.V. Nunez S.B. Zigler Jr., J.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 773-781PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of theHyla enzyme crystallin is, however, lens-specific and undetectable even in liver and kidney. Loss of the crystallin transcript in these organs by nuclease action is unlikely, because β-actin mRNA as an internal control is clearly detectable. Environmental factor(s) such as ultraviolet light and endogenous radicals might facilitate maintenance of the quinone reductase and/or NADPH binding activities of this structural protein in the frog. Although precise number of Hyla ζ-crystallin gene is unknown, the present results of Southern blot analysis are not inconsistent with single copy. Since this protein fell into disuse in other tissues, expression in this frog lens might occur without gene duplication."

Furthermore, some Syt isoforms fail to exhibit Ca2+ binding because of amino acid substitutions (mutation of the Glu or Asp residue involved in Ca2+ binding) in the putative Ca2+ binding loops (14Li C.

J. 2001; 354: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the function of the Ca2+-independent type of C2 domains remains largely unknown. In this paper, we report the discovery of an unexpected function of the C2A domain of a third isoform of double C2 protein that contains a C2A domain and a C2B domain (Doc2γ; see Fig. 1 A) in nuclear localization (30Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Duncan R.R. Shipston M.J. Chow R.H. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the Doc2 family, the C2A domain of Doc2γ lacks Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity, probably because of the amino acid substitutions of the key amino acids (Glu or Asp) responsible for Ca2+ binding (30Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Kojima T. Fukuda M. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem.

Interestingly, six Arg residues are clustered at one of the putative Ca2+ binding loops in the Doc2γ C2A domain (see Fig. 3, #). Our deletion and mutation analyses indicate that these basic residues are essential for nuclear localization of Doc2γ instead of Ca2+ binding.Figure 3Alignment of the putative Ca2+binding loop 3 of the two C2 domains of the mouse C-type tandem C2 protein family.

Plasmid DNA was prepared by using Wizard® minipreps (Promega, Madison, WI) or Maxi prep kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). A mutant Doc2γΔR (deletion of amino acids 180–183 (four Arg residues) in the C2A domain) was essentially produced by means of two-step PCR techniques, as described previously (21Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

The PCR fragment obtained that encoded the mutant Doc2γΔR was digested withBamHI/SpeI, inserted into theBamHI/SpeI site of the pEF-T7 tag vector (19Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Transfection of pEF-T7-Doc2 into PC12 cells (0.5–1 × 105 cells, the day before transfection/35-mm dish; MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) or into COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells, the day before transfection/10-cm dish) was performed as described previously (19Fukuda M.

After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the PC12 cells were fixed, incubated with anti-T7 tag mouse monoclonal antibody (1/5000 dilution; Novagen, Madison, WI) and anti-p300 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and then visualized with anti-mouse Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa 568 antibodies (1/5000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively. In some cases, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added after immunostaining with anti-T7 tag antibody. Immunoreactivity was analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (TE300; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) attached to a laser confocal scanner unit CSU 10 (Yokogawa Electric Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and HiSCA CCD camera (C6790; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Images were pseudo-colored and superimposed with Adobe PhotoShop software (Version 4.0). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the standard method (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Preparation of liposomes consisting of l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), dipalmitoyl, and l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS), dioleoyl (1:1 w/w), and a phospholipid binding assay were performed as described previously (13Fukuda M.

Proteins bound to the PS/PC liposomes were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) by using bovine serum albumin for reference. The Doc2 family consists of three isoforms (α, β, and γ) in rats and mice (30Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although this carboxyl-terminal tandem C2 domain structure is also found in the synaptotagmin family and rabphilin-3A, the Doc2 family is distinguished from other tandem C2 protein families in possessing a Mid domain at their amino terminus (6Südhof T.C.

Naito A. Komuro R. Ohtsuka T. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 41Verhage M. de Vries K.J.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but the subcellular localization of Doc2γ has yet to be determined. To address this we expressed T7-tagged Doc2γ proteins in PC12 cells. To our surprise the Doc2γ proteins were almost exclusively localized in the nucleus and overlapped well with p300 transcription factor and DAPI (Fig. 1 B, top panels, and data not shown). The Doc2γ proteins seemed to be uniformly present throughout the nucleoplasm. By contrast, Doc2β proteins are mainly present in the cytosol, the same as Doc2α proteins (Fig. 1 B, bottom panels) (42Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine which domain is essential for the nuclear localization of Doc2γ, we produced four deletion mutants, each of which involves a different domain of Doc2γ (Doc2γΔC2AB, Doc2γΔC2B, Doc2γ-C2A, and Doc2γ-C2B; see Fig.2 A). First, we checked the size of the mutants by immunoblotting and confirmed that they were expressed correctly, with no degradation (Fig. 2 B). Each deletion mutant was then expressed in PC12 cells, and its subcellular localization was determined by immunocytochemistry, as described above (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, both the Doc2γΔC2B and Doc2γ-C2A proteins showed nuclear localization in PC12 cells, whereas the amino-terminal Mid domain was localized in the cytosol, and the Doc2γ-C2B protein was localized in both the nucleus and the cytosol. We therefore concluded that only the C2A domain contains a functional nuclear localization signal. Various nuclear localization signals have been determined in many proteins localized in nucleus, and they have often consisted of clusters of basic residues (Arg and Lys; reviewed in Ref. 43Jans D.A. Xiao C.-Y. Lam M.H.C. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that the Doc2γ-C2A domain contains a cluster of basic residues (177RLRRRRR183) in the putative Ca2+ binding loop 3, between the β6 and β7 strands (Fig. 3, #) (44Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the loop 3 domain of the Doc2γ C2A domain is three amino acids longer than in other carboxyl-terminal type (C-type) tandem C2 protein families, including Syts I-XIII (9Marquèze B. Berton F. Seagar M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28542-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), rabphilin-3A (47Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and other members of the Doc2 family (31Duncan R.R. Shipston M.J. Chow R.H. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that other C-type tandem C2 domains do not contain an Arg cluster at this position (Fig. 3). Consistent with this, there have been no reports of tandem C2 proteins that specifically localized in nucleus. Although three Asp residues between the β6 and β7 strands in the C2A domain of Syt I (asterisks in Fig. 3) are known to bind Ca2+ions (48Ubach J. Zhang X. Shao X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the C2A domain of Doc2γ lacks two Asp residues (Ser-176 and Pro-185), and because of these amino acid substitutions, the Doc2γ C2A domain does not display any clear Ca2+-dependent phospholipid (PS/PC liposome) binding activity (Fig. 4 B) (30Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether the basic cluster of the Doc2γ C2A domain is the sole nuclear localization signal of this protein, we produced a deletion mutant lacking four of six Arg residues (named Doc2γΔR; see Fig. 4 A). As expected, the Doc2γΔR proteins were mainly localized in the cytosol of PC12 cells and mostly absent in the nucleus (Fig. 4 C, top panels). Finally, we investigated whether the basic cluster alone of Doc2γ is a sufficient nuclear localization signal by producing chimera proteins between Doc2β and Doc2γ in which the loop 3 domain of Doc2β was replaced by that of Doc2γ (named Doc2β(R6); see Fig. 4 A). As a result of this substitution, the Doc2β(R6) C2A domain completely lost its Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity (Fig. 4 B), whereas the Doc2β(R6) proteins acquired the ability to localize in the nucleus of PC12 cells (Fig.4 C, bottom panels). These findings indicate that the basic cluster of Doc2γ is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of Doc2γ protein. This study revealed the novel function of the Ca2+-independent type of the Doc2γ C2A domain in nuclear localization. It is noteworthy that the basic cluster (RLRRRRR) is present in the putative Ca2+ binding loop 3, which is located at the apex of β-sandwich structure of the Doc2γ C2A domain (i.e. loop 3 functions as a nuclear localization signal rather than a Ca2+-binding site). Thus, the function of the loop domains of the C2 domain is more diversified than we expected. The function of Doc2γ in the nucleus remains unclear, but because Doc2α isoform is involved in secretory vesicle exocytosis (42Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y.

Besides a powerful and well documented effect on glycogen breakdown, glucagon also increases liver gluconeogenesis mainly by the allosteric inhibition of pyruvate kinase by its phosphorylation (4Feliu J.E.

In addition, some effects of glucagon on the fructose phosphate cycle have been described,i.e. inhibition of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (6Clark M.G.

Apart from these indisputable effects, a stimulation of glucose-6-phosphatase, a key enzyme in glucose production, has been proposed but never proven (8Begley P.J. Craft J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In view of a potential key role of glucose 6-phosphate as a cellular intermediate in the transcriptional effects of glucose (11Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pegorier J.P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20543-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Ferre P. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1999; 58: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), an effect of glucagon on glucose-6-phosphatase could be of major importance. Indeed, despite a prominent effect on liver glucose metabolism, the role of glucagon in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes is still unclear and a matter of debate (13Mittelman S.D. Fu Y.Y. Rebrin K. Steil G. Bergman R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3121-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By studying glucose production under steady state conditions in a model of rat hepatocytes perifused with dihydroxyacetone (DHA)1 as an exogenous source of carbohydrate, we show in the present work that despite a clear inhibitory effect of glucagon on pyruvate kinase, this effect was not responsible for the enhanced glucose production, indicating that this step is actually not controlling this pathway. Actually, the dramatic increase in the glucose production after glucagon addition was related to a substantial activation of glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in glucose and inorganic phosphate. This finding in vitro in liver cells was confirmed in vivo in postabsorptive rats depleted in glycogen, where we showed that glucagon increased hepatic glucose production whereas liver glucose 6-phosphate concentration decreased. Because we failed to find any change in the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in perifused hepatocyte with or without glucagon and only a minor effect in vivo, we hypothesized the possibility of an effect linked to a membrane vesicle traffic-based pathway originating from the endoplasmic reticulum, as it was recently proposed (14Guillam M.T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Guillam M.T. Hummler E. Schaerer E. Yeh J.I. Birnbaum M.J. Beermann F. Schmidt A. Deriaz N. Thorens B. Wu J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the effect of glucagon on glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis was temperature-sensitive, because it was completely abolished at 15 °C, converse to the effect on pyruvate kinase, which was not affected by temperature. Therefore we propose glucagon to be involved in hepatic glucose 6-phosphate concentration by activating its hydrolysis in a temperature-dependent pathway. Hence this hormone could be involved in the glucose sensing by liver cells via its phosphorylated metabolite, glucose 6-phosphate, and in turn in the transcriptional effects of glucose (11Foufelle F.

Soc. 1999; 58: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such a finding could lead to reconsider the role of glucagon in the pathogenesis and treatment of type II diabetes. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g), fasted for 24 h, were anesthetized intraperitoneally with sodium thiopental (125 mg/kg). Hepatocytes were isolated by the method of Berry and Friend (16Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar) as modified by Groen et al. (17Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Liver cells (200 mg of dry cells in 15 ml) were perifused by the method of van der Meer and Tager (18Van Der Meer R. Tager J.M. FEBS Lett. 1976; 67: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as modified by Groen et al. (17Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were perifused at 37 or 21 °C as indicated at a flow rate of 5 ml·min−1 with Krebs bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) continuously saturated with O2/CO2 (19:1) and containing calcium (1.3 mm) (19Argaud D. Halimi S. Catelloni F. Leverve X.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Piquet M.A. Fontaine E. Sibille B. Filippi C. Keriel C. Leverve X.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To study the metabolic effect of glucagon, perifused liver cells were titrated with DHA in the presence or absence of glucagon (10−7m). After a first steady state was reached (45 min) in the absence of DHA, seven successive steady states were obtained in the presence of increasing DHA concentrations (0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 1.20, 2.40, 4.80, and 9.60 mm) as indicated. Each steady state was obtained within 20 min after which both perifusate and cell samples were taken for subsequent analysis. Proteins in the perifusate were denatured by heating the samples (80 °C for 10 min) before centrifugation (21Leverve X.M. Verhoeven A.J. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Glucose, lactate, and pyruvate were measured in the perifusate, and DHAP, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and P-enolpyruvate were measured in the cellular fraction as described previously (20Piquet M.A. Fontaine E. Sibille B. Filippi C. Keriel C. Leverve X.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Leverve X.M. Fontaine E. Putod-Paramelle F. Rigoulet M. Eur. J.

The net fluxes (µmol/min/g dry cells) of gluconeogenesis (J glucose), glycolysis (J (L+P)), and DHA metabolism (J DHA) were calculated from the total cell content of the perifusion chamber, the perifusate flow rate, and the concentration of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in the perifusate. All determinations were made by enzymatic procedures (24Bergmeyer, H. U. (ed) (1974) Methods in Enzymatic Analysis, Vol. 4, pp. 1196, 1492, 1441, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar) with either spectrophotometric or fluorometric determination of NADH. The effects of glucagon on cytosolic and mitochondrial adenine nucleotide contents were studied in hepatocytes perifused in the presence of a constant DHA concentration (9.6 mm). After an initial period of 45 min, liver cells were exposed to glucagon (10−7m), and samples were taken from the chamber after 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min. The samples of cell suspension were quickly removed from the chamber, and cellular content was separated from the extracellular medium by centrifugation through a layer of silicone oil as described previously (25Argaud D. Roth H. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by liver cell fractionation with digitonin as described (26Zuurendonk P.F. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 333: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cytosolic adenine nucleotides were calculated by subtraction of the mitochondrial from the total intracellular value. ATP, ADP, and AMP were determined by HPLC (25Argaud D. Roth H. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase activity was assessed in hepatocytes incubated in closed vials containing Krebs bicarbonate buffer saturated with carbogene and 20 mm dihydroxyacetone with or without glucagon (10−7m) and at 15, 21, or 37 °C as indicated. After 30 min, 500 µl of cell samples were taken from the vials, and pyruvate kinase activity was assessed on cell pellets resuspended in 1.5 ml of a buffer containing 20 mmol/liter potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.25 mol/liter sucrose, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol. After homogenization for 1 min with an Ultraturax, the sample was centrifuged at 30,000 × gfor 15 min (Beckman J 21). Pyruvate kinase activity in the supernatant was determined in a solution of 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm TRIS-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 µl of the supernatant. Partially purified enzyme (L form) was obtained from 0.4 ml of the supernatant, washed with 0.3 ml of 100% (NH4)2SO4 (final concentration = 40%), and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were suspended in a medium (2 ml) containing 20 mmol/liter potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 30% glycerol, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 50 mmol/liter NaF, and pyruvate kinase activity was measured in a buffer containing 50 mm TRIS-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2(27Llorente P. Marco R. Sols A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Riou J.P. Claus T.H. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 656-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was expressed as the ratio of activity measured in 0.4 mmol/liter P-enolpyruvate to that of 4 mmol/liter P-enolpyruvate (v/V max), because this ratio has been shown to accurately reflect the phosphorylated state of the enzyme (29Claus T.H. El Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7855-7864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphatase was determined in similar experimental conditions of liver cells incubation as described for pyruvate kinase activity at 37 °C. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was determined after hypo-osmotic shock and cell disruption by sonication and assayed as described previously (30Daniele N. Rajas F. Payrastre B. Mauco G. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3597-3601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The contribution of nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated via the hydrolysis of β-glycerophosphate under the same assay conditions and subtracted from all measurements. The metabolic effects of glucagon were also studied in vivo. Rats were deprived of food for 5 h with free access to water before each experiment. After the rats were anesthetized, a polyethylene catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein for the infusion of saline or glucagon (60 ng/kg/min), and [3-3H]glucose (specific activity 370 GBq/mmol; Isotopchim, Ganagobie, France). A second catheter was placed in the left carotid artery for blood sampling. Blood glucose was monitored every 10 min during infusions using a glucometer II (Bayer Diagnostics, Puteaux, France). Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C by a rectal probe-monitored blanket. After 180 min, a laparotomy was performed to allow free access to the liver. A liver lobe was frozenin situ with tongs cooled with liquid nitrogen (−196 °C), weighed, and stored at −80 °C. Blood was collected for the determination of plasma glucose and glucagon concentration and the specific activity of glucose. A local ethics committee for animal experimentation approved this protocol. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was assayed at 30 °C and pH 7.3 in liver homogenates obtained from freeze-clamped samples as described previously (30Daniele N. Rajas F. Payrastre B. Mauco G. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3597-3601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Glucokinase was assayed in 12,000-g supernatants of liver homogenates at 30 °C and pH 7.3, as described by Bontemps et al. (31Bontemps F. Hue L. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate concentration was determined as described by Lang and Michal (32Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag-Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar) and glycogen content as described by Keppler and Decker (33Keppler D. Decker C. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag-Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL1974: 1127-1131Google Scholar). Plasma glucose concentration was determined as indicated above. Hepatic glucose production was assessed from [3-3H]glucose dilution. A bolus (88.8 kBq) was infused during the first minute, and [3-3H]glucose was then infused at 8.88 kBq/min. Plasma [3-3H]glucose radioactivity was measured in triplicate in the supernatants after ZnSO4 and BaOH2 treatment and evaporation to eliminate 3H2O. A steady state glucose-specific activity was obtained during the final 60 min of the experiment in rats infused with either saline or glucagon. The rate of disappearance of glucose, which equals the rate of glucose appearance in a steady state, was calculated by dividing the [3-3H]glucose infusion rate by the isotopic enrichment of plasma glucose. Hepatic glucose production was obtained from the rate of glucose appearance. For statistical analysis, results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The effects of glucagon effect were assessed by ANOVA (Stat View®; Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkley, CA, 1992) followed by a Student's t test for post-hoc analysis when necessary. Fig.1A shows that glucagon activates DHA metabolism, as deduced from glucose and lactate plus pyruvate production (J DHA =J (glucose × 2) +J (L+P)), with only 0.30 mm of infused DHA. Above 2 mm of DHA, J DHAexhibited a plateau with or without glucagon, butJ DHA was 30% higher in the presence of glucagon. This stimulatory effect on J DHA was accompanied by a decrease in DHAP concentration at every steady state of infusion of DHA (Fig. 1 B) allowing us to conclude that glucagon activates the pathway downstream of its first step of phosphorylation of DHA. This is confirmed by the shift to the left of the relationship between the cellular concentration of DHAP andJ DHA (Fig. 1 C); for a given cellular concentration of DHAP, J DHA was higher in the presence of glucagon, confirming the downstream activation of DHAP. Glucagon inhibited J (L+P) from DHA, and the extent of inhibition was dependent upon DHA concentration;J (L+P) was almost completely inhibited by glucagon at 0.3 mm DHA (2.9 ± 0.5 versus0.3 ± 0.03 µmol/min/g of dry cells for controls or glucagon). At 0.6 and 1.2 mm DHA the inhibitory effect was 76 and 63%, respectively, whereas at 9.6 mm the inhibition was only 32%. Linear double-reciprocal plots were obtained, as would classically be expected of systems following Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic kinetics (Fig. 2B). This allows the extrapolation to an apparent maximal velocity of 10 µmol/min/g of dry cells, which is unaffected by glucagon, whereas the apparent affinity clearly differed, 0.5 mm versus 4 mm of DHA for controls and glucagon, respectively. Hence, glycolytic rate was only slightly affected by glucagon at high substrate concentrations. With the model of perifused hepatocytes, it is possible to assess the kinetics of pyruvate kinase directly in intact cells by determining the relationship between phosphoenolpyruvate concentration and the pyruvate flux under steady state conditions. Indeed under this condition of continuous perifusate rinsing, the pyruvate kinase flux (J PK) can be assumed to be close toJ (L+P). As shown in Fig.3A, the classical allosteric inhibition of pyruvate kinase by glucagon was found in intact cells. The maximal inhibition by glucagon was observed between 500 and 1000 nmol P-enolpyruvate/g of dry cells, whereas above this value the fluxes reached almost a similar maximal rate in both groups indicating that the V max was not affected by glucagon. In rat liver cells, phosphoenolpyruvate is present in both the cytosol and the mitochondria, whereas the substrate for pyruvate kinase is in the cytoplasm. The 3-phosphoglycerate (Fig. 3 B), a purely cytosolic metabolite, is an indicator of cytosolic P-enolpyruvate concentration, because it is in equilibrium with cytosolic P-enolpyruvate. A similar relationship as that reported for P-enolpyruvate confirmed the data presented in Fig. 3 A. In fact, the linear relationship between 3-phosphoglycerate and P-enolpyruvate in both controls and glucagon-treated cells (Fig.3 C) permits us to exclude a significant effect of glucagon on the subcellular distribution of P-enolpyruvate. When the cellular concentration of DHAP was plotted againstJ (L+P), to investigate the pathway from DHAP to (L+P) production, it appears that a unique relationship was found with or without glucagon (Fig. 4A). This excludes any net effect of the hormone on this part of the pathway, which, however, involves pyruvate kinase. Hence, whereas glucagon inhibited the pathway from P-enolpyruvate to (L+P) production (Fig. 3), this effect was no longer present when the pathway was considered from DHAP (Fig. 4 A). Fig. 4 B shows the relationship between the steady state concentrations of DHAP and P-enolpyruvate, which was downshifted in the presence of glucagon; whereas P-enolpyruvate was in a similar range of concentration in both groups, DHAP was lowered by glucagon. The steps located between DHAP and P-enolpyruvate are believed to work at near equilibrium under similar experimental conditions (34Groen A.K. van Roermund C.W. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); therefore the relationship between DHAP and P-enolpyruvate is expected to depend on the cytosolic ATP to ADP ratio (at the phosphoglycerate kinase level; EC 2.7.2.3) and on the redox state (at the glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase level; EC 1.2.1.12). There was no major effect of glucagon on the lactate to pyruvate ratio; therefore a change in cytosolic redox state is unlikely (Fig. 4 C). TableIshows ATP, ADP, and total nucleotide (ATP + ADP + AMP) concentrations, as well as ATP to ADP ratios in the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix, with or without glucagon. Although no significant effect was found in the mitochondrial matrix, glucagon significantly lowered cytosolic ADP (p < 0.01), leading to a marked increase in the ATP to ADP ratio (p < 0.01). Because, converse to the present results (Fig. 4 B), this effect would increase the ratio of DHAP to P-enolpyruvate, it indicates that this ratio of cytosolic intermediates might not be close to equilibrium with the cytosolic concentrations of ATP and ADP in these conditions. Taken together these results show that the inhibition of pyruvate kinase by glucagon does not explain the inhibition of (L+P) production, because pyruvate kinase is probably not a controlling step of the glycolytic pathway between DHAP andJ (L+P).Table IEffect of glucagon on adenine nucleotides in isolated perifused hepatocytesTime0510152030CytoMitoCytoMitoCytoMitoCytoMitoCytoMitoCytoMitominATPControl8.5 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.48.5 ± 0.92.3 ± 0.28.4 ± 0.62.5 ± 0.212.1 ± 0.52.8 ± 0.210.9 ± 1.32.3 ± 0.39.8 ± 1.32.2 ± 0.2Glucagon8.3 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.310.9 ± 0.52.4 ± 0.18.9 ± 1.52.5 ± 0.18.9 ± 1.12.2 ± 0.29.4 ± 1.32.5 ± 0.29.9 ± 1.32.2 ± 0.1ADPControl1.4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.51.8 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.1Glucagon1.5 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.1ΣAN1-aΣAN, ATP + ADP + AMP.Control10.5 ± 0.13.7 ± 0.510.4 ± 1.35.7 ± 0.39.4 ± 0.95.2 ± 0.314.2 ± 0.95 ± 0.312.9 ± 1.74.6 ± 0.312.1 ± 1.74.2 ± 0.3Glucagon10.3 ± 0.53.3 ± 0.112.0 ± 0.75.0 ± 0.19.4 ± 2.05.0 ± 0.19.2 ± 1.54.4 ± 0.510.3 ± 2.14.5 ± 0.110.8 ± 1.74.1 ± 0.1ATP/ADPControl6.2 ± 1.31.0 ± 0.06.4 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.15.3 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.41.42 ± 0.15.5 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.81.4 ± 0.1Glucagon6 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.110.8 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.111.5 ± 3.21.2 ± 0.114.6 ± 2.21.2 ± 0.112.2 ± 2.61.3 ± 0.112.1 ± 2.61.4 ± 0.1Hepatocytes were perifused for 45 min at 37 °C and then att= 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after the addition of glucagon (or in controls); 0.3-ml samples were removed from the chamber for mitochondria and cytosol separation (see “Materials and Methods”).

Fig. 5Ashows that glucagon activated the pathway between DHA and glucose production resulting in nearly a 2-fold stimulation inJ glucose. This effect was because of an activation downstream of DHAP as evidenced by the double relationship between DHAP and J glucose with or without glucagon (Fig. 5 B). Phosphoglucoisomerase works at near equilibrium under these conditions (Fig. 5 C), and the dramatic activation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon was because of a stimulatory effect located downstream of glucose 6-phosphate (Fig.5 D). Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was determined in our conditions with and without glucagon, and we failed to find any difference according to the presence of the hormone; glucose-6-phosphatase activity was 1654 ± 70 µmol/min/g of dry cell and 1620 ± 74 µmol/min/g of dry cell with or without glucagon, respectively (n = 6; not significant). Glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (35Burchell A. Faseb J. 1990; 4: 2978-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), requiring glucose 6-phosphate to be transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum and the glucose to be transported back into the cytosol (37Thorens B. Cheng Z.Q. Brown D. Lodish H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C279-C285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because glucose-6-phosphatase per se is not involved in the effect of glucagon, another step must be involved. In a recent work based on GLUT2-deficient mice, an alternative mechanism for hepatic glucose output other than GLUT2-facilitated diffusion was proposed based on a membrane-traffic mechanism, which was temperature-sensitive (14Guillam M.T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Guillam M.T. Hummler E. Schaerer E. Yeh J.I. Birnbaum M.J. Beermann F. Schmidt A. Deriaz N. Thorens B. Wu J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We have investigated this possibility, and the data presented in TableIIshow that the glucagon-related activation of glucose production was inhibited at low temperature in hepatocytes incubated in closed vials. Conversely, the allosteric inhibition of pyruvate kinase by glucagon was not effected by low temperature as assessed by the ratio of v 0.4/v 4 mm P-enolpyruvate (see “Material and Methods”), which was almost identical at 15, 21, and 37 °C. The finding of a low temperature sensitivity of the effect of glucagon on glucose production was confirmed in hepatocytes perifused at 21 °C. (Fig.6A). In this condition the activation of glucose production by glucagon was still present at 21 °C, albeit to a less extent as compared with the effect observed at 37 °C (see Fig. 5). This activation was located downstream of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as evidenced by the shift to the left of the relationship between DHAP and J glucose in the presence of glucagon (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly the shape of the relationship between fructose 6-phosphate (Fig. 6 C) or glucose 6-phosphate (Fig. 6 D) andJ glucose was not affected by glucagon, converse to the results obtained at 37 °C (see Fig. 5 D). This finding indicates that the effect of glucagon on glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis and glucose release was temperature-sensitive, because it was present a"

However, little is known about the interaction of internalization signals with AP-2 in live cells in the absence of clathrin lattices. To investigate this issue, we employed cells cotransfected with pairs of antigenically distinct influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mutants containing different internalization signals of the YXXZ family. To enable studies on the possible association of the naturally trimeric HAs into higher order complexes via binding to AP-2, we exploited the inability of HAs from different influenza strains to form mutual trimers. Thus, we coexpressed HA pairs from different strains (Japan and X:31) bearing similar cytoplasmic tails mutated to include internalization signals. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching on live cells, we demonstrate that internalization-competent HA mutants form higher order complexes and that this clustering depends on the strength of the internalization signal. The clustering persisted in cells treated with hypertonic medium to disperse the clathrin lattices, as validated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The clustering of HAs bearing strong internalization signals appears to be mediated via binding to AP-2, as indicated by (i) the coprecipitation of α-adaptin with these HAs, even in hypertonically treated cells; (ii) the co-localization (after hypertonic treatment) of AP-2 with antibody-mediated patches of these mutants; and (iii) the dispersal of the higher order HA complexes following chlorpromazine treatment, which removes AP-2 from the plasma membrane. These results suggest that even in the absence of clathrin lattices, AP-2 exists in multivalent complexes capable of simultaneously binding several internalization signals from the same family.

In general, internalization signals fall into three broad groups: tyrosine-based, dileucine-based, and a less defined variable third group (8Sandoval I.V. Bakke O.

Tyrosine-based signals typically contain the sequence YXXZ or NPXY, where X can be any amino acid and Z is an amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain (10Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14Trowbridge I.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The YXXZ family of signals is the best characterized in terms of interactions with AP-2 and was demonstrated by in vitro studies to bind to the µ2-subunit of the complex (10Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15Sorkin A. Carpenter G.

EBMO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The binding partner of other families of internalization signals is less clear. One study suggests that NPXY signals bind directly to clathrin (18Kibbey R.G. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and studies of the binding of dileucine-containing peptides to the µ-chains of AP-2 and AP-1 have yielded contradictory results (16Ohno H.

Although there are indications that membrane proteins carrying internalization signals may bind to AP-2 complexes prior to their association with clathrin lattices (21Brown C.M. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. Petersen N.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15166-15173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), some observations suggest that clathrin and AP-2 assemble on the membrane and subsequently capture cargo (22Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 23von Poser C. Zhang J.Z. Mineo C. Ding W. Ying Y. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.

Moreover, there is in vitro evidence that clathrin modulates interactions between AP-2 and internalization signals, as the affinity of YXXZ signal peptides for AP-2 increases by an order of magnitude following the binding of AP-2 to clathrin in coated vesicles (24Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, the order of binding of the different components of these complexes to each other in the living cell and the nature of the complexes formed are not fully understood. To explore this issue, we employed a series of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)1 mutants carrying YXXZ signals that vary in the efficiency in which they promote internalization (25Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Fire E. Gutman O. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Biol.

Since wild-type (wt) HA has no internalization signals and is not internalized, signals introduced into its cytoplasmic tail generate “gain-of-function” mutants with which the efficacy of different signals can be directly compared (25Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,27Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol.

Depending on the strength of the internalization signal, internalization-competent HA mutants exhibit either transient or stable interactions with coated pits (26Fire E. Gutman O. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21075-21081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); furthermore, HA mutants with strong internalization signals can form higher order complexes (clusters) (26Fire E. Gutman O. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21075-21081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine if the clustering of internalization-competent HA mutants occurs through interactions with AP-2 or requires the entire, preformed coated pit, in this study, we have employed antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching at the surface of live cells combined with co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HA proteins from different influenza virus strains do not form mixed trimers in co-infected cells (30Boulay F. Doms R.W. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have coexpressed pairs of such antigenically distinct HAs (Japan and X:31 HA mutants) and investigated their mutual interactions as well as interactions with AP-2 at the plasma membrane. Our results demonstrate that even after dispersal of the clathrin lattices, AP-2 exists in the cell in multivalent complexes or clusters that can simultaneously bind and bridge together several separate internalization-competent HA proteins. Hanks' balanced salt solution, protein A-Sepharose 4B, n-propyl gallate, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (n-octyl glucoside), and chlorpromazine HCl were from Sigma.

Several cytoplasmic domain mutants with either strong or weak YXXZinternalization signals were prepared from the cDNA encoding A/Japan/305/57 HA and introduced into the SV40-based vector pkSVE (35Roth M.G. Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mutants and their designations are depicted in Table I.

In the X:31/Japan chimeras, the coding sequences for the external and transmembrane domains of X:31 HA were joined in-frame to the coding sequence of the short cytoplasmic domain of the various Japan HA mutants by “megaprimer” PCR mutagenesis (36Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) in two rounds. First, pkSVE plasmids containing the various Japan HA mutant cDNAs were linearized and used as templates for PCR with a 5′-oligonucleotide encoding 18 bases of the X:31 HA region immediately preceding the transmembrane/cytoplasmic junction and 18 bases of the Japan HA sequence from the start of the region encoding the cytoplasmic domain. The 3′-oligonucleotide was 28 bases long, complementary to SV40 sequences 190 bases downstream from the first oligonucleotide, and encoded a SalI restriction site at the end. PCR produced a 190-base pair fragment that was isolated and used in a second round of PCR. The template for this round was pkSVEX31, containing X:31 HA cDNA in place of Japan HA; the sequence of X:31 HA cDNA is given in Ref. 37Gething M.-J. Bye J. Skehel J. Waterfield M. Nature. 1980; 287: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar. A 5′-oligonucleotide with the sequence of the coding strand upstream from the unique XhoI site in X:31 HA was added with the 190-base pair chimeric fragment, which served as the 3′-primer. PCR generated a 530-base pair double-stranded DNA fragment, which was isolated, digested with XhoI andSalI, and used to replace the 530-base pair wild-typeXhoI-SalI fragment in pkSVEX31. The identity of the chimeric HAs was confirmed by sequencing. An additional mutant with a dileucine internalization signal was prepared from Japan HA by replacing the cytoplasmic sequence with that of the LIMP II protein following a previously described protocol (36Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 38Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Experiments were preformed 36–38 h post-infection (for wt HA, HA+4, and HA-Y543) or after 44–46 h (for HA+8, HA-Y543,F546, and HA-Y543,L546) (for mutant nomenclature, see Table I). The longer infection time for the latter mutants, whose surface expression is low due to their fast internalization, was selected so that their surface density will be close to that of the other mutants (see Table I) (27Zwart D.E.

In some experiments, the cationic amphiphilic drug chlorpromazine, which causes a redistribution of AP-2 from the plasma membrane to endosomes (44Subtil A. Hemar A. Dautry Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), was added to cells at 100 µm in hypertonic buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. To measure the clustering of HA trimers directly at the surface of live cells, we employed immunofluorescence microscopy to detect antibody-mediated co-patching of antigenically distinct HA mutants as described (46Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 47Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J.

Briefly, CV-1 cells co-infected with pairs of recombinant SV40 virus vectors expressing X:31/Japan or Japan HA mutants with identical cytoplasmic tails were plated on glass coverslips and incubated for the periods described above. Following hypertonic treatment (with or without chlorpromazine), the cells were processed with untreated controls for the co-patching experiments. All ensuing incubations were in the same buffer used for the treatment (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 1% bovine serum albumin with or without sucrose and chlorpromazine) and were conducted at 4 °C to enable exclusive cell-surface labeling and to eliminate internalization. Under our experimental conditions, which combine low temperature (preventing the pinching off of vesicles from the membrane) and hypertonic treatment, there was no detectable internalization as validated both biochemically (by a Trypsin accessibility assay of IgG-labeled surface HA proteins) and by immunofluorescence (27Zwart D.E.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated successively with the following reagents: (i) HC3 mouse anti-X:31 IgG (50 µg/ml), rabbit anti-Japan IgG (50 µg/ml), and normal goat IgG (200 µg/ml, added for blocking) for 1 h; (ii) FITC-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (20 µg/ml) and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (5 µg/ml) for 1 h; and (iii) Cy3-streptavidin (0.5 µg/ml) for 30 min. This protocol enhances the originally lower patching by monoclonal anti-X:31 IgG to a level similar to that of the rabbit anti-Japan IgG. After washing, the cells were fixed in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C and with acetone for 2 min at −20 °C and mounted with Mowiol containing 29 mm n-propyl gallate. Fluorescent digital images were acquired using a CCD camera as described (48Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The FITC and Cy3 images were exported to Photoshop (Adobe, Mountain View, CA) and superimposed. The numbers of red, green, and yellow (superimposed red and green) patches were counted on the computer screen on 20 × 20-µm2flat cell regions; in each case, at least 100 patches were counted per cell on 10–15 cells. Experiments on the co-patching of AP-2 along with HA mutants followed a similar protocol using cells expressing only the Japan HA mutant. After patching the HA mutant at the cell surface with anti-Japan IgG followed by FITC-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, the cells were fixed/permeabilized by methanol and acetone, followed by labeling α-adaptin with AP.6 IgG (20 µg/ml in the presence of 200 µg/ml normal goat IgG, 45 min, 22 °C) and Cy3-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (5 µg/ml, 45 min, 22 °C). CCD imaging and the counting of co-localized patches were carried out as described above for HA co-patching. CV-1 cells were co-infected with pairs of X:31/Japan and Japan HA mutants as in the co-patching studies and plated on 60-mm dishes for 36–46 h. After hypertonic treatment, each culture was solubilized in 0.3 ml/dish cold n-octyl glucoside lysis buffer (1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture). After nuclei and cell debris were removed, the relative amount of the Japan HA mutant in 20 µl of each lysate was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% acrylamide) followed by Western blotting as described earlier (31Fire E. Brown C.M. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. Petersen N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29538-29545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using anti-Japan IgG (10 µg/ml) and peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) for visualization by ECL. Blots were quantified by densitometry (described below) so that lysate volumes containing comparable amounts of the Japan HA form of each mutant were taken for immunoprecipitation. The lysates were diluted to 0.33%n-octyl glucoside and cleared by preincubation with protein A-Sepharose (40 µg/ml, 1 h, 40 °C), and the Japan HA mutant was precipitated by anti-Japan IgG (20 µg/ml, 2 h, 4 °C) and protein A-Sepharose (80 µg/ml, 2 h, 4 °C). The pellets were washed with buffer containing 0.1% n-octyl glucoside, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol; dissolved and boiled in Laemmli loading buffer; and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The coprecipitated X:31/Japan HA mutants were identified by Western blotting with rabbit anti-X:31 IgG (15 µg/ml) and peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000). After washing, the filters were reacted for 5 min with SuperSignal and exposed to auto"
