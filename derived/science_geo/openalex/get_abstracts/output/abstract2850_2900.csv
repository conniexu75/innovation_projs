https://openalex.org/W141312638,"When cultured human lymphocytes of the IM-9 line were exposed to human growth hormone (hGH) at 37 degrees, washed for 2 hours, and incubated with 125I-hGH, the binding of 125I-hGH was reduced. The magnitude of the reduction in binding was dependent on the concentration of growth hormone present as well as the duration of the exposure. As little as 2 X 10(-11) M (0.5 ng/ml) growth hormone had a discernible effect. Growth hormone at 2 X 10(-10) M (5.0 ng/ml), which is a low resting concentration of hormone in vivo and occupies about 20% of the receptors at steady state at 30 degrees, produced a 50% reduction in binding while 20 mg/ml, which occupies about 50% of the receptors under steady state conditions, produced an 80% loss of receptors. Further increases in growth hormone concentration produced little further effect on receptor loss. Thus, the loss of receptors at a given concentration of growth hormone (up to 20 ng/ml) in the preincubation at 37 degrees was greater than the occupancy produced by that concentration of growth hormone receptors under steady state conditions at 30 degrees. Analysis of the data indicated that the decrease in binding of 125I-hGH was due to a loss of receptors per cell without any change in affinity of receptor for hormone or in cell number. The concentration of insulin receptors on these cells was affected by the insulin concentration in the medium, and the concentration of growth hormone receptors was affected by growth hormone, but neither hormone had any effect on the heterologous receptors. Exposure of the cells to cycloheximide (0.1 mM) produced a progressive but smaller loss of growth hormone receptors, and the effect of cycloheximide was additive to the receptor loss induced by growth hormone, suggesting that cycloheximide inhibited synthesis of receptors while growth hormone accelerated loss of receptors. When growth hormone was removed from the medium, receptor concentrations were restored rapidly; half of the loss was restored by 6 to 8 hours and the full complement of receptors was restored by 24 hours following removal of the hormone. If the growth hormone was removed and replaced with cycloheximide, the return of the receptors was delayed until the cycloheximide was removed. Thus restoration of the receptors appeared to require the synthesis of new proteins. These data indicate that in the IM-9 lymphocytes the concentration of growth hormone receptors is very sensitive to regulation by growth hormone and also add further support to the suggestion that hormones in general actively regulate the concentration of their own receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1551834526,"A double antibody immunoprecipitation technique using affinity-purified adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) antiserum was employed to investigate the biosynthesis of ACTH in a mouse pituitary tumor cell line. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell extracts resolved four forms of ACTH with apparent molecular weights of 4,500, 13,000, 23,000, and 31,000. These four forms of ACTH can be detected by radioimmunoassay of cell extracts or by immunoprecipitation of cell extracts following incubation of cultures in [3H] tryptophan, [3H] lysine, or [3H] tyrosine. The double antibody immunoprecipitation scheme developed is specific, quantitative, and reproducible. ACTH biosynthesis was examined in both steady and pulse-labeling experiments using [8H] tyrosine or [3H] lysine. The results of these experiments are consistent with the proposal that Mr=31,000 ACTH is the biosynthetic precursor for all three smaller forms of ACTH and that Mr=23,000 ACTH is a biosynthetic intermediate. Both Mr=13,000 ACTH and Mr=4,500 ACTH are derived from the intracellular processing of Mr=31,000 ACTH."
https://openalex.org/W1592938589,"Adenosine 3':5' -monophosphate (cyclic AMP) -dependent protein kinase from bovine heart muscle catalyzes the phosphorylation of its regulatory, cyclic AMP-binding subunit. Phosphorylation enhances net dissociation of the enzyme by cyclic AMP. Chromatography on omega-aminohexyl-agarose was used to study the effects of phosphorylation on cyclic AMP binding and subunit dissociation and reassociation. This method permitted rapid separation of the catalytic subunit from the cyclic AMP -binding protein and holoenzyme. Phospho- and dephosphoprotein kinases were found to dissociate to the same extent at any given concentration of cyclic AMP and completely at saturation. At equilibrium, the amount of cyclic AMP bound was the same for both forms of enzyme and was directly proportional to the degree of dissociation of the holoenzyme. In the absence of cyclic AMP, phospho- and dephospho-cyclic AMP-binding proteins reassociated completely with the catalytic subunit. However, the rate of reassociation of the dephospho-cyclic AMP-binding protein was at least 5 times greater than the phospho-cyclic AMP-binding protein. Retardation of reassociation was directly proportional to the extent of phosphorylation. We conclude that the degree to which the cyclic AMP-binding protein is phosphorylated markedly affects its intrinsic ability to combine with the catalytic subunit to regenerate the inactive cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase and that the state of phosphorylation of this subunit may be important in detemining the proportion of dissociated (active) and reassociated (inactive) protein kinase at any given time."

The changes serve as experimental observables in competition experiments between diamagnetic and paramagnetic metal ions for melanin binding sites and between melanin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for paramagnetic metal ions. Evidence is presented for the existence of several specific types of metal binding sites. The interaction of copper with free radicals leading to loss of electron spin resonance signal amplitude is magnetic in nature and not, as has been supposed, chemical."
https://openalex.org/W1544747395,"A reversible interconversion of two kinetically distinct forms of hepatic pyruvate kinase regulated by glucagon and insulin is demonstrated in the perfused rat liver. The regulation does not involve the total enzyme content of the liver, but rather results in a modulation of the substrate dependence. The forms of pyruvate kinase in liver homogenates are distinguished by measurements of the ratio of the enzyme activity at a subsaturating concentration of P-enolpyruvate (1.3 mM) to the activity at a saturating concentration of this substrate (6.6 mM). A low ratio form of pyruvate kinase (ratio between 0.1 and 0.2) is obtained from livers perfused with 10(-7) M glucagon or 0.1 mM adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). A high ratio form of the enzyme is obtained from livers perfused with no hormone (ratio = 0.35 to 0.45). The regulation of pyruvate kinase by glucagon and cyclic AMP occurs within 2 min following the hormone addition to the liver. Insulin (22 milliunits/ml) counteracts the inhibition of pyruvate kinase caused by 5 X 10(-11) M glucagon, but has only a slight influence on the enzyme properties in the absence of the hyperglycemic hormone. The low ratio form of pyruvate kinase obtained from livers perfused with glucagon or cyclic AMP is unstable in liver extracts and will revert to a high ratio form within 10 min at 37 degrees or within a few hours at 0 degrees. Pyruvate kinase is quantitatively precipitated from liver supernatants with 2.5 M ammonium sulfate. This precipitation stabilizes the enzyme and preserves the kinetically distinguishable forms. The kinetic properties of the two forms of rat hepatic pyruvate kinase are examined using ammonium sulfate precipitates from the perfused rat liver. At pH 7.5 the high ratio form of the enzyme has [S]0.5 = 1.6 +/- 0.2 mM P-enolpyruvate (n = 8). The low ratio form of enzyme from livers perfused with glucagon or cyclic AMP has [S]0.5 = 2.5 +/- 0.4 mM P-enolpyruvate (n = 8). The modification of pyruvate kinase induced by glucagon does not alter the dependence of the enzyme activity on ADP (Km is approximately 0.5 mM ADP for both forms of the enzyme). Both forms are allosterically modulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, L-alanine, and ATP. The changes in the kinetic properties of hepatic pyruvate kinase which follow treating the perfused rat liver with glucagon or cyclic AMP are consistent with the changes observed in the enzyme properties upon phosphorylation in vitro by a clyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase (Ljungstrom, O., Hjelmquist, G. and Engstrom, L. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 358, 289--298). However, other factors also influence the enzyme activity in a similar manner and it remains to be demonstrated that the regulation of hepatic pyruvate kinase by glucagon and cyclic AMP in vivo involes a phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1575451294,"Types I and II cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinases have been studied during the cell cycle of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells were synchronized by selective detachment of mitotic cells from monolayer cultures. Protein kinases were separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and were similar to the types of cAMP-dependent protein kinases studied in skeletal muscle and in heart extracts. The total amount of protein kinases activity per cell was substantial, both in mitosis and at the G1/S boundary. During mitosis, the relatively high activity of protein kinase was due to a predominance of type I protein kinase. During early G1, the activity of type I protein kinase decreased and there was little detectable type II activity. A rapid increase in the activity of type II was evident at the G1/S boundary. The administration of puromycin (50 mug/ml) from 1 to 5 hours after selective detachment of mitotic cells abolished the activity of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase seen at the G1/S border, but had no observable effect on the activity of type I protein kinase. The data presented demonstrate cell cycle-specific activity patterns of type I and type II protein kinase Type I protein kinase activity is high in mitosis and is constant throughout the cell cycle. Increased type II protein kinase activity seems to be related to the initiation of DNA synthesis in S phase. The data suggest a translational control of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1488859078,"Three types of partially purified ATPase enzymes having different phospholipid contents and compositions have been prepared: (a) an enzyme whose phospholipid moiety has been replaced predominantly by dioleoyl lecithin (DOL-enzyme), with about the same phospholipid content as the original sarcoplasmic reticulum, (b) dipalmitoyl lecithin-replaced enzyme whose phospholipid content is 30% of that of DOL-enzyme (DPL-enzyme), and (c) a partially delipidated enzyme with about the same phospholipid content as DPL-enzyme but with the original sarcoplasmic reticulum phospholipid composition (del-enzyme). The temperature dependence of Ca2+-activated ATPase activity of these preparations showed clearcut differences; with DOL-enzyme there was no appreciable break in the Arrhenius plot in the 3-40 degrees range; DPL-enzyme showed a break at 29 degrees, and del-enzyme and sarcoplasmic reticulum one at 18 degrees. Transition temperatures obtained from ESR studies with the use of spin-labeled stearic acid incorporated into the membranes agreed with those derived from ATPase assays. Thermo-dynamic analysis of the ATP hydrolysis rates shows that DPL-enzyme has considerably larger values of activation enthalpy and activation entropy below the transition temperature (29 degrees) than those of the other preparations, while all enzyme preparations show similar free energies of activation. The ESR data show that below their transition temperatures DPL-enzyme, and to a lesser degree del-enzyme, have a strongly restricted motion of their phospholipid molecules as compared with either DOL-enzyme or sarcoplasmic reticulum. Studies on the formation and decomposition of phosphoenzyme have been carried out with the three types of ATPase preparations. At 0 degrees, the rate of inorganic phosphate liberation is 8 times lower in DPL-enzyme than in del-enzyme with little difference in the steady state level of phosphoenzyme. In DOL-enzyme, the level of phosphoenzyme and the rate of inorganic phosphate liberation are 1.8 and 3.5 times higher than the corresponding values obtained with del-enzyme. Addition of ADP to the phosphorylated intermediate of DPL-enzyme induces a fast reversal of the phosphorylation reaction. These results indicate that the physical state of the phospholipid molecules associated with the enzyme affects the decomposition of phosphoenzyme, with little effect on the phosphorylation reaction and its reversal."
https://openalex.org/W1589632926,"Mouse pituitary tumor cells (AtT-20/D-16v) were incubated in medium containing [3H] glucosamine or [3H] mannose. By analyzing immunoprecipitates of cell extracts and culture medium it was shown that [3H] glucosamine and [3H] mannose were incorporated into all three high molecular weight forms of ACTH; label was not incorporated into Mr=4,500 ACTH (which is thought to be similar to the 39 amino acid polypeptide form of ACTH, alpha(1-39)). Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the apparent molecular weights of these glycoprotein forms of ACTH were 31,000, 23,000, and 13,000. Gel filtration in 6 M guanidine HCl indicated that the molecular weights of these forms of ACTH were substantially lower; sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has often been found to overestimate the molecular weight of glycoproteins. A significant fraction of the high molecular weight ACTH in tumor cell extracts binds to columns of concanavalin A-agarose and can be eluted with 0.2 M alpha-methyl-D-mannopyranoside; porcine alpha(1-39) does not bind to concanavalin A-agarose. High molecular weight glycoprotein ACTH can be detected in extracts of mouse and bovine pituitary by using concavalin A affinity chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W1555044868,"The phosphorylation of different amino acids in distinct regions of f1 histone was studied in highly synchronized Chinese hamster cell populations (line CHO). The purified, 32P-labeled f1 histone was bisected into NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal fragments with N-bromosuccinimide. Tryptic phosphopeptides from these fragments were resolved using sequential high voltage electrophoretic steps on paper. No phosphorylation was observed in early G1-arrested cells. Interphase phosphorylation began in late G1 in the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule on serine. This event continued throughout S phase and persisted into mitosis. However, in mitosis additional phosphorylation was observed in the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule on threonine, and for the only time in the CHO cell cycle the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule was also phosphorylated on both serine and threonine. The peptide studies thus predicted that a minimum of four sites (two serine and two threonine) were phosphorylated in the f1 histone of mitotic CHO cells. This was confirmed using electrophoresis in long polyacrylamide gels."

https://openalex.org/W1595406949,"The ultraviolet spectrum of a protein activator of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and adenylate cyclase purified to homogeneity from bovine brain displayed absorption peaks at 252, 259, 265, 269, and 277 nm. The activator contained no phosphate and did not serve as a substrate for cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate- or cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinases. The activator binds Ca2+, and the active form appears to be a Ca2+ activator complex (Lin, Y.M., Liu, Y.P., and Cheung, W.Y. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4943-4954). Optical rotatory dispersion measurement showed that the Ca2+-free activator exhibited a reduced mean residue rotation ([m']231) of -5700, corresponding to 39% of helical content. In the presence of Ca2+, the [m']231 was increased to -7500, corresponding to 57% of helical content. The Ca2+ -induced conformational change was corroborated by a chemical method. In the presence of Ca2+, the activator was more resistant to trypsin inactivation, presumably because proteins with more helical structures are more resistant to tryptic attack. The activator is rich in aspartate and glutamate. Chemical block of some of the carboxyl groups with glycine ethyl ester or methoxyamine diminished the [m']231 of the activator and its activity, suggesting that blockade of some of the carboxyl groups in the activator unfolded the molecule, leading to a loss of activity. We conclude that Ca2+, which confers more helical structure to the activator, converts the inactive, less helical structure to the active, more helical structure, and that chemical modification of the activator leading to unfolding of the molecule abolishes its biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W126919355,"Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 defective in CDP-diglyceride:L-serine phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylserine synthetase) can be isolated by a rapid autoradiographic screening assay described previously (Raetz, C. R. H. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 2274-2278). Four organisms of this kind have now been characterized. The gene (designated pss) which is altered in these mutants is closely linked to the nadB locus near minute 49 on the E. coli chromosome. Strains carrying the pss-8 mutation do not grow at elevated temperatures and have low levels of an altered synthetase in cell extracts. An analysis of several hundred transductants and temperature-resistant revertants reveals that the pss-8 mutation is responsible both for the enzyme defect and for the phenotype. When a pss-8 mutant is shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, the cells stop dividing and form long filaments. After 3 hours at 44 degrees the level of phosphatidylethanolamine drops from 66 to 32% (percentage of the total lipid phosphorus), while the combined levels of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin rise from 34 to 68%."

https://openalex.org/W1632247257,"Previous studies have shown that cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic defects in lysosomal acid lipase (i. e. the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease) are defective in their ability to hydrolyze the cholesteryl esters contained in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL). As a result, these mutant cells show a reduced responsiveness to the regulatory actions of LDL, as evidenced by a decreased LDL-mediated suppression of the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and by a decreased LDL-mediated activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. In the current studies, the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells were grown in the same Petri dish with mutant fibroblasts derived from a patient with the homozygous form of Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Whereas pure monolayers of either the Familial Hypercholesterolemia cells (lacking cell surface LDL receptors) or the acid lipase-deficient cells (lacking cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity) responded poorly to LDL, the mixed monolayers developed lipoprotein responsiveness as measured by an enhancement of both LDL-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation. This effect was shown to result from the release of the lysosomal acid lipase from the Familial Hypercholesterolemia homozygote cells into the culture medium and its subsequent uptake by the acid lipase-deficient cells. The acquisition of this acid lipase activity enhanced the ability of the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells to respond to the lipoprotein by suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. These data emphasize the importance of the lysosomal acid lipase in the cellular metabolism of LDL cholesteryl esters and, in addition, demonstrate that delivery of this enzyme to genetically deficient cells can enhance the regulatory response to the lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1664359276,"Pure phospholipase A/sub 2/ from Crotalus atrox is able to hydrolyze all the phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine of human serum low density lipoprotein (LDL/sub 2/). In accord with the substrate specificity of the enzyme, sphingomyelin, other minor lipids and proteins are not hydrolyzed. The enzyme-modified particles remain water-soluble and, upon reisolation, contain all of the lysophospholipids and free fatty acids produced during the reaction. By electron microscopic, circular dichroic, analytical ultracentrifugal, immunologic, and small angle x-ray scattering techniques, the enzyme-modified particles exhibit only modest changes when compared with native LDL/sub 2/. Accumulation of negative charges on the lipoprotein during hydrolysis results in the repression of ionization of the free fatty acid products. This electrostatic effect can be analyzed in terms of the Linderstrom-Lang model which yields an equivalent spherical radius of approximately 100 A for the particles. These results suggest that phospholipase A/sub 2/-hydrolyzable phospholipids are located at the surface of the LDL/sub 2/ particle and are in a fluid state. Hydrolysis by phospholipase A/sub 2/ causes no significant changes in the basic structural features of the particle even after the partial loss of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids to albumin.

https://openalex.org/W1498551439,"Changes in several parameters involved in the control of metabolism were correlated with changes in glucose utilization in rat brain slices incubated under conditions which reduced glucose oxidation by 40 to 70%. The parameters included: the concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, and the adenylate energy charge; the cytoplasmic oxidation-reduction state ([NAD+]/[NADH]), determined from the [pyruvate]/[lactate] equilibrium; the mitochondrial oxidation-reduction state, determined from the [NH4+] ]2-oxoglutarate]/[glutamate] Equilibrium; the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial oxidation-reduction potentials (in volts), calculated from the respective [NAD+]/ [NADH] ratios using the Nernst equation; and the difference between the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] potentials. The conversion of [3, 4-14C] glucose to 14CO2 and of [U-14C] glucose to acetylcholine and to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids by the brain slices were also determined. The values obtained by subtracting the mitochondrial from the cytoplasmic [NAD+1/[NADH] potentials correlated more closely with glucose utilization than did other parameters, under the conditions studied.

https://openalex.org/W2183435375,"Reuber H35 cells were pulse-labeled with radioactive leucine and the influence of hormones, serum, and amino acids on protein degradation was investigated during a subsequent chase period. Radioactive, immunoprecipitable phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) had a half-life of 5 to 6 hours which was not influenced by either N6, O2-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, dexamethasone, or insulin. The rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase degradation was the same under steady state conditions as during the approach to a new steady state following hormonal induction or deinduction of the enzyme. Therefore, hormonal regulation of enzyme activity in vivo is the result of changes in the rate of enzyme synthesis. The rate of proteolysis for total cell proteins was increased under nutritional step-down conditions produced by the removal of serum or amino acids, or both, from the medium. This effect was completely prevented by insulin. Cycloheximide and puromycin, but not actinomycin D or cordycepin, inhibited protein degradation under step-down conditions but did not further decrease the basal rate of proteolysis measured in the presence of either insulin or serum plus amino acids. There was a good correlation between changes in proteolysis produced by serum and amino acids and changes in the degradation rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Also, inhibition of proteolysis with cycloheximide and puromycin was accompanied by a decrease in the degradation rate for enzyme antigen. It is suggested that nutritional step-down leads either to the synthesis or activation of a proteolytic system."
https://openalex.org/W1505074673,"The regulatory properties of the NAD-dependent malic enzyme from the mitochondria of Ascaris suum have been studied. The malate saturation curve exhibits sigmoidicity and the degree of this sigmoidicity increases as the pH is increased. Fumarate was the only compound tested that stimulated the enzyme activity, whereas oxalacetate was the most powerful inhibitor. Activation by low levels of fumarate was found to be competitive with malate. It is proposed that this stimulation has physiological significance in controlling the dismutation reaction in the parasite. The branched-chain volatile fatty acid excretion products, tiglate, 2-methylbutanoate, and 2-methylpentanoate, inhibited the enzyme activity and this inhibition was competitive with malate. The Ki values for these compounds are in the physiological range of their concentrations; therefore, it is suggested that they may aid in controlling the malic enzyme activity in vivo. Oxalacetate inhibition of malic enzyme activity was competitive with malate, and the Ki values decreased with an increase in pH. Two alternatives are proposed which could account for the lack of oxalacetate decarboxylation by the ascarid malic enzyme."

These include 2-fold rotational symmetry about the cleavage sites, which may approximately place the p5A molecule on the RNase M5 surface, and translational (positional) symmetry, which may precisely orient substrate phosphodiester bonds with respect to catalytic amino acids. Certain features of the 3' -terminal, precursor-specific portion of p5A possibly are involved in the termination of DNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1678375204,"Only 5 to 10% of the apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) of intact high density lipoprotein (HDL) is detectable by radioimmunoassay. In addition, when isolated ApoA-I is recombined with lipids in vitro, its immunologic reactivity is decreased by 30 to 95%. Thus, ApoA-I is less reactive immunologically in the presence of lipids. Our aim was to ascertain whether the COOH- or NH2-terminal regions of ApoA-I were equally reactive in intact HDL2. CNBr fragments of ApoA-I were produced by the method of Baker et al. (Baker, H.N., Jackson, R.L., and Gotto, A.M. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 3866-3871) and iodinated with lactoperoxidase. Double-antibody radioimmunoassays were set up using anti ApoA-I antisera and 125I-CNBr I (COOH-terminal region) or 125I-CNBr II (NH2-terminal). Both labels were bound by the antisera. Affinity columns were prepared by binding CNBr I or CNBr II to Sepharose 4B. Antibodies specific against CNBr I or CNBr II were isolated by means of these columns, suggesting that ApoA-I had at least two antigenic sites. In other assays using labeled fragments and anti ApoA-I antisera, 125I-CNBr I was displaced by CNBr I, ApoA-I , and HDL2 but not CNBr II. Conversely, 125I-CNBr II was displaced by CNBr II, ApoA-I, and HDL2 but not by CNBr I. Thus the assays were region-specific. The reactivities of isolated ApoA-I and the ApoA-I in intact HDL2-ApoA-I) were compared in these assays. On a molar basis, HDL2-ApoA-I was consistently more reactive (2- to 5-fold) in the 125I-CNBr I than in the 125I-CNBr II assays. The findings suggest (a) that the two terminal regions of ApoA-I are immunologically distinct, (b) that the two regions can be assayed independently of each other in intact HDL2, and (c) that the COOH-terminal region is more reactive immunologically than is the NH2-terminal. The results are compatible with a more exposed position for the COOH-terminal region on the surface of HDL2."
https://openalex.org/W1608195605,"The use of polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer sheets to follow the phosphorylation of histone and decomposition of ATP catalyzed by an adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-stimulated protein kinase, protein kinase I, has made possible a more detailed analysis of the time course of these reactions than has been achieved previously be observing only recovered phosphorylated protein. When [gamma-32P] ATP was employed, significant error was introduced by the presence of 32Pi at the solvent front on these sheets, and this limited the accuracy of the available information. However, the analysis of assays performed with [U-14C] ATP was straightforward and appeared to have an accuracy comparable to that of the present standard assay. This appears to be the first use of [U-14C] ATP to assay protein kinases. Our physical characterization of protein kinase I showed it to be a homogeneous protein species by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation. Kinetic studies with protein kinase I indicated the absence of histone phosphatase and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity. Furthermore, the ATPase activity seen is believed to be intimately associated with the protein kinase action, particularly in view of the observed dependence of the rate of Pi production on the presence of cyclic AMP. The kinetic data for the phosphorylation of histone catalyzed by protein kinase I under full stimulation by cyclic AMP are consistent with a double displacement mechanism."

Formation of the enzyme-substrate quaternary complex is necessary prior to release of products.

https://openalex.org/W1991376330,"BIOCHEMICAL modifications in cardiac hyptertrophy, secondary to high blood pressure, in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, include reduced receptor reactivities to isoproterenol1,2 and glucagon3, and lower contents of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP due to aberrations in adenylate and guanylate cyclases or phosphodiesterases, or both. Also possibly affected are cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-PK) and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (G-PK), enzymes that presumably mediate the effects of the respective cyclic nucleotide in vivo. An accurate assay for G-PK from mammalian tissues is possible in the presence of stimulatory modulator (specifically stimulating G-PK), either as a separated and purified form4 or as a mixture with inhibitory modulator (specifically inhibiting A-PK) in a form of crude protein kinase modulator5,6. We have examined possible involvements of cardiac G-PK, relative to A-PK, in chronic hypertension and possible effects of guanethidine, a hypotensive drug, on the two key enzymes. We found that the cardiac level of G-PK in spontaneously hypertensive rats was lower than that in normotensive rats, whereas that of A-PK was the same in both groups. Guanethidine depressed the former enzyme further without affecting the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2041294431,"The hamster ductus deferens cloned tumor cell line (DDT1) contains a complex steroid receptor protein that binds 3H-labeled 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone,. Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) chromatography of cytosol from these cells yields two major receptor peaks of activity. Identification of this steroid binding protein as a cytoplasmic receptor was confirmed by salt dissociation on sucrose gradients, stability of the hormone-receptor complex at 0 degrees C, and the retention patterns on phosphocellulose and DEAE cellulose. Multiple forms of the receptor exist in a single homogeneous cell type. The data support the theory that steroid hormones bind to a cytoplasmic protein receptor composed of dissimilar subunits as the initial step in steroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1529353936,"The crystal structure of Paracoccus (formerly Micrococcus) denitrificans cytochrome c550 has been solved by x-ray diffraction to a resolution of 2.45 A. In both amino acid sequence and molecular structure it is evolutionarily homologous with mitochondrial cytochrome c from eukaryotes and photosynthetic cytochrome c2 from purple non-sulfur bacteria. All of these cytochromes c have the same basic folding pattern, with surface insertions of extra amino acids in c550. Various strains of c2 have all, some, or none of the extra insertions observed in c550. The hydrophobic heme environment, position of aromatic rings, and structure and environment of the heme crevice, are virtually identical in cytochromes c55o, c, and c2. Radical changes observed at all regions on the molecular surface except the heme crevice argue for the importance of the crevice and the exposed edge of the heme in the transfer of electrons to and from the cytochrome molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1586416135,"The metabolism and binding of [1, 2, 6, 7-3H] testosterone in male and female rat brain has been studied in an attempt to find an explanation for the relative androgen unresponsiveness characterizing the female hypothalamo-pituitary axis involved in regulation of hepatic steroid metabolism. The most significant sex differences in the pattern of [3H] testosterone metabolites recovered from several brain regions (including pituitary, pineal gland, and hypothalamus) after intraperitoneal administration of [3H] testosterone were the predominance of testosterone and androstenedione in male brain compared to the quantitative importance of 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol, 5alpha-androstane-3beta, 17beta-diol, epitestosterone, and dihydroepitestosterone in female brain. One possible explanation for the androgen unresponsiveness of female rats is, therefore, the faster metabolism of testosterone to inactive compounds in female brain. Experiments both in vivo and in vitro showed the presence of high affinity, low capacity binding sites for [3H] testosterone in male pituitary, pineal gland, and hypothalamus (Kd values in the region of 1 X 10(-10) to 1 X 10(-9) M and number of binding sites 1.0 to 1.4 X 10(-14) mol per mg of protein). The steroid - macromolecular complexes generally had a pI of 5.1, were excluded from Sephadex G-200, were heat-labile, and were sensitive to protease. Competition experiments indicated the following order of ligand affinities: testosterone is greater than 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and estradiol is greater than androstenedione is greater than corticosterone. No steroid-binding proteins of similar nature were found in pituitary, pineal gland, or hypothalamus from female rats. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the androgen unresponsiveness of female rats referred to above relates to the absence of receptor protein for androgens in female rat brain. In support of this hypothesis, 28-day-old female rats, which are known to be affected by androgens with regard to liver enzyme activities, were shown to contain receptor proteins for androgen in the brain. In conclusion, the relative androgen unresponsiveness of the female hypothalamo-pituitary axis is probably explained by the absence of receptor proteins for androgen in female hypothalamus and pituitary. The fast metabolism of testosterone in female rat brain also serves to decrease the availability of active androgen to potential receptor sites. It may be speculated that the presence of androgen receptors in male brain is the result of neonatal programming (imprinting) by testicular androgen."
https://openalex.org/W1501588489,"The mechanism by which p-chlorophenylalanine specifically reduces phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in rat liver in vivo and in Reuber H4 hepatoma cells in culture has been investigated. Chromatography on hydroxylapatite of liver extract from rats injected with p-chlorophenylalanine showed that the compound differentially affected the three normal phenylalanine hydroxylase isoenzymes (I, II, and III); isoenzymes II and III were completely absent after the treatment, but isoenzyme I was only reduced in quantity compared with normal adult rats. Normal Reuber H4 cells only possess isoenzyme I; treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine yielded a reduced level of enzyme activity which appeared to be noraml isoenzyme I by both chromatographic and kinetic criteria. There is evidence, based on immunochemical techniques, that cultures grown in the presence of p-chlorophenylalanine have significantly reduced levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase antigen, and that p-chlorophenylalanine inactivates phenylalanine hydroxylase at or near the time of enzyme synthesis. The bulk of enzyme synthesized prior to the addition of the compound appears unaffected by it. There is no indication that protein synthesis itself is affected by p-chlorophenylalanine. In addition, p-chlorophenylacetate was found to inactivate phenylalanine hydroxylase in an apparently identical manner with p-chlorophenylalanine, which almost certainly eliminates from consideration any mechanism of inactivation specifically requiring an amino acid. Finally, effects of cycloheximide and chlorophenylalanine were compared. Taken together, the data lead to two possible models for the inactivation of the enzyme. The model most consistent with all data requires (predicts) the existence of a proenzyme form of phenylalanine hydroxylase which can be specifically inactivated by p-chlorophenylalanine."

They are flavin enzymes with 1 mol of FAD/mol of protein. Asparagusate dehydrogenases I and II and lipoyl dehydrogenase have s20,w of 6.22 S, 6.39 S, and 5.91 S, respectively, and molecular weights of 111,000, 110,000, and 95,000 (sedimentation equilibrium) or 112,000, 112,000, and 92,000 (gel filtration). They are slightly acidic proteins with isoelectric points of 6.75, 5.75, and 6.80. Both asparagusate dehydrogenases catalyzed the reaction Asg(SH)2 + NAD+ equilibrium AsgS2 + NADH + H+ and exhibit lipoyl dehydrogenase and diaphorase activities. Lipoyl dehydrogenase is specific for lipoate and has no asparagusate dehydrogenase activity. NADP cannot replace NAD in any case. Optimum pH for substrate reduction of the three enzymes are near 5.9. Asparagusate dehydrogenases I and II have Km values of 21.5 mM and 20.0 mM for asparagusate and 3.0 mM and 3.3 mM for lipoate, respectively. Lipoyl dehydrogenase activity of asparagusate dehydrogenases is enhanced by NAD and surfactants such as lecithin and Tween 80, but asparagusate dehydrogenase activity is not enhanced. Asparagusate dehydrogenases are strongly inhibited by mercuric ion, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide. Amino acid composition of the three enzymes is presented and discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1489489990,"Abstract Limited treatment of Escherichia coli DNA ligase with trypsin results in rapid loss of DNA joining activity. However, the ability to react with DPN to form the covalent enzyme-AMP intermediate is unaffected. The cleaved enzyme is also unable to catalyze the formation of DNA-adenylate, the second covalent intermediate in the ligase-catalyzed reaction. These findings demonstrate that portions of the DNA ligase molecule that are required for phosphodiester bond formation are not required for at least one of the partial reactions catalyzed by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1539546071,"Human pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase is a polymorphic enzyme having two allelic gene products, UMPK 1 and UMPK 2, in several populations. A procedure is described for the partial purification of this enzyme from human red blood cells resulting in a 1500-fold purification of the enzyme for UMPK 1 and 583-fold for UMPK 2. The purified enzyme preparation catalyzed the phosphorylation of UMP, CMP, and dCMP, and used ATP as the preferred phosphate donor. The heavy metals, mercury, and copper, were found to be strong inhibitors of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase activity. EDTA was found to protect the enzyme from inactivation by the heavy metals, and 2-mercaptoethanol stabilized the enzyme during purification. UMPK 1 and UMPK 2 were found to have similar kinetic properties; however, UMPK 2 had a slower electrophoretic mobility and greater thermolability than UMPK 1."
https://openalex.org/W1563705083,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase in Reuber H4 hepatoma cell cultures can be rapidly inactivated by the addition of epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, in order of decreasing effectiveness, to the culture medium. The enzyme was 50% inactivated in 1 hour by 25 muM (R)-epinephrine or 45 muM (R)-norepinephrine in the medium. High concentrations of epinephrine caused a 70% inactivation in 15 min. Phenylalanine hydroxylase appears to be reversibly inactivated by epinephrine within the cells; since washing the compound off the cell cultures resulted in a rapid restoration of enzyme activity (40% in 1 hour), cycloheximide had little effect on the initial rate of recovery of enzyme activity and the same amount of phenylalanine hydroxylase antigen per cell was isolated from treated and normal cultures. Both (S)- and (R)-epinephrine inactivated the enzyme, and 0.1 mM desmethylimipramine, an inhibitor of amine transport, significantly decreased the effect of epinephrine on the hydroxylase activity. The possibility, suggested by the above results, that epinephrine might be directly inactivating phenylalanine hydroxylase within the cells was supported by the finding that purified rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase would be 50% inactivated by 1.5 muM epinephrine in 10 min."
