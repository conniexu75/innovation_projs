https://openalex.org/W2079300606,"To limit global warming to a rise of 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels, we cannot use all of our fossil fuel reserves; here an integrated assessment model shows that this temperature limit implies that we must leave unused a third of our oil reserves, half of our gas reserves and over 80 per cent of our coal reserves during the next 40 years, and indicates where these are geographically located. If global warming is to be limited in this century to the much-publicized 2 °C rise compared to pre-industrial levels, fossil fuel use and the associated release of greenhouse gases will need to be severely limited. This raises questions regarding the specific quantities and locations of oil, gas and coal that can be safely exploited. Christophe McGlade and Paul Ekins use an integrated assessment model to explore the implications of the 2 °C warming limit for different regions' fossil fuel production. They find that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain unused during the next 40 years in order to meet the 2 °C target and that the development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incompatible with efforts to limit climate change. Policy makers have generally agreed that the average global temperature rise caused by greenhouse gas emissions should not exceed 2 °C above the average global temperature of pre-industrial times1. It has been estimated that to have at least a 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 °C throughout the twenty-first century, the cumulative carbon emissions between 2011 and 2050 need to be limited to around 1,100 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2)2,3. However, the greenhouse gas emissions contained in present estimates of global fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this2,4, and so the unabated use of all current fossil fuel reserves is incompatible with a warming limit of 2 °C. Here we use a single integrated assessment model that contains estimates of the quantities, locations and nature of the world’s oil, gas and coal reserves and resources, and which is shown to be consistent with a wide variety of modelling approaches with different assumptions5, to explore the implications of this emissions limit for fossil fuel production in different regions. Our results suggest that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80 per cent of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 °C. We show that development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 °C. Our results show that policy makers’ instincts to exploit rapidly and completely their territorial fossil fuels are, in aggregate, inconsistent with their commitments to this temperature limit. Implementation of this policy commitment would also render unnecessary continued substantial expenditure on fossil fuel exploration, because any new discoveries could not lead to increased aggregate production."

Geula et al. now show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a messenger RNA (mRNA) modification present on transcripts of pluripotency factors, drives this transition. Methylation destabilized mRNA transcripts and limited their translation efficiency, which promoted the timely decay of naïve pluripotency. This m6A methylation was also critical for mammalian development. Science , this issue p. 1002"

Activity of mTORC1 is sensitive to the abundance of amino acids, but how the sensing of amino acids is coupled to the control of mTORC1 has been unclear. Wang et al. searched for predicted membrane proteins that interacted with regulators of mTORC1. They identified a protein currently known only as SLC38A9. Interaction of SLC38A9 with mTORC1 regulators was sensitive to the presence of amino acids. SLC38A9 has sequence similarity to amino acid transporters. Effects of modulation of SLC38A9 in cultured human cells indicate that it may be the sensor that connects the abundance of arginine and leucine to mTORC1 activity. Science , this issue p. 188"
https://openalex.org/W2157760261,"Getting specific about amino acid sensing The protein kinase complex mTORC1 regulates growth and metabolism, and its activity is controlled in response to the abundance of cellular amino acids. Jewell et al. report that control of mTORC1 in response to glutamine does not require the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) implicated in the sensing of other amino acids such as leucine (see the Perspective by Abraham). For sensing of glutamine, another GTPase, Arf1, was required. Distinct mechanisms thus appear to couple various amino acids to signaling by the mTORC1 complex.

https://openalex.org/W2039021127,"Yeasts, which have been a component of the human diet for at least 7,000 years, possess an elaborate cell wall α-mannan. The influence of yeast mannan on the ecology of the human microbiota is unknown. Here we show that yeast α-mannan is a viable food source for the Gram-negative bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a dominant member of the microbiota. Detailed biochemical analysis and targeted gene disruption studies support a model whereby limited cleavage of α-mannan on the surface generates large oligosaccharides that are subsequently depolymerized to mannose by the action of periplasmic enzymes. Co-culturing studies showed that metabolism of yeast mannan by B. thetaiotaomicron presents a 'selfish' model for the catabolism of this difficult to breakdown polysaccharide. Genomic comparison with B. thetaiotaomicron in conjunction with cell culture studies show that a cohort of highly successful members of the microbiota has evolved to consume sterically-restricted yeast glycans, an adaptation that may reflect the incorporation of eukaryotic microorganisms into the human diet."

Only recently did a reliable method emerge to make and study these compounds in the laboratory, and they didn't seem to react with water. Now, Chao et al. show that the simplest Criegee intermediate, CH 2 OO, does in fact react very rapidly with pairs of water molecules (see the Perspective by Okumura). Earlier studies may have missed this result because they were conducted at low pressure, where water dimers are scarce, or because they monitored downstream processes. The new rate measurements imply that reactivity with atmospheric water pairs is a major decay channel for Criegees. Science , this issue p. 751 ; see also p. 718"
https://openalex.org/W2071678249,"The hippocampal CA2 subregion has a different anatomical connectivity pattern within the entorhino-hippocampal circuit than either the CA1 or CA3 subregion. Yet major differences in the neuronal activity patterns of CA2 compared with the other CA subregions have not been reported. We show that standard spatial and temporal firing patterns of individual hippocampal principal neurons in behaving rats, such as place fields, theta modulation, and phase precession, are also present in CA2, but that the CA2 subregion differs substantially from the other CA subregions in its population coding. CA2 ensembles do not show a persistent code for space or for differences in context. Rather, CA2 activity patterns become progressively dissimilar over time periods of hours to days. The weak coding for a particular context is consistent with recent behavioral evidence that CA2 circuits preferentially support social, emotional, and temporal rather than spatial aspects of memory."
https://openalex.org/W2082019169,"Somatic mutations occur during brain development and are increasingly implicated as a cause of neurogenetic disease. However, the patterns in which somatic mutations distribute in the human brain are unknown. We used high-coverage whole-genome sequencing of single neurons from a normal individual to identify spontaneous somatic mutations as clonal marks to track cell lineages in human brain. Somatic mutation analyses in >30 locations throughout the nervous system identified multiple lineages and sublineages of cells marked by different LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition events and subsequent mutation of poly-A microsatellites within L1. One clone contained thousands of cells limited to the left middle frontal gyrus, whereas a second distinct clone contained millions of cells distributed over the entire left hemisphere. These patterns mirror known somatic mutation disorders of brain development and suggest that focally distributed mutations are also prevalent in normal brains. Single-cell analysis of somatic mutation enables tracing of cell lineage clones in human brain."
https://openalex.org/W1966612320,"Intracellular pathogens are responsible for much of the world-wide morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases. To colonize their hosts successfully, pathogens must sense their environment and regulate virulence gene expression appropriately. Accordingly, on entry into mammalian cells, the facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes remodels its transcriptional program by activating the master virulence regulator PrfA. Here we show that bacterial and host-derived glutathione are required to activate PrfA. In this study a genetic selection led to the identification of a bacterial mutant in glutathione synthase that exhibited reduced virulence gene expression and was attenuated 150-fold in mice. Genome sequencing of suppressor mutants that arose spontaneously in vivo revealed a single nucleotide change in prfA that locks the protein in the active conformation (PrfA*) and completely bypassed the requirement for glutathione during infection. Biochemical and genetic studies support a model in which glutathione-dependent PrfA activation is mediated by allosteric binding of glutathione to PrfA. Whereas glutathione and other low-molecular-weight thiols have important roles in redox homeostasis in all forms of life, here we demonstrate that glutathione represents a critical signalling molecule that activates the virulence of an intracellular pathogen."

Previous studies have shown that CaMKII and the RAS-ERK pathway are critical for several forms of synaptic plasticity including LTP. NMDA receptor-dependent calcium influx has been shown to regulate the RAS-ERK pathway and downstream events that result in AMPA receptor synaptic accumulation, spine enlargement, and synaptic strengthening during LTP. However, the cellular mechanisms whereby calcium influx and CaMKII control Ras activity remain elusive. Using live-imaging techniques, we have found that SynGAP is rapidly dispersed from spines upon LTP induction in hippocampal neurons, and this dispersion depends on phosphorylation of SynGAP by CaMKII. Moreover, the degree of acute dispersion predicts the maintenance of spine enlargement. Thus, the synaptic dispersion of SynGAP by CaMKII phosphorylation during LTP represents a key signaling component that transduces CaMKII activity to small G protein-mediated spine enlargement, AMPA receptor synaptic incorporation, and synaptic potentiation.

Long-term changes in the strength of synaptic transmission in the brain, and the subsequent formation of neuronal circuits, are thought to be critical for learning and memory, activity-dependent development, and other higher brain processes (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L.

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. The regulation of AMPAR number at synapses is thought to be a major determinant of synaptic strength and to mediate several forms of synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (Anggono and Huganir, 2012Anggono V.

The most well-studied form of synaptic plasticity in the brain is NMDA receptor-dependent LTP. This form of plasticity requires the activation of the NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), calcium influx and activation of CaM kinase II (CaMKII), and the subsequent recruitment of AMPARs to the synapse (Anggono and Huganir, 2012Anggono V.

Small G proteins such as Ras, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA are also essential modulators of synaptic strength and structure during NMDAR-dependent LTP (Qin et al., 2005Qin Y. Zhu Y. Baumgart J.P.

On the other hand, activation of Rac1/Cdc42, during LTP, is critical for regulating the enlargement of dendritic spines, small membranous protrusions from neuronal dendrites that house the excitatory postsynapse (Murakoshi et al., 2011Murakoshi H. Wang H. Yasuda R. Local, persistent activation of Rho GTPases during plasticity of single dendritic spines.Nature. 2011; 472: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).

Multiple imaging studies have demonstrated that shortly after LTP induction, CaMKII becomes activated (several seconds to 10 s after stimuli) and is followed by small G protein activation (approximately 1 min after stimuli) (Harvey et al., 2008Harvey C.D.

However, the cellular mechanisms that coordinate CaMKII and small G protein activation as well as the critical CaMKII substrates required for LTP remain unclear. SynGAP is a synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) that facilitates GTP hydrolysis to GDP and thereby negatively regulates Ras activity (Chen et al., 1998Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A.

Conversely, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are proteins that exchange GDP to GTP and thereby activate small G proteins. The activities of GAP and GEF proteins assure precise activation levels in neurons (Bos et al., 2007Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. GEFs and GAPs: critical elements in the control of small G proteins.Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) and have profound effects on synaptic strength and plasticity. SYNGAP1 knockout mice show deficits in NMDAR-dependent LTP in a Ras-ERK-dependent manner (Kim et al., 2003Kim J.H. Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Huganir R.L.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9721-9732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SynGAP regulates the baseline levels of Ras and Rac activity as well as the phosphorylation of Cofilin, a downstream target that regulates actin polymerization (Carlisle et al., 2008Carlisle H.J.

SynGAP also regulates synaptic strength and Erk activity levels (Rumbaugh et al., 2006Rumbaugh G. Adams J.P. Kim J.H. Huganir R.L. SynGAP regulates synaptic strength and mitogen-activated protein kinases in cultured neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 4344-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Heterozygote SYNGAP1 knockout mice have premature dendritic spine formation in vitro (Vazquez et al., 2004Vazquez L.E. Chen H.J. Sokolova I. Knuesel I. Kennedy M.B.

Moreover, de novo loss-of-function mutations in SYNGAP1 have been identified in patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Berryer et al., 2012Berryer M.H.

To examine the role of SynGAP in LTP, we investigated the dynamics of the subcellular localization of SynGAP in response to LTP induction. We demonstrated that (i) SynGAP is rapidly dispersed from spines during and after chemical LTP; (ii) this dispersion predicts the long-lasting changes in spine size, suggesting SynGAP inhibits stable LTP; (iii) phosphorylation of SynGAP at Ser1108/1138 by CaMKII plays a crucial role in this dispersion; and (iv) this dispersion triggers Ras activation that regulates downstream cellular processes, including AMPAR insertion, spine enlargement, and increased synaptic strength, demonstrating that SynGAP is a critical CaMKII substrate for the expression of LTP. To investigate the mechanism underlying SynGAP activity during LTP, we studied the dynamics of the subcellular localization of SynGAP before and after LTP induction using live imaging techniques. We expressed GFP-tagged SynGAP and mCherry (as a morphology marker) in cultured hippocampal neurons and induced LTP chemically using a standard protocol that selectively activates synaptic NMDARs (chemLTP) (Liao et al., 2001Liao D.

In this method, the magnesium in the media was withdrawn in conjunction with glycine perfusion. With spontaneous glutamate release from axonal terminals, glycine strongly and specifically stimulates synaptic NMDA receptors (Liao et al., 2001Liao D. Scannevin R.H. Huganir R.

This results in recruitment of AMPARs to synapses, spine enlargement, and synaptic potentiation. In our experiments, we observed chemLTP induced a rapid and sustained increase in dendritic spine size that lasted for at least 40 min (Figures 1A and 1B ). Under resting conditions, GFP-SynGAP showed a clear punctate localization in dendritic spine heads consistent with previous studies on SynGAP’s enrichment in dendritic spines (Chen et al., 1998Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B.

SynGAP: a synaptic RasGAP that associates with the PSD-95/SAP90 protein family.Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, upon chemLTP induction, SynGAP was rapidly dispersed from spines (Figure 1A; Movie S1 available online). This dispersion occurred within minutes after chemLTP induction and lasted for at least 1 hr. We quantified the total SynGAP content in spines (as a measure of total signal from green channel) as well as spine volume (as a measure of total signal from red channel) during chemLTP (Figures 1B and S1A). Interestingly, SynGAP concentration in spines was rapidly decreased upon chemLTP while SynGAP concentration in dendritic shafts was increased but did not surpass the initial concentration in spines, suggesting that this dispersion is a passive diffusion of SynGAP upon chemLTP (Figure S1B). Biochemical isolation of postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions from these cultures also revealed the rapid dispersion of SynGAP from the PSD (Figure 1C). In Figure 1D, we plotted the correlation between SynGAP dispersion and spine enlargement 1 hr after LTP induction. The degree of dispersion of SynGAP was significantly correlated with the degree of spine enlargement (R2 = 0.73, correlation coefficient; p < 0.001), suggesting that SynGAP dispersion may be important for LTP-induced changes in spine size. Rapid SynGAP dispersion from spines was also observed in glutamate-uncaging-induced single spine LTP (ssLTP) (Figure S1C). In this protocol, caged glutamate was photolysed repeatedly (0.5 Hz × 30 times) on the spine head to induce LTP in specific spines. The kinetics of spine dispersion and recovery of SynGAP was quite similar to those during chemLTP (Figures 1B and S1D). Notably, this rapid dispersion did not occur during chemLTD (Figure S1E). Using electron microscopy, it was reported that chemLTD stimulation reduced SynGAP levels in the PSD core in a CaMKII-dependent manner (Yang et al., 2013Yang Y. Tao-Cheng J.H. Bayer K.U. Reese T.S.

Camkii-mediated phosphorylation regulates distributions of Syngap-α1 and -α2 at the postsynaptic density.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e71795Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2011Yang Y.

SynGAP moves out of the core of the postsynaptic density upon depolarization.Neuroscience. 2011; 192: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, this microrelocalization may not be observed at the resolution of light microscopy. We confirmed endogenous SynGAP was also dispersed from spines upon chemLTP stimulation (Figures S2A and S2B). To begin to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying SynGAP dispersion, we examined the pharmacology of this process (Figures 1E and 1F). The NMDA receptor antagonist (APV), CaM inhibitor (W7), and CaMKII inhibitor (KN62) each completely blocked chemLTP-induced SynGAP dispersion indicating that NMDAR, CaM, and CaMKII function are critical for processes upstream of SynGAP spine dispersion. As reported previously, the CaMKII inhibitor does not block spine enlargement in the acute phase (10 min) but blocked sustained spine enlargement (60 min) (Matsuzaki et al., 2001Matsuzaki M. Ellis-Davies G.C. Nemoto T. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Dendritic spine geometry is critical for AMPA receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Nat.

Local, persistent activation of Rho GTPases during plasticity of single dendritic spines.Nature. 2011; 472: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that inhibition of small G proteins such as Ras and Rac by expressing dominant-negative forms of Ras and Rac, or inhibition of the Rac downstream target protein ROCK, blocked spine enlargement in the sustained phase without affecting SynGAP dispersion (Figures 1E and 1F). These data suggest that SynGAP dispersion is upstream of small G protein activation. Inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin A (LatA) also blocked both the acute and sustained phases of spine enlargement at a high concentration (100 nM) or only the sustained phase at a lower concentration (20 nM). However, both of these treatments failed to block SynGAP spine dispersion (Figures 1E and 1F). Together, these results indicate that chemLTP-induced dispersion of SynGAP from dendritic spines is downstream of NMDAR and CaMKII activation and upstream of small G protein activation and actin polymerization. Interestingly, we noticed three classes of spines regarding the degree of spine enlargement and dispersion of SynGAP following LTP induction (Figures 2A and 2B ). Most spines showed stable responses (57.6% ± 2.9% of total population) and increased in size and dispersed SynGAP in the acute and sustained phase of the response (60 min). Some spines showed no response (27.8% ± 3.4% of total population), while the remaining population (14.6% ± 2.0% of total population) had a transient response in which spines enlarged after LTP induction in the acute phase, but this growth was not sustained. Interestingly, all of the “transient” spines failed to disperse SynGAP in response to LTP induction. This suggests that dispersion of SynGAP in the acute phase predicts the long-term stability of the increased spine size. When we treated neurons with a CaMKII inhibitor, SynGAP dispersion was almost completely blocked during both acute and sustained phases (Figures 3A and 3B ). However, as previously reported, CaMKII inhibition did not block acute increases in spine size but only blocked long lasting spine enlargement during the sustained phase (Figures 3A and 3B) (Lee et al., 2009Lee S.J. Escobedo-Lozoya Y. Szatmari E.M. Yasuda R. Activation of CaMKII in single dendritic spines during long-term potentiation.Nature. 2009; 458: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Thus, CaMKII inhibition converted “stable” spines to “transient” spines (Figure 3C). These results suggest that SynGAP dispersion is required for spine enlargement during the sustained phase and that the presence of SynGAP in spines inhibits long lasting changes in spine structure. Two CaMKII phosphorylation sites (Ser780 and Ser1138; numbering according to NP_851606) have been discovered on SynGAP (Carlisle et al., 2008Carlisle H.J. Manzerra P. Marcora E. Kennedy M.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17980-17988Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We identified an additional well-conserved CaMKII consensus site (S1108) (Figure S3A) that is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo. Among these three sites, phospho-mimetic mutants of S1108 and S1138 but not S780 affected SynGAP localization and were less enriched in spines (Figure S3B). Thus, we chose the S1108 and S1138 sites for further analysis. We generated double phospho-deficient (2SA; S1108/1138A) and phospho-mimetic (2SD; S1108/1138D) mutants of SynGAP and investigated the synaptic localization of these constructs in the basal or potentiated state (Figures 4A and 4B). The double phospho-mimetic and the single phospho-mimetic mutants of SynGAP were less enriched at synapses, suggesting both phosphorylation events can regulate synaptic dispersion of SynGAP. Moreover, there was no additional reduction in synaptic content of the mutant SynGAP 2SD upon chemLTP (Figures 4A and 4B). In contrast, the phospho-deficient mutant of SynGAP was enriched in spines to the same degree as wild-type (WT) under basal conditions. Upon LTP induction there was no dispersion of SynGAP 2SA (Figures 4A and 4B), suggesting that dynamic changes in SynGAP phosphorylation are required for dispersion of SynGAP. Collectively, these findings indicate that dynamic modulation of these two phosphorylation sites plays a major role in SynGAP synaptic localization. We raised phospho-specific antibodies against S1108 and S1138 in SynGAP in order to examine the changes in phosphorylation upon LTP induction. CaMKII inhibition or lambda-phosphatase treatment abolished antibody recognition demonstrating the specificity of our phospho-antibodies (Figure S3C). Indeed, phosphorylation of each of these sites was increased upon LTP, and these effects were blocked by the CaMKII inhibitor KN62 (Figures 4C and S4A).

Diffusion properties of portions of these tracts adjacent to face- and place-selective regions of ventral temporal cortex correlate with behavioral performance for face or place processing, respectively. Strikingly, adults with developmental prosopagnosia (face blindness) express an atypical structure-behavior relationship near face-selective cortex, suggesting that white-matter atypicalities in this region may have behavioral consequences.

https://openalex.org/W2043956016,"Exosomes, cell-derived vesicles of endosomal origin, are continuously released in the extracellular environment and play a key role in intercellular crosstalk. In this study, we have investigated whether transfer of integrins through exosomes between prostate cancer (PrCa) cells occurs and whether transferred integrins promote cell adhesion and migration. Among others, we have focused on the αvβ6 integrin, which is not detectable in normal human prostate but is highly expressed in human primary PrCa as well as murine PrCa in Ptenpc−/− mice. After confirming the fidelity of the exosome preparations by electron microscopy, density gradient, and immunoblotting, we determined that the αvβ6 integrin is actively packaged into exosomes isolated from PC3 and RWPE PrCa cell lines. We also demonstrate that αvβ6 is efficiently transferred via exosomes from a donor cell to an αvβ6-negative recipient cell and localizes to the cell surface. De novo αvβ6 expression in an αvβ6-negative recipient cell is not a result of a change in mRNA levels but is a consequence of exosome-mediated transfer of this integrin between different PrCa cells. Recipient cells incubated with exosomes containing αvβ6 migrate on an αvβ6 specific substrate, latency-associated peptide-TGFβ, to a greater extent than cells treated with exosomes in which αvβ6 is stably or transiently down-regulated by shRNA or siRNA, respectively. Overall, this study shows that exosomes from PrCa cells may contribute to a horizontal propagation of integrin-associated phenotypes, which would promote cell migration, and consequently, metastasis in a paracrine fashion."

Although their catalytic mechanism is well characterized and the catalytic dioxygenase domain is highly conserved, the function of the regulatory regions (the N terminus and the low-complexity insert between the two parts of the dioxygenase domains) is only poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that TET proteins are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications that mostly occur at these regulatory regions. We mapped TET modification sites at amino acid resolution and show for the first time that TET1, TET2, and TET3 are highly phosphorylated. The O-linked GlcNAc transferase, which we identified as a strong interactor with all three TET proteins, catalyzes the addition of a GlcNAc group to serine and threonine residues of TET proteins and thereby decreases both the number of phosphorylation sites and site occupancy. Interestingly, the different TET proteins display unique post-translational modification patterns, and some modifications occur in distinct combinations. In summary, our results provide a novel potential mechanism for TET protein regulation based on a dynamic interplay of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation at the N terminus and the low-complexity insert region. Our data suggest strong cross-talk between the modification sites that could allow rapid adaption of TET protein localization, activity, or targeting due to changing environmental conditions as well as in response to external stimuli."

New therapeutic targets are emerging; in particular, dsRNA receptors Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and cytosolic helicases expressed by cancer cells, once activated, exert a pro-apoptotic effect in different tumors. We previously demonstrated that the synthetic analog of dsRNA poly(I:C) induces apoptosis in the androgen-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP in a TLR3-dependent fashion, whereas only a weak apoptotic effect is observed in the more aggressive and androgen-independent PCa cells PC3 and DU145. In this paper, we characterize the receptors and the signaling pathways involved in the remarkable apoptosis induced by poly(I:C) transfected by Lipofectamine (in-poly(I:C)) compared with the 12-fold higher free poly(I:C) concentration in PC3 and DU145 cells. By using genetic inhibition of different poly(I:C) receptors, we demonstrate the crucial role of TLR3 and Src in in-poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we show that the increased in-poly(I:C) apoptotic efficacy is due to a higher binding of endosomal TLR3.

We show here that protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is a specific co-activator of normal and mutant AR and that the interaction of PRMT6 with AR is significantly enhanced in the AR mutant. AR and PRMT6 interaction occurs through the PRMT6 steroid receptor interaction motif, LXXLL, and the AR activating function 2 surface. AR transactivation requires PRMT6 catalytic activity and involves methylation of arginine residues at Akt consensus site motifs, which is mutually exclusive with serine phosphorylation by Akt. The enhanced interaction of PRMT6 and mutant AR leads to neurodegeneration in cell and fly models of SBMA.

https://openalex.org/W2059834412,"The evolutionary origins of speech remain obscure. Recently, it was proposed that speech derived from monkey facial signals which exhibit a speech-like rhythm of ∼5 open-close lip cycles per second. In monkeys, these signals may also be vocalized, offering a plausible evolutionary stepping stone towards speech. Three essential predictions remain, however, to be tested to assess this hypothesis' validity; (i) Great apes, our closest relatives, should likewise produce 5Hz-rhythm signals, (ii) speech-like rhythm should involve calls articulatorily similar to consonants and vowels given that speech rhythm is the direct product of stringing together these two basic elements, and (iii) speech-like rhythm should be experience-based. Via cinematic analyses we demonstrate that an ex-entertainment orangutan produces two calls at a speech-like rhythm, coined ""clicks"" and ""faux-speech."" Like voiceless consonants, clicks required no vocal fold action, but did involve independent manoeuvring over lips and tongue. In parallel to vowels, faux-speech showed harmonic and formant modulations, implying vocal fold and supralaryngeal action. This rhythm was several times faster than orangutan chewing rates, as observed in monkeys and humans. Critically, this rhythm was seven-fold faster, and contextually distinct, than any other known rhythmic calls described to date in the largest database of the orangutan repertoire ever assembled. The first two predictions advanced by this study are validated and, based on parsimony and exclusion of potential alternative explanations, initial support is given to the third prediction. Irrespectively of the putative origins of these calls and underlying mechanisms, our findings demonstrate irrevocably that great apes are not respiratorily, articulatorilly, or neurologically constrained for the production of consonant- and vowel-like calls at speech rhythm. Orangutan clicks and faux-speech confirm the importance of rhythmic speech antecedents within the primate lineage, and highlight potential articulatory homologies between great ape calls and human consonants and vowels."

IgG4 Abs are dynamic molecules able to undergo a process known as Fab arm exchange (FAE).

IgG4 FAE is suggested to be an important biological mechanism that provides the basis for the anti-inflammatory activity attributed to IgG4 Abs. To date, the mechanism of FAE is not entirely understood and studies measuring FAE in ex vivo matrices have been hampered by the presence and abundance of endogenous IgG4 wild-type (WT) Abs.

A novel method for quantifying FAE using a single MSD immunoassay is also reported and confirms previous findings that, dependent on the redox conditions, the S228P mutation can prevent IgG4 FAE to undetectable levels both in vitro and in vivo. Together, the findings and novel methodologies will allow researchers to monitor and quantify FAE of their own IgG4 molecules in physiologically relevant matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2020692325,"The distinct distribution and abundance of C-to-U and U-to-C RNA editing among land plants suggest that these two processes originated and evolve independently, but the paucity of information from several key lineages limits our understanding of their evolution. To examine the evolutionary diversity of RNA editing among ferns, we sequenced the plastid transcriptomes from two early diverging species, Ophioglossum californicum and Psilotum nudum. Using a relaxed automated approach to minimize false negatives combined with manual inspection to eliminate false positives, we identified 297 C-to-U and three U-to-C edit sites in the O. californicum plastid transcriptome but only 27 C-to-U and no U-to-C edit sites in the P. nudum plastid transcriptome. A broader comparison of editing content with the leptosporangiate fern Adiantum capillus-veneris and the hornwort Anthoceros formosae uncovered large variance in the abundance of plastid editing, indicating that the frequency and type of RNA editing is highly labile in ferns. Edit sites that increase protein conservation among species are more abundant and more efficiently edited than silent and non-conservative sites, suggesting that selection maintains functionally important editing. The absence of U-to-C editing from P. nudum plastid transcripts and other vascular plants demonstrates that U-to-C editing loss is a recurrent phenomenon in vascular plant evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2084664294,"Roughly half of the heavy elements (atomic mass greater than that of iron) are believed to be synthesized in the late evolutionary stages of stars with masses between 0.8 and 8 solar masses. Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly iron) capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process) heavier elements that are subsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources, activated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: (13)C and (22)Ne, each releasing one neutron per α-particle ((4)He) captured. To explain the measured stellar abundances, stellar evolution models invoking the (13)C neutron source (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are favoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting nucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material to the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred million kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of (22)Ne (ref. 1). Here we report a determination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant stars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar evolution models. The derived temperature supports (13)C as the s-process neutron source. The radioactive pair (93)Zr-(93)Nb used to estimate the s-process temperature also provides, together with the pair (99)Tc-(99)Ru, chronometric information on the time elapsed since the start of the s-process, which we determine to be one million to three million years."
https://openalex.org/W1974822005,"Human T cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) replication and spread are controlled by different viral and cellular factors. Although several anti-HIV cellular microRNAs have been described, such a regulation for HTLV-1 has not been reported. In this study, we found that miR-28-3p inhibits HTLV-1 virus expression and its replication by targeting a specific site within the genomic gag/pol viral mRNA. Because miR-28-3p is highly expressed in resting T cells, which are resistant to HTLV-1 infection, we investigated a potential protective role of miR-28-3p against de novo HTLV-1 infection. To this end, we developed a new sensitive and quantitative assay on the basis of the detection of products of reverse transcription. We demonstrate that miR-28-3p does not prevent virus receptor interaction or virus entry but, instead, induces a post-entry block at the reverse transcription level. In addition, we found that HTLV-1, subtype 1A isolates corresponding to the Japanese strain ATK-1 present a natural, single-nucleotide polymorphism within the miR-28-3p target site. As a result of this polymorphism, the ATK-1 virus sequence was not inhibited by miR-28.

https://openalex.org/W1965261854,"Epigenetic mechanisms are important in different neurological disorders, and one such mechanism is histone acetylation. The multivalent chromatin regulator BRPF1 (bromodomain- and plant homeodomain-linked (PHD) zinc finger-containing protein 1) recognizes different epigenetic marks and activates three histone acetyltransferases, so it is both a reader and a co-writer of the epigenetic language. The three histone acetyltransferases are MOZ, MORF, and HBO1, which are also known as lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A), KAT6B, and KAT7, respectively. The MORF gene is mutated in four neurodevelopmental disorders sharing the characteristic of intellectual disability and frequently displaying callosal agenesis. Here, we report that forebrain-specific inactivation of the mouse Brpf1 gene caused early postnatal lethality, neocortical abnormalities, and partial callosal agenesis. With respect to the control, the mutant forebrain contained fewer Tbr2-positive intermediate neuronal progenitors and displayed aberrant neurogenesis. Molecularly, Brpf1 loss led to decreased transcription of multiple genes, such as Robo3 and Otx1, important for neocortical development. Surprisingly, elevated expression of different Hox genes and various other transcription factors, such as Lhx4, Foxa1, Tbx5, and Twist1, was also observed. These results thus identify an important role of Brpf1 in regulating forebrain development and suggest that it acts as both an activator and a silencer of gene expression in vivo.

In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA is elegantly packaged with histones and other proteins into chromatin, which in turn controls gene activities according to spatiotemporal signaling cues (1Berger S.L.

Such control is altered in human diseases and provides pathological epigenetic mechanisms. These mechanisms were initially recognized in leukemia and other cancers (4Dawson M.A. Kouzarides T.

From neural development to cognition: unexpected roles for chromatin.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For epigenetic regulation, chromatin is subject to various modifications, one of which is histone acetylation. The acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein and its paralog p300 are altered in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a genetic disease with the characteristic of intellectual disability and predisposition to brain and other tumors (10Petrij F.

These findings support the importance of histone acetylation modifiers in neurological diseases. MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein) is an acetyltransferase paralogous to MORF (MOZ-related factor) (16Yang X.J. Ullah M.

Psychiatric illness is a late-occurring feature of this syndrome, and some patients are predisposed to schizophrenia. The MORF gene is mutated in four neurodevelopmental disorders as follows: Noonan syndrome-like disorder (21Kraft M. Cirstea I.C. Voss A.K. Thomas T. Goehring I. Sheikh B.N. Gordon L. Scott H.

Mutat. 2012; 33: 1520-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Related to the intellectual disability, mice with low Morf expression exhibit an abnormal cerebral cortex (27Thomas T. Voss A.K. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Querkopf, a MYST family histone acetyltransferase, is required for normal cerebral cortex development.Development. 2000; 127: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No callosal abnormalities, however, have been reported for the mutant mice. BRPF1 interacts with MOZ and MORF to stimulate their acetyltransferase activity, restrict the substrate specificity, and regulate related transcription (28Doyon Y. Cayrou C. Ullah M. Landry A.J.

Biol. 2008; 28: 6828-6843Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that BRPF1 may be an important modifier of neurological disorders resulting from aberrant MOZ and MORF. Moreover, BRPF1 interacts with and activates HBO1 (histone acetyltransferase bound to ORC1), which possesses a catalytic domain highly homologous to those of MOZ and MORF (30Lalonde M.E. Avvakumov N. Glass K.C. Joncas F.H. Saksouk N. Paquet E. Yan K. Holliday M. Tan S. Yang X.J. et al.Exchange of associated factors directs a switch in HBO1 acetyltransferase histone tail specificity.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 2009-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic analysis of Chameau, the fly ortholog of HBO1, revealed an unexpected role in silencing Hox gene expression (31Grienenberger A. Miotto B. Sagnier T. Cavalli G. Schramke V.

In addition to association with histone acetyltransferases, BRPF1 possesses double plant homeodomain-linked (PHD) zinc fingers for interaction with histone H3 (30Lalonde M.E. Avvakumov N. Glass K.C.

Biologically, mouse Brpf1 is essential for embryogenesis (35You L. Chen L. Penney J. Miao D. Yang X.J. Expression atlas of the epigenetic regulator Brpf1 and its requirement for survival of mouse embryos.Epigenetics. 2014; 9: 860-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pathologically, the human BRPF1 gene is recurrently mutated in sonic hedgehog-driven adult medulloblastoma (36Kool M. Jones D.T. Jäger N. Northcott P.A. Pugh T.J. Hovestadt V. Piro R.M. Esparza L.A.

Remke M. et al.Genome sequencing of SHH medulloblastoma predicts genotype-related response to smoothened inhibition.Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, related to the aforementioned possibility that BRPF1 functions as a modifier of neurological disorders resulting from aberrant MOZ and MORF, mouse Brpf1 is highly expressed in the forebrain and cerebellum (35You L. Chen L. Penney J. Miao D. Yang X.J. Expression atlas of the epigenetic regulator Brpf1 and its requirement for survival of mouse embryos.Epigenetics. 2014; 9: 860-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in brain development. To investigate this, we have specifically inactivated the mouse Brpf1 gene in the forebrain. Here, we describe the resulting early postnatal lethality and characterize the developmental defects in the neocortex and corpus callosum. Strikingly, microarray-based gene expression analyses revealed dramatically elevated expression of multiple Hox genes and other transcription factors, thereby unveiling an unexpected role of Brpf1 in negative regulation of gene expression in vivo. Mouse strains were maintained in an established facility at McGill University, and all procedures about the use of mice were performed according to guidelines and protocols approved by the McGill Animal Use Committee. Heterozygous Brpf1f/+ mice have been described recently (35You L. Chen L. Penney J. Miao D. Yang X.J. Expression atlas of the epigenetic regulator Brpf1 and its requirement for survival of mouse embryos.Epigenetics. 2014; 9: 860-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This conditional allele contains two LoxP sites for Cre-mediated excision to remove coding exons 4–6 of the Brpf1 gene (35You L. Chen L. Penney J. Miao D. Yang X.J. Expression atlas of the epigenetic regulator Brpf1 and its requirement for survival of mouse embryos.Epigenetics. 2014; 9: 860-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Intercrosses generated Brpf1f/f homozygotes, which were then crossed with Emx1-Cre mice (Jax). Further intercross yielded forebrain-specific Brpf1f/f;Emx1-Cre knock-out (or bKO) mice. Nest-building tests were performed as described (37Deacon R.M. Assessing nest building in mice.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Between 4:00 and 5:00 pm, mice were transferred to individual testing cages with bedding but no environmental enrichment items. One nestlet cotton (3.0 g) was placed in each cage. The nests were assessed in the next morning on a 5-point scale as described (38Deacon R. Assessing burrowing, nest construction, and hoarding in mice.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 59: e2607PubMed Google Scholar). Digital cage photos were taken before and after the tests. Hindlimb clasping tests were performed as reported (39Yamamoto A. Lucas J.J. Hen R. Reversal of neuropathology and motor dysfunction in a conditional model of Huntington's disease.Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Mice were suspended by the base of the tail and videotaped for 14 s. Animals were assessed for hindlimb clasping score and duration. For the clasping score, the video was played back in half-time. The test period was divided into 2-s slots. An animal would receive a score of 1 point if it displayed any abnormal movement during the given time slot, thereby allowing for a maximum score of 7 points. An abnormal movement was defined as any dystonic movement of the hindlimbs, or a combination of hind- and forelimbs and trunk, during which the limbs were pulled into the body in a manner not observed in wild-type mice. Tissue preparation was performed as described (40Kim G.W. Li L. Gorbani M. You L. Yang X.J.

Paraffin sections were dewaxed and rehydrated through a gradient series of ethanol. Cryosections or paraffin sections were stained in 0.1% cresyl violet solution (prepared with 0.3% glacial acetic acid and filtered) for 6–8 min, rinsed in distilled H2O, dehydrated in a gradient of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and covered with glass coverslips for examination under a light microscope. Slides were also digitized with a Scanscope XT (Aperio) for further analysis. This method stains vesicular zinc in the brain and was performed according to an on-line protocol (Nikki Sunnen, BCM 4/09). Wild-type and bKO mice were anesthetized at P8 with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with cold PBS and then with a buffered sulfide solution containing 1.2% Na2S. Brains were removed and immersed in the perfusion solution for 1 h. After rinsing with distilled H2O, the brains were fixed in neutral buffered formalin (Sigma, HT501128) for 24 h and post-fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 30% dextrose solution for 1.5 h. Samples were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned sagittally at 5 μm. Dewaxed and rehydrated slides were stained in a preheated (26 °C) Timm's stain solution (30% gum arabic, 1.7% hydroquinone and 0.085% silver nitrate in the citrate buffer) for 45 min in the dark at room temperature and then for at least 20 min at 60 °C. Slides were counterstained in 0.1% cresyl violet. The Black Gold II myelin staining kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, AG105). Wild-type and bKO mice at P13 were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with cold PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were removed and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. 40 μm of coronal cryosections were used. After anesthesia, mice were perfused transcardially with cold PBS. Golgi-Cox impregnation was performed with the FD Rapid Golgi-Stain kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, PK401A) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For this, 180-μm coronal slices were prepared on a Vibrotome (Bio-Rad/EM Corp., Micro-Cut H1200). Black and white photographs were taken under a bright field on an Axio Observer Z1 microscope controlled by the Zen software package (Zeiss). This was performed as described previously (40Kim G.W.

After DAPI staining, fluorescent images were taken, and cortical layer thickness was measured with the Zen software package (Zeiss). The neocortex above the hippocampus was selected for quantification. For E15.5 neocortex, the total thickness was divided into ventricular zone/subventricular zone, intermediate zone, and cortical plate. For quantification, three brains per genotype and three sections per brain were measured. Neonate cortex was considered to include the subventricular zone, intermediate zone, and layers I–VI; for quantification, three brains per genotype and 4–5 sections per brain were measured. After double immunolabeling with anti-Ctip2 and -Cux1 antibodies, images were taken with the Zen software package (Zeiss) to determine thickness of the Cux1+ or Ctip2+ layer, signal intensity of the Cux1+ layer, and cell density in the Ctip2+ layer. Three brains per genotype and three sections per brain were used for quantification. After intraperitoneal injection with 50 μg of BrdU/g body weight at E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5, pregnant mice were sacrificed at P0 to retrieve neonate brains for fixation and subsequent preparation of 5-μm paraffin sections. For immunostaining, the sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and exposed to 2 n HCl at 37 °C for 30 min before antigen retrieval by boiling in 10 mm sodium citrate at pH 6.0 for 20 min. Sections were then incubated in the blocking solution (2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h before incubation with a rat anti-BrdU antibody (Abcam, AB6326, 1:100) in the blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. Biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rat IgG(H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 712-065-153, 1:200) was used as a secondary antibody. The signal was developed with the Vector ABC and DAB substrate kits (Vector Laboratories, PK-4001 and SK-4100). Stained sections were archived on a Scanscope XT (Aperio) with a 20× objective. The developing neocortex above the hippocampus was used for quantification. For each cortex, the total thickness extending from molecular layer to the intermediate zone was divided into 10 bins with Photoshop (Adobe), and the cell number of darkly stained and lightly stained BrdU+ cells was counted manually and assigned to each bin to generate histograms of the number of labeled cells against bin. The genotypes were intentionally ignored to avoid bias. For each BrdU labeling time point, two pairs of littermates and four matched sections per pair were used for quantification. Pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected at E15.5 with 50 μg of BrdU/g body weight, and fetal brains were recovered 1 h later. Paraffin sections were prepared for immunostaining with anti-Ki67 and -BrdU antibodies. For antigen retrieval, the sections were boiled in 10 mm sodium citrate at pH 6.0 for 20 min, blocked, and incubated simultaneously with rat anti-BrdU antibody (Abcam, AB6326, 1:100) and mouse anti-Ki67 antibody (Pharmingen, 556003, 1:400) at 4 °C overnight.

Although several immunomodulatory drugs and molecules are available, most present significant side effects over long-term use. Cinnamon is a commonly used natural spice and flavoring material used for centuries throughout the world. Here, we have explored a novel use of cinnamon powder in protecting Tregs and treating the disease process of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Oral feeding of cinnamon (Cinnamonum verum) powder suppresses clinical symptoms of relapsing-remitting EAE in female PLP-TCR transgenic mice and adoptive transfer mouse model. Cinnamon also inhibited clinical symptoms of chronic EAE in male C57/BL6 mice. Dose-dependent study shows that cinnamon powder at a dose of 50 mg/kg body wt/d or higher significantly suppresses clinical symptoms of EAE in mice. Accordingly, oral administration of cinnamon also inhibited perivascular cuffing, maintained the integrity of blood-brain barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier, suppressed inflammation, normalized the expression of myelin genes, and blocked demyelination in the central nervous system of EAE mice. Interestingly, cinnamon treatment upregulated Tregs via reduction of nitric oxide production. Furthermore, we demonstrate that blocking of Tregs by neutralizing antibodies against CD25 abrogates cinnamon-mediated protection of EAE. Taken together, our results suggest that oral administration of cinnamon powder may be beneficial in MS patients and that no other existing anti-MS therapies could be so economical and trouble-free as this approach."

One hallmark of this dynamic process is an increased permeability to large cations such as N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). In this study, we mutated residues throughout the TRPV1 pore domain to identify loci that contribute to dynamic large cation permeability. Using resiniferatoxin (RTX) as the agonist, we identified multiple gain-of-function substitutions within the TRPV1 pore turret (N628P and S629A), pore helix (F638A), and selectivity filter (M644A) domains. In all of these mutants, maximum NMDG permeability was substantially greater than that recorded in wild type TRPV1, despite similar or even reduced sodium current density. Two additional mutants, located in the pore turret (G618W) and selectivity filter (M644I), resulted in significantly reduced maximum NMDG permeability. M644A and M644I also showed increased and decreased minimum NMDG permeability, respectively. The phenotypes of this panel of mutants were confirmed by imaging the RTX-evoked uptake of the large cationic fluorescent dye YO-PRO1. Whereas none of the mutations selectively altered capsaicin-induced changes in NMDG permeability, the loss-of-function phenotypes seen with RTX stimulation of G618W and M644I were recapitulated in the capsaicin-evoked YO-PRO1 uptake assay.

https://openalex.org/W2084264457,"Fusaric acid is produced by pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium, and is toxic to plants and rhizobacteria. Many fluorescent pseudomonads can prevent wilt diseases caused by these fungi. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of fusaric acid on P. protegens Pf-5 and elucidate the mechanisms that enable the bacterium to survive in the presence of the mycotoxin. The results confirm that fusaric acid negatively affects growth and motility of P. protegens. Moreover, a notable increase in secretion of the siderophore pyoverdine was observed when P. protegens was grown in the presence of fusaric acid. Concomitantly, levels of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine and enantio-pyochelin, the second siderophore encoded by P. protegens, increased markedly. Moreover, while similar levels of resistance to fusaric acid were observed for P. protegens mutants unable to synthesize either pyoverdine or enanto-pyochelin and the wild type strain, a double mutant unable to synthesize both kinds of siderophores showed a dramatically reduced resistance to this compound. This reduced resistance was not observed when this mutant was grown under conditions of iron excess. Spectrophotometric titrations revealed that fusaric acid binds not only Fe2+ and Fe3+, but also Zn2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+, with high affinity. Our results demonstrate that iron sequestration accounts at least in part for the deleterious effect of the mycotoxin on P. protegens."

This modification of HS is important for protein ligand recognition. We have determined the crystal structures of Glce in apo-form (unliganded) and in complex with heparin hexasaccharide (product of Glce following O-sulfation), both in a stable dimer conformation. A Glce dimer contains two catalytic sites, each at a positively charged cleft in C-terminal α-helical domains binding one negatively charged hexasaccharide. Based on the structural and mutagenesis studies, three tyrosine residues, Tyr468, Tyr528, and Tyr546, in the active site were found to be crucial for the enzymatic activity. The complex structure also reveals the mechanism of product inhibition (i.e. 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation of HS keeps the C5 carbon of l-iduronic acid away from the active-site tyrosine residues).

https://openalex.org/W1994535727,"A deficiency in chondroitin N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (ChGn-1) was previously shown to reduce the number of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, leading to skeletal dysplasias in mice, suggesting that ChGn-1 regulates the number of CS chains for normal cartilage development. Recently, we demonstrated that 2-phosphoxylose phosphatase (XYLP) regulates the number of CS chains by dephosphorylating the Xyl residue in the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region of proteoglycans. However, the relationship between ChGn-1 and XYLP in controlling the number of CS chains is not clear. In this study, we for the first time detected a phosphorylated tetrasaccharide linkage structure, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl(2-O-phosphate), in ChGn-1−/− growth plate cartilage but not in ChGn-2−/− or wild-type growth plate cartilage. In contrast, the truncated linkage tetrasaccharide GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl was detected in wild-type, ChGn-1−/−, and ChGn-2−/− growth plate cartilage. Consistent with the findings, ChGn-1 preferentially transferred N-acetylgalactosamine to the phosphorylated tetrasaccharide linkage in vitro. Moreover, ChGn-1 and XYLP interacted with each other, and ChGn-1-mediated addition of N-acetylgalactosamine was accompanied by rapid XYLP-dependent dephosphorylation during formation of the CS linkage region. Taken together, we conclude that the phosphorylated tetrasaccharide linkage is the preferred substrate for ChGn-1 and that ChGn-1 and XYLP cooperatively regulate the number of CS chains in growth plate cartilage."

Internalization of the CD20·mAb·FcγRIIb complex follows, the rate of which correlates with FcγRIIb expression. In contrast, although type II anti-CD20 mAb such as tositumomab and obinutuzumab also interact with and activate FcγRIIb, this interaction fails to augment the rate of CD20·mAb internalization, raising the question of whether ITIM phosphorylation plays any role in this process. We have assessed the molecular requirements for the internalization process and demonstrate that in contrast to internalization of IgG immune complexes, FcγRIIb-augmented internalization of rituximab-ligated CD20 occurs independently of the FcγRIIb ITIM, indicating that signaling downstream of FcγRIIb is not required. In transfected cells, activatory FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIIa augmented internalization of rituximab-ligated CD20 in a similar manner.

The difference was maintained in cells expressing FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb lacking cytoplasmic domains and in which the transmembrane domains had been exchanged. This difference may be due to increased degradation of FcγRIIa, which traffics to lysosomes independently of rituximab.

https://openalex.org/W2032422833,"Background Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in newborns: its prognosis depends both on the severity of the asphyxia and on the immediate resuscitation to restore oxygen supply and blood circulation. Therefore, we investigated whether measurement of S100B, a consolidated marker of brain injury, in salivary fluid of PA newborns may constitute a useful tool for the early detection of asphyxia-related brain injury. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 292 full-term newborns admitted to our NICUs, of whom 48 suffered PA and 244 healthy controls admitted at our NICUs. Saliva S100B levels measurement longitudinally after birth; routine laboratory variables, neurological patterns, cerebral ultrasound and, magnetic resonance imaging were performed. The primary end-point was the presence of neurological abnormalities at 12-months after birth. Results S100B salivary levels were significantly (P<0.001) higher in newborns with PA than in normal infants. When asphyxiated infants were subdivided according to a good (Group A; n = 15) or poor (Group B; n = 33) neurological outcome at 12-months, S100B was significantly higher at all monitoring time-points in Group B than in Group A or controls (P<0.001, for all). A cut-off >3.25 MoM S100B achieved a sensitivity of 100% (CI5-95%: 89.3%-100%) and a specificity of 100% (CI5-95%: 98.6%-100%) as a single marker for predicting the occurrence of abnormal neurological outcome (area under the ROC curve: 1.000; CI5-95%: 0.987-1.0). Conclusions S100B protein measurement in saliva, soon after birth, is a useful tool to identify which asphyxiated infants are at risk of neurological sequelae."

By combining molecular modeling, in vitro mutagenesis, and kinetic measurements, and in cellulo analysis of GAG anabolism and decorin glycosylation, we mapped the organization of the acceptor binding pocket, in complex with 4-methylumbelliferone-xylopyranoside as prototype substrate. We show that its organization is governed, on one side, by three tyrosine residues, Tyr194, Tyr196, and Tyr199, which create a hydrophobic environment and provide stacking interactions with both xylopyranoside and aglycone rings. On the opposite side, a hydrogen-bond network is established between the charged amino acids Asp228, Asp229, and Arg226, and the hydroxyl groups of xylose.

https://openalex.org/W2088792390,"PLP synthase (PLPS) is a remarkable single-enzyme biosynthetic pathway that produces pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) from glutamine, ribose 5-phosphate, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The intact enzyme includes 12 synthase and 12 glutaminase subunits. PLP synthesis occurs in the synthase active site by a complicated mechanism involving at least two covalent intermediates at a catalytic lysine. The first intermediate forms with ribose 5-phosphate. The glutaminase subunit is a glutamine amidotransferase that hydrolyzes glutamine and channels ammonia to the synthase active site. Ammonia attack on the first covalent intermediate forms the second intermediate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reacts with the second intermediate to form PLP. To investigate the mechanism of the synthase subunit, crystal structures were obtained for three intermediate states of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus intact PLPS or its synthase subunit. The structures capture the synthase active site at three distinct steps in its complicated catalytic cycle, provide insights into the elusive mechanism, and illustrate the coordinated motions within the synthase subunit that separate the catalytic states. In the intact PLPS with a Michaelis-like intermediate in the glutaminase active site, the first covalent intermediate of the synthase is fully sequestered within the enzyme by the ordering of a generally disordered 20-residue C-terminal tail. Following addition of ammonia, the synthase active site opens and admits the Lys-149 side chain, which participates in formation of the second intermediate and PLP. Roles are identified for conserved Asp-24 in the formation of the first intermediate and for conserved Arg-147 in the conversion of the first to the second intermediate.BackgroundPyridoxal phosphate (PLP) synthase generates PLP from three common metabolites in a reaction with three covalent intermediates.ResultsCrystal structures capture the synthase active site at three steps of catalysis.ConclusionProtein dynamics are correlated with formation of covalent intermediates.SignificanceNew information is provided about the complex catalysis in the synthase active site and the roles of conserved amino acids. PLP synthase (PLPS) is a remarkable single-enzyme biosynthetic pathway that produces pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) from glutamine, ribose 5-phosphate, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The intact enzyme includes 12 synthase and 12 glutaminase subunits. PLP synthesis occurs in the synthase active site by a complicated mechanism involving at least two covalent intermediates at a catalytic lysine. The first intermediate forms with ribose 5-phosphate. The glutaminase subunit is a glutamine amidotransferase that hydrolyzes glutamine and channels ammonia to the synthase active site. Ammonia attack on the first covalent intermediate forms the second intermediate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reacts with the second intermediate to form PLP. To investigate the mechanism of the synthase subunit, crystal structures were obtained for three intermediate states of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus intact PLPS or its synthase subunit. The structures capture the synthase active site at three distinct steps in its complicated catalytic cycle, provide insights into the elusive mechanism, and illustrate the coordinated motions within the synthase subunit that separate the catalytic states.

https://openalex.org/W1991575544,"Mammalian sperm acquire fertility through a functional maturation process called capacitation, where sperm membrane molecules are drastically remodeled. In this study, we found that a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-reactive protein on lipid rafts, named WGA16, is removed from the sperm surface on capacitation. WGA16 is a prostate-derived seminal plasma protein that has never been reported and is deposited on the sperm surface in the male reproductive tract. Based on protein and cDNA sequences for purified WGA16, it is a homologue of human zymogen granule protein 16 (ZG16) belonging to the Jacalin-related lectin (JRL) family in crystal and primary structures. A glycan array shows that WGA16 binds heparin through a basic patch containing Lys-53/Lys-73 residues but not the conventional lectin domain of the JRL family. WGA16 is glycosylated, contrary to other ZG16 members, and comparative mass spectrometry clearly shows its unique N-glycosylation profile among seminal plasma proteins. It has exposed GlcNAc and GalNAc residues without additional Gal residues. The GlcNAc/GalNAc residues can work as binding ligands for a sperm surface galactosyltransferase, which actually galactosylates WGA16 in situ in the presence of UDP-Gal. Interestingly, surface removal of WGA16 is experimentally induced by either UDP-Gal or heparin. In the crystal structure, N-glycosylated sites and a potential heparin-binding site face opposite sides. This geography of two functional sites suggest that WGA16 is deposited on the sperm surface through interaction between its N-glycans and the surface galactosyltransferase, whereas its heparin-binding domain may be involved in binding to sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the female tract, enabling removal of WGA16 from the sperm surface.BackgroundMechanisms of glycoprotein redistribution during sperm capacitation remain unclear.ResultsProstate-specific ZG16-like lectin WGA16 was discovered in sperm lipid rafts.

In the electrogenic Na+-HCO3− cotransporter NBCe1-A, EL-3 is the largest extracellular loop and is predicted to consist of 82 amino acids. To determine the structural-functional importance of the conserved cysteines and the N-glycosylation sites in NBCe1-A EL-3, we analyzed the potential interplay between EL-3 disulfide bonding and N-glycosylation and their roles in EL-3 topological folding. Our results demonstrate that the 4 highly conserved cysteines form two intramolecular disulfide bonds, Cys583-Cys585 and Cys617-Cys642, respectively, that constrain EL-3 in a folded conformation. The formation of the second disulfide bond is spontaneous and unaffected by the N-glycosylation state of EL-3 or the first disulfide bond, whereas formation of the first disulfide bond relies on the presence of the second disulfide bond and is affected by N-glycosylation. Importantly, EL-3 from each monomer is adjacently located at the NBCe1-A dimeric interface. When the two disulfide bonds are missing, EL-3 adopts an extended conformation highly accessible to protease digestion.

https://openalex.org/W2095484897,"Muscle invasive bladder carcinoma is a complex, multifactorial disease caused by disruptions and alterations of several molecular pathways that result in heterogeneous phenotypes and variable disease outcome. Combining this disparate knowledge may offer insights for deciphering relevant molecular processes regarding targeted therapeutic approaches guided by molecular signatures allowing improved phenotype profiling. The aim of the study is to characterize muscle invasive bladder carcinoma on a molecular level by incorporating scientific literature screening and signatures from omics profiling. Public domain omics signatures together with molecular features associated with muscle invasive bladder cancer were derived from literature mining to provide 286 unique protein-coding genes. These were integrated in a protein-interaction network to obtain a molecular functional map of the phenotype. This feature map educated on three novel disease-associated pathways with plausible involvement in bladder cancer, namely Regulation of actin cytoskeleton, Neurotrophin signalling pathway and Endocytosis. Systematic integration approaches allow to study the molecular context of individual features reported as associated with a clinical phenotype and could potentially help to improve the molecular mechanistic description of the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2072326765,"Acquired tracheal stenosis remains a challenging problem for otolaryngologists. The objective of this study was to determine whether the Sendai virus (SeV)-mediated c-myc suppressor, a far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein (FBP)-interacting repressor (FIR), modulates wound healing of the airway mucosa, and whether it prevents tracheal stenosis in an animal model of induced mucosal injury. A fusion gene-deleted, non-transmissible SeV vector encoding FIR (FIR-SeV/ΔF) was prepared. Rats with scraped airway mucosae were administered FIR-SeV/ΔF through the tracheostoma. The pathological changes in the airway mucosa and in the tracheal lumen were assessed five days after scraping. Untreated animals showed hyperplasia of the airway epithelium and a thickened submucosal layer with extensive fibrosis, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition causing lumen stenosis. By contrast, the administration of FIR-SeV/ΔF decreased the degree of tracheal stenosis (P < 0.05) and improved the survival rate (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that c-Myc expression was downregulated in the tracheal basal cells of the FIR-SeV/ΔF-treated animals, suggesting that c-myc was suppressed by FIR-SeV/ΔF in the regenerating airway epithelium of the injured tracheal mucosa. The airway-targeted gene therapy of the c-myc suppressor FIR, using a recombinant SeV vector, prevented tracheal stenosis in a rat model of airway mucosal injury."

Because the Cdk inhibitor flavopiridol is known to inhibit RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription elongation by inhibiting the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb, a complex of CDK9 and cyclin T), we examined whether inhibition of RNA Pol II protects neurons from apoptosis. Treatment of neurons with 5, 6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribobenzimidazole (DRB), an RNA Pol II-dependent transcription elongation inhibitor, and flavopiridol inhibited phosphorylation and activation of Pol II and protected neurons from undergoing apoptosis. In addition to Pol II, neurons subjected to KCl withdrawal showed increased phosphorylation and activation of p70 S6 kinase, which was inhibited by both DRB and flavopiridol. Immunostaining analysis of the neurons deprived of KCl showed increased nuclear levels of phospho-p70 S6 kinase, and neurons protected with DRB and flavopiridol showed accumulation of the kinase into large spliceosome assembly factor-positive speckle domains within the nuclei. The formation of these foci corresponded with cell survival, and removal of the inhibitors resulted in dispersal of the speckles into smaller foci with subsequent apoptosis induction.

https://openalex.org/W2169058898,"Abstract The human angiotensinogen (hAGT) gene has polymorphisms in its 2.5-kb promoter that form two haplotype (Hap) blocks: −6A/G (−1670A/G, −1562C/T, and −1561T/C) and −217A/G (−532T/C, −793A/G, −1074T/C, and −1178G/A). Hap −6A/−217A is associated with human hypertension, whereas Hap −6G/−217G reduces cardiovascular risk. Hap −6A/−217A has increased promoter activity with enhanced transcription factor binding, including to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Glucocorticoid therapy frequently causes hypertension, the mechanisms for which are incompletely understood. We have engineered double transgenic (TG) mice containing the human renin gene with either Hap of the hAGT gene and examined the physiological significance of glucocorticoid-mediated allele-specific regulation of the hAGT gene. We have also studied the consequential effects on the renin angiotensin system and blood pressure. TG mice with Hap −6A and −6G were treated with and without a low dose of a GR agonist, dexamethasone (2.5 μg/ml), for 72 h. We found greater chromatin-GR binding with increased GR agonist-induced hAGT expression in liver and renal tissues of Hap −6A mice. Additionally, dexamethasone treatment increased circulating hAGT and angiotensin II levels in Hap −6A mice, as compared with −6G mice. Importantly, GR agonist significantly increased blood pressure and redox markers in TG mice with Hap-6A of the hAGT gene. Taken together, our results show, for the first time, that glucocorticoids affect hAGT expression in a haplotype-dependent fashion with SNPs in Hap −6A favoring agonist-induced GR binding. This leads to increased expression of the hAGT, up-regulation of the renin angiotensin system, and increased blood pressure and oxidative stress in Hap −6A mice."

https://openalex.org/W1970663387,"Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases in children (chDPLD) or interstitial lung diseases in children (chILD) represent a heterogeneous group of respiratory disorders that are mostly chronic and associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, the incidence of chDPLD is so low that most pediatricians lack sufficient knowledge of chDPLD, especially in China. Based on the clinico- radiologic- pathologic (CRP) diagnosis, we tried to describe (1) the characteristics of chDPLD and (2) the ratio of each constituent of chDPLD in China. Data were evaluated, including clinical, radiographic, and pathologic results from lung biopsies. We collected 25 cases of chDPLD, 18 boys and 7 girls with a median age of 6.0 years, from 16 hospitals in China. The most common manifestations included cough (n = 24), dyspnea (n = 21), and fever (n = 4). There were three cases of exposure-related interstitial lung disease (ILD), three cases of systemic disease-associated ILD, nineteen cases of alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD, and no cases of ILD specific to infancy. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (n = 9) was the two largest groups. Conclusion: Non-specific interstitial pneumonia is the main categories of chDPLD in China. Lung biopsy is always a crucial step in the final diagnosis. However, clinical and imaging studies should be carefully evaluated for their value in indicating a specific chDPLD."
