https://openalex.org/W2325506870,"Expectations about what will appear next guide perception. Using high-resolution fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, the authors find that such predictive coding in early visual cortex could arise from pattern completion in hippocampal subfields. They show that these two processes are related and explore their behavioral significance and relative timing. Models of predictive coding frame perception as a generative process in which expectations constrain sensory representations. These models account for expectations about how a stimulus will move or change from moment to moment, but do not address expectations about what other, distinct stimuli are likely to appear based on prior experience. We show that such memory-based expectations in human visual cortex are related to the hippocampal mechanism of pattern completion."
https://openalex.org/W2334665931,"Changes in neuronal activity create local and transient changes in energy demands at synapses. Here we discover a metabolic compartment that forms in vivo near synapses to meet local energy demands and support synaptic function in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. Under conditions of energy stress, glycolytic enzymes redistribute from a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm to a punctate localization adjacent to synapses. Glycolytic enzymes colocalize, suggesting the ad hoc formation of a glycolysis compartment, or a ""glycolytic metabolon,"" that can maintain local levels of ATP. Local formation of the glycolytic metabolon is dependent on presynaptic scaffolding proteins, and disruption of the glycolytic metabolon blocks the synaptic vesicle cycle, impairs synaptic recovery, and affects locomotion. Our studies indicate that under energy stress conditions, energy demands in C. elegans synapses are met locally through the assembly of a glycolytic metabolon to sustain synaptic function and behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2318208171,"It has long been known that males are more susceptible than females to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the reason remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the long noncoding RNA FTX (lnc-FTX), an X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST) regulator transcribed from the X chromosome inactivation center, in both HCC and HCC gender disparity. lnc-FTX is expressed at higher levels in female livers than in male livers and is significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Patients with higher lnc-FTX expression exhibited longer survival, suggesting that lnc-FTX is a useful prognostic factor for HCC patients. lnc-FTX inhibits HCC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-FTX represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity by competitively sponging miR-374a and inhibits HCC cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition and invasion. In addition, lnc-FTX binds to the DNA replication licensing factor MCM2, thereby impeding DNA replication and inhibiting proliferation in HCC cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that lnc-FTX may act as a tumor suppressor in HCC through physically binding miR-374a and MCM2. It may also be one of the reasons for HCC gender disparity and may potentially contribute to HCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2339466004,"The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has emerged as an important hallmark of cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in miRNA expression remain unclear. In this study, we discovered a novel epigenetic mechanism of miR-506 regulation and investigated its functional significance in pancreatic cancer. Sequencing analysis revealed that the miR-506 promoter is highly methylated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. Reduced miR-506 expression was significantly associated with clinical stage, pathologic tumor status, distant metastasis and decreased survival of pancreatic cancer patients. miR-506 inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and enhanced apoptosis and chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, we identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a novel target of miR-506, the expression of which inhibited the SPHK1/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is activated in pancreatic cancer. High SPHK1 expression was significantly associated with poor survival in a large cohort of pancreatic cancer specimens. Our data suggest that miR-506 acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA and is epigenetically silenced in pancreatic cancer. The newly identified miR-506/SPHK1 axis represents a novel therapeutic strategy for future pancreatic cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2333393009,"Recently, intriguing new roles for some small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs) in cancer have emerged. In the present study, a panel of SNHGs was profiled to detect aberrantly expressed SNHGs in gastric cancer (GC). The expression of SNHG5 was significantly downregulated in GC and was significantly associated with the formation of a tumor embolus and with the tumor, node and metastasis stage. SNHG5 was a long non-coding RNA, which was a class of non-coding RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. SNHG5 suppressed GC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SNHG5 exerted its function through interacting with MTA2, preventing the translocation of MTA2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. SNHG5 overexpression led to significant increases in the acetylation levels of histone H3 and p53, indicating that SNHG5 might affect acetylation by trapping MTA2 in the cytosol, thereby interfering with the formation of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex. This study is the first to demonstrate that SNHG5 is a critical and powerful regulator that is involved in GC progression through trapping MTA2 in the cytosol. These results imply that SNHG5 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of GC."
https://openalex.org/W2317544004,"Electrical and chemical synapses coexist in circuits throughout the CNS. Yet, it is not well understood how electrical and chemical synaptic transmission interact to determine the functional output of networks endowed with both types of synapse. We found that release of glutamate from bipolar cells onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was strongly shaped by gap-junction-mediated electrical coupling within the bipolar cell network of the mouse retina. Specifically, electrical synapses spread signals laterally between bipolar cells, and this lateral spread contributed to a nonlinear enhancement of bipolar cell output to visual stimuli presented closely in space and time. Our findings thus (1) highlight how electrical and chemical transmission can work in concert to influence network output and (2) reveal a previously unappreciated circuit mechanism that increases RGC sensitivity to spatiotemporally correlated input, such as that produced by motion."
https://openalex.org/W2312928696,"Limited functional recovery can be achieved through rehabilitation after incomplete spinal cord injury. Eliminating the function of a repulsive Wnt receptor, Ryk, in mice and rats by either conditional knockout in the motor cortex or monoclonal antibody infusion resulted in increased corticospinal axon collateral branches with presynaptic puncta in the spinal cord and enhanced recovery of forelimb reaching and grasping function following a cervical dorsal column lesion. Using optical stimulation, we observed that motor cortical output maps underwent massive changes after injury and that hindlimb cortical areas were recruited to control the forelimb over time. Furthermore, a greater cortical area was dedicated to controlling the forelimb in Ryk conditional knockout mice than in controls (wild-type or heterozygotes). In the absence of weekly task-specific training, recruitment of ectopic cortical areas was greatly reduced and there was no significant functional recovery even in Ryk conditional knockout mice. Our study provides evidence that maximal circuit reorganization and functional recovery can be achieved by combining molecular manipulation and targeted rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2328577203,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a soluble pentameric protein expressed in cartilage and involved in collagen organization. Tissue microarrays derived from two cohorts of patients with breast cancer (n=122 and n=498) were immunostained, revealing varying expression of COMP, both in the tumor cells and surrounding stroma. High levels of COMP in tumor cells correlated, independently of other variables, with poor survival and decreased recurrence-free survival. Breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, stably expressing COMP were injected into the mammary fat pad of SCID (CB-17/Icr-Prkdcscid/Rj) mice. Tumors expressing COMP were significantly larger and were more prone to metastasize as compared with control, mock-transfected, tumors. In vitro experiments confirmed that COMP-expressing cells had a more invasive phenotype, which could in part be attributed to an upregulation of matrix metalloprotease-9. Furthermore, microarray analyses of gene expression in tumors formed in vivo showed that COMP expression induced higher expression of genes protecting against endoplasmic reticulum stress. This observation was confirmed in vitro as COMP-expressing cells showed better survival as well as a higher rate of protein synthesis when treated with brefeldin A, compared with control cells. Further, COMP-expressing cells appeared to undergo a metabolic switch, that is, a Warburg effect. Thus, in vitro measurement of cell respiration indicated decreased mitochondrial metabolism. In conclusion, COMP is a novel biomarker in breast cancer, which contributes to the severity of the disease by metabolic switching and increasing invasiveness and tumor cell viability, leading to reduced survival in animal models and human patients."
https://openalex.org/W2334599854,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the western countries and is currently incurable due, in part, to difficulty in eliminating the leukemia cells protected by stromal microenvironment. Based on previous observations that CLL cells exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and altered lipid metabolism and that carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT) have a major role in transporting fatty acid into mitochondria to support cancer cell metabolism, we tested several clinically relevant inhibitors of lipid metabolism for their ability to eliminate primary CLL cells. We discovered that perhexiline, an antiangina agent that inhibits CPT, was highly effective in killing CLL cells in stromal microenvironment at clinically achievable concentrations. These effective concentrations caused low toxicity to normal lymphocytes and normal stromal cells. Mechanistic study revealed that CLL cells expressed high levels of CPT1 and CPT2. Suppression of fatty acid transport into mitochondria by inhibiting CPT using perhexiline resulted in a depletion of cardiolipin, a key component of mitochondrial membranes, and compromised mitochondrial integrity, leading to rapid depolarization and massive CLL cell death. The therapeutic activity of perhexiline was further demonstrated in vivo using a CLL transgenic mouse model. Perhexiline significantly prolonged the overall animal survival by only four drug injections. Our study suggests that targeting CPT using an antiangina drug is able to effectively eliminate leukemia cells in vivo, and is a novel therapeutic strategy for potential clinical treatment of CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2337497073,"Differentiation of muscle satellite cells (MSCs) involves interaction of the proteins present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) with MSCs to regulate their activity, and therefore phenotype. Herein, we report fibromodulin (FMOD), a member of the proteoglycan family participating in the assembly of ECM, as a novel regulator of myostatin (MSTN) during myoblast differentiation. In addition to having a pronounced effect on the expression of myogenic marker genes [myogenin (MYOG) and myosin light chain 2 (MYL2)], FMOD was found to maintain the transcriptional activity of MSTN. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation and in silico studies performed to investigate the interaction of FMOD helped confirm that it antagonizes MSTN function by distorting its folding and preventing its binding to activin receptor type IIB. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed that FMOD plays an active role in healing by increasing satellite cell recruitment to sites of injury. Together, these findings disclose a hitherto unrecognized regulatory role for FMOD in MSCs and highlight new mechanisms whereby FMOD circumvents the inhibitory effects of MSTN and triggers myoblast differentiation. These findings offer a basis for the design of novel MSTN inhibitors that promote muscle regeneration after injury or for the development of pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of different muscle atrophies.—Lee, E.

https://openalex.org/W2318178314,"Understanding what drives breast tumor progression is of utmost importance for blocking tumor metastasis; we have identified that semaphorin 7a is a potent driver of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) progression. Semaphorin 7a is a glycophosphatidylinositol membrane-anchored protein that promotes attachment and spreading in multiple cell types. Here, we show that increased expression of SEMA7A occurs in a large percentage of breast cancers and is associated with decreased overall and distant metastasis-free survival. In both in vitro and in vivo models, short hairpin-mediated silencing of SEMA7A reveals roles for semaphorin 7a in the promotion of DCIS growth, motility and invasion as well as lymphangiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Our studies also uncover a relationship between COX-2 and semaphorin 7a expression and suggest that semaphorin 7a promotes tumor cell invasion on collagen and lymphangiogenesis via activation of β1-integrin receptor. Our results suggest that semaphorin 7a may be novel target for blocking breast tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2337247222,"Accumulating evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a critical role in cardiovascular homeostasis, and its altered expression is associated with major cardiac and vascular disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulation of vascular function and assess the vascular redox balance in ACE2-deficient (ACE2-/y) animals. Experiments were performed in 20–22 week-old C57BL/6 and ACE2-/y male mice. Evaluation of endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation revealed an impairment of in vitro and in vivo vascular function in ACE2-/y mice. Drastic reduction in eNOS expression at both protein and mRNA levels, and a decrease in •NO concentrations were observed in aortas of ACE2-/y mice in comparison to controls. Consistently, these mice presented a lower plasma and urine nitrite concentration, confirming reduced •NO availability in ACE2-deficient animals. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased and superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in aorta homogenates of ACE2-/y mice, indicating impaired antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our data indicate, that ACE2 regulates vascular function by modulating nitric oxide release and oxidative stress. In conclusion, we elucidate mechanisms by which ACE2 is involved in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Furthermore, these findings provide insights into the role of the renin-angiotensin system in both vascular and systemic redox balance."
https://openalex.org/W2337933193,"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of macrophage polarization in aging heart. Macrophage differentiation is pathogenically linked to many inflammatory and immune disorders. It is often preceded by myocardial inflammation, which is characterized by increased cardiac damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that senescence accelerated-prone (SAMP8) mice cardiac tissue would develop macrophage polarization compared with senescence-resistant control (SAMR1) mice. Both SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice were sacrificed when they became six month old. We evaluated, histo-pathological changes and modifications in protein expression by Western blotting and immuno-histochemical staining for M1 and M2 macrophage markers, high mobility group protein (HMG)B1 and its cascade proteins, pro-inflammatory factors and inflammatory cytokines in cardiac tissue. We observed significant upregulation of HMGB1, toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, nuclear factor (NF)κB p65, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, cyclooxygenase (COX)2, interferon (IFN)γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and M1 like macrophage specific marker cluster of differentiation (CD)68 expressions in SAMP8 heart. In contrast, M2 macrophage specific marker CD36, and IL-10 expressions were down-regulated in SAMP8 mice. The results from the study demonstrated that, HMGB1-TLR2/TLR4 signaling cascade and induction of phenotypic switching to M1 macrophage polarization in SAMP8 mice heart would be one of the possible reasons behind the cardiac dysfunction and thus it could become an important therapeutic target to improve the age related cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2339123494,"As key pollinators, honey bees are crucial to many natural and agricultural ecosystems. An important factor in the health of honey bees is the availability of diverse floral resources. However, in many parts of the world, high-intensity agriculture could result in a reduction in honey bee forage. Previous studies have investigated how the landscape surrounding honey bee hives affects some aspects of honey bee health, but to our knowledge there have been no investigations of the effects of intensively cultivated landscapes on indicators of individual bee health such as nutritional physiology and pathogen loads. Furthermore, agricultural landscapes in different regions vary greatly in forage and land management, indicating a need for additional information on the relationship between honey bee health and landscape cultivation. Here, we add to this growing body of information by investigating differences in nutritional physiology between honey bees kept in areas of comparatively low and high cultivation in an area generally high agricultural intensity in the Midwestern United States. We focused on bees collected directly before winter, because overwintering stress poses one of the most serious problems for honey bees in temperate climates. We found that honey bees kept in areas of lower cultivation exhibited higher lipid levels than those kept in areas of high cultivation, but this effect was observed only in colonies that were free of Varroa mites. Furthermore, we found that the presence of mites was associated with lower lipid levels and higher titers of deformed wing virus (DWV), as well as a non-significant trend towards higher overwinter losses. Overall, these results show that mite infestation interacts with landscape, obscuring the effects of landscape alone and suggesting that the benefits of improved foraging landscape could be lost without adequate control of mite infestations."
https://openalex.org/W2338908054,"Job’s tears (Coix lachryma-jobi L.) is an important crop used as food and herbal medicine in Asian countries. A drug made of Job’s tears seed oil has been clinically applied to treat multiple cancers. In this study, the genetic diversity of Job’s tears accessions and the fatty acid composition, triglyceride composition, and anti-proliferative effect of Job’s tears seed oil were analyzed using morphological characteristics and ISSR markers, GC-MS, HPLC-ELSD, and the MTT method. ISSR analysis demonstrated low genetic diversity of Job’s tears at the species level (h = 0.21, I = 0.33) and the accession level (h = 0.07, I = 0.10), and strong genetic differentiation (GST = 0.6702) among all accessions. It also clustered the 11 accessions into three cultivated clades corresponding with geographical locations and two evidently divergent wild clades. The grouping patterns based on morphological characteristics and chemical profiles were in accordance with those clustered by ISSR analysis. Significant differences in morphological characteristics, fatty acid composition, triglyceride composition, and inhibition rates of seed oil were detected among different accessions, which showed a highly significant positive correlation with genetic variation. These results suggest that the seed morphological characteristics, fatty acid composition, and triglyceride composition may be mainly attributed to genetic factors. The proportion of palmitic acid and linoleic acid to oleic acid displayed a highly significant positive correlation with the inhibition rates of Job’s tears seed oil for T24 cells, and thus can be an important indicator for quality control for Job’s tears."
https://openalex.org/W2320139565,"Tamoxifen has shown great success in the treatment of breast cancer; however, long-term treatment can lead to acquired tamoxifen (TOT) resistance and relapse. TOT classically antagonizes estradiol (E2) -dependent breast cancer cell growth, but exerts partial agonist/antagonist behavior on gene expression. Although both E2 and TOT treatment of breast cancer cells results in recruitment of the estrogen receptor (ER) to common and distinct genomic sites, the mechanisms and proteins underlying TOT preferential recruitment of the ER remains poorly defined. To this end, we performed in silico motif-enrichment analyses within the ER-binding peaks in response to E2 or TOT, to identify factors that would specifically recruit ER to genomic binding sites in the presence of TOT as compared to E2. Intriguingly, we found Nkx3-1 and Oct-transcription factor homodimer motifs to be enriched in TOT preferential binding sites and confirmed the critical role of Oct-3/4 (aka Oct-4) in directing ER recruitment to TOT preferential genomic binding sites, by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses. Further investigation revealed Oct-4 expression to be basally repressed by Nkx3-1 in MCF-7 cells and TOT treatment appeared to elevate Nkx3-1 degradation through a p38MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase, Skp2 at serine-64 residue, as observed by quantitative mass-spectrometry analyses. Consistently, Oct-4 upon induction by phospho-Ser64-Skp2-mediated proteasomal degradation of Nkx3-1, participated in ER transcriptional complexes along with p38MAPK and Skp2 in a tamoxifen-dependent manner leading to TOT-dependent gene activation and cell proliferation of the TOT-resistant MCF-7-tamr breast cancer cells. Notably, Oct-4 levels were highly elevated in MCF-7-tamr cells, and appeared critical for their TOT sensitivity in cell proliferation assays. Furthermore, overexpression of Oct-4 enhanced tumor growth in the presence of tamoxifen in mice in vivo. Collectively, our work presents a novel mechanism for tamoxifen-specific gene activation by ER, secondary to its TOT preferential recruitment to genomic sites by specific activation of Oct-4, a phenomenon that appears to underlie tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells and in xenograft tumor models, and could be useful in designing therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2333971940,"CD146 (MUC-18, MCAM) expression on cancer cells correlates with cancer progression and a bad prognosis in several tumors, including melanoma and pancreatic tumors. Deciphering the mechanism mediating the CD146 role in cancer is essential for generating new therapeutic strategies. We found that CD146 expression in cancer cells is associated with a secretion of soluble CD146 (sCD146) that constitutes an active player in tumor development. Indeed, sCD146 induces the overexpression of its binding protein, angiomotin, on both endothelial and cancer cells and promotes both paracrine effects on angiogenesis and autocrine effects on cancer cells proliferation and survival. These last effects are mediated in part through the induction and phosphorylation of c-myc in cancer cells. In mice models xenografted with human CD146-positive melanoma or pancreatic cancer cells, administration of a novel monoclonal antibody specifically targeting sCD146, but not its membrane form, successfully suppresses tumor vascularization and growth. Our findings demonstrate that sCD146 secreted by CD146-positive tumors mediates important pro-angiogenic and pro-tumoral effects. Targeting sCD146 with a novel neutralizing antibody could thus constitute an innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CD146-positive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2339124496,"Choroideremia (CHM) is a rare X-linked disease leading to progressive retinal degeneration resulting in blindness. The disorder is caused by mutations in the CHM gene encoding REP-1 protein, an essential component of the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) complex. In the present study, we evaluated a multi-technique analysis algorithm to describe the mutational spectrum identified in a large cohort of cases and further correlate CHM variants with phenotypic characteristics and biochemical defects of choroideremia patients. Molecular genetic testing led to the characterization of 36 out of 45 unrelated CHM families (80%), allowing the clinical reclassification of four CHM families. Haplotype reconstruction showed independent origins for the recurrent p.Arg293* and p.Lys178Argfs*5 mutations, suggesting the presence of hotspots in CHM, as well as the identification of two different unrelated events involving exon 9 deletion. No certain genotype-phenotype correlation could be established. Furthermore, all the patients´ fibroblasts analyzed presented significantly increased levels of unprenylated Rabs proteins compared to control cells; however, this was not related to the genotype. This research demonstrates the major potential of the algorithm proposed for diagnosis. Our data enhance the importance of establish a differential diagnosis with other retinal dystrophies, supporting the idea of an underestimated prevalence of choroideremia. Moreover, they suggested that the severity of the disorder cannot be exclusively explained by the genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2339102089,"While it is widely recognised that the number of young adults diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disoders (ASD) is increasing, there is currently limited understanding of effective support for the transition to adulthood. One approach gaining increasing attention in the university sector is specialised peer mentoring. The aim of this inductive study was to understand the impact of peer mentor training on seven student mentors working with university students with an ASD. Kirkpatrick's model framed a mixed methods evaluation of the mentors' training and description of their experience. Overall, the training was well received by the mentors, who reported on average a 29% increase in their ASD knowledge following the training. Results from the semi-structured interviews conducted three months after the training, found that mentors felt that the general ASD knowledge they gained as part of their training had been essential to their role. The mentors described how their overall experience had been positive and reported that the training and support provided to them was pivotal to their ability to succeed in as peer mentors to students with ASD. This study provides feedback in support of specialist peer-mentoring programs for university students and can inform recommendations for future programs and research."
https://openalex.org/W2327676737,"In daylight, the input to the retinal circuit is provided primarily by cone photoreceptors acting as band-pass filters, but the retinal output also contains neuronal populations transmitting sustained signals. Using in vivo imaging of genetically encoded calcium reporters, we investigated the circuits that generate these sustained channels within the inner retina of zebrafish. In OFF bipolar cells, sustained transmission was found to depend on crossover inhibition from the ON pathway through GABAergic amacrine cells. In ON bipolar cells, the amplitude of low-frequency signals was regulated by glycinergic amacrine cells, while GABAergic inhibition regulated the gain of band-pass signals. We also provide the first functional description of a subset of sustained ON bipolar cells in which synaptic activity was suppressed by fluctuations at frequencies above ∼0.2 Hz. These results map out the basic circuitry by which the inner retina generates sustained visual signals and describes a new function of crossover inhibition."

To extend the understanding on the genetic basis of kernel size traits (i.e., kernel length, kernel width and kernel thickness), we developed a set of four-way cross mapping population derived from four maize inbred lines with varied kernel sizes. In the present study, we investigated the genetic basis of natural variation in seed size and other components of maize yield (e.g., hundred kernel weight, number of rows per ear, number of kernels per row). In total, ten QTL affecting kernel size were identified, three of which (two for kernel length and one for kernel width) had stable expression in other components of maize yield. The possible genetic mechanism behind the trade-off of kernel size and yield components was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2321764034,"Specific proteins are modified by ubiquitin at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are degraded by the proteasome, a process referred to as ER-associated protein degradation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two principal ER-associated protein degradation ubiquitin ligases (E3s) reside in the ER membrane, Doa10 and Hrd1. The membrane-embedded Doa10 functions in the degradation of substrates in the ER membrane, nuclear envelope, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm. How most E3 ligases, including Doa10, recognize their protein substrates remains poorly understood. Here we describe a previously unappreciated but highly conserved C-terminal element (CTE) in Doa10; this cytosolically disposed 16-residue motif follows the final transmembrane helix. A conserved CTE asparagine residue is required for ubiquitylation and degradation of a subset of Doa10 substrates. Such selectivity suggests that the Doa10 CTE is involved in substrate discrimination and not general ligase function. Functional conservation of the CTE was investigated in the human ortholog of Doa10, MARCH6 (TEB4), by analyzing MARCH6 autoregulation of its own degradation. Mutation of the conserved Asn residue (N890A) in the MARCH6 CTE stabilized the normally short lived enzyme to the same degree as a catalytically inactivating mutation (C9A). We also report the localization of endogenous MARCH6 to the ER using epitope tagging of the genomic MARCH6 locus by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated genome editing. These localization and CTE analyses support the inference that MARCH6 and Doa10 are functionally similar. Moreover, our results with the yeast enzyme suggest that the CTE is involved in the recognition and/or ubiquitylation of specific protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2336169204,"Protein-glycan recognition is often mediated by multivalent binding. These multivalent bindings can be further complicated by cooperative interactions between glycans and individual glycan binding subunits. Here we have demonstrated a nanocube-based lipid bilayer array capable of quantitatively elucidating binding dissociation constants, maximum binding capacity, and binding cooperativity in a high-throughput format. Taking cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) as a model cooperativity system, we studied both GM1 and GM1-like gangliosides binding to CTB. We confirmed the previously observed CTB-GM1 positive cooperativity. Surprisingly, we demonstrated fucosyl-GM1 has approximately 7 times higher CTB binding capacity than GM1. In order to explain this phenomenon, we hypothesized that the reduced binding cooperativity of fucosyl-GM1 caused the increased binding capacity. This was unintuitive, as GM1 exhibited higher binding avidity (16 times lower dissociation constant). We confirmed the hypothesis using a theoretical stepwise binding model of CTB. Moreover, by taking a mixture of fucosyl-GM1 and GM2, we observed the mild binding avidity fucosyl-GM1 activated GM2 receptors enhancing the binding capacity of the lipid bilayer surface. This was unexpected as GM2 receptors have negligible binding avidity in pure GM2 bilayers. These unexpected discoveries demonstrate the importance of binding cooperativity in multivalent binding mechanisms. Thus, quantitative analysis of multivalent protein-glycan interactions in heterogeneous glycan systems is of critical importance. Our user-friendly, robust, and high-throughput nanocube-based lipid bilayer array offers an attractive method for dissecting these complex mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2338528983,"Background The aim of this study was to examine environmental factors associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Yunnan Province, a southwestern highland region of China. Methods In this nested case-control study, newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis (UC) cases in 2 cities in Yunnan Province and Crohn’s disease (CD) cases in 16 cities in Yunnan Province were recruited between 2008 and 2013. Controls were matched by geography, sex and age at a ratio of 1:4. Data were collected using the designed questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs). Results A total of 678 UC and 102 CD cases were recruited. For UC, various factors were associated with an increased risk of developing UC: dietary habits, including frequent irregular meal times; consumption of fried foods, salty foods and frozen dinners; childhood factors, including intestinal infectious diseases and frequent use of antibiotics; and other factors, such as mental labor, high work stress, use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and allergies (OR > 1, p < 0.05). Other factors showed a protective effect: such as consumption of fruits, current smoking, physical activity, and drinking tea (OR < 1, p < 0.05). For CD, appendectomy and irregular meal times increased the disease risk (OR >1, p < 0.05), whereas physical activity may have reduced this risk (OR < 1, p < 0.05). Conclusions This study is the first nested case-control study to analyze the association between environmental factors and IBD onset in a southwestern highland region of China. Certain dietary habits, lifestyles, allergies and childhood factors may play important roles in IBD, particularly UC."
https://openalex.org/W2430748732,"Most colon cancer cases are initiated by truncating mutations in the tumor suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). APC is a critical negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway that participates in a multi-protein “destruction complex” to target the key effector protein β-catenin for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Prior work has established that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme Tankyrase (TNKS) antagonizes destruction complex activity by promoting degradation of the scaffold protein Axin, and recent work suggests that TNKS inhibition is a promising cancer therapy. We performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen and uncovered TNKS as a putative binding partner of Drosophila APC2, suggesting that TNKS may play multiple roles in destruction complex regulation. We find that TNKS binds a C-terminal RPQPSG motif in Drosophila APC2, and that this motif is conserved in human APC2, but not human APC1. In addition, we find that APC2 can recruit TNKS into the β-catenin destruction complex, placing the APC2/TNKS interaction at the correct intracellular location to regulate β-catenin proteolysis. We further show that TNKS directly PARylates both Drosophila Axin and APC2, but that PARylation does not globally regulate APC2 protein levels as it does for Axin. Moreover, TNKS inhibition in colon cancer cells decreases β-catenin signaling, which we find cannot be explained solely through Axin stabilization. Instead, our findings suggest that TNKS regulates destruction complex activity at the level of both Axin and APC2, providing further mechanistic insight into TNKS inhibition as a potential Wnt pathway cancer therapy.

We find that TNKS binds a C-terminal RPQPSG motif in Drosophila APC2, and that this motif is conserved in human APC2, but not human APC1. In addition, we find that APC2 can recruit TNKS into the β-catenin destruction complex, placing the APC2/TNKS interaction at the correct intracellular location to regulate β-catenin proteolysis. We further show that TNKS directly PARylates both Drosophila Axin and APC2, but that PARylation does not globally regulate APC2 protein levels as it does for Axin. Moreover, TNKS inhibition in colon cancer cells decreases β-catenin signaling, which we find cannot be explained solely through Axin stabilization. Instead, our findings suggest that TNKS regulates destruction complex activity at the level of both Axin and APC2, providing further mechanistic insight into TNKS inhibition as a potential Wnt pathway cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2336224917,"Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs) are now increasingly recognized as vital contributors to lupus etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential interaction of these two epigenetic factors in lupus-prone MRL-lpr mice. We recently reported dysregulated expression of miRNAs in splenocytes of MRL-lpr mice. Here, we report that a majority of the upregulated miRNAs in MRL-lpr mice is located at the genomic imprinted DLK1-Dio3 domain. Further, we show a differential magnitude of upregulation of DLK1-Dio3 miRNA cluster in purified splenic CD4+ T, CD19+ B, and splenic CD4-CD19- cells from MRL-lpr lupus mice when compared to control MRL mice. MRL-lpr splenocytes (especially CD19+ and CD4-CD19- subsets) were hypomethylated compared to cells from control, MRL mice. We further show that deliberate demethylation of splenocytes from control MRL mice, but not from MRL-lpr lupus mice, with specific DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine significantly augmented DLK1-Dio3 miRNAs expression. These findings strongly indicate that the upregulation of DLK1-Dio3 miRNAs in lupus splenic cell subsets is associated with reduced global DNA methylation levels in lupus cells. There was a differential upregulation of DLK-Dio3 miRNAs among various demethylated splenic cell subsets, which implies varied sensitivity of DLK1-Dio3 miRNA cluster in these cell subsets to DNA hypomethylation. Finally, inhibition of select DLK1-Dio3 miRNA such as miR-154, miR-379 and miR-300 with specific antagomirs significantly reduced the production of lupus-relevant IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated splenocytes from MRL-lpr mice. Our study is the first to show that DNA methylation regulates genomic imprinted DLK1-Dio3 miRNAs in autoimmune lupus, which suggests a connection of DNA methylation, miRNA and genomic imprinting in lupus pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2341871330,"Introduction Recognizing transgender individuals have a high risk of HIV acquisition, and to inform policies and programming, we conducted an HIV prevalence and risk behaviors survey among transgender individuals in Cambodia. Methods Cross-sectional survey using a respondent driven sampling method with self-administered audio-computer assisted interviews. HIV testing was performed prior to the questionnaire with results available immediately after. Eligible participants were ≥18 years, identified as male at birth and self-identified/expressed as a different gender, and reported having sex with at least one male partner in past year. From six major urban centers of Cambodia, 891 transgender individuals were recruited. Results The majority of the 891 participants self-identified as third gender or female (94.5%), were young (median age 23, IQR [20–27]), had secondary education or higher (80.5%), not married (89.7%), and employed (90.2%). The majority had first sex before 18 years (66.8%), with a male (79.9%), 37.9% having been paid or paying for this first sex. The rate of HIV positivity among participants was found to be 4.15%. Consistent condom use with male and female partners was low with all partner types, but particularly low with male partners when paying for sex (20.3%). The majority of participants reported having experienced discrimination in their lifetime (54.8%) and 30.3% had been assaulted. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (adjusted OR = 14.73 [4.20, 51.67] for age 35–44 and adjusted OR = 7.63 [2.55, 22.81] for age 30–34), only having a primary school education or no schooling at all (adjusted OR = 2.62 [1.18, 5.80], being a resident of Siem Reap (adjusted OR = 7.44 [2.37,23.29], receiving payment at first sex (adjusted OR = 2.26 [1.00, 5.11], having sex during/after using drugs (adjusted OR = 2.90 [1.09,7.73]), inconsistent condom use during last anal sex (adjusted OR = 3.84 [1.58, 9.33]), and reporting low self-esteem (adjusted OR = 3.25 [1.35,7.85]) were independently associated with HIV infection. Conclusions This study confirms transgender individuals as one of the highest-risk groups for HIV infection in Cambodia. It suggests the need for programmatic strategies that mitigate identified associated risks and facilitate access to HIV care for this population."
https://openalex.org/W2338099077,"Plants in the Meliaceae family are known to possess interesting biological activities, such as antimalaral, antihypertensive and antitumour activities. Previously, our group reported the plant-derived compound cycloart-24-ene-26-ol-3-one isolated from the hexane extracts of Aglaia exima leaves, which shows cytotoxicity towards various cancer cell lines, in particular, colon cancer cell lines. In this report, we further demonstrate that cycloart-24-ene-26-ol-3-one, from here forth known as cycloartane, reduces the viability of the colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and CaCO-2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further elucidation of the compound’s mechanism showed that it binds to tumour necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-R1) leading to the initiation of caspase-8 and, through the activation of Bid, in the activation of caspase-9. This activity causes a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the release of cytochrome-C. The activation of caspase-8 and -9 both act to commit the cancer cells to apoptosis through downstream caspase-3/7 activation, PARP cleavage and the lack of NFkB translocation into the nucleus. A molecular docking study showed that the cycloartane binds to the receptor through a hydrophobic interaction with cysteine-96 and hydrogen bonds with lysine-75 and -132. The results show that further development of the cycloartane as an anti-cancer drug is worthwhile."

Routine identification and documentation of dyspnea is the first step to improved symptom management and it may also identify patients at risk of negative clinical outcomes.To estimate the prevalence of dyspnea and of dyspnea-associated risk among hospitalized patients.Two pilot prospective cohort studies.Single academic medical center.Consecutive patients admitted to four inpatient units: cardiology, hematology/oncology, medicine, and bariatric surgery.In Study 1, nurses documented current and recent patient-reported dyspnea at the time of the Initial Patient Assessment in 581 inpatients. In Study 2, nurses documented current dyspnea at least once every nursing shift in 367 patients. We describe the prevalence of burdensome dyspnea, and compare it to pain. We also compared dyspnea ratings with a composite of adverse outcomes: 1) receipt of care from the hospital's rapid response system, 2) transfer to the intensive care unit, or 3) death in hospital. We defined burdensome dyspnea as a rating of 4 or more on a 10-point scale.Prevalence of burdensome current dyspnea upon admission (Study 1) was 13% (77 of 581, 95% CI 11%-16%). Prevalence of burdensome dyspnea at some time during the hospitalization (Study 2) was 16% (57 of 367, 95% CI 12%-20%). Dyspnea was associated with higher odds of a negative outcome.In two pilot studies, we identified a significant symptom burden of dyspnea in hospitalized patients. Patients reporting dyspnea may benefit from a more careful focus on symptom management and may represent a population at greater risk for negative outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2326837425,"HLJ1 (DNAJB4), a DNAJ/Hsp40 chaperone, has emerged as a novel prognostic marker in lung cancers; however, the molecular contribution and functionality in neoplastic diseases remain to be established. This study demonstrated that HLJ1 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro and reduces lung cancer metastasis in vivo. Using shRNA silencing and ectopic expression of HLJ1, we found that HLJ1 not only suppresses catalytic activity of Src but also downregulates the formation of oncogenic complexes associated with the EGFR, FAK and STAT3 signaling pathways. A screen of specimens from HLJ1-knockout mice and lung cancer patients validated that HLJ1 expression is inversely correlated with Src activity. Mechanistically, HLJ1 protein directly bound to catalytic and protein-binding domains of Src through its amino acid Y172 and the P301/P304 motif. Following Src-induced HLJ1 phosphorylation at Y172, HLJ1-Src interaction was elevated, resulting in Src inhibition and malignancy suppression. Interestingly, both Src-binding regions also occurred in other DNAJB family members and contributed to anti-invasive activities of DNAJB proteins. We conclude that HLJ1 is an endogenous Src inhibitor that can suppress cancer metastasis through complex interacting mechanisms. This HLJ1-Src complex might provide a promising molecular model for developing new anticancer strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2320178525,"The human transcription factor DNA replication-related element-binding factor (hDREF) is essential for the transcription of a number of housekeeping genes. The mechanisms underlying constitutively active transcription by hDREF were unclear. Here, we provide evidence that hDREF possesses small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase activity and can specifically SUMOylate Mi2α, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase in the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining and biochemical analyses showed that coexpression of hDREF and SUMO-1 resulted in dissociation of Mi2α from chromatin, whereas a SUMOylation-defective Mi2α mutant remained tightly bound to chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Mi2α expression diminished transcription of the ribosomal protein genes, which are positively regulated by hDREF. In contrast, coexpression of hDREF and SUMO-1 suppressed the transcriptional repression by Mi2α. These data indicate that hDREF might incite transcriptional activation by SUMOylating Mi2α, resulting in the dissociation of Mi2α from the gene loci. We propose a novel mechanism for maintaining constitutively active states of a number of hDREF target genes through SUMOylation."
https://openalex.org/W2337458333,"We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective nPEP (non-Occupational Post Exposure Prophylaxis) registry based on patients consulting at one academic Emergency department located in Brussels, Belgium. We review here 1,357 cases consulting from January 2011 to December 2013.The objective of the study is to determine whether emergency physicians prescribe nPEP according to national guideline with support from IDS (infectious disease specialists). As this intervention has a high cost we wanted to verify correct allocation of treatment to high risk patients. Moreover we wanted to determine whether compliance to nPEP when prescribed by an Emergency Physician was different from literature reports. Finally we wanted to describe the population consulting for nPEP at our center. Emergency physicians prescribed nPEP more frequently in high risk exposures (98.6%) compared to intermediate risk exposures (53.2%); adequately allocating resources from a public health perspective. Appropriateness of prescription when evaluated according to nPEP Belgian guidelines was 98.8%.Compliance with nPEP prescribed by Emergency physicians was 60% in our study. Compliance was the highest in MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) while sexual assault victims showed the lowest compliance. Altogether this study suggests that Emergency physicians can safely and adequately prescribe nPEP when supported by a comprehensive guideline. Recognizing intrinsic differences within heterogeneous populations consulting for nPEP may improve compliance to this high-cost public health intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2333448764,"Cholesterol homeostasis is mediated by Scap, a polytopic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that transports sterol regulatory element-binding proteins from the ER to Golgi, where they are processed to forms that activate cholesterol synthesis. Scap has eight transmembrane helices and two large luminal loops, designated Loop1 and Loop7. We earlier provided indirect evidence that Loop1 binds to Loop7, allowing Scap to bind COPII proteins for transport in coated vesicles. When ER cholesterol rises, it binds to Loop1. We hypothesized that this causes dissociation from Loop7, abrogating COPII binding. Here we demonstrate direct binding of the two loops when expressed as isolated fragments or as a fusion protein. Expressed alone, Loop1 remained intracellular and membrane-bound. When Loop7 was co-expressed, it bound to Loop1, and the soluble complex was secreted. A Loop1-Loop7 fusion protein was also secreted, and the two loops remained bound when the linker between them was cleaved by a protease. Point mutations that disrupt the Loop1-Loop7 interaction prevented secretion of the Loop1-Loop7 fusion protein. These data provide direct documentation of intramolecular Loop1-Loop7 binding, a central event in cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2333768389,"Mdm2, the principal negative regulator of p53, is critical for survival, a fact clearly demonstrated by the p53-dependent death of germline or conditional mice following deletion of Mdm2. On the other hand, Mdm2 hypomorphic (Mdm2Puro/Δ7−12) or heterozygous (Mdm2+/−) mice that express either 30 or 50% of normal Mdm2 levels, respectively, are viable but present distinct phenotypes because of increased p53 activity. Mdm2 levels are also transcriptionally regulated by p53. We evaluated the significance of this reciprocal relationship in a new hypomorphic mouse model inheriting an aberrant Mdm2 allele with insertion of the neomycin cassette and deletion of 184-bp sequence in intron 3. These mice also carry mutations in the Mdm2 P2-promoter and thus express suboptimal levels of Mdm2 entirely encoded from the P1-promoter. Resulting mice exhibit abnormalities in skin pigmentation and reproductive tissue architecture, and are subfertile. Notably, all these phenotypes are rescued on a p53-null background. Furthermore, these phenotypes depend on distinct p53 downstream activities as genetic ablation of the pro-apoptotic gene Puma reverts the reproductive abnormalities but not skin hyperpigmentation, whereas deletion of cell cycle arrest gene p21 does not rescue either phenotype. Moreover, p53-mediated upregulation of Kitl influences skin pigmentation. Altogether, these data emphasize tissue-specific p53 activities that regulate cell fate."

https://openalex.org/W2338200499,"Background Ferritin is associated with various cardiometabolic risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance in adults. We aimed to study the association between serum ferritin levels and dyslipidemia in adolescents, because dyslipidemia is considered an important modifiable cardiovascular risk factor in the young. Methods We analyzed 1,879 subjects (1,026 boys and 853 girls) from the 2009–2010 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV. Subjects were categorized into quartiles according to their lipid parameters, which were classified according to age and gender. Those in the highest quartile groups for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride concentrations were diagnosed as having dyslipidemia. Those in the lowest quartile for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) values were diagnosed with abnormal levels. Results In boys, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly correlated with serum ferritin levels. In both boys and girls, serum ferritin levels were negatively associated with HDL-C values, even after adjusting for all covariates. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between serum ferritin levels and total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride concentrations in girls. Conclusion Serum ferritin levels were significantly associated with major dyslipidemia parameters, more prominently in boys than in girls, and this association represents a cardiometabolic risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2340449812,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset, progressive, motor neuron degenerative disease. Recent evidence indicates that inflammation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. Previously, abnormal levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were described in ALS patients and/or in mouse ALS models. In addition, one study showed that blocking IL-1β could slow down progression of ALS-like symptoms in mice. In this study, we examined a role for IL-6 in ALS, using an animal model for familial ALS.Mice with mutant SOD1 (G93A) transgene, a model for familial ALS, were used in this study. The expression of the major inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, in spinal cords of these SOD1 transgenic (TG) mice were assessed by real time PCR. Mice were then crossed with IL-6(-/-) mice to generate SOD1TG/IL-6(-/-) mice. SOD1 TG/IL-6(-/-) mice (n = 17) were compared with SOD1 TG/IL-6(+/-) mice (n = 18), SOD1 TG/IL-6(+/+) mice (n = 11), WT mice (n = 15), IL-6(+/-) mice (n = 5) and IL-6(-/-) mice (n = 8), with respect to neurological disease severity score, body weight and the survival. We also histologically compared the motor neuron loss in lumber spinal cords and the atrophy of hamstring muscles between these mouse groups.Levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in spinal cords of SOD1 TG mice was increased compared to WT mice. However, SOD1 TG/IL-6(-/-) mice exhibited weight loss, deterioration in motor function and shortened lifespan (167.55 ± 11.52 days), similarly to SOD1 TG /IL-6(+/+) mice (164.31±12.16 days). Motor neuron numbers and IL-1β and TNF-α levels in spinal cords were not significantly different in SOD1 TG /IL-6(-/-) mice and SOD1 TG /IL-6 (+/+) mice.These results provide compelling preclinical evidence indicating that IL-6 does not directly contribute to motor neuron disease caused by SOD1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2317190906,"Centrioles are critical for many cellular processes including cell division and cilia assembly. The number of centrioles within a cell is under strict control, and deregulation of centriole copy number is a hallmark of cancer. The molecular mechanisms that halt centriole amplification have not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that centrosomal protein of 76 kDa (Cep76), previously shown to restrain centriole amplification, interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and is a bona fide substrate of this kinase. Cep76 is preferentially phosphorylated by cyclin A/CDK2 at a single site S83, and this event is crucial to suppress centriole amplification in S phase. A novel Cep76 mutation S83C identified in a cancer patient fails to prevent centriole amplification. Mechanistically, Cep76 phosphorylation inhibits activation of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), thereby blocking premature centriole disengagement and subsequent amplification. Cep76 can also be acetylated, and enforced acetylation at K279 dampens the protein’s ability to inhibit amplification and precludes S83 phosphorylation. Acetylation of Cep76 normally occurs in G2 phase and correlates with loss of protein function. Our data suggest that temporal changes in post-translational modifications of Cep76 during the cell cycle regulate its capacity to suppress centriole amplification, and its deregulation may contribute to malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2336280020,"The mechanisms behind weight gain following deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery seem to be multifactorial and suspected depending on the target, either the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Decreased energy expenditure following motor improvement and behavioral and/or metabolic changes are possible explanations. Focusing on GPi target, our objective was to analyze correlations between changes in brain metabolism (measured with PET) and weight gain following GPi-DBS in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Body mass index was calculated and brain activity prospectively measured using 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose PET four months before and four months after the start of GPi-DBS in 19 PD patients. Dopaminergic medication was included in the analysis to control for its possible influence on brain metabolism. Body mass index increased significantly by 0.66 ± 1.3 kg/m2 (p = 0.040). There were correlations between weight gain and changes in brain metabolism in premotor areas, including the left and right superior gyri (Brodmann area, BA 6), left superior gyrus (BA 8), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right middle gyrus, BAs 9 and 46), and the left and right somatosensory association cortices (BA 7). However, we found no correlation between weight gain and metabolic changes in limbic and associative areas. Additionally, there was a trend toward a correlation between reduced dyskinesia and weight gain (r = 0.428, p = 0.067). These findings suggest that, unlike STN-DBS, motor improvement is the major contributing factor for weight gain following GPi-DBS PD, confirming the motor selectivity of this target."
https://openalex.org/W2340553645,"The ancestor of tomato underwent whole genome triplication ca. 71 Myr ago followed by widespread gene loss. However, few of the triplicated genes are retained in modern day tomato including lycopene beta cyclase that mediates conversion of lycopene to β-carotene. The fruit specific β-carotene formation is mediated by a chromoplast-specific paralog of lycopene beta cyclase (CYC-B) gene. Presently limited information is available about how the variations in CYC-B gene contributed to its neofunctionalization. CYC-B gene in tomato clade contained several SNPs and In-Dels in the coding sequence (33 haplotypes) and promoter region (44 haplotypes). The CYC-B gene coding sequence in tomato appeared to undergo purifying selection. The transit peptide sequence of CYC-B protein was predicted to have a stronger plastid targeting signal than its chloroplast specific paralog indicating a possible neofunctionalization. In promoter of two Bog (Beta old gold) mutants, a NUPT (nuclear plastid) DNA fragment of 256 bp, likely derived from a S. chilense accession, was present. In transient expression assay, this promoter was more efficient than the “Beta type” promoter. CARGATCONSENSUS box sequences are required for the binding of the MADS-box regulatory protein RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). The loss of CARGATCONSENSUS box sequence from CYC-B promoter in tomato may be related to attenuation of its efficiency to promote higher accumulation of β-carotene than lycopene during fruit ripening."
https://openalex.org/W2317320039,"Id1 is a helix-loop-helix transcriptional modulator that increases the aggressiveness of malignant glial neoplasms. Since most glioblastomas (GBMs) show increased phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) signaling, we sought to determine whether this pathway regulates Id1 expression. Higher basal Id1 expression correlates with dysregulated PI-3K signaling in multiple established GBM cell lines. Further characterization of PI-3K-dependent Id1 regulation reveals that chemical or genetic inhibition of PI-3K signaling reduces Id1 protein but not mRNA expression. Overall, PI-3K signaling appears to enhance Id1 translation with no significant effect on its stability. PI-3K signaling is known to regulate protein translation through mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which reduces its association with and inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. Interestingly, while inhibition of PI-3K and AKT lowers 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and expression of Id1 in all cases, inhibition of TORC1 with rapamycin does not consistently have a similar effect, suggesting an alternative mechanism for PI-3K-dependent regulation of Id1 translation. We now identify a potential role for the serine-threonine phosphatase PPM1G in translational regulation of Id1 protein expression. PPM1G knockdown by siRNA increase both 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and Id1 expression and PPM1G and 4E-BP1 co-associates in GBM cells. Furthermore, PPM1G is a phosphoprotein and this phosphorylation appears to be regulated by PI-3K activity. Finally, PI-3K inhibition increases PPM1G activity when assessed by an in vitro phosphatase assay. Our findings provide the first evidence that the PI-3K/AKT signaling pathway modulates PPM1G activity resulting in a shift in the balance between hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 and translational regulation of Id1 expression."

However, other E. faecium strains are opportunistic pathogens due to the acquisition of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants. To characterize E. faecium from soybean fermentation, we sequenced the genomes of 10 E. faecium strains from Korean soybean-fermented foods and analyzed their genomes by comparing them with 51 clinical and 52 non-clinical strains of different origins. Hierarchical clustering based on 13,820 orthologous genes from all E. faecium genomes showed that the 10 strains are distinguished from most of the clinical strains. Like non-clinical strains, their genomes are significantly smaller than clinical strains due to fewer accessory genes associated with antibiotic resistance, virulence, and mobile genetic elements. Moreover, we identified niche-associated gene gain and loss from the soybean strains. Thus, we conclude that soybean E. faecium strains might have evolved to have distinctive genomic features that may contribute to its ability to thrive during soybean fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W2339108594,"Background It is unknown whether Whole-Body Hypothermia (WBH) affects pulmonary function. In vitro studies, at relatively low temperatures, suggest that hypothermia may induce significant changes to the surfactant composition. The effect of WBH on surfactant kinetics in newborn infants is unknown. We studied in vivo kinetics of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in asphyxiated newborns during WBH and in normothermic controls (NTC) with no or mild asphyxia. Both groups presented no clinically apparent lung disease. Methods Twenty-seven term or near term newborns requiring mechanical ventilation were studied (GA 38.6±2.2 wks). Fifteen during WBH and twelve NTC. All infants received an intra-tracheal dose of 13C labelled DSPC and tracheal aspirate were performed. DSPC amount, DSPC half-life (HL) and pool size (PS) were calculated. Results DSPC amount in tracheal aspirates was 0.42 [0.22–0.54] and 0.36 [0.10–0.58] mg/ml in WBH and NTC respectively (p = 0.578). DSPC HL was 24.9 [15.7–52.5] and 25.3 [15.8–59.3] h (p = 0.733) and DSPC PS was 53.2 [29.4–91.6] and 40.2 [29.8–64.6] mg/kg (p = 0.598) in WBH and NTC respectively. Conclusions WBH does not alter DSPC HL and PS in newborn infants with no clinical apparent lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2340233474,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) researchers have struggled for decades to draw a causal link between extracellular Aβ aggregation and intraneuronal accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that Aβ deposition promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, tangle formation, cell loss, vascular damage, and dementia. While the genetics of familial AD and the pathological staging of sporadic disease support this sequence of events, attempts to examine the molecular mechanism in transgenic animal models have largely relied on models of other inherited tauopathies as the basis for testing the interaction with Aβ. In an effort to more accurately model the relationship between Aβ and wild-type tau in AD, we intercrossed mice that overproduce human Aβ with a tau substitution model in which all 6 isoforms of the human protein are expressed in animals lacking murine tau. We selected an amyloid model in which pathology was biased towards the entorhinal region so that we could further examine whether the anticipated changes in tau phosphorylation occurred at the site of Aβ deposition or in synaptically connected regions. We found that Aβ and tau had independent effects on locomotion, learning, and memory, but found no behavioral evidence for an interaction between the two transgenes. Moreover, we saw no indication of amyloid-induced changes in the phosphorylation or aggregation of human tau either within the entorhinal area or elsewhere. These findings suggest that robust amyloid pathology within the medial temporal lobe has little effect on the metabolism of wild type human tau in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2338947058,"Development of a subunit vaccine targeting liver-stage Plasmodium parasites requires the identification of antigens capable of inducing protective T cell responses. However, traditional methods of antigen identification are incapable of evaluating T cell responses against large numbers of proteins expressed by these parasites. This bottleneck has limited development of subunit vaccines against Plasmodium and other complex intracellular pathogens. To address this bottleneck, we are developing a synthetic minigene technology for multi-antigen DNA vaccines. In an initial test of this approach, pools of long (150 bp) antigen-encoding oligonucleotides were synthesized and recombined into vectors by ligation-independent cloning to produce two DNA minigene library vaccines. Each vaccine encoded peptides derived from 36 (vaccine 1) and 53 (vaccine 2) secreted or transmembrane pre-erythrocytic P. yoelii proteins. BALB/cj mice were vaccinated three times with a single vaccine by biolistic particle delivery (gene gun) and screened for interferon-γ-producing T cell responses by ELISPOT. Library vaccination induced responses against four novel antigens. Naïve mice exposed to radiation-attenuated sporozoites mounted a response against only one of the four novel targets (PyMDH, malate dehydrogenase). The response to PyMDH could not be recalled by additional homologous sporozoite immunizations but could be partially recalled by heterologous cross-species sporozoite exposure. Vaccination against the dominant PyMDH epitope by DNA priming and recombinant Listeria boosting did not protect against sporozoite challenge. Improvements in library design and delivery, combined with methods promoting an increase in screening sensitivity, may enable complex minigene screening to serve as a high-throughput system for discovery of novel T cell antigens."

Hamster pial microcirculation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy through an open cranial window. Pial arterioles were classified according to Strahler's method.In age-matched control diet-fed hamsters, BCCAO caused a decrease in diameter of all arterioles. At the end of reperfusion, the reduction of diameter in order 3 arterioles was by 8.4 ± 3.1%, 10.8 ± 2.3% and 12.1 ± 1.1% of baseline in the 2, 4 and 6 month control diet-fed hamsters, respectively. Microvascular permeability and leukocyte adhesion were markedly enhanced, while perfused capillary length (PCL) decreased. The response to acetylcholine and papaverine topical application was impaired; 2'-7'-dichlorofluoresceine-diacetate assay demonstrated a significant ROS production. At the end of BCCAO, in age-matched Vaccinium myrtillussupplemented diet-fed hamsters, the arteriolar diameter did not significantly change compared to baseline. After 60 min reperfusion, order 3 arterioles dilated by 9.3 ± 2.4%, 10.6 ± 3.1% and 11.8 ± 2.7% of baseline in the 2, 4 and 6 month Vaccinium myrtillus supplemented diet-fed hamsters, respectively. Microvascular leakage and leukocyte adhesion were significantly reduced in all groups according to the time-dependent treatment, when compared with the age-matched control diet-fed hamsters. Similarly, the reduction in PCL was progressively prevented. Finally, the response to acetylcholine and papaverine topical application was preserved and there was no significant increase in ROS production in all groups.In conclusion, Vaccinium myrtillusextract protected pial microcirculation during hypoperfusion-reperfusion, preventing vasoconstriction, microvascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, reduction in PCL and preserving the endothelium function."
https://openalex.org/W2340061191,"Meningioma of the cranio-cervical junction is a rare diagnosis and demand a thorough surgical planning as radical excision of these tumors is difficult. In this context recurrence is most likely due to regrowth of residual tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical course of patients operated for craniocervical meningioma (CCM) and to investigate the histological features of these tumors and their impact on recurrence rate.All patients who were operated for CCM at our institution between 2003 and 2012 were identified. Presenting symptoms, MRI findings, surgical approaches and recurrence rate were reviewed retrospectively using medical charts. Histological features of the included tumors were studied focusing on subtypes and MIB-1 immunoreactivity and compared with MIB-1 immunoreactivity in an age and gender-matched control group of patients with supratentorial meningioma.18 patients with CCM with a mean age of 56.2 years and median follow-up of 60 months were included in the study. Sensory or motor deficit was the most frequent presenting symptom followed by neck pain and lower cranial nerve palsy. Simpson grade II resection was achieved in 16 patients and Simpson grade III resection in two patients. Mortality, morbidity and recurrence rates were 16.7%, 5.5% and 5.5%, respectively. According to the WHO-grading all were found to be grade I meningiomas. Histological subtypes included meningotheliomatous (10), transitional (2), fibrillar (2), angiomatous (3) and secretory (1) meningioma. The mean MIB-1 labeling index in the study group was significantly higher than in the control group, (7.2% and 3.6%, respectively), p < 0.05. There was no correlation between MIB-1 levels and tumor recurrence.CCM seems to have a benign character. Despite a significantly higher MIB-1 index, a high rate of recurrence was not observed. Therefore, approaches with high morbidity are not justified. Nevertheless, in view of the challenging approaches with limited access to the lesion, CCM should be considered a distinctive clinical subgroup."
