https://openalex.org/W2015331233,Preliminary trials of 17alpha-ethinyl-19-nortestosterone (norethynodrel) 17alpha-ethinyl-5(10)-estraeneolone (norethisterone) and 17alpha-ethyl-19-nortestosterone in 50 infertile women are described. Patients were 22-39 years old (mean 29) ovulating and menstruating regularly but infertile for 1.5-6 years. They took 5-50 mg of one of the progestagens from Cycle Days 5-25 for a total of 112 cycles. Cycle length endometrial biopsies basal temperature vaginal smears and pregnanediol excretion were monitored. In only 2 cycles with norethisterone were any 2 of these criteria suggestive of ovulation but pregnediol remained .1 mg/day (an ovulatory range). In most respects norethynodrel and norethisterone had identical effects; fo r example endometria showed stimulated stromal but retarded glandular development and exhibited menstruallike bleeding between cycles. Ethyl-19-nortestosterone however permitted only breakthrough bleeding in 8 of 16 women. All 3 compounds inhibited ovulation in doses above 10 mg daily. 7 (15%) women conceived within 5 months after the trial including 5 who had been infertile for 3-6 years.

https://openalex.org/W1977279074,The effects of certain 19-norsteroids on reproductive processes in mammals are presented. 17alpha-ethinyl-19-nortestosterone 17alpha-ethinyl-5(10)estraeneolone 17alpha-ethyl-19-nortestosterone 17alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone and progesterone were studied using the Clauberg assay in rabbits the Rubin assay in mice the deciduomagenic activity in rats the conception-inhibiting activity in rats and in the ability to induce and sustain implantation of fertilized ovum in female rabbits castrated 1 day after a fertile mating. These studies reveal a group of substances which by reason of certain similarities to progesterone may be classified as progestins. 17alpha-ethyl-19-nortestosterone appears to have typical progesteronelike activity in all of the tests but it is quantitatively more active than progesterone in the Clauberg assay and in deciduomagenic activity and less active in the others. Normal reproductive processes such as ovulation may be inhibited or stimulated such as endometrial proliferation with these compounds.

I have tried to indicate how the integrity of particles, purity of fractions, and the existence of new particles can be established through its use. I have also suggested the desirability of a common terminology for all cytology -classic, electron-microscopic, and biochemical. Some have expressed the opinion that neutral terms such as alpha, beta, and gamma membranes (59) are more useful than ergastoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and so forth. As helpful as such neutral terms may be in describing intracellular structures, they do not appear to me to substitute for historically rooted cytological names. Note added in proof: Since this article went to press there has appeared an important article by G. E. Palade and P. Siekevitz (60). These authors consider that the vesicles without granules found in the microsome fraction were ""probably derived from the smooth surfaced parts of the endoplasmic reticulum."" The latter were found to be continuous with the granule-studded membranes; ""the two varieties of profiles represent local differentiation within a common system."" The authors confirm the finding of Rouiller (18) and Novikoff et al. (7) of the dense bodies adjacent to the bile canaliculi and describe their presence in the microsome fraction as a ""minor component."""
