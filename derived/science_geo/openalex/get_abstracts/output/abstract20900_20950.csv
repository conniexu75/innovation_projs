https://openalex.org/W2015219342,"Approximately 30 to 40 percent of atherosclerotic coronary arteries treated by angioplasty or by bypass surgery occlude as a result of restenosis. This restenosis is due principally to the accumulation of neointimal smooth muscle cells, which is also a prominent feature of the advanced lesions of atherosclerosis. The factors responsible for the accumulation of intimal smooth muscle cells have not been identified. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent smooth muscle chemoattractant and mitogen. It is present in platelets and can be formed by endothelium, smooth muscle, and monocyte-derived macrophages. The development of an intimal lesion in the carotid artery of athymic nude rats induced by intraarterial balloon catheter deendothelialization was inhibited by a polyclonal antibody to PDGF. These data demonstrate that endogenous PDGF is involved in the accumulation of neointimal smooth muscle cells associated with balloon injury and may be involved in restenosis after angioplasty, and perhaps in atherogenesis as well."
https://openalex.org/W1966156883,"A sequence within the transcription control region of the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter has been shown to mediate transcriptional activation by the adenovirus E1A protein. We report here that this same element mediates transcriptional repression in the absence of E1A. Two cellular proteins have been found to bind to overlapping regions within this sequence element. One of these proteins, YY1, is responsible for the repression. E1A relieves repression exerted by YY1 and further activates transcription through its binding site. A YY1-specific cDNA has been isolated. Its sequence reveals YY1 to be a zinc finger protein that belongs to the GLI-Kr√ºppel gene family. The product of the cDNA binds to YY1 sites. When fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, it is capable of repressing transcription directed by a promoter that contains GAL4-binding sites, and E1A proteins can relieve the repression and activate transcription through the fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2039508988,"Denys-Drash syndrome is a rare human condition in which severe urogenital aberrations result in renal failure, pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma). To investigate its possible role, we have analyzed the coding exons of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) for germline mutations. In ten independent cases of Denys-Drash syndrome, point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one WT1 gene copy were found. Nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 (zinc finger III); the remaining mutation is in exon 8 (zinc finger II). These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition. In two families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. Wilms' tumors from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell tumor demonstrate reduction to homozygosity for the mutated WT1 allele. Our results provide evidence of a direct role for WT1 in Denys-Drash syndrome and thus urogenital system development."
https://openalex.org/W2093285783,"The stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) is a well-characterized model for primary hypertension in humans. High blood pressure in SHRSP shows polygenic inheritance, but none of the loci responsible have previously been identified. To locate genes controlling this quantitative trait, we mapped a large collection of DNA polymorphisms in a cross between SHRSP and the normotensive WKY strain. Here we report strong genetic evidence that a gene, Bp1, having a major effect on blood pressure maps to rat chromosome 10 with a LOD score of 5.10 and is closely linked to the rat gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that plays a major role in blood pressure homeostasis and is an important target of anti-hypertensive drugs. We also find significant, albeit weaker, linkage to a locus, Bp2, on chromosome 18. We discuss the implications of genetic dissection of quantitative disease-related phenotypes in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2053432671,"The RB gene product is a nuclear phosphoprotein that undergoes cell cycle-dependent changes in its phosphorylation status. To test whether RB regulates cell cycle progression, purified RB proteins, either full-length or a truncated form containing the T antigen-binding region, were injected into cells. Injection of either protein early in G1 inhibits progression into S phase. Co-injection of anti-RB antibodies antagonizes this effect. Injection of RB into cells arrested at G1/S or late in G1 has no effect on BrdU incorporation, suggesting that RB does not inhibit DNA synthesis in S phase. These results indicate that RB regulates cell proliferation by restricting cell cycle progression at a specific point in G1 and establish a biological assay for RB activity. Neither co-injection of RB with a T antigen peptide nor injection into cells expressing T antigen prevents cells from progressing into S phase, which supports the hypothesis that T antigen binding has functional consequences for RB."
https://openalex.org/W2044145281,"Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that the cdc25 protein controls the entry into mitosis by triggering tyrosine dephosphorylation of the cdc2 protein kinase. We show that the isolated cdc25 protein can catalyze dephosphorylation of several model phosphatase substrates, including p-nitrophenyl phosphate and two distinct tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. The cdc25-dependent cleavage reaction closely resembles dephosphorylation by known tyrosine phosphatases: the reaction requires a reducing agent, shows high sensitivity to sodium vanadate, and proceeds efficiently in the presence of metal chelators. Moreover, the phosphatase activity of the cdc25 protein is eliminated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide or by alteration of a single conserved cysteine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. These observations indicate that the cdc25 protein can function as a tyrosine phosphatase in the absence of any other protein."
https://openalex.org/W2035869111,A neuronal antigen (HuD) recognized by the sera of patients with antibody-associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis has been isolated by screening a lambda cerebellar expression library. The recombinant antigen provides an unambiguous assay for this rare condition associated with small cell lung cancer. The recombinant antigen has been used to identify specific infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors and affected brain tissues of patients with antibody-associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and sensory neuronopathy. HuD mRNA is uniquely expressed in brain tissue. The HuD protein shows a remarkable homology to the Drosophila proteins Elav and Sex-lethal and is likely to play a role in neuron-specific RNA processing.
https://openalex.org/W2014569682,"The wt1 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at the Wilms tumor (WT) locus on chromosome 11p13, encodes a zinc finger-containing protein that binds to the same DNA sequence as EGR-1, a mitogen-inducible immediate-early gene product that activates transcription. The transcriptional regulatory potential of WT1 has not been demonstrated. In transient transfection assays, the WT1 protein functioned as a repressor of transcription when bound to the EGR-1 site. The repression function was mapped to the glutamine- and proline-rich NH2-terminus of WT1; fusion of this domain to the zinc finger region of EGR-1 converted EGR-1 into a transcriptional repressor."

https://openalex.org/W1553375567,"A recombinant protein-tyrosine-phosphatase has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to a single band by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using affinity chromatography. When the phosphatase was allowed to react with 32P-labeled substrates and then rapidly denaturated, a 32P-labeled phosphoprotein could be visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transient formation of a 32P-labeled phosphoprotein was observed, and the 32P-labeled protein disappeared as substrate was consumed. In the presence of 32P-labeled p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.27 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. Site-directed mutagenesis of a catalytically essential cystine residue (position 215) in the recombinant protein resulted in an inactive enzyme, and no phosphoprotein was formed. The 32P-labeled phosphoprotein showed a maximum lability between pH 2.5 and 3.5 and was rapidly decomposed in the presence of iodine. These properties, along with additional site-directed mutations, suggest that the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase forms a covalent thiol phosphate linkage between Cys215 and phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1970706135,"In the mammalian central nervous system, receptors for excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters such as the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-kainate receptor mediate a large fraction of excitatory transmission. Currents induced by activation of the AMPA-kainate receptor were potentiated by agents that specifically stimulate adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity or were supported by intracellular application of the catalytic subunit of PKA by itself or in combination with cAMP. Furthermore, depression of these currents by a competitive inhibitor of PKA indicates that AMPA-kainate receptors are regulated by endogenous PKA. Endogenous protein phosphatases also regulate these receptors because an inhibitor of cellular phosphates enhanced kainate currents. Modulation of PKA and phosphatases may regulate the function of these receptors and thus contribute to synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2087302056,"We have purified two major polypeptides of 54 and 56 kd from bovine erythrocytes that specifically bind the nuclear location sequence (NLS) of the SV40 large T antigen. When added to a permeabilized cell system for nuclear import, the purified proteins increase by 2- to 3-fold the nuclear accumulation of a fluorescent protein containing the large T antigen NLS. The import stimulation is saturable and dependent upon the presence of cytosol. Nuclear protein accumulation in vitro is sensitive to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM inactivation can be overcome by addition of the purified NLS-binding proteins to the import system. NEM treatment of the purified proteins abolishes their ability to stimulate import but does not affect NLS binding. Our results indicate that the NLS-binding proteins are NEM-sensitive receptors for nuclear import. At least one other NEM-sensitive cytosolic activity and an NEM-insensitive cytosolic activity are also necessary for protein import in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2073377967,"Dystrophin-related protein (DRP) is an autosomal gene product with high homology to dystrophin. We have used highly specific antibodies to the unique C-terminal peptide sequences of DRP and dystrophin to examine the subcellular localization and biochemical properties of DRP in adult skeletal muscle. DRP is enriched in isolated sarcolemma from control and mdx mouse muscle, but is much less abundant than dystrophin. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized DRP almost exclusively to the neuromuscular junction region in rabbit and mouse skeletal muscle, as well as mdx mouse muscle and denervated mouse muscle. DRP is also present in normal size and abundance and localizes to the neuromuscular junction region in muscle from the dystrophic mouse model dy/dy. Thus, DRP is a junction-specific membrane cytoskeletal protein that may play an important role in the organization of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction."

https://openalex.org/W1986293963,"We have characterized T-cadherin, a glycoprotein of 95 kd from chick embryo brain by expression cloning and sequencing of corresponding cDNAs. The nucleotide sequence predicts a novel cadherin cell adhesion molecule in the nervous system. Surprisingly, the isolated cDNAs do not encode the cytoplasmic region conserved in other cadherin subclasses. Biochemical analysis revealed that this truncated (T) cadherin is attached to the neuronal plasma membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. T-cadherin is a component of different neuronal populations and is expressed in a temporally and spatially restricted pattern during axon growth. These results are consistent with a putative role of T-cadherin in axon growth and guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2040232267,"We have identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and characterized its function in vivo. S. cerevisiae SRP is a 16S particle that includes a homolog of the signal sequence-binding protein subunit of SRP (SRP54p) and a small cytoplasmic RNA (scR1). Surprisingly, the genes encoding scR1 and SRP54p are not essential for growth, though SRP-deficient cells grow poorly, suggesting that SRP function can be partially by-passed in vivo. Protein translocation across the ER membrane is impaired in SRP-deficient cells, indicating that yeast SRP, like its mammalian counterpart, functions in this process. Unexpectedly, the degree of the translocation defect varies for different proteins. The ability of some proteins to be efficiently targeted in SRP-deficient cells may explain why previous genetic and biochemical analyses in yeast and bacteria did not reveal components of the SRP-dependent protein targeting pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1995441615,Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex. Activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors hyperpolarizes cells and inhibits neuronal activity. Synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors also strongly excited hippocampal neurons. This excitatory response was recorded in morphologically identified interneurons in the presence of 4-aminopyridine or after elevation of extracellular potassium concentrations. The synaptic excitation sustained by GABAA receptors synchronized the activity of inhibitory interneurons. This synchronized discharge of interneurons in turn elicited large-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal and granule cells. Excitatory synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors may thus provide a mechanism for the recruitment of GABAergic interneurons through their recurrent connections.

https://openalex.org/W1606956077,"Factor VIII is a cofactor in the tenase enzyme complex which assembles on the membrane of activated platelets. A critical step in tenase assembly is membrane binding of factor VIII. Platelet membrane factor VIII-binding sites were characterized by flow cytometry using either fluorescein maleimide-labeled recombinant factor VIII or a fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibody against factor VIII. Following activation by thrombin, most platelets bound factor VIII within 90 s. In addition, over the course of several minutes, membranous vesicles (microparticles) were shed from the platelet plasma membrane and each microparticle bound as much factor VIII as a stimulated platelet. Over 30 min, stimulated platelets (but not microparticles) lost the capacity to bind factor VIII. Factor VIII bound saturably to microparticles from platelets stimulated with thrombin, thrombin plus collagen, or the complement proteins C5b-9. The binding of factor VIII was compared to factor V, a structurally homologous coagulation cofactor. Analysis of microparticle binding kinetics yielded similar on and off rates for factor VIII and factor Va and KD values of 2-10 nM. In the presence of 20 nM factor Va, the binding of factor VIII to microparticles was increased, and there was a comparable increase in platelet tenase activity. At higher factor Va concentrations, factor VIII binding and tenase activity were inhibited. Conversely, factor VIII had a similar dose-dependent effect on factor Va binding and platelet prothrombinase activity. Synthetic phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylserine competed with microparticles for binding of factor VIII and factor Va. These studies indicate that activated platelets express a transient increase in high affinity receptors for factor VIII, whereas platelet-derived microparticles express a sustained increase in receptors. The binding characteristics of platelet membrane receptors for factor VIII are similar to those for factor Va."
https://openalex.org/W2042045966,"There is strong inferential evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer of the P (mobile) element to Drosophila melanogaster from a species of the Drosophila willistoni group. One potential vector of this transfer is a semiparasitic mite, Proctolaelaps regalis DeLeon, whose morphology, behavior, and co-occurrence with Drosophila are consistent with the properties necessary for such a vector. Southern blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and DNA sequencing showed that samples of P. regalis associated with a P strain of D. melanogaster carried P element sequences. Similarly, Drosophila ribosomal DNA sequences were identified in P. regalis samples that had been associated with Drosophila cultures. These results have potentially important evolutionary implications, not only for understanding the mechanisms by which genes may be transferred between reproductively isolated species, but also for improved detection of some host-parasite and predator-prey relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2069748621,"The trk tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene product gp140prototrk binds nerve growth factor (NGF) and is rapidly and selectively activated by this neurotrophic factor. To determine whether gp140prototrk is involved in transducing a functional NGF signal, PC12 cell mutants (PC12nnr) deficient in high affinity NGF binding and unresponsive to NGF were used. Northern analysis revealed that these mutant cells have greatly reduced levels of trk expression. PC12nnr cultures were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding the full-length rat trk cDNA and assessed for responsiveness to NGF. Expression of exogenous trk rescued the capacity for NGF-promoted neurite outgrowth, cellular hypertrophy, and serum-free survival by these cells. These results indicate that gp140prototrk is necessary for functional NGF signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1582785412,"A thrombin receptor has recently been cloned and the sequence deduced. The sequence reveals a thrombin cleavage site that accounts for receptor activation. The receptor also has an acidic region with some similarities to the carboxyl-terminal region of the leech thrombin inhibitor, hirudin. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the receptor cleavage site (residues 38-45), the hirudin-like domain (residues 52-69), and the covalently associated domains (residues 38-64) were evaluated for their ability to bind to thrombin. Peptides 38-45 and 38-64 were competitive inhibitors of thrombin's chromogenic substrate activity (Ki = 0.96 mM and 0.6 microM, respectively. Residues 52-69 altered the chromogenic substrate specificity, resulting in accelerated cleavage of some substrates and inhibited cleavage of others. The same peptide binds to thrombin and alters the fluorescence emission intensity of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-thrombin in which the dansyl is attached directly to the active site serine (Kd = 32 +/- 7 microM). Residues 52-69 displace the carboxyl-terminal peptide of hirudin, indicating that they share a common binding site in the anion exosite of thrombin. These data suggest that the thrombin receptor has high affinity for thrombin due to the presence of the hirudin-like domain and that this domain alters the specificity of thrombin. This change in specificity may account for the ability of the receptor to serve as an excellent thrombin substrate despite the presence of an Asp residue in the P3 site, which is normally inhibitory to thrombin activity."
https://openalex.org/W1967618732,"Two unrelated pre-mRNA splicing regulators-suppressor-of-white-apricot (su(wa)) and transformer (tra)-contain distinctive, ‚àº120 amino acid arginine/ serine (RS)-rich domains. Deletion of the su(wa) RS domain eliminates function. Replacement with the tra RS domain restores su(wa) function to nearly wild-type levels. Replacement with a 10 amino acid simple nuclear entry signal allows partial, inefficient function. Thus, the su(wa) RS domain apparently serves a generic function(s) subsuming nuclear entry. Moreover, immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that both RS domains specifically direct localization of a fused reporter protein to a punctate subnuclear comportment shown previously to be enriched in several constitutive splicing components. We propose that RS domains are a new class of targeting signals directing concentration of proteins in a subnuclear compartment implicated in splicing metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2044229410,"T. cruzi invades mammalian cells in various organs after migrating through the ECM. These activities appear to be mediated by a unique 60 kd protein exposed on the T. cruzi surface, which promotes selective adhesion of trypomastigotes to three ECM components: heparin, heparan sulfate, and collagen. The affinity-purified protein binds to host fibroblasts in a saturable and glycosaminoglycan- and collagen-inhibitable manner. When adsorbed to plastic, it promotes adhesion and spreading of fibroblasts, as does the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. The endogenous protein, and reactive ECM proteins, are very effective in preventing T. cruzi invasion of culture cells. The recombinant protein localizes on the E. coli surface and induces the bacteria that express it to adhere to and penetrate nonphagocytic Vero cells in a proteoglycan- and collagen-inhibitable manner. Therefore, the protein, named penetrin, could play a critical role in T. cruzi binding to the ECM and to cells, and in host cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2119859693,"Cofilin is a widely distributed actin-modulating protein that has abilities to bind along the side of F-actin and to depolymerize F-actin. Both abilities of cofilin can be inhibited by phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). We have previously shown that the synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to Trp104-Met115 of cofilin is a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization (Yonezawa, N., Nishida, E., Iida, K., Kumagai, H., Yahara, I., and Sakai, H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10485-10489). In this study, we have found that the inhibitory effect of the synthetic dodecapeptide on actin polymerization is canceled specifically by phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and PIP2. We further show that the dodecapeptide as well as cofilin binds to PIP2 molecules and inhibits PIP2 hydrolysis by phospholipase C. Thus, the actin-binding dodecapeptide sequence of cofilin may constitute a multifunctional domain in cofilin."
https://openalex.org/W1603565203,"Cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP) are low molecular weight proteins whose precise function remains unknown. To investigate the role of CRABP in human skin we have cloned the human CRABP-II cDNA as well as the coding region of human CRABP-I. The predicted amino acid sequences of human CRABP-I and CRABP-II demonstrated a 99.3 and 93.5% identity to mouse CRABP-I and CRABP-II, respectively. CRABP-I transcripts were undetectable in adult human epidermis by RNA blot hybridization, while the CRABP-II cDNA probe detected an approximately 1.2-kilobase mRNA transcript. External application of 0.1% retinoic acid cream in vivo for 16 h resulted in a 16-fold induction of CRABP-II transcripts, while CRABP-I mRNA remained undetectable. Expression of CRABP-II, but not CRABP-I mRNA, was also markedly increased (greater than 15-fold) by retinoic acid treatment of fibroblasts cultured from human skin, whereas no significant induction of CRABP-II mRNA was observed in human lung fibroblasts. Human CRABP-II but not CRABP-I mRNA was significantly increased by agents which are known to induce keratinocyte differentiation in vitro. The marked inducibility of the CRABP-II gene is compatible with the idea that this isoform is important in retinoic acid-mediated regulation of human skin growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2074129189,"The existence of pseudogenes and the observation of intron loss suggest that RNA can serve as an intermediate in recombination. We used a HIS3 reporter gene to show that RNA-mediated recombination occurs in yeast. Hi+ prototroph formation required transcription and expression of the retrotransposon Ty. Two RNA-mediated recombination events were detected: homologous recombination between the cDNA and plasmid hi sequences, resulting in intron loss, and insertion of the cDNA into the chromosome in the absence of HIS3 homology. The chromosomal Hi+ prototrophs showed many hallmarks of naturally occurring pseudogenes. They integrated at novel sites in the chromosome, lacked introns, and possessed poly(A) tracts. Additionally, their 5'ends corresponded with the site of initiation of the GAL1 transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2061318624,"Wild-type S. cerevisiae cells of both mating types prefer partners producing high levels of pheromone and mate very infrequently to cells producing no pheromone. However, some mutants that are supersensitive to pheromone lack this ability to discriminate. In this study, we provide evidence for a novel role of alpha pheromone receptors in mating partner discrimination that is independent of the known G protein-mediated signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, in response to pheromone, receptors become localized to the emerging region of morphogenesis that is positioned adjacent to the nucleus, suggesting that receptor localization may be involved in mating partner discrimination. Actin, myosin 2, and clathrin heavy chain are involved in mating partner discrimination, since strains carrying mutations in the genes encoding these proteins result in a small but significant defect in mating partner discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W1995312770,"napts is a recessive mutation that affects the level of sodium channel activity and, at high temperature, causes paralysis associated with a loss of action potentials. We show, by genetic complementation tests, germline transformation, and analysis of mutations, that napts is a gain-of-function mutation of mle a gene required for X chromosome dosage compensation and male viability. Molecular analyses of nap and mle mutations indicate that mle+, nap+, and napts activities are encoded by the same open reading frame and suggest that napts is due to a single amino acid substitution. Although napts is known to act via para+, an X-linked sodium channel structural gene, its effect is not due to a simple defect in para+ dosage compensation."
https://openalex.org/W2069240478,"CD45 is a leukocyte-specific, transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) required for T cell responsiveness. How the activity of PTPases is regulated in vivo is unclear. Treatment of murine thymocytes and a variety of murine T cell lines with the calcium ionophore ionomycin decreased CD45 PTPase activity. Ionomycin treatment also led to a decreased phosphorylation of serine residues in CD45. These results indicate that increased intracellular calcium modulates CD45 PTPase activity, demonstrating regulation of CD45 PTPase activity in vivo, and also implicate serine dephosphorylation as a possible mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1550275201,"We have cloned a 4.2-kilobase pair (kb) cDNA that encodes the cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (cGS PDE) from a bovine adrenal cortex library. The 921-residue polypeptide deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence is nearly identical with the complete amino acid sequence of the cGS PDE purified from a soluble bovine heart extract. Moreover, PPD-S49 cells transfected with the cGS PDE cDNA express a soluble cAMP hydrolytic activity that is enhanced by cGMP. Total RNA isolated from several bovine tissues were screened for cGS PDE transcript by Northern blot analysis. The cGS PDE cDNA appears to hybridize to a single 4.5-4.6-kb mRNA species. Although the cGS PDE mRNA is most abundant in the adrenal cortex, it is also concentrated in the adrenal medulla and heart and in anatomically distinct regions of the brain and kidney. A mRNA species encoding a putative variant cGS PDE isoform was detected by RNase protection. Total RNA isolated from adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, liver, kidney, trachea, lung, spleen, and T-lymphocytes completely protected a 452-base riboprobe encoding 100 residues of the adrenal cortex cGS PDE amino terminus. In contrast, RNAs isolated from brain (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia) protected only 268 bases of this riboprobe. The RNase protection pattern of this same probe using heart RNA showed major bands at both 268 and 452 bases, suggesting that two different cGS PDE mRNA species are expressed. These results indicate that the cGS PDE is widely expressed in a variety of tissues. Moreover, these studies suggest that at least one different cGS PDE isoform having a structurally distinct amino-terminal domain is expressed in brain and heart."
https://openalex.org/W59225307,"The amino acid sequence of mu-conotoxin GIIIA (otherwise called geographutoxin I), a peptide having 22 amino acid residues with three disulfide bridges, was modified by replacing each residue with Ala or Lys to elucidate its active center for blocking sodium channels of skeletal muscle. NMR and CD spectra were virtually identical between native and modified toxins, indicating the similarity of their conformation including disulfide bridges. The inhibitory effect of these modified peptides on twitch contractions of the rat diaphragm showed that Arg at the 13th position and the basicity of the molecule are crucial for the biological action. The segment Lys11-Asp12-Arg13 has been reported to be flexible (Lancelin, J.-M., Kohda, D., Tate, S., Yanagawa, Y., Abe, T., Satake, M., and Inagaki, F. (1991) Biochemistry, in press), and this may represent a clue for the subtle fit of Arg13 to the specific site of sodium channels. Since known ligands to sodium channels, such as tetrodotoxin, anthopleulin-A, etc., contain guanidino groups as a putative binding moiety, Arg may be a general residue for peptide toxins to interact with the receptor site on sodium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1485292742,"The hydrolysis of triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins is mediated by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that is bound to vascular endothelial cells. The specific endothelial cell surface protein(s) with which LPL associates has not been characterized. To identify this LPL binding protein(s), radioiodinated cell surface proteins from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were chromatographed using bovine LPL-Sepharose. A single radioiodinated protein of apparent molecular mass 220 kDa was specifically retained by the gel and eluted with 0.4 M NaCl. A LPL-binding protein of similar size was obtained after metabolic labeling of the cellular proteoglycans with 35SO4, indicating that the 220-kDa protein is a proteoglycan. After heparitinase or nitrous acid treatments the molecular mass of the LPL-binding protein decreased to approximately 50 kDa, suggesting that it contains heparin sulfate chains. A 220-kDa protein from the basal cell surface was also identified using LPL-Sepharose chromatography. 125I-LPL was cross-linked to the endothelial cell surface using ethylene glycobis (succinimidylsuccinate). A single ligand-receptor complex, approximately 350 kDa, was obtained. Heparin and unlabeled LPL decreased the cross-linking of radioiodinated LPL to the cell surface receptor. To examine whether the receptor mediates the internalization of cross-linked 125I-LPL, cells containing 125I-LPL complexed to the surface were incubated at either 37 or at 4 degrees C. The amount of 125I-LPL internalized by the cells was 74% greater at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. This suggested that LPL cross-linked to the receptor was internalized in a temperature-dependent manner. Thus, a 220-kDa heparan sulfate proteoglycan functions as an endothelial cell surface receptor for LPL."
https://openalex.org/W2013716124,"The expression of mRNA encoding the TTX-sensitive (SkM1) and TTX-insensitive (SkM2) voltage-dependent sodium channels in adult skeletal muscle is independently regulated. In normal skeletal muscle, only the SkM1 message is expressed and the level varies with muscle fiber type. After surgical denervation, the steady-state SkM1 mRNA level declines transiently, but returns to control levels within 5 days. Expression of SkM2 transcripts is markedly activated, reaching a peak 3 days after axotomy and then declining to a maintained level at approximately 30% of peak. Chemical denervation with botulinum toxin results in higher levels of SkM2 mRNA, which by 7 days posttreatment are 7-fold greater than levels in paired axotomized muscles. SkM2 expression subsequently declines as functional reinnervation appears. Quantal acetylcholine release appears to play a major role in suppression of SkM2 expression in adult innervated or reinnervated muscle, whereas nonquantal factors in toxin-treated, but not axotomized, muscle may sustain high level SkM2 mRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2041458185,"We have examined the role of presynaptic residual calcium in maintaining long-term changes in synaptic efficacy observed at mossy fiber synapses between hippocampal dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells. Calcium concentrations in individual mossy fiber terminals in hippocampal slice were optically measured with the calcium indicator fura-2 while stimulating the mossy fiber pathway and recording excitatory postsynaptic potentials extracellularly. Short-term synaptic enhancement was accompanied by increased presynaptic residual calcium concentration. A 2-fold enhancement of transmitter release was accompanied by a 10-30 nM increase in residual calcium. Following induction of mossy fiber LTP, transiently elevated presynaptic calcium decayed to prestimulus levels, whereas enhancement of synaptic transmission persisted. Our results demonstrate that, despite an apparent strong sensitivity of synaptic enhancement to presynaptic residual calcium levels, sustained increases in presynaptic residual calcium levels are not responsible for the maintained synaptic enhancement observed during mossy fiber LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2017495493,"We have examined the pathological lesions and sites of infection in mice inoculated with a highly neurovirulent recombinant wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (FrCasE). The spongiform lesions appeared initially as swollen postsynaptic neuronal processes, progressing to swelling in neuronal cell bodies, all in the absence of detectable gliosis. Infection of neurons in regions of vacuolation was not detected. However, high level infection of cerebellar granule neurons was observed in the absence of cytopathology, wherein viral protein was found associated with both axons and dendrites. Infection of ramified and amoeboid microglial cells was associated with cytopathology in the brain stem, and endothelial cell-pericyte infection was found throughout the CNS. No evidence of defective retroviral expression was observed. These results are consistent with an indirect mechanism of retrovirus-induced neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W1550826397,"Human stools consist of a mixture of undigested food residues, colonic microflora, and cellular components shed from the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. The cellular components are made up mostly of terminally differentiated colonic epithelial cells. Using a combination of Percoll density gradient centrifugation and countercurrent centrifugal elutriation, it is now possible to recover these cells as an enriched fraction from fresh human stools. Cells can be visualized on heat-fixed smears of the enriched fractions stained with modified Wright's stain. The enrichment process is optimized by following the segregation of eukaryotic cells as determined by an ELISA technique using monoclonal antibodies against human double-stranded DNA. This work, demonstrating the feasibility of isolating intact colonic cells from stools, has important applications as a noninvasive approach to the biology of exfoliated cells from the gastrointestinal tract.‚ÄîIyengar, V.; Albaugh, G.

https://openalex.org/W2064249962,"Several cellular proteins form stable complexes with the proteins encoded by the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) gene in extracts derived from adenovirus infected or transformed cells. Two of the cellular proteins that bind to E1A have been identified; one, a 105-kilodalton protein (pRb), is the product of the retinoblastoma gene, and the other, a 60-kilodalton protein, is a human cyclin A. Two other proteins that bind E1A have now been shown to be related to p34cdc2. This E1A complex displayed histone H1-specific kinase activity; the kinase activity was modulated during the cell division cycle, and association of pRb with E1A apparently was not required for this activity."

https://openalex.org/W1484058837,"Interactions between the Mu A and Mu B proteins are important in the early steps of the in vitro transposition of a mini-Mu plasmid. We have examined these interactions by assaying Mu B stimulation of Mu A-mediated strand cleavage and strand transfer reactions. We have previously shown that in the presence of ATP the Mu B protein can stimulate the Mu A-directed cleavage reaction of mini-Mu plasmids carrying a terminal base pair mutation (Surette, M.G., Harkness, T., and Chaconas, G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3118-3124). Here we demonstrate that in the absence of a non-Mu DNA target molecule the Mu B protein stimulates intramolecular integration of a mini-Mu in an ATP-dependent fashion. Furthermore, modification of the Mu B protein with N-ethylmaleimide severely compromises the ability of B to form a stable complex with DNA; however, the modified protein stimulates the strand cleavage and intramolecular strand transfer reactions as efficiently as the untreated protein. These results indicate that the Mu B protein is capable of stimulating the Mu A protein through direct interaction in the absence of stable Mu B-DNA complex formation. Our results increase the spectrum of Mu B protein activities and uncouple the stimulatory properties of the Mu B protein from stable DNA binding but not the ATP cofactor requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1563167655,"Several cDNA clones encoding a 46-kDa collagen-binding glycoprotein (gp46) from rat skeletal myoblasts were isolated and sequenced. The cDNA encoded a 17-amino acid signal peptide and a 400-amino acid mature protein, containing three potential N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites. The cDNA sequence of gp46 shows 93% identity in the coding region with J6, a retinoic acid-inducible gene coding for a protein of unknown function described from embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. The first 41 NH2-terminal amino acids of the predicted J6 sequence are, however, different from the gp46 sequence as a result of a 7-base pair insertion in the gp46 cDNA. In addition, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of hsp47, a collagen-binding protein found in chick embryo fibroblasts, shows 64% identity to gp46 over 36 residues. Interestingly, this alignment begins 10 residues inward from the first amino acid in the mature form of gp46. A significant sequence similarity was observed between gp46 and members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family. Unlike other serpins, however, gp46 is both a heat shock and a collagen-binding protein and is localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, as suggested by the presence of the RDEL sequence at the COOH terminus. This sequence is similar to other proposed endoplasmic reticulum retention signals."
https://openalex.org/W1500522718,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor exist in multiple forms. PDGF exists in three dimeric combinations of A and B subunit chains, which are the products of separate genes. The PDGF receptor is similarly encoded by genes for two distinct receptor proteins, alpha and beta. A recent model proposed PDGF binding involves the association of the two receptor proteins into three possible dimeric forms. An essential prediction of that model is that PDGF alpha-receptors are required for cells to bind and respond to the heterodimeric AB isoform of PDGF. In contrast, we found both binding and functional response to PDGF-AB was retained in Balb/c-3T3 cells after PDGF alpha-receptors had been down-regulated by PDGF-AA pretreatment. The observation that PDGF-AB could still elicit these responses suggests that at 37 degrees C, PDGF-AB may bind directly to beta-receptors in either monomeric or dimeric forms and that initial receptor activation may occur independently of the formation of alpha beta-receptor heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W1643426610,"Abstract Observation of the 93-kDa cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy in H2O has revealed a series of resonances in the 10-18 ppm range arising from exchangeable protons. One of these (peak A) has been assigned to the proton bound to the ring nitrogen of the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. A second (peak B) is assigned to H143 which participates in a chain of hydrogen bonds that includes also the coenzyme-bound proton. There is a mutual nuclear Overhauser effect between these two resonances. Peaks A and B respond to changes in pH and to interaction of the enzyme with coenzyme derivatives and inhibitors. Peak A moves from 15.4 to 17.4 ppm as the pH is lowered, while peak B moves in the opposite direction from 14.7 to 13.7 ppm, both with an apparent pKa of 6.15. This pKa is associated with deprotonation of the imine nitrogen at the Schiff base linkage of the coenzyme with K258 of the enzyme. In spectra of enzyme containing pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, peak A is observed at 16.5 ppm and peak B is at 13.9 ppm over a broad pH range. Peaks A and B are found at 17.8 and 14.0 ppm, respectively, for the enzyme complex with glutarate. When alpha-methylaspartate is added to the enzyme several new resonances appear in the spectrum, which are attributed to formation of the external aldimine. The position of peak A in spectra of various forms of the enzyme is interpreted to reflect the electronic distribution in the coenzyme ring. Several other peaks in this region of the spectrum also are sensitive to changes in pH or the addition of inhibitors. Some possible assignments of these resonances are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1555552538,"The crystal structure of a fully biologically active monomeric form of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) complexed with ATP has recently been reported (Brunie, S., Zelwer, C., and Risler, J.-L., (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 216, 411-424), revealing details of the active site of the enzyme, including the location of amino acid residues potentially involved in substrate binding. In the present paper, the role of 3 active site residues in interaction with methionine, ATP, and tRNA(fMet) and in catalysis of methionyl-adenylate has been explored using site-directed mutagenesis. Lys142 is located near the ribose of ATP in the MetRS.ATP cocrystal. Mutation of this residue to Ala caused a 5-fold decrease in kcat/Km for ATP-PPi exchange, indicating some contribution of the lysine side chain to the specificity of the enzyme. Mutation of Tyr359 to Ala produced a 14-fold increase in the Km for ATP with only a small (2-3-fold) change in the other kinetic parameters, indicating that the major role of this residue is in formation of the initial complex with ATP and/or in stabilization of the methionyl-adenylate reaction intermediate. Mutation of the adjacent residue Tyr358 to Ala had no effect on the Km values for methionine or ATP but produced nearly a 2000-fold decrease in the rate of ATP-PPi exchange. This mutation also dramatically reduced the rate of pyrophosphorolysis of the isolated MetRS.Met-AMP complex on addition of pyrophosphate without increasing the Km for PPi. None of the mutations affected the Km for tRNAfMet in the aminoacylation reaction. The results suggest that Tyr358 may enhance the rate of methionyl-adenylate formation by binding to the alpha-phosphate of ATP in the transition state. Interaction of Tyr358 and Tyr359 with ATP during the course of the reaction requires a significant change in the conformation of this region of the active site compared to the structure found in the MetRS.ATP complex. Such a shift is consistent with an induced-fit mechanism for methionine activation. Primary sequence comparisons of methionine-specific enzymes from yeast and bacterial sources reveals that Tyr358 is conserved in all of the known MetRS sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1584970354,"Low molecular weight mannose 6-phosphate receptor from bovine testis exhibits two isoforms on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Mr values of 45,000 (MPR-2A) and 41,000 (MPR-2B), respectively. Each isoform was purified to near homogeneity by the sequential application of differential centrifugation and affinity chromatography. The isoforms contain a common polypeptide core, but differ in their carbohydrate content. Treatment with specific endoglycosidases demonstrated that each isoform contains two high mannose and/or hybrid and two complex N-linked oligosaccharide chains. The results obtained from treatment of each isoform with endo-beta-galactosidase and neuraminidases and from lectin affinity chromatography reveal that MPR-2A contains a linear polylactosamine sequence(s) comprised of approximately 5 lactosamine units. A majority of the outer branches of the complex chains associated with MPR-2A are terminated with sialic acid residues. In contrast, MPR-2B lacks a polylactosamine sequence and a majority of the outer branches of the complex chains are terminated with galactose residues. MPR-2A exhibited a lower affinity than MPR-2B for mannose 6-phosphate-containing ligands. Treatment of MPR-2A with endo-beta-galactosidase and/or neuraminidases followed by affinity chromatography revealed that polylactosamine and sialic acid residues impair the ability of MPR-2A to bind ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1484488458,"Activation of rabbit liver microsomal high affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase (Type IV PDE) by vanadyl-glutathione complexes was studied as a possible model of insulin stimulation of the enzyme in a cell-free system. The effect of VO.2GSH activation of PDE was a 21-fold decrease in the IC50 value for cGMP inhibition and a 2.6-fold increase in the Vmax of the higher affinity cAMP catalytic site. Cyclic AMP and cGMP substrate affinities and cGMP hydrolysis were unaffected by VO.2GSH activation. Selective Type IV PDE inhibitors and cGMP analogs indicated that VO.2GSH complexes activated the cGMP-inhibitable form of the Type IV PDE activities which co-localized in hepatic microsomes. The Type IV PDE activating complex appears to consist minimally of vanadyl ion and 2 oxidized electron donor compounds. The components of the electron donor required to achieve an enzyme activation complex are: 1) a free -SH group as the electron donor for vanadate reduction and 2) a minimum structure of cysteamine (NH2-CH2-CH2-SH). Maximal activation of the enzyme required near 2:1 molar ratios of either glutathione or cysteamine mixed with sodium orthovanadate. Active vanadyl-cysteamine complexes were isolated by reverse- phase high performance liquid chromatography. Tungsten, niobium, and tantalum, but not manganese, chromium, or molybdenum, substituted for vanadium to form enzyme-activating complexes with glutathione. VO.RSH complex activation occurred rapidly upon addition to microsomes and was reversible. We conclude from these studies that VO.RSH complexes and insulin activate the same form of Type IV PDE in rabbit liver microsomes; our findings are discussed with respect to the involvement of a possible electron transfer enzyme oxidation in the activation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1489061947,"To elucidate whether priming exists between platelet-activating factor (PAF) and histamine in the microcirculation, we measured the clearance of FITC-dextran 150 in response to the topical applications of substimulatory concentrations of PAF and histamine. Maximal priming by PAF was observed when a 5-min interval separated the applications of 10(-9) M PAF and 10(-6) M histamine. The mean (+/- SEM) clearance resulting from this sequence of agonist administration was 7529 +/- 659 nl.2 h-1.g-1, representing a 4.5-fold enhancement in FITC-dextran 150 clearance compared with that evoked by 10(-6) M histamine alone (1664 +/- 397 nl.2 h-1.g-1). Lowering the PAF priming dose to 10(-11) M, or reversing the order of agonist addition to the microcirculation, resulted in diminished but significant responses of 3545 +/- 1143 and 4467 +/- 1170 nl.2 hr-1.g-1, respectively. Coapplication of PAF and histamine or increasing the time interval between the agonists to 15 min greatly reduced the responses to 1906 +/- 678 and 2770 +/- 837, respectively. The PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 (2 mg/kg i.v.), the H1 blocker pyrilamine (10 mg/kg i.v.), and leukocyte depletion with cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg i.p.) completely abolished the PAF priming effect. In addition, the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor RG 5901 (1 or 10 mg/kg i.v.) produced a two-thirds attenuation in PAF priming. We conclude that 1) PAF has the ability to prime the in vivo microvascular actions of histamine in both a concentration and time-dependent fashion; 2) this primed response is receptor mediated; and 3) histamine can prime the microcirculation for enhanced responses to PAF. Our data also demonstrate that leukocytes and the release of leukotrienes participate in PAF priming."
https://openalex.org/W1519507385,"Abstract The mitochondrial proton-translocating nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase is embedded in the inner membrane as a homodimer of monomer Mr = 109,288. Its N-terminal 430 residues and C-terminal 200 residues protrude into the matrix, whereas its central 400 residues appear to intercalate into the inner membrane as 14 hydrophobic clusters of about 20 residues each (Yamaguchi, M., and Hatefi, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5728-5735). Treatment of mitoplasts (mitochondria denuded of outer membrane) with several proteolytic enzymes cleaves the transhydrogenase into a 72-kDa N-terminal and a 37-kDa C-terminal fragment. The cleavage site of proteinase K was determined to be Ala690-Ala691, which is located in a small loop of the transhydrogenase exposed on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane. This paper shows that the bisected transhydrogenase can be purified from proteinase K-treated mitoplasts with retention of greater than or equal to 85% transhydrogenase activity. The inactivation rate of the bisected enzyme by trypsin and N-ethylmaleimide was altered in the presence of NADP and NADPH, suggesting substrate-induced conformation changes similar to those reported previously for the intact transhydrogenase. Also, like the intact enzyme, proteoliposomes of the bisected transhydrogenase were capable of membrane potential formation and internal acidification coupled to NADPH----NAD transhydrogenation. The properties of the bisected transhydrogenase have been discussed in relation to those of the two-subunit Escherichia coli transhydrogenase, the bisected lac permease (via gene restriction), and the fragmented and reconstituted bacteriorhodopsin."
