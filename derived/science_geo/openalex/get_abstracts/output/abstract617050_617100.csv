Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- and cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell-body distributions within the DR and differentially co-express a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, amygdala- and frontal-cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal-cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in the face of challenge. These results provide compelling evidence that the DR serotonin system contains parallel sub-systems that differ in input and output connectivity, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions."

Plasma cytokine profiles of 171 treatment-naive MDD patients (none of the MDD patients received an adequate trial of antidepressants or evidence-based psychotherapy) and 64 healthy controls (HCs) were obtained. MDD patients exhibited elevated concentrations of 18 anti- and proinflammatory markers and decreased concentrations of 6 cytokines. Increased inflammasome protein expression was observed in MDD patients, indicative of an activated inflammatory response. The plasma of MDD patients was immunosuppressive on healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells, inducing reduced activation of monocytes/dendritic cells and B cells and reduced T cell memory. Comparison between 33 non-responders and 71 responders at baseline and 12 weeks revealed that after treatment, anti-inflammatory cytokine levels increase in both groups, whereas 5 proinflammatory cytokine levels were stabilized in responders, but continued to increase in non-responders. MDD patients exhibit remodeling of their inflammatory landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2888570661,"The basal ganglia play key roles in adaptive behaviors guided by reward and punishment. However, despite accumulating knowledge, few studies have tested how heterogeneous signals in the basal ganglia are organized and coordinated for goal-directed behavior. In this study, we investigated neuronal signals of the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia as rats performed a lever push/pull task for a probabilistic reward. In the dorsomedial striatum, we found that optogenetically and electrophysiologically identified direct pathway neurons encoded reward outcomes, whereas indirect pathway neurons encoded no-reward outcome and next-action selection. Outcome coding occurred in association with the chosen action. In support of pathway-specific neuronal coding, light activation induced a bias on repeat selection of the same action in the direct pathway, but on switch selection in the indirect pathway. Our data reveal the mechanisms underlying monitoring and updating of action selection for goal-directed behavior through basal ganglia circuits."

Pathogenic NaV1.3 channels showed altered biophysical properties including increased persistent current.

Disrupted cerebral cortical folding and neuronal migration were recapitulated in ferrets expressing the mutant channel, underscoring the unexpected role of SCN3A in progenitor cells and migrating neurons. Human CNS channelopathies cause a range of brain disorders (Spillane et al., 2016Spillane J. Kullmann D.M. Hanna M.G. Genetic neurological channelopathies: molecular genetics and clinical phenotypes.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2016; 87: 37-48PubMed Google Scholar). However, we lack a clear understanding of ion channel functions at early stages of cerebral cortical development, particularly in progenitor cells and migrating neurons (Spillane et al., 2016Spillane J. Kullmann D.M. Hanna M.G. Genetic neurological channelopathies: molecular genetics and clinical phenotypes.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2016; 87: 37-48PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe a disease of abnormal brain development, polymicrogyria (PMG), associated with pathogenic variants in SCN3A, which encodes brain-enriched voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) NaV1.3. PMG is characterized by multiple abnormally small gyri in the cerebral cortex (Kuzniecky et al., 1993Kuzniecky R. Andermann F. Guerrini R.

PMG in language areas can affect speech (Stutterd and Leventer, 2014Stutterd C.A. Leventer R.J. Polymicrogyria: a common and heterogeneous malformation of cortical development.Am. J. Med. Genet. C.

Although case reports suggest that SCN3A variants cause early infantile epilepsy, sometimes resolving in childhood (Holland et al., 2008Holland K.D. Kearney J.A. Glauser T.A. Buck G. Keddache M.

Neurol. 2018; 83: 703-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the pathogenic SCN3A alleles we discovered manifest as a fixed perisylvian anatomical defect with prominent orofacial weakness and/or speech delay, yet epilepsy was uncommon. Our findings reveal prenatal roles for SCN3A in cortical organization and neuronal migration, especially in speech and language areas, mirroring the enriched fetal expression of SCN3A. Prenatal cortical progenitor cells and neurons do not show detectable action potentials, supporting an unexpected role for sodium channel (SCN3A) in their proliferation and migration in the developing brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological evaluations of six unrelated families with oral motor and/or speech deficits demonstrate bilateral perisylvian PMG (Families A and B; Figure 1A and 1B ; Table S1), unilateral perisylvian PMG with abnormal sulcation (Families C and F), and bilateral frontoparietal PMG with microcephaly (Families D and E; Figure 1B). Families A and B are multigenerational with prominent dysarthric speech, and variable oral motor deficits and ID, clinically described previously (Guerreiro et al., 2000Guerreiro M.M. Andermann E. Guerrini R. Dobyns W.B. Kuzniecky R. Silver K. Van Bogaert P. Gillain C. David P. Ambrosetto G. et al.Familial perisylvian polymicrogyria: a new familial syndrome of cortical maldevelopment.Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (Figure 1C). Linkage and haplotype mapping, exome sequencing, and Sanger sequencing in Family A detected only one rare, predicted deleterious variant that segregated perfectly with the condition: it is heterozygous in affected individuals and obligate carriers and absent in unaffected individuals (Figures 1C and S1A–S1C). The variant occurs in SCN3A, which encodes NaV1.3 (NM_006922.3), a VGSC alpha subunit (NaV). This channel’s pore-forming structure contains four homologous domains (DI–DIV), each consisting of six membrane-spanning segments (S1–S6; Figure 2A). The SCN3A variant in Family A, c.5276T>A, p.Phe1759Tyr (F1759Y) affects a phenylalanine in the S6 segment of the fourth transmembrane domain (DIV-S6; Figures 2A and S1A), an important pore-facing subunit regulating voltage-dependent inactivation (McPhee et al., 1995McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. A critical role for transmembrane segment IVS6 of the sodium channel α subunit in fast inactivation.J. Biol.

A screen of 258 individuals with PMG and variable oral motor or speech deficits for SCN3A variants revealed five additional families. In Family B, the variant at c.4030A>C, p.Ile1344Leu (I1344L) affects an isoleucine in the S5 segment of the third domain (DIII-S5; Figures 1C, 2A, and S1E) and was inherited by two affected siblings from their mother who had a normal MRI, suggesting that she is a non-manifesting carrier, a feature of channelopathies (Cooper et al., 2013Cooper D.N. Krawczak M. Polychronakos C. Tyler-Smith C. Kehrer-Sawatzki H.

Genet. 2013; 132: 1077-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The siblings’ maternal uncle, now deceased, reportedly never developed speech and had seizures but did not have brain imaging. The de novo SCN3A variant in Family C, c.2549T>C, p.Leu850Pro (L850P), present in one affected child and absent from both parents, affects a leucine in the S4 voltage-sensing segment of the second domain (DII-S4; Figures 1C, 2A, and S1F). Unrelated Families D and E each have one affected child with the same de novo variant absent from their parents, SCN3A c.2624T>C, p.Ile875Thr (I875T), which is in the intracellular loop connecting the S4-S5 subunits in DII, close to the NaV voltage sensor (Savio-Galimberti et al., 2012Savio-Galimberti E.

Pharmacol. 2012; 3: 124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C, 2A, and S1H). The SCN3A variant in Family F, 1862G>A, p.Arg621His (R621H), present in one affected child and absent in maternal DNA, affects an arginine in the S6-S1 cytoplasmic linker between DI and DII (Figures 1C and S1G).Figure 2Pathogenic SCN3A Variants Alter Channel PhysiologyShow full caption(A) Top: schematic of SCN3A alpha subunit where colored circles indicate approximate locations of mutations identified in Families A–F.

R621, L850, I875, I1344, and F1759 are highly conserved among human VGSC subtype genes (SCN1A-SCN11A) and invariant in other vertebrate SCN3A orthologs (Figures S1D–S1H). L850P, I1344L, and F1759Y are completely absent in large human genetics databases, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD.broadinstitute.org), which contains 4,877,782 exome or genome sequences for >138,000 individuals, including ∼13,000 Finns. Four other I875T alleles have been reported, two individuals in large ID and developmental disability cohorts reported without further phenotypic detail (Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2017Deciphering Developmental Disorders StudyPrevalence and architecture of de novo mutations in developmental disorders.Nature. 2017; 542: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, Lelieveld et al., 2016Lelieveld S.H.

Božović I.B. DeBrosse S.D. Bergqvist A.C. Wallis K. Medne L. Maver A. Peterlin B. Helbig K.L. et al.Mutations in SCN3A cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy.Ann. Neurol. 2018; 83: 703-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that I875T is a recurrent, severely damaging allele. In silico pathogenicity predictions using SIFT, MutationTaster, and PolyPhen2 suggested that R621H, L850P, I875T, I1344L, and F1759Y are all damaging and likely disease causing (STAR Methods). The mutations suggest a range of severity, from inheritance of variably penetrant perisylvian PMG and ID without epilepsy (F1759Y, I1344L) to the severely damaging recurrent I875T allele, which is de novo in the 5 families identified to date with widespread PMG, microcephaly, and severe seizures. Sodium current recordings from HEK293T cells that expressed mutated SCN3A harboring the F1759Y or I875T alleles displayed abnormal channel properties. Using whole-cell patch recordings, we evoked transient sodium currents over a range of voltages and measured the conductance-voltage curve in transfected cells (Figure 2B). Both mutant channels exhibited abnormal peak conductance (Ipeak) and half-maximal voltage of activation (V1/2; Figure 2C). Compared to wild-type (WT), the F1759Y mutation produced a depolarizing shift (+7.8 ± 1.6 mV; t test, p < 0.01, n = 28), while the I875T mutation produced a hyperpolarizing shift (−5.4 ± 1.7 mV; t test, p < 0.01, n = 17; Figure 2C; see Table S2 for complete sodium current values). NaV channel availability calculated by measuring steady-state (fast) inactivation with a stepwise conditioning protocol (100 ms pre-pulse from −100 to 0 mV; Figure 2D) showed a trend toward depolarizing shifts in half-maximal voltage of inactivation (F1759Y, 5.2 ± 1.1 mV, t test, p = 0.24, n = 28; and I875T, 5.5 ± 0.6 mV; t test, p = 0.27 n = 17; Figure 2D). Whereas SCN3A channels are already distinct from SCN1A channels by their larger, non-inactivating persistent current (I-NaP) (Lampert et al., 2006Lampert A. Hains B.C. Waxman S.G. Upregulation of persistent and ramp sodium current in dorsal horn neurons after spinal cord injury.Exp. Brain Res. 2006; 174: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Sun et al., 2007Sun G.-C. Werkman T.R. Battefeld A. Clare J.J. Wadman W.J.

The I-NaP measured at depolarized potentials for I875T (+10 to +50 mV; t test, n = 17, p < 0.05), and at all potentials tested for F1759Y (−10 to +50 mV; t test, n = 28, p < 0.01), was greater than WT NaV1.3 controls (Figure 2E; Table S2). Because I-NaP depolarizes cells (Stafstrom, 2007Stafstrom C.E. Persistent sodium current and its role in epilepsy.Epilepsy Curr. 2007; 7: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and mutated SCN3A can enhance excitability (Estacion et al., 2010Estacion M. Gasser A. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. A sodium channel mutation linked to epilepsy increases ramp and persistent current of Nav1.3 and induces hyperexcitability in hippocampal neurons.Exp. Neurol. 2010; 224: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we next evaluated total charge (current density) conducted by channels during a voltage step depolarization (Figure 2F). The F1759Y pathogenic variant conducted more sodium current through depolarizing potentials (−10 mV to +25 mV; t test, n = 28, p < 0.05), while the I875T pathogenic variant conducted less sodium current than controls (t test, n = 17, p < 0.01; Figure 2F; Table S2). Because I-NaP is a characteristic of SCN3A channels and is similarly increased by both variants, it might underlie PMG associated with these variants. Patch clamping human primary fetal cortical neurons from early-middle gestation showed small reproducible sodium currents (110 pA ± 45 pA, n = 12; Figure 2H), but no regenerative action potentials under the tested conditions (Figure 2I), consistent with prior reports (Moore et al., 2009Moore A.R. Filipovic R. Mo Z. Rasband M.N. Zecevic N. Antic S.D. Electrical excitability of early neurons in the human cerebral cortex during the second trimester of gestation.Cereb. Cortex. 2009; 19: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The absence of action potentials prenatally suggests that during human fetal development, SCN3A sodium currents may have functions beyond the classical role of action potential electrogenesis. Unlike SCN1A, SCN3A is robustly expressed across human cortical regions during fetal periods but downregulated after birth (Figures 3A and S3C). RNA in situ analyses of fetal (20 weeks gestation) human brain revealed the highest SCN3A expression in the cortical plate (CP), which contains immature neurons, with significant expression in the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) and intermediate zone (IZ), but low expression in the ventricular zone (VZ; Figures 3C, 3E, and S3B). Consistent with this pattern, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data at 16–18 weeks gestation (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Nicholas C.R. Shuga J. Liu S.J. Oldham M.C. Diaz A. et al.Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development.Cell. 2015; 163: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) showed SCN3A enrichment in intermediate progenitors and neurons (Figures 3B and S3A), and in situ analysis showed expression in outer radial glia (oRG; Figures S3B) as well, a progenitor cell type present in developing gyrencephalic brains (non-human primates and humans) but rare or absent in mice (Florio and Huttner, 2014Florio M. Huttner W.B. Neural progenitors, neurogenesis and the evolution of the neocortex.Development. 2014; 141: 2182-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). oRG cells, but not ventricular RG cells, display small sodium currents (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V. Lui J.H. Parker P.R.L. Kriegstein A.R. Neurogenic radial glia in the outer subventricular zone of human neocortex.Nature. 2010; 464: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), suggesting that SCN3A underlies sodium conductance in these cortical progenitors, which are key to gyrification. Adult human cortex (38 years old) showed very low SCN3A expression across all cortical layers (Figures 3D, 3F, and S3C). SCN3A expression differs sharply from that of other VGSCs, including SCN1A, which was lower during gestation and upregulated postnatally (Figures 3A and S3C). Low SCN1A expression during gestation was confirmed across all fetal cortical cell types by scRNA-seq (two-part Wilcoxon test, p < 0.005; Figure 3B). Notably, postnatal upregulation of SCN1A correlates with the age of onset of epilepsy associated with SCN1A variants (Spillane et al., 2016Spillane J. Kullmann D.M. Hanna M.G. Genetic neurological channelopathies: molecular genetics and clinical phenotypes.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2016; 87: 37-48PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical reports have associated other SCN3A variants with infantile epilepsy that resolves with age (Vanoye et al., 2014Vanoye C.G. Gurnett C.A. Holland K.D. George Jr., A.L. Kearney J.A. Novel SCN3A variants associated with focal epilepsy in children.Neurobiol. Dis. 2014; 62: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), perhaps because fetal SCN3A expression later decreases. Mice also display post-natal Scn3a downregulation (Beckh et al., 1989Beckh S. Noda M. Lübbert H. Numa S.

Thus, different expression patterns between SCN1A and SCN3A may relate to the ages of onset and severity of VGSC channelopathies, possibly explaining the limited adult epilepsy observed in individuals with SCN3A pathogenic variants in this study (Families A, B, C, and E), and the absence of brain malformations seen with SCN1A mutations (Spillane et al., 2016Spillane J.

Expression of SCN3A in cultured human fetal neurons produced a modest increase in neurite branching without an overall increase in neurite length, and this branching effect was attenuated by both I875T and F1759Y mutants (Figure S2). Fetal neurons overexpressing the I875T mutant displayed modestly shorter neurites overall, similar to neuropathy-associated NaV1.7 mutations that disrupts neurites (Estacion et al., 2015Estacion M. Vohra B.P.S. Liu S. Hoeijmakers J. Faber C.G. Merkies I.S.J. Lauria G. Black J.A. Waxman S.G.

Overexpression of the β-NaV subunit, which affects persistent current (Aman et al., 2009Aman T.K. Grieco-Calub T.M. Chen C. Rusconi R. Slat E.A. Isom L.L. Raman I.M.

These results further support the possibility that SCN3A regulates neuronal development through action potential-independent mechanisms and that the disease-associated mutations impact these processes. SCN3A-F1759Y mutation disrupted cortical gyral formation in vivo in the developing ferret cerebral cortex (Figure 4). Unlike rodents, ferret brains possess a stereotyped pattern of gyri and sulci, a human-like molecular diversity of progenitor cells, and a developmental timeline that permits transient gene overexpression in embryos via in utero electroporation (IUE) (Johnson et al., 2015Johnson M.B.

Following IUE delivery of F1759Y or WT SCN3A at embryonic day 33 (E33), we analyzed ferret brains at: (1) birth (postnatal day 0 [P0]), coincident with mid-corticogenesis (cortical layers are still forming and cortex largely smooth), and (2) P33, when gyri and sulci are more fully formed. At P0, F1759Y overexpression severely disrupted neuronal migration: Tuj1-positive neurons were displaced near the VZ and SVZ instead of arriving at their age-appropriate cortical laminae (Figure 4C).

It is important to educate health personnel about the potential risks that can arise from the associated distraction.The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the level of nomophobia and the distraction associated with smartphone use among nursing students during their clinical practicum.A cross-sectional study was carried out on 304 nursing students. The nomophobia questionnaire (NMP-Q) and a questionnaire about smartphone use, the distraction associated with it, and opinions about phone restriction policies in hospitals were used.A positive correlation between the use of smartphones and the total score of nomophobia was found. In the same way, there was a positive correlation between opinion about smartphone restriction polices with each of the dimensions of nomophobia and the total score of the questionnaire.Nursing students who show high levels of nomophobia also regularly use their smartphones during their clinical practicum, although they also believe that the implementation of policies restricting smartphone use while working is necessary."

Autoimmune encephalitis represents a heterogeneous group of autoimmune disorders in the CNS that are characterized by autoantibodies (ABs) to neuronal targets localized at central synapses, such as ionotropic or G-protein-coupled receptors, presynaptic proteins, or ion channels (Dalmau et al., 2017Dalmau J.

Patients showing high titers of anti-AMPAR autoantibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) most often develop a syndrome of limbic encephalitis with dramatic impairment of the ability to build new memories in addition to temporally graded retrograde amnesia, anxiety, mood changes, psychosis, and temporal lobe seizures (Höftberger et al., 2015Höftberger R. van Sonderen A.

First in vitro experimental studies indicate that patient CSF containing AMPAR autoantibodies to both GluA1 and GluA2 subunits decreases synaptic AMPAR clusters and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude and frequency in cultures of primary hippocampal neurons without changing expression and function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (Lai et al., 2009Lai M.

Moreover, whether human AMPAR autoantibodies can induce disease symptoms in mice has yet to be shown. AMPARs are mainly heterotetrameric ionotropic glutamatergic receptors composed of four pore-forming subunits (GluA1 to GluA4) and several auxiliary subunits (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003Bredt D.S.

The assembly of AMPARs with auxiliary subunits (transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, TARPs) regulates many functional properties of the receptor and is crucial for AMPAR trafficking and their anchoring at synapses (Bats et al., 2007Bats C.

In normal hippocampus, the majority of synaptic AMPARs are assembled as heteromeric receptors of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits and to a much lesser extent of GluA2 and GluA3 subunits (Greger et al., 2017Greger I.H.

Importantly, the presence of the GluA2 subunit in the AMPAR complex confers different properties to the receptors, which have consequences on AMPAR function in synaptic transmission and plasticity. AMPARs containing GluA2 subunits conduct Na+ and K+ but not Ca2+, whereas those lacking GluA2 are also permeable to Ca2+ ions, have a large single-channel conductance, and are inwardly rectifying due to a channel block by intracellular polyamines at positive membrane potentials (Bowie and Mayer, 1995Bowie D.

Ca2+ permeable AMPARs can primarily be found at extrasynaptic sites. During synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) highly mobile extrasynaptic AMPARs and Ca2+ permeable AMPARs are incorporated into synapses where they increase Ca2+ influx and strengthen synaptic transmission (Ehlers et al., 2007Ehlers M.D. Heine M.

Similarly, after long-lasting decreases in synaptic activity Ca2+ permeable AMPARs are incorporated at synapses thereby restoring synaptic function, a phenomenon termed homeostatic plasticity by synaptic scaling (Hou et al., 2008Hou Q. Zhang D. Jarzylo L. Huganir R.L. Man H.Y. Homeostatic regulation of AMPA receptor expression at single hippocampal synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). We sought to investigate whether autoimmune mechanisms involving autoantibodies specifically targeting GluA2 influence basic properties of AMPAR function and whether these processes are sufficient to induce characteristic disease symptoms of AMPAR encephalitis. Using purified patient immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies specifically directed against the GluA2 subunit, we show that anti-GluA2 autoantibodies lead to distinct changes in synaptic transmission by modifications in AMPAR composition and localization, TARP association, and by synaptic scaling-like mechanisms involving enhanced synaptic incorporation of inwardly rectifying, non-GluA2-containing AMPARs. These changes affect LTP in the hippocampus and induce characteristic behavioral changes in vivo. Our results thus identify a unique immune-neuronal interaction that may underlie characteristic disease symptoms. In this study, we used purified IgG fractions from plasma exchange material or serum samples of nine patients with autoimmune encephalitis and high-titer autoantibodies against only the GluA2 subunit of the AMPAR (a-GluA2 IgG) and of a control patient without detectable antineuronal autoantibodies (ct IgG). One IgG fraction was derived from an individual patient with very high titers of specific autoantibodies to GluA2, and the other IgG fraction was derived from a group of eight patients (a-GluA2 IgG 1 and 2, respectively). According to previous reports, all patients presented with limbic encephalitis including severe memory dysfunction and seizures (Höftberger et al., 2015Höftberger R. van Sonderen A. Leypoldt F. Houghton D. Geschwind M. Gelfand J. Paredes M. Sabater L. Saiz A.

Hughes E.G. Peng X. Zhou L. Gleichman A.J. Shu H. Matà S. Kremens D. Vitaliani R. Geschwind M.D. et al.AMPA receptor antibodies in limbic encephalitis alter synaptic receptor location.Ann. Neurol. 2009; 65: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). We tested the specificity of both purified IgG fractions and found exclusive plasma membrane binding of patient IgG on non-permeabilized GluA2:eGFP but not GluA1:eGFP transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and on dissociated neurons. Patient IgG bound to the neuropil in the hippocampus of wild-type (WT), but not in GluA2-knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, affinity purification experiments with patient IgG in rat brain tissue combined with mass spectrometric analysis confirmed GluA2 as its main target (Figure S1). Thus, patient IgG fractions used in this study target the GluA2 subunit of the AMPAR at high specificity. We first investigated the effect of a-GluA2 IgG on quantal AMPAR signaling by recording AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs in dissociated hippocampal neurons after 24-hr preincubation with the purified IgG fractions. At a holding potential of −80 mV, mEPSC peak amplitudes were not significantly different between control preparations and a-GluA2 IgG-treated preparations (Figures 1A–1C). Rise and decay time were also unchanged in all groups (data not shown). At this holding potential, AMPARs of all subunit compositions contribute to the recorded miniature current. To selectively record currents from AMPARs containing the GluA2 subunit (non-inwardly rectifying AMPARs), neurons were voltage clamped at a membrane potential of +40 mV. Under this condition, mEPSC amplitudes were decreased in neurons treated with a-GluA2 IgG fractions (ct IgG 21.0 ± 1.4 pA, a-GluA2 IgG 1 12.5 ± 0.5 pA, a-GluA2 IgG 2 14.7 ± 0.7 pA), and cumulative probability was shifted toward smaller amplitudes (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1D). Under both conditions, the mEPSC frequency was reduced in a-GluA2 IgG-incubated neurons and the cumulative probability plots of inter-event intervals were shifted to greater values (Figures 1C and 1D). These findings, obtained in two independent a-GluA2 IgG samples, led us to hypothesize that a-GluA2 IgG results in a decrease of GluA2-containing AMPARs and homeostatic incorporation of non-GluA2 AMPARs. To verify whether these changes were indeed induced by autoantibodies against GluA2, we additionally used the patients’ IgG fraction (a-GluA2 IgG 1) depleted of autoantibodies against GluA2 (Figures S1B and S1C) and found no such alterations of mEPSC peak amplitude and frequency at a membrane potential of +40 mV (Figure S2A). To test our hypothesis of reduced signaling derived from GluA2-containing AMPARs and homeostatic incorporation of non-GluA2 AMPARs, we used two complementary approaches: First, 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine (NASPM), a selective blocker of AMPARs lacking GluA2 (Koike et al., 1997Koike M. Iino M. Ozawa S. Blocking effect of 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine on Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.Neurosci. Res. 1997; 29: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) led to a significant reduction of the mEPSC peak amplitude in neurons held at −80 mV that had been preincubated with a-GluA2 IgG (Figures 1E and 1F). In contrast, NASPM did not significantly alter mEPSCs in control IgG-treated neurons (Figure S2B). Second, inhibition of synaptic scaling-like mechanisms of postsynaptic accumulation of AMPARs by blockade of the ryanodine receptor preventing mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ sources (Vlachos et al., 2013Vlachos A. Ikenberg B. Lenz M. Becker D. Reifenberg K. Bas-Orth C. Deller T. Synaptopodin regulates denervation-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 8242-8247Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) led to a significant reduction of mEPSC peak amplitude (Figures 1G and 1H). These findings suggest that the unaltered mEPSC amplitude at −80 mV after preincubation with a-GluA2 IgG (cf. Figure 1C) is mediated by compensatory synaptic incorporation of AMPARs lacking GluA2. To dissect pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms that might contribute to the observed changes in mEPSC amplitude and frequency, we performed iontophoretic application of L-glutamate to individual synapses of primary neurons. Depending on the stimulation strength, this procedure allows both stimulation of single synapses and multi-synaptic stimulation of larger dendritic portions (Figures 2A, 2B, and S3). Single-synapse stimulation revealed unchanged iontophoretically evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs (ieEPSCs) at −80 mV after long-time pre-incubation with a-GluA2 IgG over 24 hr consistent with the analysis of the mEPSC amplitude (cf. Figure 1C). However, we found reduced ieEPSC amplitudes at increased stimulation strength when a multi-synaptic response was elicited (Figures 2B and 2C). These findings provide an explanation for the reduced frequency of spontaneous events, as they indicate a decrease in the number of functional glutamatergic synapses. When we performed paired-pulse stimulation of individual synapses, we found rapid desensitization and prolonged monoexponential recovery from desensitization. Preincubation with a-GluA2 IgG slowed the recovery from desensitization in the paired-pulse paradigm (Figure 2D) similarly to findings in neurons from GluA2-KO mice (Harvey et al., 2001Harvey S.C. Köster A. Yu H. Skolnick P. Baumbarger P. Nisenbaum E.S. AMPA receptor function is altered in GLUR2-deficient mice.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or in HEK293 cells with homomeric GluA1 receptors after transfection with only the GluA1 subunit (Grosskreutz et al., 2003Grosskreutz J. Zoerner A. Schlesinger F. Krampfl K. Dengler R. Bufler J. Kinetic properties of human AMPA-type glutamate receptors expressed in HEK293 cells.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) consistent with a rearrangement of AMPAR subunit composition from GluA2 to GluA1. To directly test the hypothesis of synaptic AMPAR rearrangement, we analyzed the structural changes of synaptic AMPAR subunit expression in dissociated hippocampal neurons by confocal and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). When we quantified the total dendritic postsynaptic spots as revealed by analysis of Homer1 regions, we found that after 24-hr incubation with a-GluA2 IgG the mean areas of Homer1 clusters were unchanged and the number of Homer1 density regions per dendrite length was slightly reduced (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4). Importantly, as revealed by confocal and super-resolution microscopy, the amount of synaptic GluA2 localizations within the Homer1-defined regions was decreased after a-GluA2 IgG preincubation (Figures 3C–3H). In extrasynaptic regions, GluA2 localizations were not significantly reduced. However, due to less well-defined dendritic boundaries and background fluorescence in larger areas, quantification in these areas may be carefully interpreted (Figure S4A). Distance analysis of AMPAR subunits with respect to the synaptic Homer region corroborated the decreased GluA2 receptor localizations within the ∼500-nm vicinity that may also include perisynaptic regions (Figure S4D). As synaptic AMPAR in the hippocampus regularly exist as GluA1/2 heterodimers (Henley and Wilkinson, 2016Henley J.M. Wilkinson K.A. Synaptic AMPA receptor composition in development, plasticity and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2009Lu W. Shi Y. Jackson A.C. Bjorgan K. During M.J. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nicoll R.A. Subunit composition of synaptic AMPA receptors revealed by a single-cell genetic approach.Neuron. 2009; 62: 254-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), a similar reduction of GluA1 subunit expression would be expected following autoantibody-induced AMPAR internalization. However, synaptic GluA1 density and the perisynaptic amount of GluA1 were unchanged (Figures 3C–3H). Thus, in line with our functional experiments in primary neurons, these findings demonstrate autoantibody-induced depletion of heteromeric synaptic AMPARs containing GluA2 most likely followed by a synaptic incorporation of GluA1 homomeric AMPARs. In addition to the effects of synaptic AMPAR rearrangement, specific autoantibodies to GluA2 may also affect AMPAR ion channel function directly or may interfere with AMPAR association with TARPs that control anchoring of highly mobile AMPARs at the postsynaptic density (Bats et al., 2007Bats C. Groc L. Choquet D. The interaction between Stargazin and PSD-95 regulates AMPA receptor surface trafficking.Neuron. 2007; 53: 719-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). To investigate acute effects of patients’ IgG fractions, we applied ct IgG or a-GluA2 IgG to tSA201 cells transfected with GluA1/GluA2 heterodimers only. Short IgG application did not induce changes of glutamate-evoked inward currents thus arguing against direct effects on AMPAR ion channel function (Figure 4A). Next, we tested whether patients’ IgG modifies the interaction of AMPAR and stargazin, the prototypical TARP co-expressed with AMPAR. Therefore, we performed fast application of glutamate onto outside-out patches from tSA201 cells that were cotransfected with GluA1/GluA2 heterodimers and stargazin 25 ± 3 min after 4-min preincubation of the cells with a-GluA2 IgG or ct IgG. Rectification index (peak current at +60 mV/–60 mV) was 0.91 ± 0.02 for ct IgG versus 0.89 ± 0.03 for a-GluA2-IgG indicating about 90% of heterodimeric AMPAR in both experimental groups. Non-stationary fluctuation analysis (NSFA) in these patches of defined AMPAR composition revealed reduced single-channel conductance (Figure 4B). Since stargazin increases AMPAR single-channel conductance (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A. The expanding social network of ionotropic glutamate receptors: TARPs and other transmembrane auxiliary subunits.Neuron. 2011; 70: 178-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), these findings suggest dissociation of TARPs in cells incubated with pathogenic autoantibodies at this early time point. To test this hypothesis, we used tSA201 cells transfected with GluA1 and a tandem protein in which GluA2 is fused to stargazin by a 9-amino-acid (aa) linker (GluA2:stargazin). NSFA experiments resulted in single-channel conductance that was unchanged after 4-min treatment with a-GluA2-IgG (Figure 4C), thus corroborating the hypothesis of IgG-induced AMPAR-TARP dissociation in the non-fused constructs. We next evaluated the effect of short-duration incubation of patients’ IgG fractions on synaptic mEPSCs in primary neurons at −80 mV. Short-duration application (mean duration of IgG application: 25 ± 2 min) did not affect mEPSC peak amplitude, kinetics, and frequency. However, longer duration of autoantibody incubation (59 ± 4 min) led to reduction of mEPSC frequency (ct IgG 2.2 ± 0.6 Hz, a-GluA2 IgG 1 1.0 ± 0.2 Hz) with unchanged mEPSC amplitudes indicating similar regulation at that time point as observed in the experiments with 24-hr incubation after compensatory incorporation of non-GluA2-containing AMPARs (Figures 4D and 4E). These initial changes may be explained by antibody-induced receptor mobilization from the postsynaptic density at early time points that is followed by internalization at perisynaptic localized endocytic zones (Rosendale et al., 2017Rosendale M. Jullié D. Choquet D. Perrais D. Spatial and temporal regulation of receptor endocytosis in neuronal dendrites revealed by imaging of single vesicle formation.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 1840-1847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous studies provided evidence of reduced surface AMPAR expression upon challenge with pathogenic patient IgG antibodies (Lai et al., 2009Lai M. Hughes E.G. Peng X. Zhou L. Gleichman A.J. Shu H. Matà S. Kremens D. Vitaliani R. Geschwind M.D. et al.AMPA receptor antibodies in limbic encephalitis alter synaptic receptor location.Ann. Neurol. 2009; 65: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Using super-resolution dSTORM, we here demonstrate that patients’ a-GluA2 IgG reacts with synaptic and extrasynaptic located GluA2 subunits (Figures 5A and 5B ) similar to previous reports using commercial AMPAR antibodies (Nair et al., 2013Nair D. Hosy E. Petersen J.D. Constals A. Giannone G. Choquet D. Sibarita J.B. Super-resolution imaging reveals that AMPA receptors inside synapses are dynamically organized in nanodomains regulated by PSD95.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13204-13224Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis of antibody-induced receptor internalization with a complementary approach, we performed sequential staining to determine membrane-bound and internalized GluA2 AMPARs. We found reduced surface expression of GluA2 upon pretreatment with patients’ a-GluA2 IgG. This effect was reversed when endocytosis was blocked during IgG application (Figures 5C and 5D). Together, these data indicate that at an early time point autoantibodies to GluA2 may lead to beginning dissociation of AMPARs and TARPs and disruption of synaptic anchoring, followed by endocytosis of GluA2-containing heteromeric AMPARs and compensatory regulation with synaptic insertion of non-GluA2 AMPARs. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of GluA2 autoantibodies in the brain, we evaluated AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampal network after stereotactic intrahippocampal injection of a-GluA2 IgG fractions in mice in comparison to control IgG and physiological saline (0.9 M). The amount of injected human IgG detected in mice hippocampi was similar for control and a-GluA2 IgG (Figure S5A). Concomitant injection of FM1-43 dye that labels active synapses served as a marker in acute brain slices for verification that IgG fractions were applied to the correct recording site (Figure 6A). In some mice, specific binding of injected patient IgG fractions to the AMPAR GluA2 subunit in vivo was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the bound human IgG that was found exclusively after a-GluA2 IgG injection (Figure S5B). Analysis of synaptic spines using Neurolucida reconstructions of CA1 apical dendrites revealed unchanged spine density and morphology in ct IgG and a-GluA2 IgG-injected mice (Figure S5C), thus arguing against major changes in structural plasticity or dendritic pruning after application of a-GluA2 IgG. To investigate AMPAR subunit expression after targeted intrahippocampal injection of purified IgG fractions, we performed confocal analysis of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 region. Here, we found synaptic downregulation of GluA2 corroborating the in vitro findings obtained by confocal and super-resolution microscopy (Figures S5D–S5F). In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from granule cells (GCs) in the DG, we electrically evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) by stimulation of the lateral perforant path (LPP). Corroborating our cell-culture findings, we did not find differences in the amplitudes (ct IgG 109.8 ± 13.7 pA, a-GluA2 IgG 112.9 ± 13.8 pA, saline 105.1 ± 9.4 pA) and kinetics (data not shown) of eEPSC between saline, ct IgG, and a-GluA2 IgG-injected mice (Figures 6B and 6C). Paired-pulse stimulation induced facilitation in the LPP-DG pathway without differences between the experimental groups (Figure 6D). Although facilitation in this pathway is believed to be mainly mediated by presynaptic mechanisms (Petersen et al., 2013Petersen R.P. Moradpour F. Eadie B.D. Shin J.D. Kannangara T.S. Delaney K.R.

https://openalex.org/W2888398679,"Conditioned appetitive and aversive responses (CRs) are thought to result from the activation of specific subsets of valence-coding basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons. Under this model, the responses of BLA cells to conditioned stimuli (CSs) and the activity that drives CRs are closely related. We tested the strength of this correlation using a task where rats could emit different CRs in response to the same CSs. At odds with this model, the CS responses and CR-related activity of individual BLA cells were separable. Moreover, while the incidence of valence-coding cells did not exceed chance, at the population level there was similarity between valence coding for CSs and CRs. In fact, both lateral and basolateral neurons concurrently encoded multiple task features and behaviors. Thus, conditioned emotional behaviors may not depend on the recruitment of single cells that explicitly encode individual task variables but from multiplexed representations distributed across the BLA."
https://openalex.org/W2889219581,"Black soldier fly (BSF) is a generalist species able to reduce large quantities of organic substrates and is thus considered as an interesting solution for waste management. Moreover, as BSF larvae accumulate high quantities of nutrients during their growth, they are valued because of their potential to produce products such as protein meal or fat for livestock feeds. Abiotic factors can influence larva growth, and a more detailed knowledge and control of these parameters can lead to the development of mass BSF breeding for the production of innovative products for animal feeds. As little information is available on the effects of the pH of substrates and feeding systems, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of these two factors on the activities of BSF larvae, prepupae, and adults. An experiment was performed with two fixed factors: i) pH (4.0; 6.1; 7.5; 9.5) and ii) feeding system (batch feeding system (TFS) or daily feeding system (DFS)). The pH treatments impacted larval weight on the first, third, and fifth day, but not at the end of the trial. Larval activity increased pH values from the fourth day onward, with final values of around 8.9-9.4 in all the treatments. The weight of the prepupae ranged from between 0.094 and 0.100 g. The final weight of the larvae and pupae, sex ratio, ingested food, larval mortality, percentage of emergence, and time to reach the pupa stadium were all affected by the feeding system. DFS showed the heaviest final larval weight (0.149 g), but required a longer time (11.3 d) than TFS to reach the prepupa stadium. The findings of this research could be useful for the mass production of BSF. Evaluation of an appropriate feeding system and initial pH value of the substrate are important parameters to reduce the time and to increase the weight in the production of larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2888462525,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) enables cloning of differentiated cells by reprogramming their nuclei to a totipotent state. However, successful full-term development of SCNT embryos is a low-efficiency process and arrested embryos frequently exhibit epigenetic abnormalities. Here, we generated genome-wide DNA methylation maps from mouse pre-implantation SCNT embryos. We identified widespread regions that were aberrantly re-methylated, leading to mis-expression of genes and retrotransposons important for zygotic genome activation. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) specifically rescued these re-methylation defects and improved the developmental capacity of cloned embryos. Moreover, combining inhibition of Dnmts with overexpression of histone demethylases led to stronger reductions in inappropriate DNA methylation and synergistic enhancement of full-term SCNT embryo development. These findings show that excessive DNA re-methylation is a potent barrier that limits full-term development of SCNT embryos and that removing multiple epigenetic barriers is a promising approach to achieve higher cloning efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2888387923,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a largely incurable hematological malignancy, is derived from aberrant clonal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) that persist after conventional therapies. Defining the mechanisms underlying MDS HSPC maintenance is critical for developing MDS therapy. The deacetylase SIRT1 regulates stem cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal by deacetylating downstream proteins. Here we show that SIRT1 protein levels were downregulated in MDS HSPCs. Genetic or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 inhibited MDS HSPC functions, whereas SIRT1 deficiency enhanced MDS HSPC self-renewal. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 were dependent on TET2, a safeguard against HSPC transformation. SIRT1 deacetylated TET2 at conserved lysine residues in its catalytic domain, enhancing TET2 activity. Our genome-wide analysis identified cancer-related genes regulated by the SIRT1/TET2 axis. SIRT1 activation also inhibited functions of MDS HSPCs from patients with TET2 heterozygous mutations. Altogether, our results indicate that restoring TET2 function through SIRT1 activation represents a promising means to target MDS HSPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2888951606,"Age-related sensory impairment is a slow and gradual progress, which affects multiple modalities. Two contradictory hypotheses exist about the age-related decline of sensory thresholds. The common factor theory assumes one underlying factor—which accounts for the loss of several sensory modalities simultaneously—and the specific factor theory predicts that the sensory decline is uncorrelated between different modalities. In this study, we aimed to explore whether (i) there is a common factor of sensory thresholds in older people, (ii) older people assume that sensory decline in one modality also affects other modalities, (iii) there is a relation between sensory threshold and the subjective assessment of sensory function. This was accomplished by collecting both threshold measures and self-reported ratings for smell, hearing, taste, vision, and touch function in a group of 104 older people (mean age: 67.2 years; SD: 9.85; range: 50–100 years). Results indicated that there was no common factor of sensory thresholds, hence an impairment in one modality did not necessarily imply a shortfall in other modalities. In contrast, our results suggested one or two common factor(s) for the participants’ ratings. Participants who reported a diminished function in one sense tended to generalize this rating to the other senses as well. The correspondence between subjective ratings and sensory thresholds was relatively good for vision and audition, although no correlations were observed for the other domains. These findings have implications for clinicians, suggesting that subjective measures should be combined with sensory threshold measurements when evaluating sensory dysfunction. Also, these data convey a positive message for older people and their physicians by showing that loss in one sensory modality does not necessarily generalize to losses across all sensory modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2888510300,"Reward-seeking behavior is regulated by a diverse collection of inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The information encoded in each excitatory afferent to the NAc is unknown, in part because it is unclear when these pathways are active in relation to behavior. Here we compare the activity profiles of amygdala, hippocampal, and thalamic inputs to the NAc shell in mice performing a cued reward-seeking task using GCaMP-based fiber photometry. We find that the rostral and caudal ends of the NAc shell are innervated by distinct but intermingled populations of forebrain neurons that exhibit divergent feeding-related activity. In the rostral NAc shell, a coordinated network-wide reduction in excitatory drive correlates with feeding, and reduced input from individual pathways is sufficient to promote it. Overall, the data suggest that pathway-specific input activity at a population level may vary more across the NAc than between pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2888440394,"As somatic cells are converted into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), their chromatin is remodeled to a pluripotent configuration with unique euchromatin-to-heterochromatin ratios, DNA methylation patterns, and enhancer and promoter status. The molecular machinery underlying this process is largely unknown. Here, we show that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific factors Dppa2 and Dppa4 play a key role in resetting the epigenome to a pluripotent state. They are induced in reprogramming intermediates, function as a heterodimer, and are required for efficient reprogramming of mouse and human cells. When co-expressed with Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and Myc (OKSM) factors, Dppa2/4 yield reprogramming efficiencies that exceed 80% and accelerate reprogramming kinetics, generating iPSCs in 2 to 4 days. When bound to chromatin, Dppa2/4 initiate global chromatin decompaction via the DNA damage response pathway and contribute to downregulation of somatic genes and activation of ESC enhancers, all of which enables an efficient transition to pluripotency. Our work provides critical insights into how the epigenome is remodeled during acquisition of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2889393737,"Neuropathic pain remains a therapeutic challenge because of its complicated mechanisms. Mas-related GPCR D (MrgprD) is specifically expressed in small-diameter, nociceptive neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and is implicated in pain modulation. However, the underlying mechanism of MrgprD involved in neuropathic pain remains elusive. In this study, we used behavioral experiments and physiologic examination methods to investigate the role of MrgprD in chronic constriction injury (CCI)–induced neuropathic pain. We found that MrgprD is necessary for the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity and cold allodynia, but not for heat allodynia. Moreover, we demonstrated that transient receptor potential cation channel (TRP)-A1 was the ion channel downstream of MrgprD, and the β-alanine–induced calcium signal was attributed mostly to TRP-A1 function. We further showed that PKA serves as a downstream mediator of β-alanine–activated MrgprD signaling to activate TRP-A1 in DRG neurons and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, to coexpress MrgprD and TRP-A1 plasmids. Finally, we found that the β-alanine–induced pain behavior was increased, whereas the itching behavior was unchanged in CCI models compared with sham-injured animals. Knockout of TRPA1 also attenuated the β-alanine–induced pain behavior in CCI models. In conclusion, MrgprD is essential in cold allodynia in CCI-induced neuropathic pain through the PKA–TRP-A1 pathway. TRP-A1 facilitates MrgprD to development of neuropathic pain. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of neuropathic pain formation and highlight MrgprD as a promising drug target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.—Wang, C., Gu, L., Ruan, Y., Geng, X., Xu, M., Yang, N., Yu, L., Jiang, Y., Zhu, C., Yang, Y., Zhou, Y., Guan, X., Luo, W., Liu, Q., Dong, X., Yu, G., Lan, L., Tang, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2889400743,"Emerging evidence indicates that G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), a nonclassic receptor of the endocannabinoid system that is activated by L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol and various cannabinoid ligands, may regulate endocrine function and energy metabolism. We examined how GPR55 deficiency and modulation affects insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver alongside expression analysis of proteins implicated in insulin action and energy metabolism. We show that GPR55-null mice display decreased insulin sensitivity in these tissues, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its downstream targets, concomitant with increased adiposity and reduced physical activity relative to wild-type counterparts. Impaired tissue insulin sensitivity coincided with reduced insulin receptor substrate-1 abundance in skeletal muscle, whereas in liver and epididymal fat it was associated with increased expression of the 3-phosphoinoistide lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog. In contrast, GPR55 activation enhanced insulin signaling in cultured skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, and hepatocytes; this response was negated by receptor antagonists and GPR55 gene silencing in L6 myotubes. Sustained GPR55 antagonism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes enhanced expression of proteins implicated in lipogenesis and promoted triglyceride accumulation.

https://openalex.org/W2888239704,"Sensitization is a simple form of behavioral plasticity by which an initial stimulus, often signaling danger, leads to increased responsiveness to subsequent stimuli. Cross-modal sensitization is an important feature of arousal in many organisms, yet its molecular and neural mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that in C. elegans, aversive mechanical stimuli lead to both enhanced locomotor activity and sensitization of aversive chemosensory pathways. Both locomotor arousal and cross-modal sensitization depend on the release of FLP-20 neuropeptides from primary mechanosensory neurons and on their receptor FRPR-3. Surprisingly, the critical site of action of FRPR-3 for both sensory and locomotor arousal is RID, a single neuroendocrine cell specialized for the release of neuropeptides that responds to mechanical stimuli in a FLP-20-dependent manner. Thus, FLP-20 peptides function as an afferent arousal signal that conveys mechanosensory information to central neurons that modulate arousal and other behavioral states."

Cells and their exosomes were from harvested human kidneys declined for transplantation. Injections of either cells or exosomes, given after 24 and 48 hours of reperfusion, preserved renal function and structure in both treatment groups. However, exosomes were superior to cells; and maintained renal vascular and epithelial networks, prevented renal oxidant stress, and apoptosis; and restrained activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic pathways. Exosomes worked in 24 hours, consistent with functional rather than regenerative activity. Comprehensive proteomic analysis identified 6152 renal proteins from all cellular compartments; and 628 were altered by ischemia at all cell levels, while 377 were significantly improved by exosome infusions. We conclude that renal damage from severe ischemia was broad, and human renal exosomes prevented most protein alterations. Thus, exosomes seem to acutely correct a critical and consequential abnormality during reperfusion. In their absence, renal structure and cells transition to a chronic state of fibrosis and extensive renal cell loss."

Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 men in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania who socialize in networks locally referred to as “camps”. Men reported privacy, confidentiality, and saving time as the primary reasons for their self-testing interest. Most participants had high perceived control and self-efficacy to self-test and seek confirmatory HIV testing. Nevertheless, men reported concerns related to their ability to perform the test and the potential lack of post-test counseling. Specific recommendations for the intervention included providing HIVST education and pre-test counseling, and using mobile health (mHealth) strategies for participants to reach a healthcare professional for further assistance. The findings suggest that while HIVST is highly acceptable among men in Tanzania, future interventions will need to address the challenges that men may face with HIVST before promoting it as an alternative or supplement to facility-based HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W2888852351,"Microglia are the macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), which function to monitor and maintain homeostasis. Microglial activation occurs after CNS injury, infection or disease. Prolonged microglial activation is detrimental to the CNS as they produce nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in neuronal cell dysfunction and death. Microglial activation is implicated in the neurological deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer's disease. Intranasal insulin administration is a promising treatment of Alzheimer's disease and TBI. However, the exact effect of insulin on microglia is currently unclear. The goal of this study was therefore to examine the effect of insulin administration on activated microglia. The microglial cell line BV2 were exposed to a pro-inflammatory stimulus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by insulin administration. Outcome measures were conducted at 24 hours after treatment. In vitro assays quantified NO and ROS production. Western blot, immunocytochemistry and phagocytosis assay further examined the effect of insulin on microglial activity. Insulin treatment significantly reduced NO, ROS and TNFα production and increased phagocytic activity. Insulin treatment also significantly reduced iNOS expression, but had no significant effect on any other M1 or M2 macrophage polarization marker examined. These data suggest that insulin has very specific effects to reduce pro-inflammatory or chemoattractant properties of microglia, and this may be one mechanism by which insulin has beneficial effects in CNS injury or neurodegenerative conditions."

While remodeling of individual neuronal populations has been studied, how neuronal circuits remodel-and whether remodeling of synaptic partners is coordinated-is unknown. We found that the Drosophila anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron undergoes stereotypic remodeling during metamorphosis in a similar time frame as the mushroom body (MB) ɣ-neurons, with whom it forms a functional circuit. By simultaneously manipulating both neuronal populations, we found that cell-autonomous inhibition of ɣ-neuron pruning resulted in the inhibition of APL pruning in a process that is mediated, at least in part, by Ca2+-Calmodulin and neuronal activity dependent interaction. Finally, ectopic unpruned MB ɣ axons display ectopic connections with the APL, as well as with other neurons, at the adult, suggesting that inhibiting remodeling of one neuronal type can affect the functional wiring of the entire micro-circuit."

We developed a probabilistic statistical model of hippocampal spontaneous sequential activity and revealed existence of an internal model of generative predictive codes for the regularities of multiple future novel spatial sequences. During navigation, the inferred difference between external stimuli and the internal model was encoded by emergence of intrinsic-unlikely, novel functional connections, which updated the model by preferentially potentiating post-experience. This internal model and these predictive codes depended on neuronal organization into inferred modules of short, high-repeat sequential neuronal ""tuplets"" operating as ""neuro-codons.""

https://openalex.org/W2889283384,"Hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) alleviates the selective and delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region induced by transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI). This type of cell death may include different programmed cell death mechanisms, namely, apoptosis and necroptosis. Although apoptotic signaling is well defined, the mechanisms that underlie neuronal necroptosis are yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether HPC protects neurons from cerebral ischemia-induced necroptosis. We observed that tGCI up-regulated the expression of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 3 and increased the interaction of RIP1-RIP3 in CA1 at the early stage of reperfusion. The pretreatment with HPC or necrostatin-1 decreased the expression of RIP3 and the formation of RIP1-RIP3 after tGCI. We also found that HPC decreased the expression and the activity of caspase-8 in CA1 after tGCI, and notably, the pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, did not trigger necroptosis but attenuated the tGCI-induced neuronal damage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HPC decreased the activation of calcium-calmodulin kinase (CaMK) IIα and the interaction of RIP1 and CaMKIIα induced by tGCI. Intriguingly, the pretreatment with a CaMKs inhibitor KN-93 before tGCI resulted in significantly reduced RIP1-3 interaction and tGCI-induced neuronal damage. Finally, we ascertained that HPC prevented the dephosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-Ser637 (serine 637) and inhibited the translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria induced by tGCI. Importantly, the treatment with a Drp1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 or necrostatin-1 before tGCI also abolished Drp1 dephosphorylation at Ser637 and mitochondrial translocation. Taken together, our results highlight that HPC attenuates necroptotic neuronal death induced by tGCI via Drp1-dependent mitochondrial signaling pathways mediated by CaMKIIα inactivation.-Zhan, L., Lu, Z., Zhu, X., Xu, W., Li, L., Li, X., Chen, S., Sun, W., Xu, E.

Hemp seed hexane extracts (HSHE) showed anti-microbial activity against P. acnes. The expression of iNOS, COX-2, and the subsequent production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin increased after infection of P. acnes in HaCaT cells, however, upon treating with HSHE, their expressions were reduced. P. acnes-induced expressions of IL-1β and IL-8 were also reduced. HSHE exerted anti-inflammatory effects by regulating NF-κB and MAPKs signaling and blunting the translocation of p-NF-κB to the nucleus in P. acnes-stimulated HaCaT cells. Moreover, P. acnes-induced phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, and their downstream targets c-Fos and c-Jun, was also inhibited by HSHE. In addition, the transactivation of AP-1 induced by P. acnes infection was also downregulated by HSHE. Notably, HSHE regulated inflammation and lipid biosynthesis via regulating AMPK and AKT/FoxO1 signaling in IGF-1-induced inflammation and lipogenesis of sebocytes. In addition, HSHE inhibited 5-lipoxygenase level and P. acnes-induced MMP-9 activity, and promoted collagen biosynthesis in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2889367149,"The present study aimed to identify molecules associated with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI) and to examine their biological behavior in colorectal cancer (CRC). LVI- and PNI-associated molecules were identified and verified using sequential processes including (1) identification of 117 recurrence-associated genes differentially expressed on RNA-seq analysis using primary cancer tissues from 130 CRC patients with and without systemic recurrence; (2) analysis of molecules associated with LVI and PNI; (3) assessment of biological properties by measuring proliferation, anoikis, invasion/migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and autophagy flux; and (4) verification of disease-free survival using public datasets. Gelsolin (GSN) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2) were associated with PNI and LVI, respectively. Invasion potential was >2-fold greater in GSN-overexpressing LoVo cells than in control cells (p<0.001–0.005), whereas OAS2-overexpressing RKO cells showed reduced invasion (p<0.001–0.005). GSN downregulated E-cadherin, β-catenin, claudin-1 and snail, and upregulated N-cadherin and ZEB1, whereas OAS2 overexpression had the opposite effects. Several autophagy-related proteins including ATG5-12, ATG6/BECN1, ATG7 and ATG101 were downregulated in GSN-overexpressing LoVo cells, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in OAS2-overexpressing RKO cells. Patients with low GSN expression had significantly higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates than those with GSN overexpression (73.6% vs. 64.7%, p = 0.038), whereas RFS was longer in patients with OAS2 overexpression than in those with underexpression (73.4% vs. 63.7%, p = 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W2889254343,"Metastatic growth is the leading cause of cancer-related death in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Metastasis is believed to be initiated by an increase in cell motility mediated by the loss of cell-cell adhesion because of the suppression of E-cadherin [encoded by cadherin 1 ( CDH1)]. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of CDH1 regulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that non-small cell lung cancer-associated transcript-1 (NSCLCAT1) suppresses functional CDH1 and mediates the Hippo signaling pathway, resulting in increased cell migration and invasion, and reduced apoptosis. Initially, microarray profiling and target prediction programs were employed to identify whether NSCLCAT1 targets CDH1. Next, quantitative PCR was used to determine the expression pattern of NSCLCAT1 in 114 specimens. The biologic functions of NSCLCAT1 in NSCLC were assessed through the up-regulation and down-regulation of the levels of endogenous NSCLCAT1 with the use of NSCLCAT1 vector or small interfering RNA against NSCLCAT1 in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the Hippo signaling pathway in NSCLC cells was blocked by applying the verteporfin treatment to have a better understanding on the pivotal role of the Hippo signaling pathway in NSCLC. Microarray expression profiles of long noncoding RNAs, GSE19804 and GSE27262), revealed that NSCLCAT1 was up-regulated in NSCLC. Among patients with NSCLC, we determined that the NSCLCAT1 was robustly induced, whereas CDH1 was suppressed. The luciferase activity determination identified CDH1 as a NSCLCAT1 target. NSCLCAT1 was found to increase cell viability, migration, and invasion and to reduce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. The results from the quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that NSCLCAT1 modulated the Hippo signaling pathway. Furthermore, the inhibition of the Hippo signaling pathway by verteporfin treatment led to the loss of the effect of NSCLCAT1 on NSCLC cells. In summary, our findings suggested that NSCLCAT1 potentially has a role in NSCLC and NSCLCAT1-mediated regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway through the transcriptional repression of CDH1; therefore, the functional suppression or inhibition of NSCLCAT1 could be used as a novel therapeutic pathway in the control of aggressive and metastatic NSCLC.-Zhao, W., Zhang, L.-N., Wang, X.-L., Zhang, J., Yu, H.-X. Long noncoding RNA NSCLCAT1 increases non-small cell lung cancer cell invasion and migration through the Hippo signaling pathway by interacting with CDH1."
https://openalex.org/W2888913342,"Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant global health problem. Women who experience IPV have increased HIV incidence, reduced antiretroviral adherence, and a lower likelihood of viral load suppression. There is a lack of evidence regarding how to effectively identify and support women living with HIV (WLWH) experiencing IPV, including uncertainty whether universal or targeted screening is most appropriate for lower-resourced settings. We examined physical and sexual IPV prevalence and correlates among WLWH in Uganda to understand the burden of IPV and factors that could help identify women at risk. Methods We utilized data from women receiving ART and enrolled in the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) cohort study between 2011 and 2015. Bloodwork and interviewer-administered questionnaires were completed every 4 months. IPV was assessed annually or with any new pregnancy. Multivariate models assessed independent socio-demographic and clinical factors correlated with IPV, at baseline and follow-up visits. Results 455 WLWH were included. Median age was 36 years, 43% were married, and median follow-up was 2.8 years. At baseline 131 women (29%) reported any experience of past or current IPV. In the adjusted models, being married was associated with a higher risk of baseline IPV (ARR 2.33, 95% CI 1.13–4.81) and follow-up IPV (ARR 2.43, 95% CI 1.33–4.45). Older age (ARR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.99) and higher household asset index score (ARR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68–0.96) were associated with lower risk of IPV during follow-up. Conclusion There was a high prevalence of physical and sexual IPV amongst WLWH, and many women experienced both types of violence. These findings suggest the need for clinic-based screening for IPV. If universal screening is not feasible, correlates of having experienced IPV can inform targeted approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2889304675,"Pleural tuberculosis (PlTB) is the most common extrapulmonary manifestation of this infectious disease which still presents high mortality rates worldwide. Conventional diagnostic tests for PlTB register multiple limitations, including the lack of sensitivity of microbiological methods on pleural specimens and the need of invasive procedures such as pleural biopsy performance. In this scenario, the search for biological markers on pleural fluid (PF) has been the target of several studies as a strategy to overcome the limitations of PlTB diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the use either isolated or in combination with adenosine deaminase (ADA), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interferon-gamma inducible protein of 10-kD (IP-10) levels on PF in order to guide an accurate anti-TB treatment in microbiologically non-confirmed cases.Eighty patients presenting pleural effusion under investigation were enrolled in a cross-sectional study conducted at Pedro Ernesto University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. Peripheral blood (PB) and PF samples collected from all patients were applied to the commercial IFN-γ release assay, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and samples were analyzed for IFN-γ and IP-10 by immunoassays. ADA activity was determined on PF by the colorimetric method. Based on microbiological and histological criteria, patients were categorized as follow: confirmed PlTB (n = 16), non-confirmed PlTB (n = 17) and non-PlTB (n = 47). The Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific production of IFN-γ and IP-10 on PB or PF did not show significant differences. However, the basal levels of these biomarkers, as well as the ADA activity on PF, were significantly increased in confirmed PlTB in comparison to non-PlTB group. Receiver operating characteristics curves were performed and the best cut-off points of these three biomarkers were estimated. Their either isolated or combined performances (sensitivity [Se], specificity [Sp], positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV] and accuracy [Acc]) were determined and applied to Venn's diagrams among the groups. Based on the confirmed PlTB cases, IFN-γ showed the best performance of them at a cut-off point of 2.33 IU/mL (Se = 93.8% and Sp = 97.9%) followed by ADA at a cut-off of 25.80 IU/L (Se = 100% and Sp = 84.8%) and IP-10 (Cut-point = 4,361.90 pg/mL, Se = 75% and Sp = 82.6%). IFN-γ plus ADA (cut-point: 25.80 IU/L) represent the most accurate biomarker combination (98.4%), showing Se = 93.7%, Sp = 100%, PPV = 100% and NPV = 97.9%. When this analysis was applied in non-confirmed PlTB, 15/17 (88.2%) presented at least two positive biomarkers in combination.IFN-γ, IP-10, and ADA in PlTB effusions are significantly higher than in non-PlTB cases. IFN-γ is an excellent rule-in and rule-out test compared to IP-10 and ADA. The combination of IFN-γ and ADA, in a reviewed cut-off point, showed to be particularly useful to clinicians as their positive results combined prompts immediate treatment for TB while both negative results suggest further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2889291228,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating neurological disease, which is characterized by multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system. The most abundant myelin lipids are galactosylceramides and their sulfated form, sulfatides, which together account for about 27% of the total dry weight of myelin. In this study we investigated the role of vitamin K in remyelination, by using an animal model for MS, the cuprizone model. Demyelination was induced in C57Bl6/J mice, by feeding them a special diet containing 0.3% cuprizone (w/w) for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, cuprizone was removed from the diet and mice were allowed to remyelinate for either 1 or 3 weeks, in the absence or presence of vitamin K (i.p. phylloquinone, 2mg, three times per week). Vitamin K enhanced the production of total brain sulfatides, after both 1 week and 3 weeks of remyelination (n = 5, P-values were <0.0001), when compared with the control group. To determine whether or not there is a synergistic effect between vitamins K and D for the production of brain sulfatides, we employed a similar experiment as above. Vitamin K also increased the production of individual brain sulfatides, including d18:1/18:0, d18:1/20:0, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/24:1 after 3 weeks of remyelination, when compared to the control group. In addition, vitamin D enhanced the production of total brain sulfatides, as well as d18:1/18:0, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/24:1 sulfatides after 3 weeks of remyelination, but no synergistic effect between vitamins K and D for the production of total brain sulfatides was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2888985332,"Arthropod vectors are responsible for the transmission of human pathogens worldwide. Several arthropod species are bird ectoparasites, however, no study to date has characterized their microbiota as a whole. We sampled hematophagous ectoparasites that feed on migratory birds and performed 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to characterize their microbial community. A total of 194 ectoparasites were collected from 115 avian hosts and classified into three groups: a) Hippoboscidae diptera; b) ticks; c) other arthropods. Metabarcoding showed that endosymbionts were the most abundant genera of the microbial community, including Wolbachia for Hippoboscidae diptera, Candidatus Midichloria for ticks, Wolbachia and Arsenophonus for the other arthropod group. Genera including pathogenic species were: Rickettsia, Borrelia, Coxiella, Francisella, Bartonella, Anaplasma. Co-infection with Borrelia-Rickettsia and Anaplasma-Rickettsia was also observed. A global overview of the microbiota of ectoparasites sampled from migratory birds was obtained with the use of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. A novel finding is the first identification of Rickettsia in the common swift louse fly, Crataerina pallida. Given their possible interaction with pathogenic viruses and bacteria, the presence of endosymbionts in arthropods merits attention. Finally, molecular characterization of genera, including both pathogenic and symbiont species, plays a pivotal role in the design of targeted molecular diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2889073289,"The physiologic signals that regulate beige adipogenesis remain incompletely understood, especially those that limit browning and prevent overexpenditure of energy. In this study, the TNF family member cytokine lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry on T cells (LIGHT), also known as TNF super family protein 14 (TNFSF14), can inhibit adipose precursor differentiation into beige adipocytes. In acute cold stress, LIGHT deficiency in mice accelerated browning in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Further experiments showed that LIGHT interacting with lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) on adipose precursors blocked beige fat biogenesis. LTβR signals attenuated the JNK pathway, which contributed to their antibeiging effect. Blocking JNK activation using a small molecular inhibitor prevented cold-induced scWAT beiging. Furthermore, LIGHT/LTβR signals acted as an attenuator of white adipogenesis. LIGHT deficiency in mice promoted obesity during high-fat diet feeding. These findings identify the LIGHT axis as a regulator of adipose tissue homeostasis and suggest that LIGHT signaling functions as a mechanism to divert energy in favor of immune activation.—Kou, Y., Liu, Q., Liu, W., Sun, H., Liang, M., Kong, F., Zhang, B., Wei, Y., Liu, Z., Wang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2889318470,"Background Accurate national information on dietary intakes, including heterogeneity among individuals, is critical to inform health implications and policy priorities. In low- and middle-income countries, household expenditure surveys constitute the major source of food data, but with uncertain validity for individual-level intakes. Objective To investigate how individualized dietary consumption estimated from household survey data compared with individual-level 24-hr dietary recalls (24hR); and to assess potential heterogeneity by method for individualizing household intakes, dietary indicator, and individual characteristics (age, sex, education, religion, household income). Methods We evaluated data from the 2011–2012 Bangladesh Household Integrated Survey (BIHS), which included household-level consumption data (5,503 households) and individual-level dietary data based on 24hR from these households (22,173 participants). Household and 24hR estimates were standardized and harmonized for 33 dietary indicators, including 9 food groups, total energy, 8 macronutrients, and 15 micronutrients. Individual consumption was estimated from household data using two approaches, the Adult Male Equivalent (AME) and per capita (PC) approach. For each dietary indicator, differences in household vs. individual mean estimates were evaluated overall and by strata of individual characteristics, using Spearman’s correlations and univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Results Individualized household estimates overestimated individual intakes from 24hR for all dietary factors using either estimation method (P<0.001 for each), except for starchy vegetables (AME: P = 0.15; PC: P = 0.85). For foods, overestimation ranged from 4% for seafood to about 240% for fruits, and for nutrients from 11% for carbohydrates and poly-unsaturated fats to 55% for vitamin C, with similar overestimation for the AME and the PC method. By strata, overestimation was modestly higher in men vs. women, in children (0-10y) vs. adolescents (11-19y) and adults (20-44y, ≥45y), among adults of higher (≥6y) vs. lower (<6y) education, in Muslims vs. other religions (Christians, Hindus), and for the lowest vs. all other income groups. This overestimation was notably higher in young children (0-5y) vs. all other age groups and in the lowest vs. all other income groups. Underestimation was rarely observed, for example for milk intake (-56%) in young children (0-5y). The PC approach did not capture heterogeneity in validity of estimation of different dietary factors by age, mainly in children (0-5y, 6-10y). Spearman's correlations between individualized household estimates and 24hR data were higher for the AME (0.30–0.70) than PC (0.20–0.50) approach. Findings were similar with and without multivariate regression, with proportions of variance (R2) in 24hR intakes explained by the AME being generally greater than PC estimates, yet still low to modest. Conclusions In this national survey, established methods for estimating individual level intakes from household surveys produce overestimation of intakes of nearly all dietary indicators, with significant variation depending on the dietary factor and modest variation depending on individual characteristics. These findings suggest a need for new methods to estimate individual-level consumption from household survey estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2888879229,"In pigs, the alpha-(1,2) fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been highlighted for its properties in controlling the intestinal expression of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) F18 receptors; a pathogen causing edema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea. In this study, we hypothesized that pigs with different genotypes (ETEC F18 resistant (FUT1AA) versus susceptible (FUT1AG)) differed in following systemic and enteric responses: growth performance, plasma metabolic profiles, expression of candidate genes for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and immunity, number of selected bacteria and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in faeces and digesta in piglets pre and post-weaning, and on the ETEC F18 adherence ex vivo. Genotype had the strongest impact on plasma metabolomic profile on day 7 and 28 of age. FUT1AG piglets had higher level of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, hippuric acid, oxindole, and 3-oxo-5-beta-chol-7-en-24-oic acid on day 7, and a higher level of guanosine on day 28 than that in the FUT1AA piglets. FUT1AA piglets had a higher level of betaine on day 7 and 3-methylguanine on day 28. On day 34 of age, the FUT1AA pigs had higher levels of S-2-hydroxyglutarate, L-phenylalanine, tauroursodeoxycholic acid and an undetermined PC/LysoPC, while Ile Glu Phe Gly peptide and genistein 5-O-glucuronide, and PC (18:0/0:0) were at higher levels in the FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype did not affect the growth performance and expression of candidate genes. FUT1AG piglets had a higher number of haemolytic bacteria in faeces and in digesta than that in FUT1AA at 34 days of age. The colonic acetic acid concentration was highest in FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype may influence not only the expression of E. coli F18 receptors but could potentially impact the gut homeostasis and metabotype of piglets pre and post-weaning. Further investigations on the relation between FUT1 genotype and these aspects including the intestinal commensal microbiota will expand the knowledge on factors affecting the intestinal ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2888907481,"Application of a phonological rule is often conditioned by prosodic structure, which may create a potential perceptual ambiguity, calling for phonological inferencing. Three eye-tracking experiments were conducted to examine how spoken word recognition may be modulated by the interaction between the prosodically-conditioned rule application and phonological inferencing. The rule examined was post-obstruent tensing (POT) in Korean, which changes a lax consonant into a tense after an obstruent only within a prosodic domain of Accentual Phrase (AP). Results of Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that, upon hearing a derived tense form, listeners indeed recovered its underlying (lax) form. The phonological inferencing effect, however, was observed only in the absence of its tense competitor which was acoustically matched with the auditory input. In Experiment 3, a prosodic cue to an AP boundary (which blocks POT) was created before the target using an F0 cue alone (i.e., without any temporal cues), and the phonological inferencing effect disappeared. This supports the view that phonological inferencing is modulated by listeners’ online computation of prosodic structure (rather than through a low-level temporal normalization). Further analyses of the time course of eye movement suggested that the prosodic modulation effect occurred relatively later in the lexical processing. This implies that speech processing involves segmental processing in conjunction with prosodic structural analysis, and calls for further research on how prosodic information is processed along with segmental information in language-specific vs. universally applicable ways."
https://openalex.org/W2888975165,"Healthcare-associated infections have increasingly become problematic in the endoscopic procedures resulting in several severe diseases such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)-related infections, pneumonia, and bacteremia. Especially, some bacterial strains are resistant to traditional antimicrobials. Therefore, the necessity of developing new antibiotics or management to deal with bacterial infections has been increasing. The current study combined a low concentration of glutaraldehyde (GTA) with near-infrared (NIR) light and 405-nm laser to entail antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and colony forming unit (CFU) counting were used to quantify the viable cells while fluorescent and scanning electron microscopic images were used to qualitatively evaluate the cell membrane integrity and structural deformation, respectively. Practically, S. aureus biofilm was highly susceptible (7% cell viability and 6.8-log CFU/cm2 bacterial reduction for MTT assay and CFU analysis, respectively) to the combination of GTA (0.1%), NIR light (270 J/cm2), and 405-nm laser (288 J/cm2) exposure. GTA could form either DNA-protein or protein-protein crosslinks to inhibit DNA and protein synthesis. The NIR light induced the thermal damage on protein/enzymes while 405-nm laser could induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to damage the bacterial membrane. Thus, the proposed technique may be a feasible modality for endoscope cleaning to prevent any secondary infection in the healthcare industry."

The disease attacks the host's lungs and may disseminate to many other organs. Treatment involves amphotericin B, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or fluconazole. The treatment duration is usually long, from 6 months to 2 years, and many adverse effects may occur in relation to the treatment; co-morbidities and poor treatment adherence have been noted. Therefore, the discovery of more effective and less toxic drugs is needed. Thiosemicarbazide (TSC) and a camphene derivative of thiosemicarbazide (TSC-C) were able to inhibit P. brasiliensis growth at a low dosage and were not toxic to fibroblast cells. In order to investigate the mode of action of those compounds, we used a chemoproteomic approach to determine which fungal proteins were bound to each of these compounds. The compounds were able to inhibit the activities of the enzyme formamidase and interfered in P. brasiliensis dimorphism. In comparison with the transcriptomic and proteomic data previously obtained by our group, we determined that TSC and TSC-C were multitarget compounds that exerted effects on the electron-transport chain and cell cycle regulation, increased ROS formation, inhibited proteasomes and peptidases, modulated glycolysis, lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolisms, and caused suppressed the mycelium to yeast transition."

The molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression associated with the synergistic effects of NNK and arecoline remain unclear. We treated SCC-25 and FaDu cells with NNK and arecoline (separately or in combination) for 3 months. Comparative analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism underlying the acquisition of properties related to tumor promotion, including stemness, anti-apoptosis, and resistance to HNSCC therapeutics. Long-term exposure to NNK and arecoline resulted in an increase in cancer stem cell properties, anti-apoptosis, and the resistance to cisplatin in HNSCC. We detected abundant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in HNSCC cells after combined treatment with NNK and arecoline. EGFR was pivotal in inducing tumor promotion and anti-apoptosis in cancer cells by inducing pAKT and NFκB. Combined treatment with NNK and arecoline synergistically facilitated tumor aggressiveness via EGFR–AKT signaling. Targeting EGFR–AKT signaling may be a feasible strategy for treating HNSCC."

We generated and analyzed Klhl3 knock-in (KI) mice carrying a missense M131V mutation in the BTB domain (corresponding to human KLHL3 M78V mutation). Klhl3M131V/+ KI mice exhibited typical PHAII phenotype with an exaggerated diuretic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Their kidney tissues showed an unchanged KLHL3, decreased cullin 3 (Cul3), and increased with-no-lysine kinases (WNKs) WNK1 and WNK4 along with an enhanced downstream ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase/oxidative stress response kinase 1-N(K)CC phosphorylation. Their Cul3 protein in the cytosol of distal convoluted tubule cells was also significantly attenuated on immunogold-labeling electron microscopy. In micro-dissected renal tubules, Klhl3M131V/+ KI mice expressed high levels of Wnk4 mRNA in the distal nephron. In vitro coimmunoprecipitation showed the KLHL3 BTB domain mutation retained intact interaction with WNKs but reduced binding to Cul3, thus leading to the increased abundance of total WNKs.

https://openalex.org/W2888851697,"Purpose This study evaluated changes in choroidal vascularity after half-fluence photodynamic therapy (HF-PDT) in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) en face imaging. Methods This retrospective comparative case series included 50 eyes of 25 patients with unilateral CSC who underwent HF-PDT and 50 age-and sex-matched normal healthy control eyes. En face SS-OCT images of the choriocapillaris, Sattler’s layer, and Haller’s layer were converted into binary images. The vascular proportions were defined as the percentage of the area of vascular lumen against the area of the 3.0-mm-diameter circular area. The main outcome measures were the vascular proportions before HF-PDT and at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after HF-PDT. Results At baseline, the vascular proportions in the CSC eyes were significantly greater than those in the control eyes in all layers (choriocapillaris: 51.8% ± 15.5% vs. 41.3 ± 18.7%, P = 0.018; Sattler’s: 58.6% ± 13.4% vs. 49.7% ± 15.7%, P = 0.017; Haller’s: 65.3% ± 15.3% vs. 53.0% ± 13.4%, P = 0.001). In the CSC eyes, the vascular proportion in the choriocapillaris significantly decreased at 6 weeks (36.6% ± 16.9%, P < 0.001), 6 months (34.0% ± 12.3%, P < 0.001), and 12 months (34.8% ± 17.6%, P < 0.001) after HF-PDT compared with baseline. The vascular proportions in Sattler’s and Haller’s layers did not show a significant decrease at 6 weeks (Sattler’s: 49.7% ± 17.3%, P = 0.052 and Haller’s: 58.3% ± 12.9%, P = 0.558) but decreased significantly at 6 months (Sattler’s: 48.9% ± 12.4%, P < 0.001 and Haller’s: 57.7% ± 15.7%, P = 0.027) and 12 months after HF-PDT from the baseline values (Sattler’s: 45.8% ± 10.4%, P < 0.001 and Haller’s: 56.8% ± 15.7%, P < 0.001). Conclusion After HF-PDT, the choriocapillaris showed the earliest decrease in vascular proportion of en face images, Sattler’s and Haller’s layers showed later decreases. The temporal differences in the response of each layer may reflect the pathophysiology of CSC and the therapeutic mechanism of HF-PDT."
https://openalex.org/W2902298837,"A mathematical model was developed for mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) growth in a packed bed bioreactor that improves oxygen availability by allowing oxygen diffusion through a gas-permeable wall. The governing equations for oxygen, glucose and lactate, the inhibitory waste product, were developed assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, together with an equation for the medium flow based on Darcy’s Law. The conservation law for the cells includes the effects of inhibition as the cells reach confluence, nutrient and waste product concentrations, and the assumption that the cells can migrate on the scaffold. The equations were solved using the finite element package, COMSOL. Previous experimental results collected using a packed bed bioreactor with gas permeable walls to expand MSCs produced a lower cell yield than was obtained using a traditional cell culture flask. This mathematical model suggests that the main contributors to the observed low cell yield were a non-uniform initial cell seeding profile and a potential lag phase as cells recovered from the initial seeding procedure. Lactate build-up was predicted to have only a small effect at lower flow rates. Thus, the most important parameters to optimise cell expansion in the proliferation of MSCs in a bioreactor with gas permeable wall are the initial cell seeding protocol and the handling of the cells during the seeding process. The mathematical model was then used to identify and characterise potential enhancements to the bioreactor design, including incorporating a central gas permeable capillary to further enhance oxygen availability to the cells. Finally, to evaluate the issues and limitations that might be encountered scale-up of the bioreactor, the mathematical model was used to investigate modifications to the bioreactor design geometry and packing density."
https://openalex.org/W2889532739,"Cumulus-free in vitro maturation (IVM) provides a powerful tool to manipulate immature oocytes, but IVM oocytes lead to poor development after fertilization. Supplementation of the culture medium with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid, has been reported to improve the development of embryos derived from in vivo fertilized (IVF) embryos after in vitro culture (IVC) by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, it remains unclear if TUDCA can improve development of IVM-IVF embryos. Here, we examined whether TUDCA treatment could improve embryonic development during or after IVM. Immature GV oocytes collected from ovaries of ICR female mice that were free from cumulus cells were subjected to IVM in αMEM containing 5% FBS for 16 h. TUDCA was added to the media at varying concentrations (0–1000 μM) during IVM and IVC. TUDCA treatment during IVM reduced both MII and pronuclear (PN) rates but did not affect blastocyst rates of fertilized embryos. In contrast, TUDCA treatment during IVC significantly increased blastocyst formation rates in a concentration dependent manner. Finally, embryo transfer after TUDCA treatment revealed a significant improvement in the rates of offspring production (15% with 1000 μM TUDCA vs. 6.0% control). These results show that treatment with 1000 μM of TUDCA significantly can improve poor embryonic development of cumulus-free IVM-IVF embryos."

We recently completed a randomized, controlled trial of a peer mentoring intervention, which failed to increase retention in care or HIV suppression. We sought to gain insight into this negative result and elicit suggestions for future interventions. We conducted semi-structured one-on-one interviews with a sub-sample of participants and all available interventionists after completion of the primary study. Interviews were coded by two researchers and thematically analyzed. Participants in the intervention arm (N = 16) reported good rapport with and benefit from peer mentoring and found the mentors helpful in facilitating the transition from hospital to out-patient clinic. Control arm participants (N = 9) reported similar emotional and social support benefits from the health educators. In both arms, ongoing challenges including completing paperwork, securing transportation, and rescheduling missed appointments were cited, along with internalized stigma and lack of will to seek care, despite the mentors' best efforts. Suggested improvements to the intervention included: more frequent contact with interventionists; additional support for mental health problems; and targeting overall health rather than a more selective focus on HIV. Mentors and health educators agreed with the participant-reported barriers and added that some participants were too sick to meaningfully participate in the intervention, while others appeared unwilling to engage with the interventionists in a meaningful way. Mentoring was highly acceptable and felt to be impactful, however it was not sufficient to overcome structural barriers or stigma and low motivation in some participants. The attention control intervention may have had an unintended positive impact. Future interventions should focus on broad aspects of health and well-being."

Method A retrospective study from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015. Data were collected by the Mediterranean network and a declarative survey was completed by each maternity facility in the region to study factor which could be associated with lower caesarean rate by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results 250 564 women gave birth during this period, of which 55 097 by caesarean section. The mean caesarean delivery rate over the four years was 22.0%. The rate was significantly higher in private maternity facilities [23.9% (21.9%– 25.8%), p<0.05] and type III (maximum care level) maternity facilities [24.2% (21.3%– 27.1%), p<0.05]. After a stepwise regression, the factors associated with a decrease in the caesarean delivery rate were audits concerning caesarean delivery (19.83%, β = - 2.48, p = 0.03 over the four years) and the provision of training to trainee doctors at the maternity facility (20.28%, β = - 1.08, p = 0.04 over the four years). Conclusion Performing audits in relation to caesarean deliveries could affect the caesarean. Teaching trainee doctors could be an indicator of quality of caesarean practices. They should be encouraged in maternity facilities to reduce the rate of caesareans."

We engineered yeast strains to misincorporate serine at alanine and glycine sites on a global scale and evaluated the putative effects on the lipidome. Lipids from whole cells were extracted and analysed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC-MS) and gas chromatography (GC). Oxidative damage, fatty acid desaturation and membrane fluidity changes were screened to identify putative alterations in lipid profiles in both logarithmic (fermentative) and post-diauxic shift (respiratory) phases. There were alterations in several lipid classes, namely lyso-phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and triglyceride, and in the fatty acid profiles, namely C16:1, C16:0, C18:1 and C18:0. Overall, the relative content of lipid species with saturated FA increased in detriment of those with unsaturated fatty acids. The expression of the OLE1 mRNA was deregulated, but phospholipid fluidity changes were not observed. These data expand current knowledge of mistranslation biology and highlight its putative roles in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2889481602,"Genetic Generalized Epilepsy (GGE) and benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes or Rolandic Epilepsy (RE) are common forms of genetic epilepsies. Rare copy number variants have been recognized as important risk factors in brain disorders. We performed a systematic survey of rare deletions affecting protein-coding genes derived from exome data of patients with common forms of genetic epilepsies. We analysed exomes from 390 European patients (196 GGE and 194 RE) and 572 population controls to identify low-frequency genic deletions. We found that 75 (32 GGE and 43 RE) patients out of 390, i.e. ~19%, carried rare genic deletions. In particular, large deletions (>400 kb) represent a higher burden in both GGE and RE syndromes as compared to controls. The detected low-frequency deletions (1) share genes with brain-expressed exons that are under negative selection, (2) overlap with known autism and epilepsy-associated candidate genes, (3) are enriched for CNV intolerant genes recorded by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and (4) coincide with likely disruptive de novo mutations from the NPdenovo database. Employing several knowledge databases, we discuss the most prominent epilepsy candidate genes and their protein-protein networks for GGE and RE."
https://openalex.org/W2889152069,"Sunitinib is the standard-of-care, first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Characteristics of treatment-resistant RCC have been described; however, complex tumor adaptation mechanisms obstruct the identification of significant operators in resistance. We hypothesized that resistance is a late manifestation of early, treatment-induced histomolecular alterations; therefore, studying early drug response may identify drivers of resistance. We describe an epithelioid RCC growth pattern in RCC xenografts, which emerges in sunitinib-sensitive tumors and is augmented during resistance. This growth modality is molecularly and morphologically related to the RCC spheroids that advance during in vitro treatment. Based on time-lapse microscopy, mRNA and microRNA screening, and tumor behavior-related characteristics, we propose that the spheroid and adherent RCC growth patterns differentially respond to sunitinib. Gene expression analysis indicated that sunitinib promoted spheroid formation, which provided a selective survival advantage under treatment. Functional studies confirm that E-cadherin is a key contributor to the survival of RCC cells under sunitinib treatment. In summary, we suggest that sunitinib-resistant RCC cells exist in treatment-sensitive tumors and are histologically identifiable.—Lichner, Z., Saleeb, R., Butz, H., Ding, Q., Nofech-Mozes, R., Riad, S., Farag, M., Varkouhi, A.

https://openalex.org/W2785168783,"Analog bulletin boards are omnipresent in Swedish urban areas, yet little systematic knowledge about this communication medium exists. In the shadow of the rapid emergence of digital media the analog bulletin board has received less attention than its digital successors, many of them having incorporated similar functionality with novel technical solutions. In this study we used a citizen science method to collect 1167 messages from bulletin boards around Sweden aided by school children and teachers, with the purpose of shedding new light on what is communicated on the boards, by whom, using what types of technologies and in what way the messages refer to other media. Results show that the most common messages are invitations to events, such as concerts, lectures and sports events, followed by buy-and-sell ads for goods and services. The most frequent sender is an association, for example NGOs, sports associations or religious communities. Almost half of the sampled messages were professionally printed, about forty per cent were made by home printers. Only six per cent of the messages were handwritten, almost exclusively by private persons as senders. Moreover, we show how the analog bulletin board has adapted to recent changes in media technology—a media landscape which is saturated with electronic- and mobile media. Further, the bulletin board still holds a firm place in a media ecology where local communication is in demand, and exists in parallel with electronic media. Close to forty percent of the messages contained hyperlinks to web pages and we found (and removed for anonymization purposes) more than six hundred phone numbers from the dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2889312854,"Background Albuminuria is a predictor of disease progression in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the ability of proteinuria parameters measured at various time periods to predict renal outcomes is unclear. Method This observational cohort study included 165 non-diabetic hypertensive CKD patients who took olmesartan medoxomil. We measured the albuminuria at five different time points (0, 2, 4, 26, and 38 months) and the mean levels. The mean albuminuria levels were calculated during 0–4 months, 0–26 months, and 0–38 months. The renal outcome was defined as a decline in eGFR ≥ 40% during the entire study period. Result The albuminuria at five different time points and the mean albuminuria levels were independent risk factors for a worse renal outcome after adjusting for age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at enrollment and were able to predict the renal outcome, although the performance of the estimation tended to be more effective using the mean albuminuria level at the 38-month follow-up time point. The risk of a decline in eGFR ≥ 40% was increased by 1.690-folds [95% CI 1.110–2.572, P = 0.014] per 500 mg/day increase in the mean albuminuria at 38 months. With a cut-off value of 897 mg/day for mean albuminuria at 38 months after treatment, a decline in eGFR ≥ 40% was predicted with a sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 81.3%. The ability of albuminuria to predict a renal event at different measurement points does not differ in CKD patients. Conclusion The time-averaged albuminuria cut-off of 900 mg/day during the 3-year follow-up period showed high sensitivity and specificity for predicting a decline in eGFR ≥ 40% in CKD patients, although the albuminuria at different measurement points did not predict a worse renal outcome."
