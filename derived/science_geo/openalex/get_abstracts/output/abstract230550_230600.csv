https://openalex.org/W2020099789,"An amphiphilic hexa- peri -hexabenzocoronene self-assembles to form a π-electronic, discrete nanotubular object. The object is characterized by an aspect ratio greater than 1000 and has a uniform, 14-nanometer-wide, open-ended hollow space, which is an order of magnitude larger than those of carbon nanotubes. The wall is 3 nanometers thick and consists of helical arrays of the π-stacked graphene molecule, whose exterior and interior surfaces are covered by hydrophilic triethylene glycol chains. The graphitic nanotube is redox active, and a single piece of the nanotube across 180-nanometer-gap electrodes shows, upon oxidation, an electrical conductivity of 2.5 megohms at 285 kelvin. This family of molecularly engineered graphite with a one-dimensional tubular shape and a chemically accessible surface constitutes an important step toward molecular electronics."

Laboratory experiments show that nucleation of sulfuric acid is considerably enhanced in the presence of aromatic acids. Theoretical calculations identify the formation of an unusually stable aromatic acid–sulfuric acid complex, which likely leads to a reduced nucleation barrier. The results imply that the interaction between organic and sulfuric acids promotes efficient formation of organic and sulfate aerosols in the polluted atmosphere because of emissions from burning of fossil fuels, which strongly affect human health and global climate."
https://openalex.org/W2055456981,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in promoting mitochondrial cytochrome c release and induction of apoptosis. ROS induce dissociation of cytochrome c from cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and cytochrome c may then be released via mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-dependent or MPT-independent mechanisms. We have developed peptide antioxidants that target the IMM, and we used them to investigate the role of ROS and MPT in cell death caused by t-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP) and 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). The structural motif of these peptides centers on alternating aromatic and basic amino acid residues, with dimethyltyrosine providing scavenging properties. These peptide antioxidants are cell-permeable and concentrate 1000-fold in the IMM. They potently reduced intracellular ROS and cell death caused by tBHP in neuronal N2A cells (EC50 in nm range). They also decreased mitochondrial ROS production, inhibited MPT and swelling, and prevented cytochrome c release induced by Ca2+ in isolated mitochondria. In addition, they inhibited 3NP-induced MPT in isolated mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial depolarization in cells treated with 3NP. ROS and MPT have been implicated in myocardial stunning associated with reperfusion in ischemic hearts, and these peptide antioxidants potently improved contractile force in an ex vivo heart model. It is noteworthy that peptide analogs without dimethyltyrosine did not inhibit mitochondrial ROS generation or swelling and failed to prevent myocardial stunning. These results clearly demonstrate that overproduction of ROS underlies the cellular toxicity of tBHP and 3NP, and ROS mediate cytochrome c release via MPT. These IMM-targeted antioxidants may be very beneficial in the treatment of aging and diseases associated with oxidative stress.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain on the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) 1The abbreviations used are: IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; ROS, reactive oxygen species; 3NP, 3-nitropropionic acid; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; tBHP, t-butylhydroperoxide; Dmt, 2′,6′-dimethyltyrosine; LDL, low density lipoprotein; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester. is a major intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS cause nonspecific damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to alteration or loss of cellular function. Mitochondria are continuously exposed to ROS and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly than the rest of the cell, especially because ROS are highly reactive and shortlived (1Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Many studies have associated mitochondrial dysfunction caused by ROS with both necrotic and apoptotic cell death (2Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Dallaporta B. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The rate of mitochondrial ROS production can be altered by several physiological or pathological conditions. Inhibitors of the respiratory chain such as 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP), an irreversible inhibitor of the complex II enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, tend to increase ROS production (3Beal M.F. Ferrante R.J. Henshaw R. Matthews R.T. Chan P.H. Kowall N.W. Epstein C.J. Schulz J.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Lee W.T. Yin H.S. Shen Y.Z.

Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The inhibition of this complex seems to be related to neuronal death similar to those occurring in Huntington's disease (6Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antioxidants can attenuate the neurochemical changes and some behavioral disturbances caused by 3NP in animals (5Rosenstock T.R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ca2+ is another powerful signal for ROS production. Calcium is taken up into mitochondria via a uniporter in the IMM, and elevation of mitochondrial Ca2+ and ROS production is thought to play an important part in cell death associated with ischemia-reperfusion as well as 3NP (4Lee W.T. Yin H.S. Shen Y.Z. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Rosenstock T.R. Carvalho A.C. Jurkiewicz A. Frussa-Filho R. Smaili S.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that ROS play a key role in promoting cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (8Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Pistolese M. Paradies G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Nishimura G. Proske R.J. Doyama H. Higuchi M.

Pharmacol. 2003; 139: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c in the cytoplasm triggers activation of the caspase cascade that ultimately leads to apoptosis (12Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar, 13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying ROS-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria is still not fully understood. Cytochrome c is normally bound to the IMM by an association with cardiolipin (14Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 346: 261-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is now believed that cytochrome c release from mitochondria proceeds by a two-step process: dissociation of cytochrome c from cardiolipin in the IMM, followed by release of cytochrome c through the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (15Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, and peroxidation of cardiolipin induces the dissociation of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol (16Shidoji Y. Hayashi K. Komura S. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which cytochrome c is released through the OMM is not clear. One mechanism may involve ROS-induced promotion of Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), with swelling of the mitochondrial matrix and rupture of the OMM (17Byrne A.M. Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). ROS may promote MPT by causing oxidation of thiol groups on the adenine nucleotide translocator (19Costantini P. Belzacq A.S.

Sato E.E. Muranaka S. Fujita H. Fujiwara T. Utsumi T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This mechanism seems likely in 3NP toxicity and ischemia-reperfusion injury, where increased intracellular Ca2+ and ROS are both present (4Lee W.T. Yin H.S. Shen Y.Z. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Rosenstock T.R. Carvalho A.C. Jurkiewicz A. Frussa-Filho R. Smaili S.S. J.

However, there is also evidence showing that cytochrome c can be released through the OMM in an MPT-independent manner (24Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 25Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Polster B.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31243-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was reported recently that ROS can induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria in the absence of Ca2+ and was insensitive to cyclosporin A (10Petrosillo G. Ruggiero F.M. Paradies G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2202-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting MPT-independent mechanisms. MPT-independent mechanisms may involve the voltage-dependent anion channel on the OMM or an oligomeric form of Bax (15Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 25Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Madesh M. Hajnoczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Given the many ways by which cytochrome c may be released through the OMM, the most efficient approach to inhibit ROS-induced cytochrome c release and cell death would be prevention of lipid peroxidation of the IMM. Unfortunately, none of the available antioxidants specifically targets mitochondria, let alone the IMM. In addition, most of the antioxidants are poorly cell-permeable, requiring concentrations in excess of 100 μm to prevent oxidative cell death. One approach used to target antioxidants such as coenzyme Q and vitamin E to mitochondria has involved conjugation of these lipid-soluble molecules to lipophilic cations such as triphenylalkylphosphonium ions, which are rapidly taken up into the mitochondrial matrix because of the potential gradient across the IMM (30Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 31Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The introduction of cations into the mitochondrial matrix, however, leads to dissipation of IMM potential, and this was observed in isolated mitochondria with concentrations of triphenylalkylphosphonium ion-conjugated antioxidants greater than 20 μm (30Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 31Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dissipation of the IMM potential would ultimately limit further drug uptake. We have developed a series of peptide antioxidants that are taken up by mitochondria and concentrate in the IMM. These peptide antioxidants are cell-permeable and are very potent at reducing intracellular ROS and preventing cell death caused by the oxidant t-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP). We have used these IMM-targeted antioxidants to investigate the role of mitochondrially generated ROS in mitochondrial dysfunction in cells exposed to 3NP. To investigate the mechanisms by which these peptide antioxidants protect against mitochondrial dysfunction, we used isolated mitochondria to determine their ability to prevent MPT and cytochrome c release caused by Ca2+ overload and 3NP. In addition, because ROS have been implicated in contractile dysfunction associated with reperfusion of ischemic hearts, we determined the efficacy of these peptide antioxidants in preventing myocardial stunning in an ex vivo perfused heart model. Finally, to prove that the effects of these peptide antioxidants are caused by their ability to scavenge ROS, we designed a peptide analog that lacked antioxidant properties. Our results suggest that overproduction of ROS underlies the cellular toxicity of tBHP and 3NP, and ROS mediate cytochrome c release via MPT and rupture of the OMM. These results also confirm a major role for ROS in mitochondrial dysfunction and reperfusion injury and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these peptide antioxidants in ischemia-reperfusion injury and neurodegeneration. Chemicals and Reagents—The SS peptides are tetrapeptides with alternating aromatic residues and basic amino acids. SS-02 (Dmt-d-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2; Dmt = 2′,6′-dimethyltyrosine), SS-20 (Phe-d-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2), SS-31 (d-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2), and [3H]SS-02 were synthesized as described previously (32Schiller P.W. Nguyen T.M. Berezowska I. Dupuis S. Weltrowska G. Chung N.N. Lemieux C. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Zhao G.M. Qian X. Schiller P.W. Szeto H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A fluorescent analog (SS-19; Dmt-d-Arg-Phe-atnDap-NH2) containing β-anthraniloyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid in place of the Lys4 residue in SS-02 was prepared for mitochondrial and cellular uptake studies (34Berezowska I. Chung N.N. Lemieux C. Zelent B. Szeto H.H. Schiller P.W. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Measurement of Antioxidant Properties of SS Peptides in Vitro—The ability of SS peptides to scavenge H2O2in vitro was determined using luminol chemiluminescence (35Li Y. Zhu H. Trush M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). H2O2 (4.4 nmol) was incubated with 1 to 100 μm of various peptides in 0.5 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, for 30 s. Luminol (25 μm) and horseradish peroxidase (0.7 IU) were then added to the solution, and chemiluminescence was monitored with an aggregometer (Chronolog, Havertown, PA) for 20 min at 37 °C. Antioxidant properties of SS peptides were further established by inhibition of fatty acid peroxidation and low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. Linoleic acid peroxidation was initiated with 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) and the formation of conjugated dienes was monitored spectrophotometrically at 234 nm (36Longoni B. Pryor W.A. Marchiafava P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared human LDL (0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was oxidized catalytically by the addition of 10 μm CuSO4, and the formation of conjugated dienes was monitored at 234 nm for 5 h at 37 °C (37Moosmann B. Behl C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Preparation—Male CD1 mice were sacrificed by decapitation, and the livers immediately excised and homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (10 mm sucrose, 200 mm mannitol, 5 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 900 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 13,800 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellets were washed twice, centrifuged at 11,200 × g, and re-suspended in the same buffer (no EGTA). All experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the Institution for the Care and Use of Animals at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Mitochondrial Uptake Studies—Uptake of SS-19 by isolated mitochondria was examined by fluorescence quenching upon addition of a mitochondrial suspension (0.35 mg) (Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer; excitation/emission = 320/420 nm). For mitochondrial uptake of [3H]SS-02, mitochondria (0.8 mg) were suspended in buffer (70 mm sucrose, 230 mm mannitol, 3 mm HEPES, 5 mm succinate, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 0.5 μm rotenone, pH 7.4) containing [3H]SS-02 and 1 μm SS-02 at room temperature. Uptake was stopped by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), the mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS/0.2 N NaOH, and radioactivity was determined. Mitochondrial uptake of SS-19 and [3H]SS-02 were also determined in the presence of 1.5 μm carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), an uncoupler that results in mitochondrial depolarization. To determine the localization of the peptide within mitochondria, three cycles of freeze-thaw treatment were used to isolate inner and outer membranes (38Vardanis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 807-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with 0.2% digitonin was used to disrupt the outer membrane to determine peptide distribution to the IMM and matrix (39Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Caco-2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and N2A cells (provided by Dr. Gunnar Gouras, Department of Neurology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University) were cultured as described previously (40Zhao K. Luo G. Zhao G.M. Schiller P.W. Szeto H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 41Gouras G.K. Xu H. Gross R.S. Greenfield J.P. Hai B. Wang R. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. Cellular Uptake and Intracellular Localization of Peptide Antioxidants—Peptide uptake into Caco-2 cells was carried out as described previously (40Zhao K. Luo G. Zhao G.M. Schiller P.W. Szeto H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells (106/well) were incubated with [3H]SS-02 at 37 °C for 60 min, and radioactivity was determined in the medium and in cell lysate. To determine intracellular peptide localization, Caco-2 cells were incubated with SS-19 (0.1 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was carried out with living cells using a C-Apochromat 63×/1.2 W Corr objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 320 and 420 nm, resepctively. To demonstrate localization of SS-19 to mitochondria, Caco-2 cells were incubated with SS-19 and Mitotracker tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Molecular Probes, Portland, OR; excitation/emission = 550/575 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C and then examined by CLSM. Intracellular ROS and Cell Viability—N2A cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104/well and allowed to grow for 2 days before treatment with tBHP (0.5 or 1 mm) for 40 min. Cells were washed twice and replaced with medium alone or medium containing varying concentrations of SS-02 or SS-31 for 4 h. Intracellular ROS was measured by 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorohydro-fluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes). Cell death was assessed by a cell proliferation assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay; Promega, Madison, WI). Intracellular Mitochondrial Potential—Caco-2 cells were treated with 3NP (10 mm) in the absence or presence of SS-02 (0.1 μm) for 4 h and then incubated with TMRM and examined under CLSM as described above. Mitochondrial H2O2Production—0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein was added to 0.5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0) containing 5 mm succinate; 25 μm luminol and 0.7 IU of horseradish peroxidase were added, and chemiluminescence was monitored continuously for 20 min at 37 °C. The amount of H2O2 produced was determined by area under the curve. Mitochondrial Oxygen Consumption—Mitochondrial protein (1 mg) was added to 2.0 ml of respiration buffer (70 mm sucrose, 230 mm mannitol, 2 mm HEPES, 5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK). Respiration was measured in the presence of 5 mm succinate, and state 3 respiration was initiated with the addition of 0.35 mm ADP. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial potential was qualitatively assessed using TMRM fluorescence intensity (excitation/emission = 550/575 nm). Isolated mitochondria (0.3 mg) were added to 2.0 ml of buffer (70 mm sucrose, 230 mm mannitol, 3 mm HEPES, 2 mm Tris-phosphate, 5 mm succinate, and 1 μm rotenone) containing TMRM (0.4–2 μm), and potential was assessed by quenching of the fluorescent signal. Mitochondrial Swelling Assays—Isolated mitochondria (0.1 mg) were added to 0.2 ml of buffer (70 mm sucrose, 230 mm mannitol, 3 mm HEPES, 2 mm Tris-phosphate, 5 mm succinate, and 1 μm rotenone) and swelling was measured by decrease in absorbance at 540 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Release—Isolated mitochondria (0.75 mg/2 ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of SS-02 for 100 s before addition of Ca2+ to induce swelling. Swelling was measured by light scattering at 610 nm. Alamethicin (7 μg/ml) was added to induce maximal swelling, and the magnitude of swelling induced by Ca2+ was expressed as a percentage of maximal swelling. After incubation for 400 s, the mitochondrial pellet was collected by centrifugation. Cytochrome c content in the pellet and supernatant was determined using a commercial rat/mouse cytochrome c immunoassay kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Ischemia-Reperfusion Studies—Details of the isolated perfused guinea pig heart model have been published previously (42Wu D. Soong Y. Zhao G.M. Szeto H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H783-H791Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Isolated hearts were perfused continuously with either Krebs-Henseleit solution or Krebs-Henseleit solution containing various SS peptides and allowed to stabilize for 30 min. Contractile force was measured with a small hook inserted into the apex of the left ventricle, and the silk ligature tightly connected to a Grass force-displacement transducer. Global ischemia was then induced by complete interruption of coronary perfusion for 30 min. Reperfusion was carried out for 90 min after ischemia. Antioxidant Properties of SS Peptides—The antioxidant properties of SS peptides were demonstrated by their ability to scavenge H2O2 and inhibit the oxidation of linoleic acid and LDL in vitro. The prototype peptide, SS-02, dose-dependently reduced the luminol-derived chemiluminescence produced by H2O2 in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 1A). SS-02 also dose-dependently inhibited the oxidation of fatty acids (Fig. 1B) and LDL in vitro (Fig. 1C). The antioxidant activity of SS-02 was not dependent on the specific order of the four amino acids in that SS-31 showed similar antioxidant activity (Fig. 1, D and E). However, substitution of Dmt1 by Phe1 (SS-20) eliminated antioxidant activity (Fig. 1, D and E). Cellular Uptake of SS-02—To demonstrate that the SS peptides are cell-permeable, we incubated Caco-2 cells with [3H]SS-02 at 37 °C for 60 min and measured the amount of radioactivity in cell lysate. [3H]SS-02 was readily taken up into Caco-2 cells. The amount of [3H]SS-02 in cell lysate and media averaged 6152 ± 128 cpm and 229,622 ± 2199, respectively (mean ± S.E.; n = 6). Based on a cell volume of ∼3.3 μl/mg protein (43Terada T. Sawada K. Saito H. Hashimoto Y. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1435-G1441PubMed Google Scholar) and 200 μl of media, the intracellular concentration of [3H]SS-02 can be estimated to be 9.8 ± 0.26 times higher than extracellular concentration. Intracellular Targeting of SS Peptides—The fluorescent analog SS-19 was used to determine cellular uptake and intracellular localization by CLSM. The confocal images showed uptake of SS-19 (blue fluorescence) into Caco-2 cells within 15 min (Fig. 2, left). Fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of all cells, but the peptide was entirely excluded from the nucleus. The distribution pattern resembled mitochondrial distribution as shown by Mitotracker TMRM (Fig. 2, middle). The co-localization of SS-19 and TMRM (Fig. 2, right) suggests targeting of SS-19 to mitochondria after cellular uptake. Mitochondrial Uptake of SS Peptides—Mitochondrial uptake of SS peptides was examined using isolated mouse liver mitochondria. Addition of isolated mitochondria to SS-19 resulted in immediate quenching of the fluorescent signal (Fig. 3A). To ensure that the uptake of SS-19 by mitochondria was not an artifact of the fluorophore, we incubated mitochondria with [3H]SS-02 and determined radioactivity in the mitochondrial pellet. Uptake of [3H]SS-02 by mitochondria was rapid with maximal levels reached by 2 min (Fig. 3B). Radioactivity averaged 67,021 ± 2008 cpm in the mitochondrial pellet, and 128,131 ± 2015 cpm in the supernatant (n = 3). Assuming mitochondrial volume of 1 μl/mg protein (44Lim K.H. Javadov S.A. Das M. Clarke S.J. Suleiman M.S. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it can be estimated that [3H]SS-02 accumulates 104.6 ± 1.6-fold in mitochondria. Pretreatment of mitochondria with FCCP only reduced SS-19 quenching or [3H]SS-02 uptake by ∼20% (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that only 20% of this cationic peptide was targeted into the mitochondrial matrix in a potential-dependent manner. When mitochondria were incubated with [3H]SS-02 for 5 min and the mitochondrial pellet was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, 72% of [3H]SS-02 was retained in the membrane pellet consisting of both IMM and OMM (Fig. 3C). Treatment of the mitochondrial suspension with 1% digitonin to disrupt the OMM allowed us to determine that 85% of the radioactivity was in the mitoplast (IMM and matrix) (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the peptides are predominantly targeted to the IMM. SS Peptides Reduce Intracellular ROS and Cell Death Caused by tBHP—To show that SS peptides are effective when applied to whole cells, neuronal N2A cells were treated with tBHP (0.5 or 1.0 mm) for 40 min, washed, and then incubated with media containing SS-02 or SS-31, or media alone for 4 h. Incubation with tBHP resulted in dose-dependent increase in intracellular ROS and decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4). Incubation of these cells with either SS-31 or SS-02 dose-dependently reduced intracellular ROS (Fig. 4A) and increased cell survival (Fig. 4, B and C), with EC50 in the nanomolar range. SS-02 Protects against 3NP-induced Mitochondrial Depolarization in Caco-2 Cells—To demonstrate that reduction in mitochondrially generated ROS can protect against mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the effect of SS-02 on mitochondrial depolarization caused by treatment of cells with 3NP. Caco-2 cells were treated with 10 mm 3NP in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm SS-02, and mitochondrial potential was visualized by confocal mi"

For N systems, this limit requires that they be in a quantum-mechanically entangled state. We describe a scalable method of spectroscopy that can potentially take full advantage of entanglement to reach the Heisenberg limit and has the practical advantage that the spectroscopic information is transferred to states with optimal protection against readout noise. We demonstrate our method experimentally with three beryllium ions. The spectroscopic sensitivity attained is 1.45(2) times as high as that of a perfect experiment with three non-entangled particles."

During development, stomata are specified and positioned nonrandomly by the integration of asymmetric cell divisions and intercellular signaling. The Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase gene, YODA , acts as part of a molecular switch controlling cell identities in the epidermis. Null mutations in YODA lead to excess stomata, whereas constitutive activation of YODA eliminated stomata. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings with altered YODA activity was used to identify potential stomatal regulatory genes. A putative transcription factor from this set was shown to regulate the developmental behavior of stomatal precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2134068241,"Hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable disease. We found that high expression levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 correlated with the presence of metastatic disease in prostate cancer patients. Positive staining for CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, was mainly present in the tumor-associated blood vessels and basal cell hyperplasia. Subcutaneous xenografts of PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate tumors that overexpressed CXCR4 in NOD/SCID mice were two- to threefold larger in volume and weight vs. controls. Moreover, blood vessel density, functionality, invasiveness of tumors into the surrounding tissues, and metastasis to the lymph node and lung were significantly increased in these tumors. Neutralizing the interactions of CXCL12/CXCR4 in vivo with CXCR4 specific antibodies inhibited the CXCR4-dependent tumor growth and vascularization. In vitro, CXCL12 induced the proliferation and VEGF secretion but not migration of PC3 and 22Rv1 cells overexpressing CXCR4. Similar effects of CXCR4 overexpression on tumor growth in vivo were also noted in two breast cancer lines, suggesting that the observed effect of CXCR4 is not unique to prostate tumor cells. Thus high levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 induce a more aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cells and identify CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic target in advanced cases of metastatic prostate cancer."

Additionally, we demonstrate conditional operations controlled by the results from reading out one qubit.

https://openalex.org/W1987340301,"Redox mechanisms function in control of gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, but the circuitry for redox signaling remains unclear. Cysteine and methionine are the only amino acids in proteins that undergo reversible oxidation/reduction under biologic conditions and, as such, provide a means for control of protein activity, protein-protein interaction, protein trafficking, and protein-DNA interaction. Hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) provide a mechanism to oxidize signaling proteins. However, oxidation of sulfur-containing side chains of cysteine and methionine by ROS can result in oxidation states of sulfur (e.g., sulfinate, sulfonate, sulfone) that are not reducible under biologic conditions. Thus, mechanisms for oxidation that protect against over-oxidation of these susceptible residues and prevent irreversible loss of activity would be advantageous. The present study shows that the steady-state redox potential of the cysteine/cystine couple (Eh = -145 mV) in cells is sufficiently oxidized (>90 mV) relative to the GSH/GSSG (-250 mV) and thioredoxin (Trx1, -280 mV) redox couples for the cysteine/cystine couple to function as an oxidant in redox switching. Consequently, the cysteine/cystine couple provides a means to oxidize proteins without direct involvement of more potent oxidants. A circuitry model incorporating cysteine as a redox node, along with Trx1 and GSH, reveals how selective interactions between the different thiol/disulfide couples and reactive protein thiols could differentially regulate metabolic functions. Moreover, inclusion of cysteine/cystine as a signaling node distinct from GSH and Trx1 significantly expands the redox range over which protein thiol/disulfide couples may operate to control physiologically relevant processes."
https://openalex.org/W1987956257,"CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) is the primary circadian photoreceptor in Drosophila. We show that CRY binding to TIMELESS (TIM) is light-dependent in flies and irreversibly commits TIM to proteasomal degradation. In contrast, CRY degradation is dependent on continuous light exposure, indicating that the CRY-TIM interaction is transient. A novel cry mutation (cry(m)) reveals that CRY's photolyase homology domain is sufficient for light detection and phototransduction, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain regulates CRY stability, CRY-TIM interaction, and circadian photosensitivity. This contrasts with the function of Arabidopsis CRY domains and demonstrates that insect and plant cryptochromes use different mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1969599461,"The basis for the endothelial cell-restricted expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is not known. While transgenic promoter/reporter mice demonstrated endothelium cell-specific eNOS expression, we found robust expression of episomal eNOS promoter/reporter constructs in cell types that do not express the native eNOS transcript. To explore the mechanism underlying this differential activity pattern of chromatin-versus episome-based eNOS promoters, we examined the methylation status of 5′-regulatory sequences of the human eNOS gene. DNA methylation differed dramatically between endothelial and nonendothelial cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. This same cell type-specific methylation pattern was observed in vivo in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of the mouse aorta at the native murine eNOS promoter. We addressed the functional consequences of methylation on eNOS transcription using transient transfection of in vitro methylated promoter/reporter constructs and found that methylated constructs exhibited a marked decrease in the synergistic action of Sp1, Sp3, and Ets1 on eNOS promoter activity. The addition of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 further reduced the transcriptional activity of methylated eNOS constructs. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated the presence of Sp1, Sp3, and Ets1 at the native eNOS promoter in endothelial cells but not in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Fiorucci S. Sessa W.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 91-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Regulation of the NO pathway in this system involves post-translational regulation of the enzyme involved in NO synthesis, namely endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). It is now appreciated that control of the relative expression of the eNOS mRNA also plays a prominent role (2Tai S.C. Robb G.B. Marsden P.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This laboratory and others have previously reported the isolation and characterization of complementary and genomic clones for eNOS. The human eNOS gene has been mapped to chromosome 7q35–36 (3Marsden P. Heng H. Scherer S. Stewart R. Hall A. Shi X. Tsui L. Schappert K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Molecular characterization revealed that the human eNOS gene consists of 26 exons, spanning ∼21 kb of genomic DNA. Two clustered cis-regulatory regions were identified in the proximal TATA-less eNOS promoter using deletion analysis and linker-scanning mutagenesis: positive regulatory domain I (PRD I) (-104/-95 relative to transcription initiation) and PRD II (-144/-115). Functional domain studies in Schneider's Drosophila line 2 (SL2) cells revealed examples of positive and negative protein-protein cooperativity involving Sp1, variants of Sp3, Ets1, Elf1, and MAZ (5Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G. Miller T. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P. J. Biol.

Therefore, multiprotein complexes form on the activator recognition sites within this 50-base pair region (PRD I and II) of the human eNOS promoter in vascular endothelium (5Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G. Miller T. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). eNOS gene expression has been shown to be relatively restricted to the vascular endothelium. In situ hybridization using antisense cRNA probes in a wide variety of human tissues has revealed that the eNOS mRNA transcript is highly localized to the vascular endothelium of large and medium sized arteries (6Marsden P.

Elucidating the mechanisms involved in the endothelial cell-specific eNOS would provide valuable insight into the poorly understood basis for endothelium-specific gene regulation. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is a prominent feature of the vertebrate genome. In eukaryotes, DNA methylation has been implicated in a number of distinct cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, embryogenesis, regulation of chromatin structure, genomic imprinting, X-inactivation, and cancer pathogenesis (9Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar, 10Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 2042-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). Evidence accumulated during the past 20 years suggests an inverse correlation between transcriptional activity and methylation density. Methyl-CpG is now recognized as a gene-silencing signal (11Klose R. Bird A. Science. 2003; 302: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Specific methyl-CpGs in the promoter can prevent the interaction of transcription factors with their cognate sites. Many of the trans-factors known to bind to sequences containing CpG dinucleotides, including AP-2, HIF-1α, and c-Myc, do not bind when the CpG doublets are methylated (12Comb M. Goodman H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Rolfs A. Camenisch G. Gassmann M. Eur. J.

However, CpG methylation alone does not importantly affect the binding of other transcription factors, such as Sp1 (15Harrington M. Jones P. Imagawa M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and NF-1 (16Rhodes K. Rippe R. Umezawa A. Nehls M. Brenner D. Breindl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5950-5960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that DNA methylation can not only interfere with factor binding but can also directly modulate chromatin structure by modifying the interaction between core histones and DNA (17Davey C. Penning S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Methyl-CpG-binding proteins 1 and 2 (MeCP-1 and MeCP-2) and other methyl binding domain proteins also bind preferentially to 5-methyl-CpG dinucleotides (18Nan X. Campoy F. Bird A.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 498-504PubMed Google Scholar) and modulate transcriptional activity in a number of ways. Binding of these proteins can limit access to the recognition site of transcription factors or modulate DNA structure indirectly as a consequence of local binding. MeCP-2 is a broadly expressed protein specific for single symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides that also possesses two active transcriptional repression domains (18Nan X. Campoy F. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). MeCP-2 can exist as a complex with histone deacetylase and the transcriptional corepressor Sin3A (19Jones P. Veenstra G. Wade P. Vermaak D. Kass S. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar, 21Nan X. Ng H. Johnson C. Laherty C. Turner B. Eisenman R. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar), providing a link between DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. MeCP-2 has also recently been demonstrated to associate with histone methyltransferase activity that is specific for lysine 9 of histone H3, a mark of repressive chromatin (22Fuks F. Hurd P.J. Wolf D. Nan X. Bird A.P. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4035-4040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar).

To address the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms implicated in eNOS cell-specific expression, a series of transient transfections of eNOS promoter/reporter constructs was performed in a number of endothelial and nonendothelial cell types. These episomal templates displayed unusually high eNOS promoter activities in a variety of nonendothelial cells that did not express appreciable steadystate levels of eNOS mRNA. These results suggested that the absence of eNOS expression in these cell types was not due solely to the lack of the necessary transcriptional machinery, since episomes were able to accurately serve as a template for transcription initiation. Rather, a mechanism that represses native eNOS gene expression in nonexpressing cells must exist. We considered whether cell specificity could be regulated, in part, at the chromatin level through epigenetic contributions. We report here that DNA methylation plays an important role in the control of the transcriptional regulation as well as the endothelial cell-specific expression of eNOS. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and characterized as described previously (6Marsden P. Shappert K. Chen H.

Pooled human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HuDermMVEC), human iliac artery endothelial cells, human pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cells, human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HuAoVSMC), human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells, and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were obtained from Clonetics (Cambrex; East Rutherford, NJ) and maintained as recommended. Primary human hepatocytes were obtained from BD Gentest (Woburn, MA) and were maintained in Hepato-STIM hepatocyte culture medium (BD Gentest). TGW (human neuroblastoma cell line) was a generous gift from Dr. Toshio Kuroki (Department of Cancer Cell Research, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan), and cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. KP-N-RT (KPN), also a human neuroblastoma cell line, was a generous gift from Dr. Tohru Sugimoto (Department of Pediatrics, Miyazaki Medical College, Japan) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SL2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), propagated in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and maintained at 23 °C with atmospheric CO2.

Multiple independent plasmid preparations were employed in transfection experiments. Comparable findings were evident when plasmid DNA was prepared in dam-, dcm- bacteria. DNA concentrations were independently determined using a DyNAQuant 200 fluorometer (Amersham Biosciences), an Ultrospec Plus UV/visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences), and analytical gel electrophoresis. Drosophila Eukaryotic Expression Constructs—Expression cassettes for Sp1, Sp3, Ets1, and MeCP-2 were based upon pPacUO, a transient episomal vector that contains the 2.6-kb Drosophila actin 5C promoter, a 0.7-kb 5′-untranslated region (UTR) ultrabithorax internal ribosome entry site, the first eight codons of the ultrabithorax open reading frame, and 1.1 kb of 3′-UTR from the actin 5C gene (polyadenylation signal sequences). pPacUO and pPacUSp1 were provided by R. Tjian (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Berkeley, IL) and have been described previously (5Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G. Miller T. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). pPacUSp3 was provided by G. Suske (Institut fur Molekularbiologie und Tumorfurchung, Marburg, Germany). pPac-UEts1 was constructed as previously described (5Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G. Miller T. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The rat MeCP-2 cDNA was kindly provided by A. Bird (Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK) and has been described previously (31Lewis J. Meehan R. Henzel W. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). For construction of pPacUMeCP-2, rat MeCP-2 was cleaved with a partial SacI digestion, and the linearized plasmid was digested to completion with EcoRI. The resulting 1.8-kb fragment was bluntended with Klenow (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the BamHI sites of pPacUO. Methylation of Promoter/Reporter Constructs—The eNOS promoter/luciferase reporter construct (pGL2-1193/+109) was in vitro methylated by various methylases including M. HpaII (CmCGG), M. MspI (mCCGG), and M. SssI (mCG) as previously described (16Rhodes K. Rippe R. Umezawa A. Nehls M. Brenner D. Breindl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5950-5960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mock methylation reactions did not contain any methylase. High and low density methylation constructs were prepared by varying the amount of M. SssI added (i.e. 5 times more M. SssI was added for high density versus low density methylation). The methylation status of the constructs was verified using HpaII and MspI. Methylated and mock-methylated constructs were phenol/chloroform-purified and precipitated in ethanol prior to transient transfection experiments. To assess the role of eNOS promoter-specific methylation in the absence of reporter methylation, methylated or mock-methylated -1193/+109 and -265/+109 eNOS sequences were ligated into unmethylated pGL2-Basic using the restriction enzymes SacI/HindIII and PstI/HindIII, respectively. Ligation reactions representing a total of 5 μg of DNA and equimolar ratios of insert to vector were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and directly transfected into cells without DNA preparation and purification in bacteria. Transient Transfection Assays—All transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). BAEC cultures were plated at 3.3 × 104 cells/ml (3.5 ml) and grown on 60-mm dishes 48 h prior to transfection. Transfection conditions were optimized using the SV40 promoter/enhancer luciferase control plasmid, pGL2-Control, to confirm that increasing amounts of templates resulted in proportional increases in reporter activity. Various endothelial and nonendothelial cell types were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of promoter/reporter construct, 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-gal, and 1.5 μg of pBluescript II SK(-) DNA. β-Galactosidase activity was used to control for transfection efficiency, and pBluescript II SK(-) DNA was used to optimize DNA/Lipofectin ratios and hence transfection efficiency. DNA-Lipofectin complexes (2:1 (mass/mass) ratio) were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C and then added to cells at 37 °C in serum-free Opti-MEM I. The transfection mix was replaced at 5 h with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% calf serum. Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. pGL2-Control vector was used as a positive control. The pGL2-Basic vector, lacking both an eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences, was used as a negative control. For Drosophila SL2 studies, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of promoter/luciferase construct, the indicated amount of expression plasmids, and 0.5 μg of pADH-β-gal (a gift from R. Tjian) (32Courey J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (2 μg) by the addition of pPacUO. SL2 cells were seeded at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml at the time of transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection with 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA). Protein extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min to pellet residual cellular debris and stored at -80 °C for subsequent assay. Luciferase activity was evaluated using the MonoLight 2010C luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously (5Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G. Miller T. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Data in raw luciferase units was corrected for nonspecific background of mocktransfected cells, which represented ≤0.5% of experimental luciferase activities, and was then normalized for β-galactosidase activity, as previously described (5Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G. Miller T. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For studies involving methylated or mockmethylated ligation reactions, the efficiency of ligation reactions was modest and resulted in luciferase activities for mock-methylated controls that averaged 5–10% of intact nonligated control vectors. Methylation-sensitive Isoschizomer Mapping—High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from various human cell types including HUVEC, HuAoVSMC, HeLa, HepG2, JEG-3, and TGW as described previously (33Hall A. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A. Arbus A. Olson S. Lu W. Kau C. Marsden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33082-33092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10–20 μg) was digested with SacI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 16 h to produce a 2.4-kb fragment encompassing the transcription start site of the human eNOS gene (-1193 to +1207 bp). This fragment was further digested with either MspI (methylation-insensitive) or HpaII (methylation-sensitive) 5′-CCGG-3′ (New England Biolabs). Digests were carried out for 16 h at 37 °C with excess enzyme to ensure completion of the reaction. To increase the efficiency of HpaII digestion, a HpaII double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TAT AGC CGG CTA TA-3′) was added in 10-fold molar excess of genomic DNA (34Kupper D. Rueter M. Meisel A. Kruger D.H. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, downward transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Scheicher and Schuell), and UV-cross-linked. For Southern hybridization, a 986-bp SacI/PstI fragment (from -1193 to -207 bp of the human eNOS promoter) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a nick translation kit (Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of 0.5 to 1.0 × 109 cpm/μg. Membranes were washed at high stringency and subjected to STORM PhosphorImager analysis. Experiments were performed with multiple independent DNA isolations and repeated a minimum of three times. Sodium Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—Genomic DNA (5 μg) was subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment, as described previously (35Clark S. Frommer M. Taylor G. Laboratory Methods for the Detection of Mutations and Polymorphisms in DNA. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 151-162Google Scholar). Given that the nascent strand of replicating DNA is hemimethylated immediately following DNA replication, only quiescent postconfluent cells were utilized for DNA isolation. BamHI-digested DNA was denatured with 0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C in a volume of 20 μl, treated with 3.1 m sodium bisulfite and 0.5 mm hydroquinone, overlaid with mineral oil, and incubated at 55 °C for 16 h in the absence of light. Free bisulfite was removed using a Promega Wizard DNA clean-up desalting column, followed by an incubation with 0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C to denature and remove the -SO3 adduct from the uracil bases prior to the PCR. Sample DNA was then neutralized with NH4OAc, precipitated, and stored at -20 °C. An aliquot of the bisulfite-treated DNA (25–50 ng) was subjected to 35 cycles of PCR amplification, followed by another 35 cycles of nested PCR amplification. PCR primers in the regions of interest were designed for the sodium bisulfite-modified template. Oligonucleotides were generated using a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Primer sets used in sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing (Table I) were designed to amplify the 5′-flanking region and the GC-rich region of exon 24 of the eNOS gene according to criteria previously described (35Clark S. Frommer M. Taylor G. Laboratory Methods for the Detection of Mutations and Polymorphisms in DNA. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 151-162Google Scholar) using Oligo 4.0 Primer Analysis Software (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO). The final PCR products were either directly sequenced using an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) to yield 10–20 individual plasmid clones for sequencing.Table ISodium bisulfite genomic sequencing primer sets for human and murine samplesPrimer pair (oriented with respect to transcription)SequenceAmplicon locationAmplicon sizeTmbp°CHu-4998S5′-GAA TTT TTA GTA TTT TAG AAG T-3′EnhancerHu-4544AS5′-CCC TAC CTT CCC TCT CAA-3′–4998 to –454445546.2Hu-4941S5′-TTT GTA ATT TGG AAG TTG AGT AA-3′Hu-4554AS5′-CCT CTC AAA CCA AAA TAC TCT ACA A-3′–4941 to –455438847.5Hu-1295S5′-GGT AGT AGG GTA TAT TAG TGT TTA GG-3′PromoterHu-860AS5′-AAT ACA CCA ACA CTC TCC AAA CA-3′–1295 to –86043646.5Hu-1211S5′-TGG TGT GAT TTT AGA GTT TTG AGT AT-3′Hu-880AS5′-AAC ACT TCA AAC CAA AAT ACA TAC-3′–1211 to –88033245.9Hu-965S5′-GAT TAG ATG TTT AGT TAG TGG TT-3′PromoterHu-583AS5′-TTA TCC TTA AAT CTA ACA TTA A-3′–965 to –58338346.4Hu-884S5′-AGT GTT TGG AGA GTG TTG GTG TAT T-3′Hu-617AS5′-CCT CCC AAC CCC AAT TTC CTA A-3′–884 to –61726851.0Hu-538S5′-AAG GAT TTA AGG GTG GGG ATT-3′PromoterHu-74AS5′-AAC TCT CCA ATA CTA ACC CTC-3′–538 to –7446548.6Hu-484S5′-GAG AGA ATT TGT ATG ATT TTA GAG GTT-3′Hu-145AS5′-AAC TCT AAA ACC TCA ACT CCA C-3′–484 to –14534047.9Hu-346S5′-GTG TTA TAT TAT AGA AGG ATT TTT ATG-3′Core promoterHu+95AS5′-ACC CAA AAC CCA ACC CCA ACC CCA AAC-3′–346 to +9544148.2Hu-286S5′-TGT TTT AGT TTT TAT GTT GTA GTT TTA G-3′Hu+3AS5′-ACT ACC TAC TCC AAC AAA ACC CTA ACC-3′–286 to +328948.2Hu+19107S5′-AGA GTT ATA AGT ATG GGA GAA TAT GAA GTG-3′Exon 24 to intron 24Hu+19976AS5′-CAA CCA ACT CCG TCC TCA AAA TAT CCT ACA-3′+19,107 to +19,97687052.3Hu+19309S5′-AGA GAT GAA ATA GTT AAA GTA ATG GTG G-3′Hu+19874AS5′-CTA ACT AAC CCT AAA CGT AAA AAT CTC C-3′+19,309 to +19,87456652.1Mu-409S5′-AGA TAG GAG AGG AGT AAG GGT GAA TTT-3′Core"
https://openalex.org/W2148128487,"Axonal projections from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb are organized into glomeruli according to the expressed odorant receptor. Using gene-targeted mice, we show that glomerular maturation proceeds along different time courses for two similar receptors and requires sensory input during distinct sensitive periods. During early development, some glomeruli are innervated by axons of neurons that do not express the same receptor. These heterogeneous glomeruli normally disappear with age, but they persist in adults deprived of sensory input by unilateral and permanent naris closure. Persistence may be due, in part, to prolonged survival of olfactory sensory neurons."

In Gram-negative bacteria, the lipopolysaccharide layer in the outer membrane is an efficient barrier for fatty acids and aromatic hydrocarbons destined for biodegradation. We report crystal structures of the long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL from Escherichia coli at 2.6 and 2.8 angstrom resolution. FadL forms a 14-stranded beta barrel that is occluded by a central hatch domain. The structures suggest that hydrophobic compounds bind to multiple sites in FadL and use a transport mechanism that involves spontaneous conformational changes in the hatch."

https://openalex.org/W2145864424,"Convergent biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the formation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein deposits is an important and, probably, seminal step in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). It has been reported that transgenic animals overexpressing human alpha-syn develop lesions similar to those found in the brain in PD, together with a progressive loss of dopaminergic cells and associated abnormalities of motor function. Inhibiting and/or reversing alpha-syn self-aggregation could, therefore, provide a novel approach to treating the underlying cause of these diseases. We synthesized a library of overlapping 7-mer peptides spanning the entire alpha-syn sequence, and identified amino acid residues 64-100 of alpha-syn as the binding region responsible for its self-association. Modified short peptides containing alpha-syn amino acid sequences from part of this binding region (residues 69-72), named alpha-syn inhibitors (ASI), were found to interact with full-length alpha-syn and block its assembly into both early oligomers and mature amyloid-like fibrils. We also developed a cell-permeable inhibitor of alpha-syn aggregation (ASID), using the polyarginine peptide delivery system. This ASID peptide was able to inhibit the DNA damage induced by Fe(II) in neuronal cells transfected with alpha-syn(A53T), a familial PD-associated mutation. ASI peptides without this delivery system did not reverse levels of Fe(II)-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, the ASID peptide increased (P<0.0005) the number of cells stained positive for Bcl-2, while significantly (P<0.05) decreasing the percentage of cells stained positive for BAX. These short peptides could serve as lead compounds for the design of peptidomimetic drugs to treat PD and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2143572393,"The relationship between growth factor-dependent cell growth and proliferation and the up-regulation of cellular metabolism required to support these processes remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that cell growth, proliferation, and glucose metabolism are coordinately regulated by interleukin-3 (IL-3) in cytokine-dependent cells. Surprisingly, glycolytic activity is stimulated to a greater extent than would be expected based on the rate of cell growth or proliferation. IL-3 signaling exerts a direct effect on glycolytic commitment independent of cell growth control. These results are not restricted to IL-3 as the cytokines IL-7 and IL-2 have similar effects on glucose metabolism when assayed in factor-dependent cell lines or primary lymphocytes, respectively. Growth factor stimulation leads cells to consume less oxygen and produce more lactate per glucose, indicative of conversion from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. The enforced rate of glucose metabolism is in excess of that required to support cell growth; accordingly, if extracellular glucose is reduced, cells retain the ability to grow and proliferate by derepressing oxidative metabolism. These data suggest that the high rate of glycolysis observed in response to growth factor stimulation is a primary effect rather than a homeostatic response to increased cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2063972197,"Megalin, a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, is required for efficient protein absorption in the proximal tubule. Recent studies have shown that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, another member of this gene family, is proteolytically processed by γ-secretase implying a role for low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein in a Notchlike signaling pathway. This pathway has been shown to involve: 1) metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding and γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane proteolysis of some receptors. Experiments were performed to determine whether megalin undergoes similar processing. By immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and a fluorogenic enzyme assay presenilin-1 (required for γ-secretase activity) and γ-secretase activity were found in the brush border of proximal kidney tubules where megalin is localized. Using a fluorogenic peptide containing an amyloid precursor protein γ-secretase cleavage site and Compound E, a specific γ-secretase inhibitor, we found high levels of γ-secretase activity in renal brush border membrane vesicles. Immunoblotting analysis of renal microsomes and opossum kidney proximal tubule (OKP) cells using antibodies directed to the cytosolic domain of megalin showed a 35–40-kDa, membrane-associated, carboxyl-terminal fragment of megalin (MCTF). When cells were incubated with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the appearance of the MCTF increased 2.5-fold and was blocked by metalloprotease inhibitors. When the cells were incubated with γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E, it caused a 2-fold increase in MCTF. Finally, incubating the cells with 1 μm vitamin D-binding protein resulted in a 25% increase in the appearance of the MCTF. In summary, the MCTF is produced by protein kinase C regulated, metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding and is the substrate for γ-secretase. We postulate that the enzymatic processing of megalin represents part of a novel ligand-dependent signaling pathway in the proximal tubule that links receptor-mediated endocytosis with cell signaling.

We postulate that the enzymatic processing of megalin represents part of a novel ligand-dependent signaling pathway in the proximal tubule that links receptor-mediated endocytosis with cell signaling. The proximal tubule reabsorbs low molecular weight protein (<70 kDa) by a mechanism that is largely dependent on the scavenger receptor megalin. In the healthy adult this amounts to as much as 600 mg of protein/day. However in renal disease, where the glomerular barrier is damaged, protein delivery to the proximal tubule increases dramatically and reaches levels that are eventually cytotoxic. Under these conditions the endocytic capacity of the proximal tubule becomes saturated and results in progressive nephropathy (1Orth S.R. Ritz E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition to proteinuria and sodium retention, the nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the up-regulation of several vasoactive and inflammatory genes (2Remuzzi G. Bertani T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Although the pathologic course of the nephrotic syndrome has been fairly well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that link protein absorption with disease as well as with gene regulation in the proximal tubule are not understood. Recently many studies have shown that a process known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) 1The abbreviations used are: RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; APP, amyloid precursor protein; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; PKC, protein kinase C; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; OKP, opossum kidney proximal tubule; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MCTF, megalin carboxyl-terminal fragment; EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride; DBP, vitamin D-binding protein. acts on some membrane receptors and links receptor-mediated endocytosis and intracellular signaling events. RIP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism involving the sequential, regulated proteolysis of membrane proteins culminating in the release of the intracellular domain of the protein from the membrane. The released intracellular domain in turn is either translocated to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription regulator (3Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) or it may activate other components of signaling pathways. First described for the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar), RIP has been shown to be involved in processing the Notch receptor (5Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (6Lendon C.L. Ashall F. Goate A.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 277: 825-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a growing list of other receptors including the ErbB-4, ATF6, and IRE1 (for a review, see Ref. 7Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For intramembrane cleavage to occur, RIP first requires ectodomain shedding of the receptor. Ectodomain shedding frequently occurs as multiple steps and is mediated either by members of the metalloprotease-disintegrin family of proteases, also called ADAMs (adisintegrin and metalloprotease domain), or by a matrix metalloprotease (MMP). The RIP of APP is clinically important since aberrant processing causes the accumulation of the Aβ peptide fragments seen in the senile plaques that are pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease (8Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In some instances, for example Notch and ErbB-4, ectodomain shedding has been shown to be ligand-dependent (5Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 9Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34737-34743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in the case of other receptors such as APP, the role of ligand binding is unclear, and constitutive processing seems to occur (10Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Oltersdorf T. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 695: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In all cases studied to date, ectodomain shedding is regulated by the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) (for a review, see Ref. 11Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The shedding process produces characteristic membrane-associated carboxyl-terminal fragments, which in turn form the substrate for γ-secretase. γ-Secretase activity acts at a site within the transmembrane domain and is mediated by a protein complex that includes presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and nicastrin (12Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Growing evidence supports the notion that the proteolytic activity of the γ-secretase complex is mediated by the presenilins. Presenilin-1 and -2 are themselves proteolytically cleaved in the Golgi apparatus into amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments that remain associated in the active γ-secretase complex (13Campbell W.A. Reed M.L. Strahle J. Wolfe M.S. Xia W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, showed that this receptor is also subjected to RIP (14May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Since megalin is also a member of this gene family and closely related to LRP, we carried out studies to determine whether megalin is proteolytically processed by similar mechanisms. Here we report evidence for both γ-secretase activity and cleaved forms of megalin in the brush border of the proximal tubule. We also show in opossum kidney proximal tubule (OKP) cells that megalin is processed by both matrix metalloprotease and γ-secretase activities and that processing is both ligand-dependent and regulated by PKC. Materials—The fluorogenic γ-secretase substrate (no. 565764), Compound E (γ-secretase inhibitor XVIII, no. 565779), MMP inhibitor III (no. 444264), Gö6983 (no. 365251), and vitamin D-binding protein (Gcglobulin, no. 345802) were purchased from Calbiochem. The phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, no. P 8139), 4αPMA (no. P 148), and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA, no. A 3085) were obtained from Sigma. Cloning the Carboxyl Terminus of Opossum (OKP Cell) Megalin— Opossum kidney mRNA was obtained from cultured OKP cells using TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen, no. 15596-018) followed by treatment with DNase (Invitrogen, no. 18068015) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. The cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)-primed total RNA (SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen, no. 11904-018). Using primers designed from the published rat megalin nucleotide sequence (15Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) we identified a 350-bp fragment of opossum megalin. A 3′-terminal 3.4-kb fragment of opossum kidney megalin mRNA was PCR-amplified by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen, no. 18373012) using the gene-specific forward primer (5′-CAACTGTCCTTGTGTTCCAATCAGTC-3′) and a universal amplification primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) supplied in the 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit with Herculase Taq polymerase (Stratagene, no. 600310). The fragment was then ligated into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen, no. K270020), and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This opossum partial cDNA sequence was submitted to GenBankTM under the accession number AY627686. Constructing the GST-fused Opossum Kidney Cell Megalin Carboxyl Terminus as Antigen for Making Antibodies—A3′-end 660-bp fragment of the opossum megalin gene encoding the entire intracellular domain was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-GCTCCCTTCTGCCATCTCTTCCTAAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAGTGGCACTAGTTATACCTCAGAGTC-3′. The PCR product was ligated into pDrive PCR vector (Qiagen) and digested out with BamHI and SalI. The GST-fused megalin carboxyl terminus was constructed by ligating the digested PCR product into pGEX-6p-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-megalin fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified using Glutathione-SepharoseTM4B (Amersham Biosciences). The purified fusion protein was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline and stored at –70 °C. γ-Secretase Assay—γ-Secretase activity was measured as described previously (16Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Pursglove S.E. Bergman A. Winblad B. Naslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24277-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly solubilized brush border membrane vesicles were incubated with 8 μm fluorogenic substrate NMA (2-N-methylaminobenzoyl)-Gly-Gly-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-Thr-Val-Lys(DNP(dinitro-phenyl))-d-Arg-d-Arg-d-Arg-NH2 (Calbiochem) in 150 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPSO (w/v) at 37 °C overnight with or without 30 nm specific γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E (Calbiochem). After incubation, reactions were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 15 min and chilled on ice. Supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate, and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (POLARSTAR Galaxy, BMG Lab Technologies, Ltd.) with excitation wavelength at 350 nm and emission wavelength at 440 nm. The data were analyzed and presented using Microsoft Excel. Primary Antibodies—For anti-megalin antibodies, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised to the GST fusion protein representing the entire cytosolic domain of opossum megalin. For polyclonal antibodies, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized by the Immunization Service, Department of Comparative Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine. Immune sera were compared with preimmune sera by immunocytochemistry using fixed opossum kidney cryosections and by immunoblotting using specific and control fusion proteins as well as kidney microsomes as antigen. The serum was affinity-depleted of unwanted bacterial reactivity by passing over a CNBr-activated Sepharose column to which was attached control GST. This antibody is named anti-MC-220. For monoclonal antibodies, BALB/c mice were immunized with the megalin carboxyl-terminal fusion protein using the pertussis/alum method (17Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Splenocytes from an immunized mouse were fused with Ag8 cells, and hybridomas were prepared by routine methods using Cloning FactorTM (IGEN International, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Hybridomas secreting IgG with specificity for the megalin carboxyl-terminal domain were selected by screening by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the GST-megalin carboxyl terminus and GST control fusion proteins as antigen. Hybridomas shown to be positive to the megalin fusion protein and not the control were screened by Western blot using fusion proteins and renal microsomes as antigen. mAb 6E10 was selected, and purified IgG was prepared by Protein G affinity chromatography. The specificity of the anti-megalin antibodies is shown in Fig. 1. A monoclonal antibody (mAb 6A6) was raised to native opossum kidney megalin. Advantage was taken of the antigenicity of the extracellular domain of megalin (18Kerjaschki D. Ullrich R. Diem K. Pietromonaco S. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11179-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1331-1337PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were immunized with opossum kidney brush border membrane vesicles, and hybridomas were prepared as described above. Hybridomas were first screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using brush border membrane vesicles as antigen. Positive hybridomas were subsequently screened by immunocytochemistry using 5-μm cryosections of opossum kidney. Supernatants that stained the coated pit region of the brush border were then screened by Western blot using opossum microsomes as antigen. For comparison and as a positive control, a polyclonal antibody to the carboxyl terminus of rat megalin was used in the blotting screens. The specificity of mAb 6A6 is shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 1, all of the newly developed antibodies to opossum megalin (anti-MC220, 6E10, and 6A6) reacted with megalin by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and stained the brush border (coated pits) of the proximal tubule. An additional mAb raised to megalin (mAb DC6) was a gift from Drs. Markus Exner and Dontscho Kerjaschki, Vienna, Austria. This mAb has been described previously and labels megalin in numerous mammalian species (20Orlando R.A. Exner M. Czekay R.P. Yamazaki H. Saito A. Ullrich R. Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These mAbs were used as purified IgG from hybridoma supernatants. Finally a polyclonal antibody to the megalin carboxyl terminus (anti-gp330CT) was a gift from Drs. Marilyn Farquhar and Robert Orlando at the University of California in San Diego. This antibody was raised to a fusion protein representing an 18-amino acid peptide within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of rat megalin (21Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Adamson E.D. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1433-1441PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to the amino-terminal fragment of presenilin-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). As controls in some of the experiments described below, a polyclonal antibody to the Na+/Pi cotransporter (22Levi M. Lotscher M. Sorribas V. Custer M. Arar M. Kaissling B. Murer H. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F900-F908PubMed Google Scholar) and the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (23Rutherford P.A. Pizzonia J.H. Biemesderfer D. Abu-Alfa A. Reilly R. Aronson P.S. Exp. Nephrol. 1997; 5: 490-497PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Antibody Conjugates—For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR. For immunoblotting, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (heavy and light chain-specific), goat anti-mouse (γ chain-specific), or goat anti-rabbit (heavy and light chain-specific) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Experimental Animals—Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) were used to prepare microsomes (24Grassl S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8778-8783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and brush border membrane vesicles using the divalent cation precipitation method (25Aronson P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed by injection of sodium pentobarbital (Butler Co., Columbus, OH). Two wild caught opossums were purchased from Northeastern Wild-life, South Plymouth, NY, and the kidneys were used for screening hybridomas. The animals were handled and anesthetized by veterinarians from the Section of Comparative Medicine, Yale University Medical School. The kidneys of one animal were used to prepare brush border membrane vesicles according to the divalent cation precipitation method (25Aronson P.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The kidneys of the other animal were perfusion-fixed and prepared for immunocytochemistry as described below. Density Separation of Postmitochondrial Microsomes—The density separation of cellular membranes was accomplished by isopycnic centrifugation using OptiPrepTM (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway) density gradients. OptiPrep was diluted to appropriate concentrations from stocks using 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.8) and 8% sucrose according to the manufacturer's protocols. Preformed OptiPrep gradients were made using a Gradient MasterTM (Biocomp Inc., New Brunswick, Canada). 2 mg of postmitochondrial microsomes in 5% OptiPrep were layered on the top of 15–25% OptiPrep gradients. Gradients were centrifuged to equilibrium (at least 2 h) at 28,000 rpm using an SW 41 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. 1-ml fractions were manually collected from the top and stored at –70 °C. For analysis by immunoblotting equal volumes (10 μl) of each fraction were used. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 3.5–8% gradient or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to PVDF (Millipore Immobilon-P) at 400 mA for 4–6hat4 °C with a TransphorTM transfer electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) and stained with Ponceau S in 0.5% trichloroacetic acid. Immunoblotting was performed as follows. PVDF membranes containing transferred protein from entire gels were incubated first in Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 1–3 h to block non-specific binding of antibody followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody. Primary antibodies, diluted in Blotto, were used at dilutions ranging from 1:1000 to 1:5000. The membranes were then washed in Blotto and incubated for 1 h with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in Blotto. After washing three times in Blotto, one time in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and one time in distilled water, bound antibody was detected with the ECLTM chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In some experiments PVDF blots were reprobed with additional primary antibodies after stripping away the first antibody. Stripping was accomplished by incubating the PVDF membranes in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris (pH 6.9) for 60 min at 70 °C. Tissue Preparation for Immunocytochemistry—Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital injected intravenously, and the kidneys were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate fixative (27McClean W. Nakane P.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 22: 1077-1083Crossref Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) as described previously (28Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling tissue was cryoprotected by incubating for 1 h in 2.3 m sucrose with 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone, mounted on aluminum nails, and stored in liquid nitrogen (28Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using either semithin cryosections of fixed tissue or Epon sections of the same tissue that was further subjected to antigen retrieval. Cryosections were prepared and stained exactly as described previously (17Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For antigen retrieval fixed tissue was embedded in Epon 812 as described previously (28Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tissue was not subjected to osmium tetroxide or uranyl acetate steps. After embedding 0.5-μm sections were cut with glass knives, and the sections were mounted on glass slides. The sections were then etched by incubating for 5 min in a solution containing 10 ml of 100% methanol, 5 ml of propylene oxide, and 2 g of KOH. The slides were then washed two times for 5 min each in 100% methanol and once in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). For antigen retrieval a 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was used. Briefly 500 ml of buffer in a 2-liter glass beaker were heated to boiling in a microwave oven. The slides were added to the hot buffer and heated in the oven for 20 min at ∼40% power. After cooling the sections were washed three times for 15 min each in TBS, quenched for 15 min in 0.5 m ammonium chloride, and washed again in TBS. After an additional 5-min wash in 1% SDS the section were stained as described above. For immunoelectron microscopy ultrathin cryosections were labeled using the colloidal gold technique. Briefly ultrathin cryosections were cut using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome fitted with an FC-4E cryoattachment and picked up on carbon-coated Formvar grids. Sections were labeled overnight either with anti-MC-220 or with mAb DC6 either diluted 1:50 in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum. After washing in TBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin the sections were incubated for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse gold conjugate (10 nm) diluted 1:20 in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum. After processing as described previously (28Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar, 29Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) the sections were examined and photographed with a Zeiss 910 electron microscope. Digital images were prepared by scanning negatives with a ScanMaker 8700 (Microtek, Inc.) and were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Analysis of Megalin Carboxyl-terminal Fragment—OKP cells were grown to confluence in 24-well culture plates (COSTAR, Inc.). Cells were serum-starved for 48 h prior to each experiment. Cells were treated in different conditions and then solubilized for 30 min on ice using 30 mm Tris, 20 mm MES (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 40 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete Protease InhibitorTM EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science) tablet (one tablet/25 ml of buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 21,000 × g at 4 °C using a Micromax RF tabletop centrifuge (IEC, Needhan Heights, MA), and protein concentration from each extraction was estimated using the Lowry assay (30Lowry O.H. Rosrebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total proteins from each treatment were separated by SDS-PAGE using 3.5–8% gradient gels and then transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously using the anti-MC-220 antibody. The densitometry of the Western blot was measured using NIH Image 1.63 program. γ-Secretase Expression in the Renal Brush Border—Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is mediated by γ-secretase activity. Since presenilin is the active component of the γ-secretase protein complex (31De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar), we first sought to localize presenilin-1 protein in kidney and compare its renal distribution with that of megalin. As seen in Fig. 2, panel A, presenilin-1 localizes to the brush border of the proximal tubule where megalin is expressed (32Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5557-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To support our immunocytochemical data presented in Fig. 2 (panel A), we performed immunoblotting experiments using rat kidney microsomes and brush border membrane vesicles prepared from the renal cortex (Fig. 2, panel B). This figure shows that the anti-presenilin-1 antibody detected a protein of a size that is consistent with the presenilin-1 amino-terminal fragment and that it is enriched in microvillar membranes. Finally we assayed γ-secretase activity in renal membranes. As shown in Fig. 2, panel C, we were able to detect a significant level of γ-secretase activity in brush border membrane vesicles that is inhibitable by the specific inhibitor Compound E. Taken together, these data show that presenilin-1 protein and γ-secretase activity are present in the renal brush border where megalin is localized. Evidence for Proteolysis of Megalin in Proximal Tubule— Since signaling pathways involving RIP require several proteolytic events (11Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we looked for evidence of megalin processing in the proximal tubule. Previous studies by Bachinsky and co-workers (33Bachinsky D.R. Zheng G. Niles J.L. McLaughlin M. Abbate M. Andres G. Brown D. McCluskey R.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 598-611PubMed Google Scholar) reported two forms of megalin in the brush border. In addition to megalin found in coated pits and endosomes, they found megalin on the microvillar surface that seemed to lack the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor suggesting that this region of the receptor was removed. To confirm this observation and localize the extracellular and cytosolic domains of megali"

We previously reported that mutation at three residues in subunit c of the vacuolar ATPase from Neurospora crassa conferred strong resistance to bafilomycin but little or no resistance to concanamycin (Bowman, B. J., and Bowman, E. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 3965-3972). We have identified additional mutated sites in subunit c that confer resistance to bafilomycin. Furthermore, by subjecting a resistant mutant to a second round of mutation we isolated strains with increased resistance to both bafilomycin and concanamycin. In all of these strains the second mutation is also in subunit c, suggesting it forms at least part of the concanamycin binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the gene encoding subunit c in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that single mutations in each of the residues identified in one of the double mutants of N. crassa conferred resistance to both bafilomycin and concanamycin. Mutations at the corresponding sites in the VMA11 and VMA16 genes of S. cerevisiae, which encode the c′ and c″ subunits, did not confer resistance to the drugs. In all, nine residues of subunit c have been implicated in drug binding. The positions of these residues support a model in which the drug binding site is a pocket formed by helices 1, 2, and 4. We hypothesize that the drugs inhibit by preventing the rotation of the c subunits.

Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases (V-ATPases) 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; YEPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose. 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; YEPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose. are large, complex enzymes responsible for acidification of many internal compartments in eukaryotic cells. They also occur on plasma membranes of specialized cells, where they acidify the surrounding milieu. Numerous physiological processes depend on the activity of V-ATPases, including protein processing, transport of metabolites, receptor-mediated endocytosis, neurotransmitter uptake, and apoptosis (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are implicated as a contributing factor in multiple diseases such as osteoporosis (3Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), deafness (4Karet F.E. Finberg K.E. Nelson R.D. Nayir A. Mocan H. Sanjad S.A. Rodriguez-Soriano J.

Because of its vital role in so many processes and diseases, the V-ATPase is an attractive target for the development of therapeutic agents (6Bowman E.J. Gustafson K.R. Bowman B.J. Boyd M.R. J. Biol.

The bafilomycins and concanamycins have been particularly important in elucidating the physiological role of V-ATPases and are under investigation as possible lead compounds for drug therapy directed toward this enzyme (9Farina C.

Bradbeer J.N. Oneta S. Liang X. Gowen M. Farina C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These macrolide antibiotics, which are very similar in structure, are specific, highly potent inhibitors of all eukaryotic V-ATPases in vitro and in vivo (12Dröse S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K.

A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread use of these compounds, however, our understanding of how they inhibit is rudimentary. Early reports indicated that bafilomycin and concanamycin acted on the Vo segment of the enzyme (15Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Mattsson J.P. Keeling D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Using a radiolabeled derivative of concanamycin, Huss et al. (19Huss M. Ingenhorst G. Konig S. Gassel M. Dröse S. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40544-40548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) identified subunit c as the site bound by the inhibitor in the Manduca sexta enzyme. We have used a genetic approach to identify specific amino acid residues involved in binding the drugs. Eleven bafilomycin-resistant mutants (bfr strains) of Neurospora crassa were initially isolated, and all had mutations in subunit c (20Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Among the 11 strains, three different residues were altered. A surprising outcome of the study was that mutations that conferred resistance to bafilomycin had little effect on inhibition by concanamycin. Assayed in vitro, the V-ATPase from the bfr mutant strains was 13-70-fold more resistant to bafilomycin than the wild type strain but less than 3-fold more resistant to concanamycin. Because bafilomycin and concanamycin have similar structures, we had expected them to bind the V-ATPase at the same site. The data suggested this might not be correct. The consensus model of the structure of V-ATPases, which applies to yeasts, filamentous fungi, insects, and mammals, proposes 13 different subunits, several present in multiple copies (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). These are organized into two sectors, the V1 subunits (A-H), which can be removed from the membrane in soluble form, and the Vo subunits (a, c, c′, c″, and d), which are tightly associated with the membrane. Like the F-ATPase, the enzyme functions as a rotary motor (21Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

It is not yet clear if the V-ATPase in animal cells has a c′ subunit (26Sun-Wada G.H. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Hayami K.

Previously, we proposed a simple model to explain bafilomycin inhibition of the V-ATPase; binding occurs at the interface of the rotating c subunits and the stationary a subunit, blocking rotation (20Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the current paper we identify additional bfr mutations in N. crassa and describe strains with increased resistance to both bafilomycin and concanamycin. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae we demonstrate that homologous mutations in subunit c confer resistance as in N. crassa and ask if mutations in the corresponding sites in subunits c′ and c″ can confer resistance to the macrolide antibiotics. The positions of the altered residues within subunit c lead us to a hypothesis for the folding of that polypeptide and a more detailed proposal for the bafilomycin and concanamycin binding sites. N. crassa Strains; Growth of Cells—N. crassa strain 74A (or 74a) was used as the wild type. A and a refer to the two mating types of N. crassa. Bfr33 is a bafilomycin-resistant strain with the mutation T32I in subunit c of the V-ATPase. Strains were maintained on Vogel's medium N (a minimal medium salt solution at pH 5.8) supplemented with 2% sucrose. For experiments designed to test resistance to bafilomycin or concanamycin, this medium was modified by the addition of 20 mm HEPES buffer and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. Bafilomycin or concanamycin from a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide was added after autoclaving the medium. To compare the morphology of germinating spores growing in the presence of inhibitors, we photographed the colonies on agar plates with a digital camera mounted on a dissecting microscope. S. cerevisiae Strains; Growth of Cells—The S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used are summarized in Table I. They were maintained on YEPD medium or synthetic minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. The dilution spotting growth assays were carried out by growing cells to saturation in liquid YEPD medium. Cell numbers were estimated by absorbance at 600 nm and diluted to 1 × 107 cells/ml in water. Serial 5-fold dilutions of these cells in water (10-μl aliquots) were pipetted onto YEPD plates adjusted to pH 7.5 with 50 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer and supplemented with bafilomycin or concanamycin. We incubated the plates at 30 °C and photographed them after 2 and 3 days.Table IS. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceSF838-1DαMATα, ade6, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, pep4-3, his4-519, gal2Ref 47Rothman J.H.

Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, we irradiated conidia from the wild type strain 74A with ultraviolet light and selected for growth on Vogel's minimal medium adjusted to pH 7.2 and supplemented with 1.0 μm bafilomycin A1. Four bcr (bafilomycin- and concanamycin-resistant) strains were isolated by a similar procedure with the following differences. We started with strain bfr33a, which carries the T32I mutation in subunit c of the V-ATPase, and selected for growth on medium at pH 7.2 containing 0.5 μm concanamycin C. Putative mutants were backcrossed to strain bfr33 al-3A to test for linkage of the new mutation to the vma-3 locus, which encodes subunit c. Al-3 (albino) is closely linked (∼5 map units) to vma-3. Site-directed Mutagenesis of S. cerevisiae VMA3, VMA11, and VMA16—Mutations were introduced into epitope-tagged versions of VMA3, VMA11, and VMA16 previously subcloned into the yeast CEN vector pRS316 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The following amino acid changes were made by the site-directed mutagenesis of each codon as indicated: Vma3p T32I (act → att), Vma3p F135L (ttt → ttg), Vma3p Y142N (tac → aac), Vma11p T38I (aca → ata), Vma11p F143L (ttc → ttg), Vma11p Y150N (tat → aat), Vma16p F106L (ttc → tta), and Vma16p Y113N (tac → aac). Using pLG47 as template, QuikChange mutagenesis was also used to generate Vma3p T32I (act → att), Vma3p I54F (att → ttt), and the double mutant T32I/I54F before integration into the yeast genome. These mutations were introduced into the genomic locus by single step gene replacement after transformation with the SacI/XhoI fragment of pLG160, -161, or -162 and selecting for Ura+ transformants. The presence of each mutation was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid insert using custom sequencing primers complementary to the 5′-flanking sequence and located ∼100 bp upstream of the initiating codon. Sequence was generated by the DNA sequencing facility at the University of Oregon. Site-directed mutations in VMA3, VMA11, or VMA16 present on pRS316 vectors were transformed using standard yeast methods into their respective deletion strains and tested for the ability to complement the Vma- phenotype by growth on YEPD plus 100 mm CaCl2. Isolation of Vacuolar Membranes, Analysis of ATPase Activity, and the Effects of Inhibitors—Vacuolar membranes were prepared from N. crassa as described previously (28Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Packer L. Fleischer S. Biomembranes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1997: 861-872Google Scholar) and modified (29Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes were prepared from S. cerevisiae as described (30Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was assayed by the Lowry procedure (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture for N. crassa V-ATPase contained 5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm MgSO4, 10mm NH4Cl, 5mm KN3, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm PIPES buffer, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. The assay mixture for S. cerevisiae V-ATPase contained 5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm KN3, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 25 mm MES buffer, adjusted to pH 6.9 with Tris base. V-ATPase activity was assayed by the Fiske-Subbarow colorimetric procedure as described (32Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Activity assays were typically run for 25 min at 37 °C. Bafilomycin and concanamycin were added to the V-ATPase assay mix from a 1 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide for the highest concentration of inhibitor being tested (typically 0.3 or 1.0 μm); this solution was diluted serially in V-ATPase mix to obtain the desired lower concentrations of inhibitor. When Ki values were compared for different strains, the titrations were carried out at the same time in the same assay mixture to compensate for instability of inhibitors when thawed several times. The reaction was initiated by the addition of vacuolar membranes. Isolation and Sequencing of DNA—N. crassa genomic DNA was prepared from 20 mg of lyophilized mycelia, using the DNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen). The protein coding region of the vma-3 gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ primer was CACGGCAATCTCCAATTC, and the 3′ primer was the reverse complement of GAACTCGGTCTAGGTCTCC. Amplified DNA of 1080 bp was purified by separation on agarose gels and extraction by the Geneclean procedure (Bio 101). The same primers were used for the sequencing reactions, performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Berkeley. Materials—The bafilomycin A1 used in these experiments was a gift from Dr. C. Farina and Dr. S. Gagliardi (NiKem Research, Milan, Italy). Concanamycin C was a gift from Dr. A. Zeeck (University of Göttingen) and Dr. K. Altendorf (University of Osnabrück). Isolation of Two New bfr Strains—We previously described N. crassa strains mutated at three sites in the gene encoding subunit c of the V-ATPase. These mutations conferred resistance to bafilomycin in vivo and in vitro. In a further screen with mutagenesis of strain 74A and selection with bafilomycin we isolated two additional mutants whose properties were similar to those of the original bfr strains. V-ATPase activity was assayed in vitro for sensitivity to bafilomycin and concanamycin. With bafilomycin, we obtained Ki values of 4.6 nm for 74A (wild type control), 94 nm for bfr34, and 17 nm for bfr314 (Fig. 1A). With concanamycin the Ki values were 3.5 nm for 74A, 7.3 nm for bfr34, and 5.6 nm for bfr314 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the VATPase of the two mutant strains showed an increase in resistance to bafilomycin of 20- and 4-fold and a smaller increase in resistance to concanamycin of 2.1- and 1.6-fold. The mutations mapped to vma-3, and sequencing of the vma-3 gene identified the mutations as I39F in bfr34 and as L140F in bfr314 in subunit c. Isolation of Strains with Significant Resistance to Concanamycin—Several years ago we mutagenized strain 74A of N. crassa and selected for growth on concanamycin at pH 7.2 (29Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We obtained ∼100 concanamycin-resistant strains. However, none of these grew vigorously in medium containing the inhibitor, and none were altered in a V-ATPase gene. We recently repeated this experiment and again failed to obtain any mutants altered in the V-ATPase. Reasoning that double mutants might confer strong resistance to concanamycin, we mutagenized the bfr33 strain, which has the T32I mutation in subunit c. This strain was chosen because it had the strongest resistance to the inhibitors of our original four bfr strains, a 70-fold increase in resistance to bafilomycin and a 3-fold increase in resistance to concanamycin. To select mutant strains, conidia of strain bfr33a were exposed to ultraviolet irradiation and spread on pH 7.2 plates containing 0.5 μm concanamycin. Strain bfr33a cannot grow on this medium. After 2-3 days, many conidia had germinated and formed colonies. Selecting larger colonies with more normal morphology, we isolated 70 colonies on day 2 and 86 colonies on day 3. The isolates were designated bcr1-bcr156 (for bafilomycin/concanamycin resistant) and were initially maintained on the same medium with concanamycin. All the isolates were backcrossed to strain bfr33A (T32I) to see if the resistance phenotype was heritable and to eliminate secondary mutations that may have been present in the primary isolate. Ninety-three of the strains produced ascospores that germinated on pH 7.2 medium containing 0.5 μm concanamycin. However, most of the colonies grew poorly and had abnormal morphology. As in our previous genetic screens for drug-resistant mutants, most of the strains had mutations, not in the V-ATPase but in genes that were able to partially suppress the toxic effects of concanamycin. In the bcr strains occurrence of a second mutation in vma-3 strongly correlated with vigor of growth on the concanamycin plates. Approximately 10% of the strains grew vigorously and had nearly normal hyphal morphology, characterized by long straight hyphae with smaller side branches (Fig. 2, bcr 31, 69, 118, and 149). Most of the strains produced smaller colonies, often with dichotomous branching at the hyphal tips (Fig. 2, bcr 50, 37, 19, 134). In 8 of the 11 most vigorously growing strains sequencing of the vma-3 gene revealed both the original bfr mutation and a second mutation. Three strains were T32I/I54F mutants; one was a T32I/V55A mutant, two were T32I/M130I mutants, and two were T32I/L132F mutants (see below). Three strains that grew reasonably well on concanamycin did not show genetic linkage to al-3, which lies within 5 map units of vma-3. In vitro assays of V-ATPase activity in the unlinked strains showed no increase in resistance to concanamycin. We identified one as a pma-1 mutant (bcr19) and did not pursue the others. The vma-3 gene was sequenced in nine other strains that grew weakly on medium with concanamycin. None of these had a second mutation in the vma-3 gene. Assessment of V-ATPase Resistance to Concanamycin and Bafilomycin in Vitro and in Vivo—To test the effect of concanamycin and bafilomycin on the bcr strains with double mutations in subunit c, we chose one strain from each category, isolated vacuolar membranes, and assayed V-ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table II, the V-ATPases of the bcr strains showed increased resistance to both inhibitors. Compared with the original strain bfr33 (T32I), the V-ATPases of strains bcr31 (T32I/V55A) and bcr118 (T32I/M130I) were 2-fold resistant to concanamycin; the V-ATPase of bcr149 (T32I/L132F) was 3-fold resistant, and that of bcr69 (T32I/I54F) was 12-fold resistant (Fig. 3A). Thus, the enzymes from the bcr strains were 6-39-fold more resistant to concanamycin than the wild type enzyme. Three of the bcr mutants showed a further increase in resistance to bafilomycin in vitro as well. The V-ATPases of strains bcr118 (T32I/M130I), bcr149 (T32I/L132F), and bcr69 (T32I/I54F) were, respectively, 3-, 4-, and 5-fold resistant to bafilomycin compared with bfr33 (T32I) or 37-325-fold resistant compared with 74A (WT) (Fig. 3B). Only bcr31 (T32I/V55A) showed no increase in resistance to bafilomycin (Fig. 3B).Table IIProperties of bfr and bcr mutant strains of N. crassaStrainMutation in subunit cV-ATPase activityIncrease in resistance to bafilomycinIncrease in resistance to concanamycinμmol/min/mg74ANone4.71.0×1.0×bfr34I39F2.720.0×2.1×bfr314L140F3.03.7×1.6×bfr33T32I2.168.0×3.1×bcr31T32I/V55A3.837.0×5.6×bcr69T32I/I54F2.2325.0×39.0×bcr118T32I/M130F2.7215.0×5.6×bcr149T32I/L132F1.5286.0×9.9× Open table in a new tab The characteristic phenotype of S. cerevisiae and N. crassa cells lacking a functional V-ATPase is the inability to grow on medium at alkaline pH (33Nelson H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Concanamycin prevents growth of wild type N. crassa on medium at pH 7.2, indicating that the V-ATPase is inhibited and inactive. At pH 5.8, concanamycin does not prevent growth of N. crassa, but it profoundly affects the morphology of the filamentous fungus, reducing the rate of hyphal extension and altering the pattern of hyphal branching. The mutations in the bcr strains partially suppressed this phenotype. In the presence of concanamycin, strains bcr31 (T32I/V55A), bcr69 (T32I/I54F), bcr118 (T32I/M130I), and bcr149 (T32I/L132F) grew vigorously at pH 7.2 and had a nearly normal growth pattern, long straight hyphae with small side branches (Fig. 2). We did not see a direct correlation between the degree of resistance to concanamycin in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the order of resistance of the V-ATPase was bcr69 (T32I/I54F) > bcr149 (T32I/L132F) > bcr118 (T32I/M130I) = bcr31 (T32I/V55A) (Fig. 3 and Table II). In vivo, the strongest growers in the presence of concanamycin were bcr69 and bcr31 followed by bcr118 and bcr149 (Fig. 2). The mutations affected the activity of the enzyme as well as the binding of inhibitor. The specific activity of the V-ATPase in vacuolar membranes (average of two preparations) was 4.8 μmol/min/mg for bcr31 (T32I/V55A), 2.3 μmol/min/mg for bcr69 (T32I/I54F), 3.0 μmol/min/mg for bcr118 (T32I/M130I), and 1.3 μmol/min/mg for bcr149 (T32I/L132F). The relatively high specific activity of the bcr31 enzyme might explain its stronger growth when compared with bcr149. Attempting to get more concanamycin-resistant mutants, we performed a similar screen for concanamycin-resistant double mutants with bfr21 (F136L) as the initial strain. The V-ATPase of bfr21 (F136L) is 13-fold resistant to bafilomycin and is not resistant to concanamycin in vitro as compared with the wild type enzyme. We found no concanamycin-resistant strains that mapped to vma-3. Similarly, another attempt to obtain concanamycin-resistant mutants altered in the V-ATPase from strain 74A yielded no new mutants. In each of our mutant runs we have pursued several of the mutants that did not show linkage to vma-3, hoping to find a mutation in a different V-ATPase gene. Activity assays in vacuolar membranes have shown no increase in resistance of the V-ATPase to the antibiotics in these other strains. Effect of bfr Mutations on V-ATPase of S. cerevisiae—The c, c′, and c″ subunits of V-ATPases are highly conserved proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1998142932,"Gram-positive bacteria face unique challenges in generating biologically active conformations for their exported proteins because they lack a dedicated compartment for folding secreted polypeptides. We have discovered that protein secretion by way of the general secretory (Sec) pathway in the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes proceeds through a single microdomain. Unlike other mechanisms for asymmetry involving the Sec pathway, proteins destined for secretion are targeted to a single locus distal to either cell pole that has specialized to contain the Sec translocons. This subcellular organization may represent a paradigm for secretion common to other Gram-positive pathogens with profound implications for pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1544117147,"In response to replicative stress, cells relocate and activate DNA repair and cell cycle arrest proteins such as replication protein A (RPA, a three subunit protein complex required for DNA replication and DNA repair) and the MRN complex (consisting of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1; involved in DNA double-strand break repair). There is increasing evidence that both of these complexes play a central role in DNA damage recognition, activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and DNA repair pathways. Here we demonstrate that RPA and the MRN complex co-localize to discrete foci and interact in response to DNA replication fork blockage induced by hydroxyurea (HU) or ultraviolet light (UV). Members of both RPA and the MRN complexes become phosphorylated during S-phase and in response to replication fork blockage. Analysis of RPA and Mre11 in fractionated lysates (cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic, chromatin-bound, and nuclear matrix fractions) showed increased hyperphosphorylated-RPA and phosphorylated-Mre11 in the chromatin-bound fractions. HU and UV treatment also led to co-localization of hyperphosphorylated RPA and Mre11 to discrete detergent-resistant nuclear foci. An interaction between RPA and Mre11 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of both protein complexes with anti-Mre11, anti-Rad50, anti-NBS1, or anti-RPA antibodies. Phosphatase treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase or λ-phosphatase not only de-phosphorylated RPA and Mre11 but also abrogated the ability of RPA and the MRN complex to co-immunoprecipitate. Together, these data demonstrate that RPA and the MRN complex co-localize and interact after HU- or UV-induced replication stress and suggest that protein phosphorylation may play a role in this interaction.

Stalled replication forks threaten DNA replication fidelity and genomic integrity. Stalled forks occur after deficiencies in replication substrates, inhibition of replication machinery, or blocking of the replication machinery by DNA damage or DNA-protein complexes (1Rothstein R.

Replication fork stalling with subsequent replication stress is also thought to occur during normal DNA replication, particularly at DNA sequences that are prone to form secondary structures (e.g. tRNA genes) or in regions where transcription complexes may collide (2Bierne H. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Failure to resolve this replication stress may result in the collapse of stalled forks and genomic instability (3Michel B. Ehrlich S.D. Uzest M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To prevent such instability, replication stress triggers the activation of a DNA damage response. This response involves the recruitment and activation of proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. This DNA damage response uses proteins to detect damage, signal the site of damage, and transduce and amplify the signal to activate needed effector proteins. Many proteins involved in these three aspects accumulate and form large nuclear foci after DNA damage. Examples of such proteins include γH2AX, 53BP1, ATM, ATR, BRCA1, Werner's protein, the MRN 1The abbreviations used are: Mre11·Rad50·Nbs1; RPA, replication protein A; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; UV, ultraviolet light; Wrn, Werner's protein; λPPase, λ phosphatase; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; EtBr, ethidium bromide; HU, hydroxyurea; MRN; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; ATR, ATM-and Rad3-related; ATRIP, ATR-interacting protein; DSBs, double-strand breaks. complex, and RPA1 (4Rouse J.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The functions of these foci are not fully understood, but they may represent sites of fork reactivation, protein activation, DNA repair, and/or non-repairable damage (6Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar, 7Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 8Wang Y. Cortez D.

Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Replication protein A (RPA), the major single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein in eukaryotic cells, accumulates along stretches of ssDNA generated by stalled replication forks and/or DNA damage (10Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 11Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Haaf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the RPA·DNA complex created by the accumulation of RPA at these sites may signal the presence of damage and activate the DNA damage response. In support of this, Dart et al. (12Dart D.A. Adams K.E. Akerman I. Lakin N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16433-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) show that recruitment of ATR to nuclear foci after replication fork stalling is dependent on RPA (12Dart D.A. Adams K.E. Akerman I. Lakin N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16433-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that RPA promotes DNA binding and activation of ATR/ATRIP in vitro (13Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). RPA is also required to recruit and activate Rad17 complexes for checkpoint signaling in vivo (14Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Further evidence that RPA acts as a common intermediate for signaling stalled replication forks/DNA damage is demonstrated by the RPA-dependent binding of Cut5 to chromatin after DNA damage and its subsequent recruitment of ATR and DNA polymerase α to chromatin (15Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45507-45511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In that report, Parrilla-Castellar and Karnitz (15Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45507-45511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) put forth a model suggesting that ssDNA generated at a stalled replication fork is coated with RPA, leading to Cut5 chromatin association. Cut5 then facilitates the chromatin association of ATR and DNA Polα, which in turn leads to the loading of the 9-1-1 complex (15Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45507-45511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data have given credence to the hypothesis that RPA-coated ssDNA acts as a common intermediate for signaling-stalled replication forks and/or DNA damage and subsequent recruitment and activation of DNA damage response proteins. It is likely that RPA plays a dual role in the damage response network, that of a sensor of damage and also as an effector. Replication protein A is an essential component of most, if not all, DNA repair processes. Petrini and Stracker (16Petrini J.H. Stracker T.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) postulate that, similar to RPA, the MRN complex acts as a sensor of DNA damage needed to activate the DNA damage response. Recent data suggest that the MRN complex functions as a damage sensor upstream of ATM/ATR activation in addition to acting as an effector downstream of ATM/ATR in double strand break repair and cell cycle checkpoints (17Petrini J.H. Huwiler K.G. Weaver D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7615-7619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8586-8591PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is known that the MRN complex binds to DNA ends, there is no clearly defined mechanism by which the MRN complex recognizes other types of DNA damage. Because both RPA and the MRN complexes are believed to be involved in the sensing and signaling of DNA damage, we postulated that these two complexes might interact at sites of stalled replication forks and DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction of these proteins in response to hydroxyurea (HU)- and ultraviolet light (UV)-induced replication stress and DNA damage. After treatment with these agents, RPA and Mre11 became phosphorylated and co-localized to discrete chromatin-bound nuclear foci. RPA and the MRN complex also co-immunoprecipitated together, suggesting that these proteins interact either directly or indirectly. The interaction between RPA and the MRN complex was abrogated by phosphatase treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that after replication stress induced by HU or UV, RPA and the MRN complex co-localized and interacted at sites of stalled replication forks and that the protein interaction may be mediated at least in part by protein phosphorylation. Cell Lines and Treatments—HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). For UV exposure, the growth medium was removed (and held at 37 °C), and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The PBS was replaced with minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) without phenol red, and cells were treated with 30 J/m2 UVC (for asynchronous cells) or 20 J/m2 (for cells synchronized in S-phase) using a low pressure mercury lamp (Mineralight lamp; model UVG-11; UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) with a maximal output at 254 nm. After UV exposure, the minimum essential medium was removed and replaced with the original growth medium, and cells were allowed to recover for 8 h at 37 °C before harvesting. For HU (Sigma-Aldrich) treatment, cells were incubated in growth medium containing HU (2 mm) for 3 h before harvesting. Western Immunoblots—Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were probed using the following primary antibodies: anti-Mre11 (Novus Biological, Littleton, CO; 1:20,000), anti-Mre11 (GeneTex, San Antonio, Texas; 1:10,000), anti-RPA-p34 (Neomarkers, Freemont, CA; 1:5000), and anti-RPA-p34-SP4-SP8 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX; 1:10,000). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences; 1:3000), and bound antibodies were visualized using chemiluminescent detection. Cell Synchronization—Cells were synchronized in S-phase and G1-phase of the cell cycle as previously described (21Oakley G.G. Loberg L.I. Yao J. Risinger M.A. Yunker R.L. Zernik-Kobak M. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Carty M.P. Dixon K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To synchronize in S-phase, cells were incubated in growth medium containing aphidocolin (final concentration of 1 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 h. After incubation, the aphidocolin-containing medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in fresh medium without aphidocolin for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. For nocodazole synchronization in G1- or S-phase of the cell cycle, cells were incubated in medium containing nocodazole (0.3 μm final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich) for 17 h. The mitotic cells, which become detached from the culture dish as they entered M-phase, were collected and pelleted at 500 × g. Mitotic cells were released from nocodazole treatment by incubating in fresh medium. We have shown previously that HeLa cells enter G1-phase about 5 h after release and enter S-phase about 12 h after release (21Oakley G.G. Loberg L.I. Yao J. Risinger M.A. Yunker R.L. Zernik-Kobak M. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Carty M.P. Dixon K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For the experiments reported here cells were treated with HU from 4.5 to 7.5 h after release (for G1-phase) or from 12 to 15 h after release (for S-phase) and then harvested. Subcellular Fractionation—The cellular protein fractionation protocol was performed as previously described with slight modifications (22Liu J.S. Kuo S.R. Yin X. Beerman T.A. Melendy T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14661-14668Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, S-phase-synchronized HeLa cells were treated with either HU, UV, or mock-treated. The free cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic fraction was prepared by allowing cells to lyse for 10 min on ice in 0.5% Triton X-100 in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μl/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (free cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic; fraction FCN) was collected. The pellet was washed with PBS and treated with 100 μg/ml DNase I in cell lysis buffer at 37 °C for 15 min followed by the addition of ammonium sulfate (250 mm final concentration) and further incubation at room temperature for 10 min. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and designated as the chromatin-bound fraction (fraction CB). The remaining insoluble material was washed with PBS, suspended in SDS buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), and designated the nuclear matrix fraction (fraction NM). The presence of glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, histone H1, and lamin A/C within the free nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic fraction, chromatin-bound fraction, and nuclear matrix fraction, respectively, verified the validity of this fractionation method. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on 18- or 12-mm coverslips (BD Biosciences) for 20–24 h before treatment. Cells were treated with 30 J/m2 UVC (asynchronous cells) and allowed to recover for 8 h or with 2 mm HU for 3 h. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS, then washed with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and fixed for 5 min with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde (Fisher). Cells were then blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Primary antibody dilutions used are as follows: anti-RPA-p34-SP4-SP8 1:2000 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), anti-RPA 1:1000 (Neomarkers), anti-Mre11 1:500 (Novus Biological), anti-Mre11 1:500 (Genetex), anti-γH2AX 1:300 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA), and anti-Wrn 1:300 (Novus Biological). Secondary antibody dilutions are as follows: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 1:250 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 1:250 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were captured with a Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope with attached CCD camera at 100× magnification and processed using Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe) software. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—For co-immunoprecipitation reactions, 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were incubated with 3.0–5.0 μg of anti-Mre11 (Novus Biological), anti-RPA-p70 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), or normal rabbit IgG (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature with end-over-end mixing. After the addition of ∼1000 μg of cell lysate, the immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated for 20–24 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. The immunoprecipitates were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were extracted from the agarose beads by resuspending in 1× Laemmli gel-loading buffer and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When antibodies cross-linked to the agarose beads were used, 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were incubated with 3.0–5.0 μg of anti-Mre11 (Novus Biological) for 1 h at room temperature with end-over-end mixing. The beads were washed twice with 200 mm triethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and then incubated in 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 mm triethanolamine for 30 min at room temperature. The dimethyl pimelimidate solution was replaced with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for an additional 15 min. The Tris-HCl was removed, and the beads were suspended in PBS and stored at 4 °C until the addition of cell lysate. Phosphatase Treatment—For phosphatase treatments of cellular lysates, 10× NEBuffer 3 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to ∼1000 μg of total protein to give a final concentration of 1× NEBuffer. 200 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) was added to the mixture and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. For phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitates, samples were prepared by washing immunoprecipitates with PBS to remove non-specifically bound proteins and the remaining medium. For CIP treatment, the pellets were resuspended in 1× NEBuffer 3 with the addition of 50 units of CIP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h before collection of the Mre11-associated pellet and supernatant. For λ-phosphatase (λPPase) treatment, the pellets were resuspended in 1× λPPase buffer (New England Biolabs) with 2 mm MnCl2 or 1× λPPase buffer with 1 mm Na2VO4 and 10 mm NaF (known inhibitors of λPPase). 400 units of λPPase was added to each reaction tube and then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Replication Stress Induces Hyperphosphorylation of RPA and Phosphorylation of Mre11—Both RPA-p34 and Mre11 are phosphorylated in a DNA damage-dependent and a DNA replication-dependent manner (23Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Costanzo V. Robertson K. Bibikova M. Kim E. Grieco D. Gottesman M. Carroll D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To verify that phosphorylation of RPA-p34 and Mre11 occurred after exposure of HeLa cells to 2 mm HU for 3 h and 20 J/m2 or 30 J/m2 UV, whole cell lysates from treated cells were visualized for RPA-p34 and Mre11 via Western blotting. Similar to previous reports, these treatments resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of the RPA-p34 subunit and phosphorylation of Mre11 (Fig. 1, A (lanes 2–3 and 5–6) and B (lanes 2–3 and 8–9)). When cells were synchronized in S-phase before treatment with HU or UV, the proportion of hyperphosphorylated RPA and phosphorylated Mre11 increased (Fig. 1, A (lanes 5–6) and B (lanes 8–9)). This increase in RPA and Mre11 phosphorylation in treated S-phase cells is most likely due to the replication stress induced by these agents. An antibody that recognizes phosphorylated serine 4 and serine 8 of RPA-p34 specifically recognized only the DNA damage-dependent hyperphosphorylated form of RPA-p34 (Fig. 1, B (lanes 4–6 and 10–12)). The phosphorylation of RPA and Mre11 suggests that these proteins are involved in the cellular response to replication stress. Phosphorylated RPA and Mre11 Are More Tightly Bound to the Chromatin—It has been previously reported that after DNA damage, RPA becomes re-distributed within the nucleus and is found predominantly bound to the chromatin (22Liu J.S. Kuo S.R. Yin X. Beerman T.A. Melendy T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14661-14668Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mre11, which has increased chromatin binding in S-phase, does not show a re-distribution within the nucleus after DNA damage in any stage of the cell cycle (6Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhao S. Renthal W. Lee E.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate the nuclear re-distribution of the phosphorylated isoforms of RPA and Mre11 after replication fork stalling and DNA damage, cellular proteins of S-phase-synchronized cells were separated into three fractions: 1) free cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic, 2) chromatin-bound, and 3) nuclear matrix fractions. To confirm the separation of the three fractions, we verified the presence of glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (a cytosolic protein), histone H1, and lamin A/C (a nuclear matrix protein) within the free nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic fractions, chromatin-bound fractions, and nuclear matrix fractions, respectively (data not shown). In mock-treated cells, ∼60% of the total RPA was in the free cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic fraction, whereas Mre11 was present in all three fractions, with the chromatin-bound fraction containing the largest percent (Fig. 2, A (lanes 2–3) and B). After HU or UV treatment, there was a redistribution of RPA to the chromatin-bound fraction (Fig. 2, A (lanes 6–8 and 10–12) and B), with the percent of total RPA changing from 40% chromatin-bound in mock-treated cells to ∼85% in HU- or UV-treated cells. As previously reported (22Liu J.S. Kuo S.R. Yin X. Beerman T.A. Melendy T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14661-14668Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the damage-induced hyperphosphorylated isoform of RPA was found predominantly in the chromatin-bound fraction. Although the distribution of Mre11 between the different fractions did not change after damage, the majority of the damage-induced phosphorylated form of Mre11 was found in the chromatin-bound fraction (Fig. 2, A (lanes 7 and 11) and B). RPA and Mre11 Co-localize to Discrete Nuclear Foci after HU or UV Treatment—After the induction of DNA damage, many proteins associated with DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoints become localized to sites of damage and form nuclear “foci” (4Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To visualize these foci and to determine whether Mre11 and RPA were present in these “repair foci,” we used immunofluorescent staining. Pre-extraction of cells with a detergent-containing buffer removes the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, leaving behind the chromatin-bound and matrix-associated proteins (6Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar). In mock-treated cells stained with antibodies against RPA and Mre11, there was a diffuse nuclear staining. After HU or UV treatment, there was a redistribution of RPA and Mre11 to discrete foci that co-localized (Fig. 3A, panels D, H, and L). Although studies have shown that both RPA and the MRN complex are able to form nuclear foci after DNA damage by various genotoxic agents (6Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar, 7Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 11Raderschall E.

We also looked for co-localization of Mre11 with hyperphosphorylated RPA using the RPA-p34-SP4-SP8 phospho-specific antibody. Under mock-treatment conditions, there is no staining with the phospho-specific RPA antibody as expected (Fig. 3B, panel B). After treatment with HU or UV, similar to staining with the antibody that recognizes all isoforms of RPA, phosphorylated-RPA aggregated into nuclear foci that co-localized with Mre11 (Fig. 3B, panels D, H, and L). In addition to co-localization of RPA and hyperphosphorylated-RPA with Mre11 and similar to previous reports, these foci also showed limited co-localization with phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) (6Mirzoeva O.K.

MOCS1A shares homology with S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent radical enzymes, which catalyze the formation of protein and/or substrate radicals by reductive cleavage of AdoMet through a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Sequence analysis of MOCS1A showed two highly conserved cysteine motifs, one near the N terminus and one near the C terminus. MOCS1A was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Individual mutations of the conserved cysteines to serine revealed that all are essential for synthesis of precursor Z in vivo. The type and properties of the iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters were investigated using a combination of UV-visible absorption, variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, Mössbauer, and EPR spectroscopies coupled with iron and acid-labile sulfide analyses. The results indicated that anaerobically purified MOCS1A is a monomeric protein containing two oxygen-sensitive FeS clusters, each coordinated by only three cysteine residues. A redox-active [4Fe-4S]2+,+ cluster is ligated by an N-terminal CX3CX2C motif as is the case with all other AdoMet-dependent radical enzymes investigated thus far. A C-terminal CX2CX13C motif that is unique to MOCS1A and its orthologs primarily ligates a [3Fe-4S]0 cluster. However, MOCS1A could be reconstituted in vitro under anaerobic conditions to yield a form containing two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. The N-terminal [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster was rapidly degraded by oxygen via a semistable [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster intermediate, and the C-terminal [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster was rapidly degraded by oxygen to yield a semistable [3Fe-4S]0 cluster intermediate.

The molybdenum cofactor in eukaryotic molybdoenzymes consists of a mononuclear molybdenum coordinated by the dithiolene moiety of a tricyclic pyranopterin, termed molybdopterin (MPT) 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, molybdopterin; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; FeS, iron-sulfur; MOCS, molybdenum cofactor synthesis; RR, resonance Raman; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; VTMCD, variable temperature MCD; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; mT, millitesla; VTVH, variable temperature and variable field. 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, molybdopterin; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; FeS, iron-sulfur; MOCS, molybdenum cofactor synthesis; RR, resonance Raman; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; VTMCD, variable temperature MCD; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; mT, millitesla; VTVH, variable temperature and variable field. (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, defects in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis lead to the pleiotropic loss of the molybdoenzymes sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and xanthine dehydrogenase (2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Reiss J. Johnson J.L. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Affected patients usually die shortly after birth and show neurological abnormalities, such as attenuated growth of the brain, untreatable seizures, and dislocated ocular lenses (4Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Wadman S.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The first step during human molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is catalyzed by MOCS1A and MOCS1B, leading to the synthesis of precursor Z, an oxygen-sensitive 6-alkyl pterin with a cyclic phosphate, from a guanosine derivative, most likely 5′-GTP (5Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Gotze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analogous to other pteridine biosynthetic pathways, synthesis of precursor Z has been proposed to occur via a GTP cyclohydrolase-like reaction mechanism (5Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Gotze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast to these pathways, the C-8 atom of 5′-GTP is not released as formate but is retained and incorporated in a rearrangement reaction as the first carbon atom of the precursor Z side chain. In the second step of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis catalyzed by MOCS3 (8Matthies A. Rajagopalan K.V. Mendel R.R. Leimkühler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and MPT synthase (MOCS2) precursor Z is converted into MPT (9Stallmeyer B. Drugeon G. Reiss J. Haenni A.L. Mendel R.R. Am. J. Hum.

Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). MOCS1A contains two highly conserved cysteine motifs (Fig. 1) proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster binding (14Menendez C. Igloi G. Henninger H. Brandsch R. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Menendez C. Siebert D. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), one is located near the N terminus (consensus sequence CX3CX2C where X denotes any amino acid), and one is near the C terminus (consensus sequence CX2CX13C). Several mutations identified in molybdenum cofactor deficiency patients are located in these conserved cysteine motifs indicating their functional importance for protein activity (2Reiss J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Reiss J. Johnson J.L. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities to proteins such as biotin synthase, pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme, and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase-activating enzyme, MOCS1A has been classified as a member of the superfamily of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent radical enzymes (16Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In this class of enzymes, AdoMet serves as the free radical initiator and undergoes cleavage to methionine and a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical that in turn propagates radical formation by abstracting hydrogen atoms either from substrate molecules to form radical intermediates or from glycyl residues of enzymes to activate them for radical-based biochemistry (17Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Frey P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 121-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Jarrett J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Frey P.A. Magnusson O.T. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2129-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The source of the electron required for the cleavage of AdoMet is a reduced form of an FeS cluster. In MOCS1A the N-terminal cysteine motif is highly homologous to a motif in AdoMet-dependent radical enzymes that ligates a [4Fe-4S] cluster, whereas the C-terminal motif is unique to MOCS1A and its orthologs. Here we describe the purification of MOCS1A, the spectroscopic characterization of its FeS clusters, and site-directed mutagenesis investigations of the role of the N- and the C-terminal cysteines. Single and triple Cys → Ser mutants were generated and analyzed in terms of catalytic activity and spectroscopic properties. The results showed that all six cysteines are essential for activity. The results also indicated that anaerobically purified MOCS1A is a monomeric protein containing two oxygen-sensitive FeS clusters, each ligated by only three cysteine residues. A redox-active [4Fe-4S]2+,+ cluster is ligated by the N-terminal CX3CX2C motif as is the case with all other AdoMet-dependent radical enzymes investigated thus far, whereas a [3Fe-4S]0 cluster is ligated by the C-terminal CX2CX13C motif. However, MOCS1A could be reconstituted in vitro to yield a form containing two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters, and both clusters appeared to be degraded via [3Fe-4S]0 and/or [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster intermediates on exposure to oxygen. Expression and Purification of MOCS1A and Mutated Proteins—All expressions were conducted in LB medium at 30 °C in the Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) or CL100 (iscS-)(DE3). Cultures were induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.1. After 8 h of growth, cells were harvested and stored at -80 °C. For cells grown for Mössbauer measurements, 5 mg/liter 57Fe, as ferric ammonium citrate, was added to the growth medium at induction. All purification steps were carried out either under anaerobic conditions inside a glove box (Coy Laboratories) in an argon atmosphere containing less than 2 ppm O2 at 4 °C or under aerobic conditions. Cells were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 20 mm imidazole and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Hen egg white lysozyme (2 mg/ml) and a few crystals of bovine pancreas DNase were added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min and sonicated. After centrifugation (60 min, 4 °C, 48,000 × g) MOCS1A was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen, 1.5 ml of matrix/liter of culture volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 followed by 10 bed volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. Brown-colored fractions were pooled, desalted by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with buffer B (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 300 mm NaCl), concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Centriprep-30, Millipore), and stored at -80 °C. Oligomeric State of MOCS1A—Fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.0 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer B was used for size determination. The column was calibrated using aldolase (Mr = 158,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr = 67,000), ovalbumin (Mr = 43,000), chymotrypsinogen A (Mr = 25,000), and ribonuclease A (Mr = 13,700) as marker proteins. Reconstitution of the FeS Cluster—Expression and purification of E. coli IscS was as described by Leimkühler and Rajagopalan (21Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All steps of the reconstitution procedure were made anaerobically as described above. Anaerobically purified MOCS1A (250 μm) in buffer B was incubated with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min. Then a 10-fold molar excess of FeCl3 and l-cysteine and 200 μm pyridoxal phosphate in buffer B containing 5 mm dithiothreitol was added. After addition of 2.5–5 μm IscS the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Reconstituted proteins were desalted over Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with buffer B to remove pyridoxal phosphate and adventitiously bound iron and sulfide. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Immunoblotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was carried out with primary polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant MOCS1A (1:5000 diluted serum). The membranes were probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, and bands were visualized with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium detection system (Promega). Nitrate Reductase Overlay Assay—For functional complementation the E. coli moaA mutant strain KB2037 (moaA940delT) was transformed with the corresponding expression plasmids. Qualitative analysis of nitrate reductase activity was performed by a colony overlay assay (22Glaser J.H. DeMoss J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Vivo Assay for Precursor Z Synthesizing Activity—The E. coli moaD mutant strain MJ7chlM (DE3) was transformed with the corresponding expression plasmids and grown anaerobically in 50 ml of LB medium containing 0.4% (w/v) nitrate and 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Precursor Z was detected as compound Z in crude cell extracts by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (7Hänzelmann P. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analytic Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) standardized against bovine serum albumin. Protein-bound iron and acid-labile sulfide were determined by the methods of Fish (24Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and Fogo and Popowsky (25Fogo J.K. Popowsky M. Anal. Biochem. 1949; 21: 732-734Google Scholar), respectively, standardized against either Fe(II) ethylenediammonium sulfate or ammonium sulfide. Spectroscopic Methods—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. X-band (∼9.6 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP-300E EPR spectrometer equipped with an ER-4116 dual mode cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 flow cryostat. Resonances were quantified under non-saturating conditions using a 1 mm Cu-EDTA standard. Resonance Raman (RR) spectra were recorded using an Instruments SA U1000 spectrometer fitted with a cooled RCA 31034 photomultiplier tube with 90° scattering geometry. Spectra were recorded digitally using photon-counting electronics, and improvements in signal-to-noise were achieved by averaging multiple scans. Band positions were calibrated using the excitation frequency and are accurate to ±1 cm-1. Lines from a Coherent Sabre 10-watt argon ion laser were used for excitation, and plasma lines were removed using a Pellin Broca prism premonochromator. Scattering was collected from the surface of a frozen droplet of sample at 17 K using a custom-designed anaerobic sample cell (26Drozdzewski P.M. Johnson M.K. Appl. Spectrosc. 1988; 42: 1575-1577Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) attached to the cold finger of an Air Products Displex model CSA-202E closed cycle refrigerator. Bands originating from lattice modes of ice and a linear ramp fluorescent background have been subtracted from each spectrum shown in this work. Variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VTMCD) measurements were carried out with an Oxford Instruments Spectromag 4000 split coil superconducting magnet mated to either a Jasco J715 or a Jasco J730 spectropolarimeter using published protocols (27Johnson M.K. Que L. Metal Clusters in Proteins. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1988: 326-342Google Scholar, 28Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. George S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Variable temperature and variable field (VTVH) MCD saturation magnetization data were collected by monitoring MCD intensity at fixed temperatures as a function of the applied magnetic field. The data were corrected for temperature-independent contributions by extrapolating plots of MCD intensity versus inverse temperature to infinite temperature and subtracting a proportional correction at each field. Data are plotted as percent magnetization against βB/2kT where percent magnetization is the percentage of the MCD intensity relative to magnetic saturation, β is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Theoretical VTVH MCD saturation magnetization data were constructed as published previously (29Bennett D.E. Johnson M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mössbauer spectra were recorded using spectrometers described previously (30Ravi N. Bollinger J.M. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8007-8014Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The zero velocity refers to the centroid of the room temperature spectra of metallic iron foil. Analysis of the Mössbauer data was performed with the program WMOSS (WEB Research). Effect of ISC and SUF Proteins as Well as the GroES/EL Chaperonin System on the Expression of MOCS1A—MOCS1A contains an N-terminal extension of ∼56 amino acids not found in any of its bacterial orthologs. Due to an increased stability in comparison with the full-length protein, MOCS1A without its N-terminal extension (MOCS1A-Δ1–56, 39 kDa) was expressed with an N-terminal His tag. Deletion of the additional amino acids at the N terminus increased the in vivo precursor Z synthesizing activity by about a factor of 1.5 (data not shown). MOCS1A and orthologous MoaA proteins in eukaryotes and prokaryotes were characterized as FeS cluster-containing proteins (15Menendez C. Siebert D. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Solomon P.S. Shaw A.L. Lane I. Hanson G.R. Palmer T. McEwan A.G. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The de novo synthesis and assembly of FeS clusters in E. coli is mediated by the ISC (iron-sulfur cluster) system (iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx) (32Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), while the SUF (sulfur) system (sufABCDSE) (33Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) has been proposed to be involved in the repair of oxidatively damaged FeS clusters and/or play a role in FeS biosynthesis under conditions of iron limitation (34Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Expression of MOCS1A in the E. coli iscS mutant strain CL100 (35Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) resulted in an inactive iron-free insoluble MOCS1A protein showing that MOCS1A is only stable in its holoform (data not shown). ApoMOCS1A is improperly folded due to the absence of the FeS clusters and tends to aggregate in inclusion bodies. Coexpression of MOCS1A with iscSUA-hscBA-fdx or sufAB-CDSE and the E. coli chaperonin system groES/EL in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) increased the amount of soluble MOCS1A by a factor of 1.7–2.2, and MOCS1A could be purified by Ni-NTA chromatography with a yield of about 10 mg/liter of cell culture. However, coexpression of MOCS1A with the ISC or SUF proteins revealed no changes in the FeS cluster composition of purified proteins (data not shown). These studies showed that under overexpression conditions MOCS1A requires (i) the assistance of chaperones (GroES/EL) and/or (ii) proteins for efficient de novo biosynthesis of FeS clusters (ISC and SUF) for proper folding and/or insertion of the FeS cluster. Spectroscopic Characterization of the FeS Cluster Composition of MOSC1A—MOSC1A was purified under aerobic conditions and under anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere. Both samples were brown, indicating the presence of FeS clusters, and the nature and properties of the FeS clusters in aerobic and anaerobic preparations were investigated using UV-visible absorption, RR, EPR, VTMCD, and Mössbauer spectroscopies coupled with iron, acid-labile sulfide, and protein analyses. Aerobically purified samples of MOCS1A contained 3.6 ± 0.2 mol of iron and 3.9 ± 0.3 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of MOCS1A, and the absorption spectrum exhibited peaks/shoulders around 320–330 and 415 nm and in the region between 500 and 600 nm (Fig. 2A). The spectrum is more typical of a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster than a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (36Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37Duin E.C. Lafferty M.E. Crouse B.R. Allen R.M. Sanyal I. Flint D.H. Johnson M.K.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). More definitive assessment of the FeS cluster content was provided by RR, EPR, and VTMCD, which indicated that aerobically purified MOCS1A primarily contains a mixture of [3Fe-4S]0 and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters. The RR spectrum (Fig. 3A) of the protein as purified comprises broad bands centered at 290, 338, 369, and 392 cm-1 and is very similar to those reported for the [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters that are observed during oxygen-induced degradation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters in other members of the AdoMet-dependent radical enzymes, e.g. anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase-activating enzyme (40Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem.

EPR studies only showed a near isotropic S = 1/2 resonance centered near g = 2.01 (Fig. 4) with relaxation properties (observable only below 30 K) indicative of a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster (43Johnson M.K. Duderstadt R.E. Duin E.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 1-82Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in addition to a large g = 4.3 resonance from adventitiously bound ferric ions. However, spin quantitation indicated that the g = 2.01 resonance is a very minor component accounting for only 0.01 [3Fe-4S]+ clusters/MOCS1A monomer.Fig. 3Resonance Raman spectra of MOCS1A.A, aerobically purified MOCS1A.

Conditions of measurement were as follows: temperature, 20 K; microwave power, 5 milliwatts; frequency, 9.59 GHz; modulation amplitude, 0.64 mT. Selected g values are indicated on the spectra. Sample concentrations were 0.43 mm for aerobically purified, 0.24 mm for anaerobically purified, 0.14 mm for anaerobically reconstituted, and 0.25 mm for the anaerobically purified N-terminal Cys → Ser triple variant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Parallel mode X-band EPR and VTMCD studies of aerobically purified MOCS1A revealed the presence of S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 clusters in addition to S = 0 [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters. A broad low field resonance centered near g = 9.4 was observed in the conventional perpendicular mode X-band EPR spectrum, and the resonance sharpened and intensified in parallel mode (Fig. 5). Similar integer spin EPR signals have been reported for a range of S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 clusters (43Johnson M.K. Duderstadt R.E. Duin E.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 1-82Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover parallel VT-MCD studies (Fig. 6A and data not shown) showed a pattern of intense, temperature-dependent MCD bands that are uniquely characteristic of the excited state properties of cubane-type S = 2 [3Fe-4S]0 clusters (43Johnson M.K. Duderstadt R.E. Duin E.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 1-82Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the basis of the intensity of the VTMCD spectrum, [3Fe-4S]0 clusters are the major component of aerobically purified MOCS1A with between 0.5 and 1.0 [3Fe-4S]0 clusters/monomer. [3Fe-4S]0 clusters give rise to very weak RR spectra compared with [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters using a 457.9 nm laser (at least 20 times weaker (43Johnson M.K. Duderstadt R.E. Duin E.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 1-82Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), and this presumably explains the absence of bands attributable to [3Fe-4S]0 clusters in the RR spectrum shown in Fig. 3A.Fig. 6VTMCD spectra of MOCS1A.A, as-purified MOCS1A.

https://openalex.org/W2072696058,"Strategies for inhibiting phagolysosome fusion are essential for the intracellular survival and replication of many pathogens. We found that the lysosomal synaptotagmin Syt VII is required for a mechanism that promotes phagolysosomal fusion and limits the intracellular growth of pathogenic bacteria. Syt VII was required for a form of Ca 2+ -dependent phagolysosome fusion that is analogous to Ca 2+ -regulated exocytosis of lysosomes, which can be triggered by membrane injury. Bacterial type III secretion systems, which permeabilize membranes and cause Ca 2+ influx in mammalian cells, promote lysosomal exocytosis and inhibit intracellular survival in Syt VII +/+ but not –/– cells. Thus, the lysosomal repair response can also protect cells against pathogens that trigger membrane permeabilization."

Cytosolically synthesized precursor proteins are generally made with an N-terminal transit peptide that is both necessary and sufficient for chloroplast recognition and translocation initiation. Translocation across the outer and inner envelopes of chloroplasts is achieved by the Toc 1The abbreviations used are: Toc, translocon of the outer envelope of chloroplasts; Tic, translocon of the inner envelope of chloroplasts; mSSU, mature form of small subunit of Rubisco; pSSU, precursor of small subunit of Rubisco; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase. and Tic complexes, respectively (translocon at the outer/inner envelope of chloroplasts). Upon import, the targeting peptide is removed by a stromal processing peptidase, and the mature protein is further sorted and assembled into active structures (5Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Preproteins are recognized in a GTP-dependent manner by the Toc34 receptor at the chloroplast surface (6Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J.

The GTPase activity of Toc34 is greatly stimulated by precursor binding, and upon GTP hydrolysis the preprotein is released from Toc34GDP to Toc159 (9Jelic M. Sveshnikova N. Motzkus M. Horth P. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Toc159, another GTP-dependent protein, interacts with the preprotein in a manner that also involves GTP hydrolysis (6Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J.

Several subunits of the Tic complex have been identified. Tic110, which is the second most abundant protein in the inner envelope (17Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hemmler R. Wagner R. Kuchler M. Hormann F. Sveshnikov D. Soll J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, because of different proposals about the topology and structure of Tic110 (21Heins L. Mehrle A. Hemmler R. Wagner R. Kuchler M. Hormann F. Sveshnikov D. Soll J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2616-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Inaba T. Li M. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Biol.

In addition, Tic110 could interact with the molecular chaperones cpn60 and Hsp93 on the stromal face of the membrane. It could also act as a chaperone recruitment factor (17Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a role that could also be mediated by Tic40, a Tic subunit that might function as a co-chaperone because of the presence of a TPR domain and homology to heat shock interacting and heat shock organizing proteins (23Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 24Stahl T. Glockmann C. Soll J. Heins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The molecular role of the other Tic subunits is less well defined. Tic62 and Tic55 have redox properties and could be involved in regulation of translocation across the inner envelope membrane (25Caliebe A. Grimm R. Kaiser G. Lubeck J. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7342-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Kuchler M. Decker S. Hormann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tic22 is a peripheral subunit exposed to the intermembrane space and could therefore function as a link between the Toc and the Tic complexes (27Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Tic20 is an integral protein of the inner envelope and shows homology to amino acid transporters (27Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Rassow J. Dekker P.J. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This led to the assumption that Tic20 is involved in the formation of a translocation channel that might be formed independently or together with Tic110. Biochemical evidence for a distinct function of Tic20 is, however, still missing. Plastids isolated from an Arabidopsis Tic20 antisense line show reduced import yields, and translocation seems to be arrested at the level of the Tic complex (29Chen X. Smith M.D. Fitzpatrick L. Schnell D.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Tic110 is the most abundant of all Tic subunits in the inner envelope of chloroplasts. The N-terminal domain of Tic110 (amino acids 1–180) contains 1–2 hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices that anchor the protein in the membrane and that are also required for targeting and insertion into the inner envelope (17Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Lubeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In an attempt to find interaction partners of Tic110, we identified a novel 32-kDa protein localized in the inner envelope. This protein interacts tightly with other Tic subunits and forms a chemical cross-link product with a precursor protein. It is an essential gene in Arabidopsis and we propose to call it Tic32. Growth of Plants and Isolation of Chloroplast Membrane Fractions— Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 12–14-day-old plants (Pisum sativum L. var. Golf) as previously described (30Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Outer and inner envelope membrane vesicles were isolated from purified chloroplasts by sucrose density centrifugation (31Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana (var. Columbia) were grown under a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle at 20 °C on Murashigee and Skoog medium (32Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1960; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54341) Google Scholar) or soil. Mutants were selected with Basta. Production of Antibodies—Full-length tic32 was cloned into the pET21d vector (Novagen, Schwalbach, Germany) with a C-terminal His6 tag. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal-chelating chromatography prior to immunization. Isolation of Tic32 Mutants (at4g23430)—Mutant line Garlic 861 was obtained from Syngenta (33Sessions A. Burke E. Presting G. Aux G. McElver J. Patton D. Dietrich B. Ho P. Bacwaden J. Ko C. Clarke J.D. Cotton D. Bullis D. Snell J. Miguel T. Hutchison D. Kimmerly B. Mitzel T. Katagiri F. Glazebrook J. Law M. Goff S.A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Mutant line 117H08 was generated in the context of the GABI-KAT (Max-Planck-Institute of Plant Breeding, Cologne, Germany) (34Rosso M.G. Li Y. Strizhov N. Reiss B. Dekker K. Weisshaar B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) program. When grown on medium containing Basta, no homozygous plants could be observed, but compared with wild-type seeds about 20% of mutant seeds did not germinate. In Garlic 861 the T-DNA insertion is located in the first intron; in 117H08 the T-DNA is located in exon IV as verified by DNA sequencing (see “Results”). Screening of Phage-based cDNA Library—Screening of pea (Pisum sativum L.) Uni-Zap cDNA library was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from peptide sequences of the pea protein. Both strands of the obtained cDNA clone were sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY488758). Interaction Partners of Tic110 —To find interaction partners of the N terminus of Tic110, a hybrid protein of mature Tic110 (amino acids 39–269) and a C-terminal fusion with mSSU-His6 (35Lubeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or with a His6 tag alone were overexpressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, dissolved in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 8 m urea, immobilized onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix, and washed with the above buffer. After washing, the refolding of the protein on the matrix was achieved by creating refolding conditions on the matrix with a linear gradient of 8-0 m urea in 20 mm Tris/HCL, pH 8.0 (36Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The column was then equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4), pH 7.2. 500 μl of inner envelope vesicles corresponding to 0.5–1 mg of protein were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 3% decylmaltoside, incubated on ice for 10 min, and diluted to 2 ml with phosphate-buffered saline. Unresolved membrane fractions were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed three times over the matrix. Proteins bound to the matrix were eluted with a KCl step gradient (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mm in phosphate-buffered saline). Fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (37Ansorge W. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1985; 11: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For protein sequencing, the affinity purification was repeated three times. The fractions were pooled, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was briefly stained with Coomassie G250, and the protein band of interest was treated with trypsin and used for protein microsequencing (Top Lab, Munich, Germany). Immunoprecipitation and Cross-linking—Isolated inner envelope vesicles were solubilized in 2% octylglucoside, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% egg albumin. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with antisera against Tic110 and Tic32, incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and washed extensively with 10 volumes of the above buffer. Proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. Cross-linking was carried out as described earlier (23Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In short, pea chloroplasts (15 μg of chlorophyll) were incubated with radiolabeled pSSU for 2 min on ice or for 10 min at 25 °C. Cross-linking was performed with 0.5 mm dithiobis succinimidyl propionate for 15 min on ice and quenched with 25 mm glycine for 15 min on ice. Chloroplasts were lysed (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA). After centrifugation (125,000 × g, 30 min), the membrane fractions were solubilized in 1% SDS in 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% egg albumin. Solubilized membranes were diluted to 0.1% SDS, immunoprecipitated with antisera against Toc75, Tic110, Tic32 and preimmune serum and coupled onto protein A glass beads (ProSep-vA-High Capacity; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The matrix was washed extensively with the above buffer. Cross-links were cleaved with β-mercaptoethanol in SDS-sample buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were analyzed using a phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS 3000) and quantified using the Aida software. Microscopy—Seeds were cleared in Hoyer's solution (39Liu C.M. Meinke D.W. Plant J. 1998; 16: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and observed using Normarski optics (Axiophot; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Identification of Tic110 Interaction Partners—To identify potential interaction partners of Tic110, we expressed the N-terminal amino acids 1–231 either with a C-terminal mSSU-His6 fusion or with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in E. coli. The proteins were bound separately to a nickel-chelating matrix and incubated with purified inner envelope proteins solubilized in 3% decylmaltoside. The matrices were washed, and bound protein was eluted by increasing salt concentrations. Although the flow-through from the affinity matrix contained numerous proteins, only one polypeptide was eluted from the Tic110N-mSSU-His6 matrix at salt concentrations around 600 mm KCl (Fig. 1A, left panel). This polypeptide migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (subsequently named Tic32). A protein of similar size eluted from the Tic110N-His6 matrix though at slightly lower KCl concentrations (Fig. 1A, middle panel). This could be because of the missing spacer arm in this construct, which could result in steric hindrance of Tic32 binding. An affinity matrix containing only mSSU did not bind any envelope proteins (Fig. 1A, right panel). Peptide sequences were obtained from the trypsin-treated protein (Fig. 1B) and used for the generation of degenerated oligonucleotides. Screening of a pea cDNA library resulted in the isolation of a single clone, the deduced amino acid sequence of which contained all three sequenced peptides (Fig. 1B). The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34.3 kDa and a pI of 9.47. Sequence comparison of the pea 32-kDa protein shows homologies to enzymes in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, bacteria, and mammals and reveals that Tic32 belongs to the enzyme superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) (Fig. 1C). To determine the localization of Tic32 within chloroplasts, proteins purified from organellar subfractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using different antisera against marker proteins. Tic32 was detected in chloroplasts and in purified inner envelope membranes such as the marker protein Tic110. Very little antigen was found in the outer envelope and none in the stroma or the thylakoids. Tic32 shows strong homologies to the gene product of at4g23430, which was found in a proteomic analysis from purified mixed envelope preparation from Arabidopsis (40Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Tic32 behaves as an integral membrane protein because it is not extractable by either 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Na2CO3, or 6 m urea (Fig. 2B). We conclude that Tic32 is a genuine inner envelope protein from chloroplasts. Tic32 Is Involved in Protein Import—Chemical cross-linking can be used to identify proteins that are in close vicinity to each other. We incubated isolated chloroplasts with radiolabeled precursor pSSU under conditions that allow binding and partial translocation (i.e. 3 mm ATP, 4 °C) and the formation of import intermediates or complete translocation (i.e. 3 mm ATP, 25 °C) (31Waegemann K.

Cross-linking was done using the thiol-cleavable cross-linkers dithiobis succinimidyl propionate (Fig. 3B) or sodium tetrathionate (data not shown). Cross-linked products were enriched by immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions (0.1% SDS) and subsequently analyzed after cleavage of the cross-link products by β-mercaptoethanol by SDS-PAGE. Antisera against Toc75, Tic110, Tic40, and Tic32, but not against OEP24 or preimmune serum, could co-immunoprecipitate the radiolabeled precursor at 4 °C and 3 mm ATP (Fig. 3, B and C). These conditions allow the formation of translocation intermediates, i.e. precursor proteins are in contact with Toc and Tic subunits but do not allow complete translocation. At 25 °C in the presence of 3 mm ATP, the mature form (mSSU) also became detectable when α-Tic110 or α-Tic32 was used for immunoprecipitation. The mSSU form was less pronounced in α-Toc75 precipitates, indicating that Tic32 is in close proximity to the preprotein at a late stage of translocation. Processing of precursors occurs concomitant to translocation; thus the presence of mSSU as a cross-linked partner is not surprising and indicates that Tic32 is in close proximity to a preprotein late in the translocation process. A similar cross-link product ratio of pSSU and mSSU with Toc75, Tic110, and Tic40 was observed in import reactions that lasted up to 20 min (23Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Next we investigated whether Tic32 is present in a protein complex together with other components of the translocon. Purified inner envelope membranes were treated with 2% octylglycoside, and solubilized proteins were incubated with either α-Tic110 or α-Tic32. Antigen-antibody complexes were purified by protein A-agarose, and co-fractionated protein was determined by immunoblot analysis. α-Tic32-immunoprecipitated complex contained Tic110, Tic62, Tic 40, and Tic32, but no Toc75 and very little Tic22 (Fig. 3A). The complex composition obtained by α-Tic110 co-immunoprecipitation was similar, except that we constantly observed significant amounts of Tic22. Because Tic22 is a peripheral subunit of the Tic complex, it could be that Tic22 and Tic110 also interact independently of other Tic subunits. Tic32 Knock-out Lines—In Arabidopsis two genes are present that show significant homologies to Tic32 over the entire coding region, namely at4g23430 and at4g41140. As shown by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4A), only at4g23430 is expressed in all examined tissues. Together with the data from the proteomic analysis of envelope membranes from Arabidopsis chloroplasts, we anticipate that pea Tic32 is the orthologue of the at4g23430 gene product. Two independent T-DNA insertion lines for at4g23430 were available from different resource centers (Fig. 4B). Both Arabidopsis lines, attic32synintronI and attic32KölnexIV, were cultivated and the F1 generation was analyzed for homozygous offspring. We were unable to obtain homozygous insertion lines, indicating that atTic32 is essential for viability. Support for this idea came from the observation that, in contrast to wild-type, seed pods from mutant lines contained numerous aborted seeds that seem to fail to develop properly (Fig. 4C). Embryos from wild-type seeds as well as from mutant seeds were analyzed by light microscopy using Normarski optics. In wild-type seeds we could see a clear development from globular (Fig. 4D, a) to heart stage (Fig. 4D, b and c) to torpedo stage (Fig. 4D, d). In mutant seeds the globular stage of embryo development was still normal (Fig. 4D, e and f); however, embryos in the heart stage looked deformed and not as symmetric as wild-type (Fig. 4D, g and h). In no case could we observe any torpedo stage in aborted seeds. In this study a new component of the Tic complex was found while screening for interaction partners for the N terminus of Tic110. Only one protein with a mass of 32kDa could be observed in a silver stain after elution with increasing salt concentrations (Fig. 1A), indicating a strong interaction between Tic110 and this protein. Three peptide sequences for Tic32 were obtained. A degenerate oligonucleotide derived from one of the obtained amino acid sequences was used as a probe for a screen of a pea cDNA library, and a single cDNA clone was isolated. The primary structure deduced from the cDNA clone contained all three peptides, obtained from Tic32 by microsequencing, thus confirming that this cDNA corresponded to the purified protein. Blast searches of the protein data base revealed membership in SDR, an evolutionarily conserved, functionally heterogeneous protein superfamily found in all organisms, with a typical chain length of about 250 residues (43Kallberg Y.

SDRs are defined by distinct sequence motifs, comprising an N-terminal TGXXXGXG motif that is responsible for NAD(P+) coenzyme binding, a highly conserved NNAG motif stabilizing the central β-sheet, and the active site tetrad consisting of Asn, Ser, Tyr, and Lys residues (Fig. 1C) (45Filling C.

Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases are involved in various processes in cellular homeostasis, e.g. in basic metabolic roles (fatty acid or sugar metabolism), control of hormone ligand levels, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis (44Oppermann U.

Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). SDR enzymes, such as several retinol dehydrogenases (RDH), are frequently membrane-bound, where they form complexes with other membrane proteins (51Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 52Simon A. Romert A. Gustafson A.L. McCaffery J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tic32 is the Pisum ortholog of a previously defined SDR cluster found in a cross-species comparison between Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana (53Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1C. To this end, the molecular functions of this ortholog cluster have mostly been studied in humans, represented by the WW domain containing reductase WWOX; however, its substrate specificity has not yet been determined. WWOX is a proapoptotic oncogene and interacts with signaling molecules like JNK1 or p53 and is thereby involved in stress signaling. Tic32 displays several important structural features. Tic32 does not show the N-terminal WW interaction domain, as compared with human WWOX, but instead is highly similar to other members of the cluster, e.g. human retinol dehydrogenases RDH11 and RDH13. No obvious transmembrane domain can be found within the primary structure using different prediction methods; however, Tic32 shows high homology to the hydrophobic SDR proteins RDH11 and RDH13 (Fig. 1C), which are ER membrane-bound. The sequence alignment and our own experimental data (54Nada A. Soll J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that Tic32 is targeted and imported without a detectable presequence but by internal sequence information. Taken together, the biochemical data obtained and the theoretical considerations outlined above make it possible that Tic32 acts as an important component of a membrane transport complex with essential functions for cellular integrity, as demonstrated by the gene deletion experiments in A. thaliana. At present, the molecular substrate of Tic32 remains unknown, but as outlined below, Tic32 might function as redox sensor in the chloroplast import machinery. Because the association of Tic32 with Tic110 does not necessarily mean an involvement of Tic32 in protein translocation, we used co-immunoprecipitation to confirm the affiliation. With antisera against Tic32 and Tic110, all other known Tic components, namely Tic110, Tic62, Tic40, Tic32, and Tic22, could be precipitated. In a second approach, we tested whether Tic32 interacts with precursor proteins during translocation. For this purpose we used chemical cross-linking with dithiobis succinyl propionate (23Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). pSSU could indeed be immunoprecipitated with antiserum against Tic32, even the mature form, indicating that it might play a role late in the import process (23Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To further investigate this possible role, we utilized two independent T-DNA insertion lines from the Arabidopsis homologue at4g23430. We used this homologue and not at4g11410 because the homology to the pea protein was higher in at4g23430 and this protein was expressed in all tissues, whereas at4g11410 was not expressed in seeds (Fig. 4A). Therefore, at4g11410 should not be responsible for the embryo lethal phenotype we observed. Furthermore, at4g23430 was found in the inner envelope of A. thaliana chloroplasts in a proteomic approach, whereas at4g11410 was not detectable (40Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of this gene product is still unknown. To our surprise, no homozygous plants could be generated, assuming that the mutation is lethal in embryonic development. This assumption was confirmed when we investigated the siliques. About 20% of the seeds of the mutant seeds were aborted. In younger siliques they had a white appearance, whereas in older siliques they looked brown and shriveled, indicating a lack of chlorophyll accumulation and thylakoid biogenesis (Fig. 4C). These aborted seeds did not germinate on sucrose-containing agar plates. Micrographs of mutant seeds supported this finding. The embryonic development in mutant seeds stopped at the level of the heart stage (Fig. 4D). So far, such a drastic phenotype for a component of the translocon has not been reported. T-DNA mutants deficient in atToc159 (ppi2 mutants) were viable on Murashigee and Skoog medium, but not on soil (55Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 56Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). tic40 null mutants were pale and showed a reduced import rate but were viable (23Chou M.L. Fitzpatrick L.M. Tu S.L. Budziszewski G. Potter-Lewis S. Akita M. Levin J.Z. Keegstra K. Li H.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2970-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), similar to antisense lines of atTic20 (29Chen X. Smith M.D. Fitzpatrick L. Schnell D.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The most severe tic20 mutants are not viable on soil (29Chen X. Smith M.D. Fitzpatrick L. Schnell D.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the Tic32 null mutant has such a severe phenotype, it has to have an essential function in plastid development during embryogenesis. Given that Tic32 is tightly associated with Tic110, it is conceivable that Tic32 controls the gating of Tic110 as, for example, do β subunits of potassium channels. There, Kvβ oxidoreductase activity couples Kv channel inactivation to cellular redox regulation (57Bahring R. Milligan C.J. Vardanyan V. Engeland B. Young B.A. Dannenberg J. Waldschutz R. Edwards J.P. Wray D. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22923-22929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is even more tempting to speculate about some kind of redox regulation at the inner envelope because there are other Tic components that show redox features: Tic62 and Tic55 contain a Rieske-type iron-sulfur center (25Caliebe A. Grimm R. Kaiser G. Lubeck J. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7342-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Kuchler M. Decker S. Hormann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, for some nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins, regulation of gene expression by redox mechanism has been proposed (58Escoubas J.M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 59Oswald O. Martin T. Dominy P.J. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recently, the influence of light, and therefore the redox state of the chloroplast, was suggested to affect protein import in vitro (61Hirohashi T. Hase T. Nakai M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the presence of light, the non-photosynthetic ferredoxin III, which is usually localized in the stroma, was mis-sorted to the inter-membrane space (61Hirohashi T. Hase T. Nakai M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tic32 might be a subunit of a redoxsensing circuit that regulates the import of photosynthetic proteins into the organelle."

Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Similarly, the overproduction of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) has been implicated in the response to cytokines including tissue damage and apoptosis (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34223-34228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, however, it has become more clear that ROS and RNS are important transducers of cellular signaling that regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and death (2Chen K. Thomas S.R. Keaney Jr., J.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Among ROS and RNS, H2O2 has emerged as a particularly important signaling molecule that is consistent with its chemical similarities to nitric oxide, a well characterized autocrine and paracrine signaling species (6Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, like nitric oxide, H2O2 has defined targets such as protein thiol moieties that produce a variety of sulfur oxidation products that have the potential to produce distinct cellular responses (7Kim S.O. Merchant K. Nudelman R. Beyer Jr., W.F. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Hausladen A. Stamler J.S. Cell. 2002; 109: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Secondly, H2O2 is a weak oxidant with a relatively long (seconds) half-life in biological systems (8Liu X. Zweier J.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 894-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, H2O2 is soluble in both lipid and aqueous environments, and thus, capable of traversing several cell diameters before it reacts with its target or is catabolized (2Chen K. Thomas S.R. Keaney Jr., J.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The proximal redox-sensitive targets required for H2O2-induced cell signaling are not well understood. Emerging evidence indicates that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases through a process known as receptor “transactivation” that involves ligand-independent stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity (9Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) is particularly important. In this regard, H2O2-induced transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors has received considerable attention (10Bae Y.S. Kang S. Seo M.

Despite this interest in receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation by H2O2, the precise molecular events involved in this process are not clear. Some studies have implicated Src family kinases in this process (12Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas other data indicate that protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation may have a role (17Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The goal of this study, therefore, was to examine proximal signals involved in H2O2-mediated signal transduction. Materials—Antibodies directed against EGF receptor, PDGF receptor, and VEGF receptor (KDR/Flk-1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, PY20 and 4G10, were from BD Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63), c-Jun, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-p53 (Ser-15), and p53 were from Cell Signaling Technology. The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, mitoQ and mitoVitE, were synthesized as described previously (18Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Hughes G. Ledgerwood E.C. Gane A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Ann. N. Y.

Cell Culture—COS-7 and NIH/3T3 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Cambrex and cultured in EGM-2 and EBM endothelial cell growth medium, respectively (Cambrex). Prior to all experiments, cells were washed in HEPES-buffered physiologic salt solution containing 22 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.16 mm HPO4, 0.4 mm H2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm d-glucose. Cells were then incubated in HEPES-buffered physiologic salt solution prior to exposure to H2O2, tumor necrosis factor-α, growth factors, or UV irradiation (4 kJ/m2) as indicated in “Results.” Creation of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted Cells—Cells were depleted of mtDNA and rendered respiration-deficient as described previously (20King M.P.

Briefly, cells were cultured and passaged in culture medium supplemented with ethidium bromide (250 ng/ml), uridine (50 μg/ml), and sodium pyruvate (110 mg/ml) for 7 days. Cells treated in this manner will be referred to as (pseudo-ρ0), and their status as mtDNA-depleted was verified by examining the expression of mitochondrial DNA-encoded cytochrome oxidase I or II mRNA and protein. To reconstitute normal respiration from pseudo-ρ0 cells, the cells were transferred to normal culture medium (without ethidium bromide, uridine, pyruvate) and passaged for a further 7–14 days. Restoration of mitochondrial was function was verified by reconstituted expression of cytochrome oxidase I or II mRNA and protein. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting procedures were performed essentially as described (12Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

Briefly, after incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice followed by brief sonication. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation (13,600 × g) for 10 min and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (13Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 16Chen K. Albano A. Ho A. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39527-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins or cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting as described (13Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 16Chen K. Albano A. Ho A. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39527-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed using commercially available software (PDI Imageware System, Huntington Station, NY). Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) Activity—Total intracellular tyrosine phosphatase activity was performed using a modification of the tyrosine phosphatase assay kit from Takara Bio. This is a colorimetric assay utilizing the change in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding to immobilized phosphotyrosine-containing peptide. Incubation of cell lysates releases phosphate, thereby reducing antibody binding that is detected by secondary peroxidase-linked antibody. To specifically assess PTP activity susceptible to H2O2 inactivation, H2O2-treated cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer containing 10 μm 5′-iodoacetic acid to irreversibly alkylate and inactivate PTP activity (21Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), and supernatants were incubated for 10 min with 10 mm dithiothreitol to reduce PTP active site cysteines oxidized by H2O2 as described (17Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Samples were then assessed for PTP activity according to the manufacturer's instructions with the resulting activity representing PTPs inactivated by H2O2. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis—An annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit (Calbiochem) was used to detect phosphatidylserine externalization as an index of apoptosis. Briefly, non-adherent and adherent cells, harvested by trypsinization, were pooled, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% bovine serum albumin). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (0.5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.6 μg/ml) were then added to a 250-μl aliquot (∼5 × 106 cells) of this cell suspension. After a 15-min incubation in the dark at room temperature, stained cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (MoFlo®, Dako Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Statistical Analysis—All numerical data are presented as means ± S.D. Western blots shown are representative of three or more independent experiments. Comparisons among treatment groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance and an appropriate post hoc comparison. Statistical significance was accepted if the null hypothesis was rejected with a p < 0.05. Inhibitors Of Flavin and Heme Proteins Attenuate H2O2-induced Activation of JNK and Akt—The activation statuses of JNK and Akt are important determinants of the fate of mammalian cells exposed to H2O2 (11Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J.

J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The proximal redox-sensitive targets involved in H2O2-mediated activation of JNK and Akt are not well understood. Since many physiological redox reactions require flavin- and/or heme-containing proteins, we treated cells with diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or sodium azide, inhibitors of flavin- and heme-containing proteins, respectively, and examined the implications for H2O2-induced JNK and Akt activation. Both DPI and azide inhibited H2O2-induced JNK and Akt activation (Fig. 1). Inhibition of Mitochondrial Function Attenuates H2O2-induced Activation of JNK and Akt—Flavin and heme proteins are important constituents of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. To determine whether inhibition of mitochondrial respiration would recapitulate the results in Fig. 1, we treated cells with distinct inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration and examined H2O2-induced JNK and Akt activation. We found that inhibition of respiration at complex I (rotenone), complex III (antimycin A), and complex IV (KCN) all inhibited H2O2-induced JNK and Akt activation, as did inhibition of mitochondrial complex V-mediated ATP synthesis with oligomycin (Fig. 2, A and B). Collapsing the mitochondrial proton electrochemical potential gradient with the uncoupler carbonylcyanide-mchlorophenylhydrazone also attenuated the ability of H2O2 to activate JNK or Akt (Fig. 2). These effects of mitochondrial inhibitors and uncouplers were not related to general cellular toxicity as UV-induced JNK activation was not sensitive to these compounds (Fig. 2C). These data indicate a specific involvement of mitochondrial function in H2O2-induced signaling. Functioning Mitochondria Are Required For H2O2-induced Transactivation of the EGF Receptor—Transactivation of the EGF receptor is a critical proximal signaling event required for the activation of JNK and Akt in response to H2O2 treatment (11Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of DPI, azide, and mitochondrial respiration on H2O2-induced EGF receptor transactivation. We found that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration abrogated H2O2-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, we found no role for mitochondrial respiration in EGF receptor activation by UV irradiation or its specific ligand, EGF (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, the requirement for a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain appears specific for H2O2-mediated responses. Respiration-deficient Cells Exhibit Impaired Oxidative Stress-induced Signaling—Since the pharmacologic manipulation of mitochondrial respiration is not specific, we sought to manipulate this process through genetic means. Therefore, we generated stable cells deficient in mitochondrial respiration (pseudo-ρ° cells) as described (20King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Culturing cells with ethidium bromide selectively down-regulated expression of the mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxidase II and III at both the mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein levels (Fig. 4B) by 90–100%, without limiting mitochondrial ATPaseα that is encoded by nuclear DNA (Fig. 4B). The effect of ethidium was entirely reversible as evident by restoration of cytochrome oxidase expression in pseudo-ρ°-recovered cells after the removal of ethidium bromide from culture medium for 7 days (Fig. 4B). In response to H2O2, the pseudo-ρ° cells exhibited markedly attenuated levels of phospho-c-Jun and phospho-Akt as compared with parental cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, JNK activation in response to UV irradiation- or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell stress occurred to a similar extent in both parental and pseudo-ρ° cells (Fig. 5C). Transactivation of the EGFR in response to H2O2 was also inhibited in the pseudo-ρ° cells as compared with parental cells with functional mitochondria (Fig. 5D). In contrast, treatment of normal and pseudo-ρ° cells with EGF resulted in similar phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 5E). Importantly, H2O2-induced signaling was fully restored in the ρ°-recovered cells as measured by phosphorylation of c-Jun in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5F), indicating that the procedure for making pseudo-ρ° cells has no adverse side effects on the signaling pathways induced by oxidative stress and the experimental results derived from pseudo-ρ° cells were not simply due to toxicity. Functioning Mitochondria Are Required for H2O2-induced Transactivation of Multiple Growth Factor Receptors—In addition to the EGF receptor, oxidative stress can transactivate other growth factor receptors including the PDGFβ receptor (16Chen K. Albano A. Ho A. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39527-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Min D.S. Kim E.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29986-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and VEGF receptor 2 (KDR/Flk-1) (24Colavitti R. Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Waltenberger J. Galeotti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 3101-3108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To determine whether mitochondrial respiration is involved in these processes, we probed H2O2-induced growth factor transactivation in NIH/3T3 and endothelial cells. Consistent with our findings on the EGF receptor, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with rotenone and oligomycin attenuated PDGFβ receptor transactivation and its downstream signaling to p53 (16Chen K. Albano A. Ho A. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39527-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 6A). This strategy also attenuated H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1/VEGFR2 in bovine aortic endothelial cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast, manipulation of mitochondrial respiration had no material impact on Flk-1/VEGFR2 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to its ligand VEGF (Fig. 6C). Selective Mitochondrial-targeted Antioxidants Inhibit H2O2-induced Signaling—Mitochondrial redox reactions have been implicated in the response to hypoxia (25Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S.

To probe the involvement of mitochondrial redox reactions in H2O2-induced signaling, we utilized the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, mitoQ. This compound has been shown to inhibit H2O2-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage and cell death and to attenuate mitochondrial oxidative damage and putative mitochondrial ROS signaling (27Taylor E.R. Hurrell F. Shannon R.J. Lin T.K. Hirst J. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19603-19610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Jauslin M.L. Meier T. Smith R.A.

Pretreatment of cells with mitoQ at concentrations (<5 μm) that do not disrupt cell or mitochondrial function (31Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) attenuated H2O2-induced EGF receptor transactivation and activation of its downstream targets, JNK and Akt (Fig. 7A). To determine whether the mitochondrial localization of mitoQ is required, we compared mitoQ with Q1, a quinol antioxidant that distributes evenly throughout the cell (18Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Hughes G. Ledgerwood E.C. Gane A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found that Q1 did not block H2O2-induced activation of Akt or JNK (Fig. 7B). Since mitoQ comprises a ubiquinone moiety attached to the triphenylphosphonium lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium, we also included triphenylmethylphosphonium as a control and found no inhibitory effect on H2O2-induced signaling (Fig. 7B). Importantly, mitoQ also had no effect on UV and EGF-induced signaling (Fig. 7C), consistent with our results involving mitochondrial respiration. We also tested another mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, mitoVitE, that consists of α-tocopherol attached to triphenylphosphonium (19Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This compound, like mitoQ, dose-dependently inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and c-Jun (Fig. 7D). However, non-targeted compounds such as vitamin E (α-tocopherol) or Trolox (a water-soluble analog of vitamin E) at the same concentrations had no effect (data not shown). These findings appeared pervasive as H2O2-induced Flk-1/VEGFR2 transactivation was also abrogated by mitoQ, whereas receptor activation by its endogenous ligand, VEGF, was not (Fig. 7E). Thus, both mitoQ and mitoVitE abolish H2O2-induced growth factor transactivation due to their targeted antioxidant properties, and these findings implicate that mitochondria as a proximal component of the cellular response to oxidative stress. H2O2-induced Inhibition of PTP Activity Is Independent of Functioning Mitochondria—Tyrosine phosphorylation is a reversible and dynamic process that reflects the combined activities of both protein tyrosine kinases and PTPs. Exposure to H2O2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation in many proteins that is due, albeit not exclusively, to oxidative inhibition of PTPs (32Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7489) Google Scholar). To determine the implications of mitochondrial respiration for H2O2-mediated PTP inhibition, we treated cells with rotenone or mitoQ and examined PTP activity. Treatment with H2O2 led to PTP inactivation that was not materially altered by pretreating cells with either rotenone or mitoQ, whereas H2O2 scavenging with N-acetyl-cysteine largely abolished H2O2-mediated PTP inhibition (Fig. 8). These data suggest that mitochondrial respiration does not modulate H2O2-mediated growth factor transactivation and signaling through an effect on cellular PTP activity. Inhibition of H2O2-induced Signaling at Mitochondria Prevents Cell Death—To determine whether the effects of mitochondrial respiration have functional consequences, we examined H2O2- and UV-induced apoptosis and necrosis using flow cytometry. We found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with H2O2 (100 μm) for 12 h increased the number of both early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells (Fig. 9). This effect was significantly attenuated by mitoQ, whereas the response to UV irradiation was not sensitive to mitoQ pretreatment (Fig. 9). These data suggest that mitochondria play a distinct role in H2O2-mediated signaling that is not shared by UV irradiation. The principal finding of the current study is that mitochondrial respiration is an important proximal component of the signaling response to H2O2. Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial respiration at multiple sites inhibited both JNK and Akt activation in response to H2O2. This finding was not due to cellular toxicity as UV-induced and ligand-induced responses were insensitive to manipulation of mitochondrial function. We were able to confirm these findings by genetic manipulation of mitochondrial function through the creation of pseudo-ρ0 cells. The site of mitochondria in the H2O2-induced signaling cascade appeared proximal as growth factor receptor transactivation was also sensitive to manipulation of mitochondrial function. In addition, we found evidence for redox-sensitive processes in the mitochondrion as mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants abrogated H2O2-induced cell signaling in the same manner as inhibition of mitochondrial function. Taken together, these data implicate the mitochondrion as a proximal component of redox-sensitive events in cell signaling. The activation of JNK and Akt by H2O2 has distinct phenotypic implications for cell fate (33Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar). Signaling through JNK is a proximal component of the cytochrome c-mediated death pathway (34Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar), and cells deficient in cytochrome c are resistant to specific apoptotic stimuli (35Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt inhibits apoptosis (11Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), in part, by preventing Bax translocation to the mitochondrion (36Tsuruta F. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14040-14047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Available data have also linked stress-mediated activation of these two pathways to EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity that depends, in part, on Src family kinase activation (11Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J.

Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, conventional wisdom places the mitochondrion as a downstream component of stress-induced signaling and the cytochrome c-mediated death pathway. The results reported here add considerably to this body of literature and indicate that mitochondria play a previously unrecognized proximal role in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Manipulation of mitochondrial respiration had profound implications for H2O2-mediated EGF receptor transactivation, a proximal step in both JNK (12Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and Akt (11Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) stimulation. Thus, our data suggest that paradigms for H2O2-mediated signaling must now take into consideration the role of the mitochondrion as a proximal sensor or relay for oxidative stress. It is worth noting that a role for the mitochondrion in H2O2-mediated signaling was evident across multiple cell types and held true for several different growth factor receptors. Since growth factor receptor activation is a generalized response to environmental stress (39Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), our data may have broadranging implications. We were also able to interrupt H2O2-mediated signaling using mitochondrial targeting of lipid-soluble antioxidants. These findings could be consistent with the mitochondrion as a source of ROS in stress signaling, a notion that is consistent with the implication of mitochondrial ROS in other cellular responses. Hypoxia leads to the up-regulation and stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a response linked to mitochondrial H2O2 production from complex III (25Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, hypoxia-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation is blunted by pharmacological inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration such as rotenone and myxothiazol (40Kulisz A. Chen N. Chandel N.S. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1324-L1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These data are in keeping with emerging literature that mitochondrial ROS participate in aging (41Hagen T.M. Yowe D.L. Bartholomew J.C. Wehr C.M. Do K.L. Park J.Y. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), cellular metabolism (42Nemoto S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7311-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the complications of diabetes (53Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2000; 77: S26-S30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and the response to exogenous ROS (43Zorov D.B. Filburn C.R. Klotz L.O. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). A recent study has also implicated mitochondrial oxidant production in early atherosclerotic lesion development (44Ballinger S.W. Patterson C. Knight-Lozano C.A. Burow D.L. Conklin C.A. Hu Z. Reuf J. Horaist C. Lebovitz R. Hunter G.C. McIntyre K. Runge M.S. Circulation. 2002; 106: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), although the mechanism(s) surrounding these observations await further study. At first glance, the implication that mitochondria might serve as both a sensor and a source of ROS might seem incongruous. However, recent studies in cardiac myocytes indicate that mitochondria may produce localized bursts of ROS in response to ROS, a process known as ROS-induced ROS release (43Zorov D.B. Filburn C.R. Klotz L.O. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). In this phenomenon, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opens in response to ROS, and this induces a mitochondrial ROS burst. This process can occur among chains of adjacent mitochondria, and thus, may serve as a means of cell signaling. It is feasible that our observations represent a form of this phenomenon as rotenone potently inhibits both ROS-induced ROS release and H2O2-mediated growth factor receptor transactivation. However, Zorov et al. (43Zorov D.B. Filburn C.R. Klotz L.O. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) also observed profound inhibition of mitochondrial ROS release with bongkrekic acid, and preliminary experiments in our hands demonstrated no effect of this compound on H2O2-induced signaling (data not shown). Thus, complete characterization of the precise proximal molecular events attributable to the mitochondrion will require further study. Although we observed that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants inhibited H2O2-induced signaling events, their non-targeted counterparts were not effective in this regard. These observations have implications with respect to the nature of redox-active species critical for H2O2-mediated signaling. Both ubiquinol (45Stocker R. Bowry V.W. Frei B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) and vitamin E (46Burton G.W. Cheeseman K.H. Doba T. Ingold K.U. Slater T.F. CIBA Found. Symp. 1983; 101: 4-18PubMed Google Scholar) are potent scavengers of lipid-soluble single-electron oxidants (47Pryor W.A. Cornicelli J.A. Devall L.J. Tait B.A. Trivedi B.K. Witiak D.T. Wu M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 3521-3532Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Their non-targeted forms should distribute uniformly throughout the cellular lipid compartment, including the mitochondria. As a consequence, one might expect the non-targeted and targeted forms to be equally effective if a lipid-soluble free radical species were necessary for the response to H2O2. In contrast, the mitochondrial-targeted forms are charged and, as a consequence, should preferentially remain free of the membrane. Thus, our data are most consistent with an aqueous species as the active mitochondrial agent in the signaling response to H2O2. The plausibility of this notion is supported by observations that ROS enhance mitochondrial permeability, thereby facilitating the diffusion of species between the mitochondrion and the cytoplasm (43Zorov D.B. Filburn C.R. Klotz L.O. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). One important target for aqueous redox-active species is protein cysteinyl residues. In this regard, protein tyrosine phosphatases have become the subject of considerable interest concerning H2O2-mediated signaling. These enzymes are important for cellular tyrosine kinase signaling and contain an active site motif consisting of an invariant cysteine and an arginine separated by five residues ((I/V)CXXGXXR(S/T), where X is any amino acid) (48Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This sequence motif facilitates the cysteine function as a nucleophile and also renders it susceptible to oxidation, consistent with observations that H2O2 treatment of many phosphatases leads to enzyme inactivation via cysteine oxidation in vitro (49Denu J.M.

Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we found significant inhibition of cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity with H2O2 treatment. However, we did not observe any material impact on this phenomenon with inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Our approach, however, has limitations including the possibility that the particular subset of phosphatase(s) putatively responsible for growth factor receptor transactivation in our study may represent too minor a component of the total cellular activity to observe a signal. There is a precedent for this phenomenon as cellular treatment with H2O2 inactivates many phosphatase species, but only one (SHP-2) appears germane for PDGF receptor responses (17Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). In summary, the data presented here indicate that mitochondria play an important role in mediating cellular responses to oxidative stress, particularly H2O2. This role of mitochondria appears proximal in the signaling cascades leading to H2O2-induced JNK, Akt, and p53 activation, implicating a novel role of the mitochondria in redox-sensitive signal transduction. Although the precise nature of how mitochondria control the response to H2O2 is not yet clear, our data indicate that mitochondrial function needs to be carefully considered when investigating redox-sensitive signal transduction.

In addition to androgens, AR activity can also be modulated by selective growth factors and/or kinases. Here we report a new kinase signaling pathway by showing that AR transactivation was repressed by wild type glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) or constitutively active S9A-GSK3β in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the catalytically inactive kinase mutant GSK3β showed little effect on the AR transactivation. The suppression of AR transactivation by GSK3β was abolished by the GSK3β inhibitor lithium chloride. The in vitro kinase assay showed that GSK3β prefers to phosphorylate the amino terminus of AR that may lead to the suppression of activation function 1 activity located in the NH2-terminal region of AR. GSK3β interrupted the interaction between the NH2 and COOH termini of AR, and overexpression of the constitutively active form of GSK3β, S9A-GSK3β, reduced the androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth in stably transfected CWR22R cells. Together, our data demonstrated that GSK3β may function as a repressor to suppress AR-mediated transactivation and cell growth, which may provide a new strategy to modulate the AR-mediated prostate cancer growth.

Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, the AR protein is comprised of a nonconserved amino-terminal domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). Upon androgen binding, AR dissociates from the heat-shock proteins and binds to androgen response elements, resulting in up-regulation or down-regulation of the transcription of AR target genes. Mutations in the AR gene cause a range of androgen insensitivity abnormalities in male sexual development and play a key role in human prostatic carcinogenesis, which is the most common invasive malignancy and second leading cause of cancer deaths in males in the United States (3Gittes R.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 236-245Google Scholar, 4Greenlee R.T. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2000; 50: 7-33Google Scholar). In the early stage of this disease, most patients respond favorably to androgen ablation and antiandrogen therapy. However, the effects of androgen ablation are usually transient as cancer cells eventually progress into the androgen-independent phenotype. Several different molecular mechanisms might be responsible for the transition to androgen independence. Many of these involve the mutations in the AR and the altered AR coregulator signaling (5Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Google Scholar, 6Yeh S. Hu Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K. Hsu C.L. Ting H.J. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11256-11261Google Scholar), but they might also include enhanced expression of growth factor receptors and their associated ligands (7Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Google Scholar). In addition to responding to ligands, the AR is affected by kinase signaling pathways, which directly or indirectly alter the biological responses to androgens. This phenomenon is mediated by the AR as antiandrogens have been shown to block kinase-induced transcriptional activation (8Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Google Scholar). Growth factors, cytokines, and neuropeptides have been implicated in various in vitro and in vivo models of human malignancies, including prostate cancers (9Burfeind P. Chernicky C.L. Rininsland F. Ilan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7263-7268Google Scholar). In the absence of androgens, insulin-like growth factor-1, keratinocyte growth factor, and epidermal growth factor are able to activate transcription of AR-regulated genes in prostate cancer cells (10Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Eur. Urol. 1995; 27: 45-47Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt kinase cascades have been shown to be involved in growth factor-mediated AR activation (7Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Google Scholar, 11Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845Google Scholar, 12Lin H.K. Yeh S.

Commun. 2003; 305: 462-469Google Scholar). Some neuropeptides, such as bombesin and neurotensin, can stimulate AR activation and cancer cell growth in the absence of androgen by activation of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (14Lee L.F. Guan J. Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8385-8397Google Scholar). To date, it is well established that the AR is a phosphoprotein, and its activity is correlated with its phosphorylation status. Prostate cancer cells may progress from androgen dependence to a refractory state resulting from activation of AR by various kinases, thus circumventing the normal growth inhibition caused by androgen ablation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that was first described in a metabolic pathway for glycogen synthase regulation (15Cohen P. Nimmo H.G. Proud C.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1978; 43: 69-95Google Scholar). It is now clear that GSK3β is a multifunctional kinase that regulates a wide range of cellular processes, ranging from intermediate metabolism and gene expression to cell fate determination, proliferation, and survival (16Hardt S.E. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1055-1063Google Scholar, 17Krylova O. Messenger M.J. Salinas P.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 83-94Google Scholar, 18Harwood A.J. Plyte S.E. Woodgett J. Strutt H.

GSK3β phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, including several transcription factors such as c-Myc, c-Jun, rat glucocorticoid receptor, heat-shock factor-1, nuclear factor of activated T-cells c, and β-catenin (20Sears R.

Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Google Scholar). In contrast to other kinases, GSK3β is highly active in unstimulated cells and becomes inactivated in response to mitogenic stimulation (26Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Google Scholar). Growth factors down-regulate GSK3β activity through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/p90RSK pathway (27Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Google Scholar, 28Torres M.A. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1427-1437Google Scholar). Consistent with its position downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/p90RSK pathways, GSK3β activity suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis (29Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Google Scholar, 30Hall J.L. Chatham J.C. Eldar-Finkelman H. Gibbons G.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1171-1179Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 9 of GSK3β inhibits its activity by creating an inhibitory pseudosubstrate for the enzyme. Conversely, a mutation that prevents this phosphorylation results in activation of the kinase. GSK3β is also inhibited by Wnt signaling, which may contribute to progression of the prostate cancer (31Chesire D.R. Ewing C.M. Gage W.R. Isaacs W.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2679-2694Google Scholar). In the present study, the role of GSK3β in AR signaling was assessed. In transfected cell lines, GSK3β inhibited AR-dependent transactivation of several reporter genes as well as endogenous 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-mediated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression. Additionally our data indicated that the effect of GSK3β was mediated through the NH2-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1) of the AR and through suppressing the interaction between the NH2 and COOH termini of AR. Moreover our results suggested that GSK3β can interact directly with the AR and inhibit androgen-stimulated cell growth. These findings suggest that GSK3β might modulate AR signaling and, therefore, may play important roles in the control of the proliferation of normal and malignant androgen-regulated tissues. Materials and Plasmids—DHT and LiCl were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies to GSK3β and phospho-GSK3β were purchased from New England Biolabs. Purified GSK3β was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The anti-AR polyclonal antibody, NH27, was produced as described previously (32Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Google Scholar). The GSK3β plasmids, including wild type (WT), constitutively active, and dominant negative forms, were kindly provided by J. Sadoshima, Pennsylvania State University. Plasmids pCMX-GAL4-AR-DE, pCMX-VP16-AR-N, pCDNA3-AR-N, and pCDNA3-AR-C were constructed as described previously (33Wang L. Hsu C.L. Ni J. Wang P.H. Yeh S. Keng P. Chang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2202-2213Google Scholar). The plasmid pBIG-S9A-GSK3β was constructed by inserting full-length S9A-GSK3β cDNA into pBIG2i expression vector. Cell Culture and Transfection Assay—COS-1 and PC-3 cells were maintained in early to midlog phase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in incubators with humidified air and 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, cells were washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution, trypsinized, and seeded to be at a density of 40–60% confluence for transfection. Cells in 24-well plates were refed with fresh medium 2 h before transfection and transfected according to the SuperFect transfection instructions (Qiagen). After 2–3 h of incubation, cells were treated with medium supplemented with charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum containing either ethanol or ligands. Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested. The luciferase results were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, and the data represent means ± S.D. from duplicate sets of three independent experiments. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Purified recombinant murine GSK3β (New England Biolabs) was assayed as described previously (7Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Google Scholar). The kinase buffer contained 25 mm HEPES/pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, and 0.05 pmol of GSK3β. The same amounts of various AR fragments were purified from Escherichia coli and used as substrates, whereas GST protein was utilized as negative control. The reactions were terminated by addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled and loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Real Time Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1 μg of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Specific primers for GSK3β, 5′-CTA AGG ATT CGT CAG GAA CAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTG AGT GGT GAA GTT GAA GAG-3′ (reverse), were designed according to Bacon Designer2 software. 36B4 primers, 5′-TAC ACC TTC CCA CTT ACT G-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAT TCC TCC GAC TCT TCC-3′ (reverse), were used as controls (34Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Google Scholar). The real time PCR was performed with 1 μl of reverse transcription product, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad), and 0.5 μl of each primer (10 μm) in a total volume of 25 μl. PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s on an iCycler iQ multicolor real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Each sample was run in triplicate. Data were analyzed by iCycler iQ software (Bio-Rad). Stable S9A-GSK3β Transfection in CWR22R Cells—The constitutively active form of GSK3β, S9A-GSK3β, was inserted into pBIG vector with hygromycin resistance. The S9A-GSK3β-transfected CWR22R cells were selected and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Thiazolyl Blue (MTT) Assay—The MTT assay is a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation. 5 × 103 CWR22R cells were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal calf serum for 48 h. Cells were then treated with ethanol, 10 nm DHT, and/or 2 μg/ml doxycycline for another 5 days. Then 200 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml, Sigma) was added into each well with 1 ml of medium for 3 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 2 ml of 0.04 m HCl in isopropyl alcohol was added into each well. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was read at a test wavelength of 570 nm. GSK3β Is Ubiquitously Expressed in Prostate Cancer Cells— Early studies showed that GSK3β mRNA was prominently expressed in testis, thymus, prostate, and ovary (35Lau K.F. Miller C.C. Anderton B.H. Shaw P.C. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 85-91Google Scholar). We first applied real time PCR to determine the expression of endogenous GSK3β in COS-1 and several prostate cancer cells, including PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, GSK3β mRNA was detected in all the cell lines tested with the highest level of GSK3β mRNA in LNCaP and the lowest level in COS-1. To further examine the protein expression and activity of endogenous GSK3β in cancer cells, several prostate cancer cell lines, including PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145, were subjected to Western blotting analysis along with some nonprostate cancer cell lines, including MCF7, C2C12, and COS-1. GSK3β protein was ubiquitously expressed in all cell lines analyzed. GSK3β can be phosphorylated at Ser-9, and phosphorylation at this site has been shown to inhibit kinase activities of GSK3β (36Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Google Scholar). Therefore, the inactive form of GSK3β with phosphorylation at serine 9 was determined by Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies. LNCaP cells showed strongly phosphorylated GSK3β compared with PC-3 and DU145 cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that LNCaP cells may have relatively lower endogenous activity of GSK3β. Suppression of AR Transactivation by GSK3β—Since growth factors, neuropeptides, and protein kinase A inhibit GSK3β and enhance AR activity concurrently (8Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Google Scholar, 14Lee L.F. Guan J. Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8385-8397Google Scholar, 37Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478Google Scholar, 38Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Google Scholar, 39Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)Google Scholar), we were interested to see whether co-expression of GSK3β might alter AR-dependent transcriptional activity. We took advantage of a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) using reporter and internal control plasmids together. The ARE4-Luc reporter is driven by four androgen-responsive elements (AREs) in the promoter region and functions as a monitor of AR transcriptional activity. We transiently co-transfected GSK3β, AR, and the two reporter plasmids in COS-1 cells, which lack endogenous AR. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT GSK3β reduced the AR-mediated transcription of the luciferase reporter by about 40% (lane 3 versus lane 2). While the KM-GSK3β had only a marginal effect on AR (lane 4), the constitutively active form of the GSK3β (S9A-GSK3β), which prevents serine 9 phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, strongly inhibited AR activity (lane 5), suggesting that the kinase activity of GSK3β is necessary to suppress AR activity. Since the context of upstream promoter elements may influence transcriptional efficiency, we tested another reporter plasmid, MMTV-Luc, to confirm the suppression effect of GSK3β on AR transcriptional activity. MMTV-Luc is driven by the natural MMTV long terminal repeat promoter that contains several AR response elements. Fig. 2B demonstrates that GSK3β inhibits DHT-mediated AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–5). LiCl, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β, not only abolished the inhibitory effect of GSK3β on AR (lanes 8–10) but also slightly enhanced AR transcriptional activity (lane 7 versus lane 2). This result indicates that LiCl may block both exogenously transfected GSK3β as well as the endogenous GSK3β activity in COS-1 cells. Moreover LiCl did not alter luciferase expression in the absence of AR, ensuring that LiCl has no nonspecific effect on the MMTV-Luc reporter (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that GSK3β may have nonspecific effects on the general transcription machinery, we also tested its effect on the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) since early studies reported that GSK3β has little effect on the phosphorylation of human GR. As shown in Fig. 2C (lanes 3 and 4), addition of GSK3β failed to inhibit human GR transactivation. Inhibition of AR Transactivation and PSA Expression by GSK3β in LNCaP Cells—To examine whether the inhibitory effect of GSK3β on AR transactivation extends to cells that express endogenous AR, LNCaP cells, which have mutated yet functional AR, were co-transfected with the androgen-responsive reporter MMTV-Luc and GSK3β. As shown in Fig. 3A, addition of GSK3β reduced the activity of AR in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 3–5). Moreover, addition of LiCl abrogated the GSK3β-mediated inhibition of AR activity (lane 6). A similar suppression effect also occurred when we replaced MMTV-Luc reporter with the ARE4-Luc reporter system (data not shown). PSA is a clinically significant androgen-stimulated gene that is used to monitor the response to treatment, the prognosis, and the progression of prostate cancer. The DHT-mediated induction of transcription from the PSA promoter by DHT was repressed by overexpression of WT GSK3β in a dose-dependent manner in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 4, 6, and 8 versus lane 2). The results from Northern blot assays further demonstrated that the expression of PSA mRNA was reduced about 40% by the ectopic expression of GSK3β (Fig. 3C). Together, both the reporter assay and the Northern blot assay suggest that GSK3β inhibits AR transactivation and influences expression of the PSA target gene downstream of the AR. GSK3β Phosphorylates the NH2 Terminus of AR in Vitro and Inhibits the Function of the Ligand-independent Activation Domain (AF-1)—Since our data suggest that GSK3β kinase activity is necessary for inhibiting AR transactivation, we wanted to determine whether AR is a substrate for GSK3β. We purified three proteins, GST-ARN, GST-AR-DBD-LBD, and His6-AR-LBD, that cover most of the N terminus (amino acids 38–560), DBD-LBD (amino acids 551–918), and LBD (amino acids 666–918) of AR, respectively (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B demonstrates that GSK3β significantly phosphorylated the GST-AR-(38–560) (lane 2), while GST protein alone could not be phosphorylated (lane 1). We also observed the phosphorylation of some degraded fragments of GST-AR-(38–560) by GSK3β (lane 1). In contrast, under the same experimental conditions GSK3β only slightly phosphorylated GST-AR-DBD-LBD (lane 3) or His6-AR-LBD (lane 4). Thus, it appears that the NH2 terminus of AR serves as a substrate for GSK3β in vitro. As AF-1 is located in the NH2 terminus of AR and Fig. 4B shows GSK3β can phosphorylate AR at the NH2 terminus, we wanted to determine the potential effect of GSK3β on AF-1 function. COS-1 cells were transfected with a fusion construct linking the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the NH2 terminus of AR (GAL4-AR-N). The transcriptional response of this construct was assessed using an upstream activating sequence-Luc reporter (pG5-Luc). Fig. 4C (lower panel) shows that the addition of GSK3β inhibited the constitutive transcriptional activity of GAL4-AR-N (lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). In contrast, in the presence of DHT, GSK3β did not influence the weak activity of GAL4-AR-LBD, which contains the AF-2 domain (lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 6). These results suggest that GSK3β may suppress AR transactivation via the AF-1 functional domain that is located in the AR NH2 terminus. AR Interacts with GSK3β —To test whether GSK3β can associate with AR in vitro, we used the GST pull-down assay to examine the interaction between GSK3β and AR. Full-length WT GSK3β was constructed in a GST fusion vector. As shown in Fig. 5A, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled AR was found to bind specifically to purified GST-GSK3β in the presence or absence of DHT (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, there was no AR detected in the complex pulled down by GST protein alone (lane 2). To dissect the GSK3β-interacting domain in AR, we found that both AR NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains could bind to GSK3β as shown in Fig. 5B. To further demonstrate that GSK3β interacts with AR in mammalian cells, we next used co-immunoprecipitation to examine their interaction by co-transfecting AR and HA-tagged GSK3β into COS-1 cells. The COS-1 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5C, the HA-GSK3β immunocomplexes contained the AR (lane 3), suggesting that AR interacts with GSK3β in the COS-1 cells. HA-tagged GSK3β was also observed in the immunocomplexes pulled down with an anti-AR antibody (data not shown). Next we used LNCaP cells, which express endogenous AR and GSK3β, to examine whether GSK3β interacts with AR physiologically. As demonstrated in Fig. 5D, GSK3β forms a stable complex with AR, suggesting that GSK3β can interact with AR in the same cell and that AR could be a substrate for GSK3β in vivo. GSK3β Suppresses Androgen/AR-induced Cell Growth—As previous reports revealed that androgen/AR might play important roles in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, we wanted to know whether the suppression of AR by GSK3β could modulate prostate cancer cell growth. We introduced the inducible constitutively active form of GSK3β (S9A-GSK3β) into the androgen-dependent CWR22R cell line by stable transfection. To distinguish exogenously transfected GSK3β from endogenous GSK3β in CWR22R cells, a Myc-tagged S9A-GSK3β was constructed in the pBIG vector. Doxycycline stimulated the constitutively active S9A-GSK3β expression in CWR22R-S9A-GSK3β cells but not in the vector-transfected CWR22R-pBIG cells (Fig. 6A). Using a luciferace reporter assay, we found that induction of the constitutively active S9A-GSK3β reduced AR transactivation by 30%, while doxycycline had a marginal effect on CWR22R-pBIG cells in the presence of DHT (Fig. 6B). This effect likely represents an underestimate of the total impact of GSK3β on AR activity since CWR22R cells express endogenous GSK3β. To correlate the inhibitory effect of GSK3β on AR with prostrate cancer cell growth, the growth of stably transfected CWR22R cells was tested in an MTT assay. The MTT assay (Fig. 6C) shows that addition of DHT induced cell growth in both CWR22R-pBIG and CWR22R-S9A-GSK3β cells. As expected, the doxycycline treatment caused obvious growth arrest in the CWR22R-S9A-GSK3β cells but not in the CWR22R-pBIG cells, suggesting that GSK3β may repress AR-mediated cell proliferation. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of GSK3β inhibits AR transcriptional activity and correlates with the reduced cell growth. Reduction of the Interaction between the NH2 and COOH Termini of AR—One potential mechanism through which GSK3β may inhibit AR transactivation is by altering the level of AR expression. To address this issue, AR expression was measured by immunoblot in LNCaP cells transfected with the pCMV vector or with pCMV-GSK3β. As shown in Fig. 7A, little change was seen in the endogenous expression of AR in LNCaP cells. In addition, AR localization was not altered by expressing S9A-GSK3β in LNCaP cells (data not shown). Similar data were observed in transiently transfected COS-1 and in stably transfected CWR22 cells. These data therefore suggest that GSK3β suppression of AR transactivation is not through alteration of endogenous androgen receptor stability or its nucleus-cytosol distribution. We then studied the potential GSK3β effect on the interaction between the NH2- and COOH termini of AR (AR N-C interaction) as early studies indicated that AR N-C interaction plays important roles for the AR transactivation. We used a mammalian two-hybrid system to study the effects of GSK3β on AR N-C interaction. GAL4-AR-LBD and VP16-AR-N plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 7B, addition of GSK3β inhibited the interaction of AR NH2 terminus with AR-LBD (lanes 4, 6, and 8 versus lane 2), whereas this inhibitory effect was blocked by the presence of 25 mm LiCl, suggesting that the inhibition of AR transactivation by GSK3β may involve reduced AR N-C interaction. In addition, we used a reconstituted AR transcription assay to further explore the interruption of the AR N-C interaction. The addition of the NH2 terminus of AR dramatically increased the reporter induction by the AR-DBD-LBD (Fig. 7C, lane 4 versus lane 2). The reduced AR transactivation was observed by the co-expression of GSK3β (lanes 6 and 8 versus lane 4), while LiCl could eliminate the inhibition of GSK3β on AR activity. Thus, these results suggest GSK3β may play an inhibitory role in the AR N-C interaction. A principal clinical problem in prostate cancer treatment is the progression of androgen-dependent tumors to a hormone-refractory state after antiandrogen or androgen ablation therapy. Although the molecular basis for androgen independence is largely unknown, studies of patient specimens indicate that the AR signaling pathway can still be functional in hormone-refractory cancers. The AR is a phosphorylated protein, and its phosphorylation status is associated with its transcriptional activation. The NH2 terminus of AR contains the majority of the sites phosphorylated in vivo (40Kuiper G.G. de Ruiter P.E. Trapman J. Boersma W.J. Grootegoed J.A. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 95-101Google Scholar). The alteration of AR phosphorylation by factors with elevated expressions in some prostate cancers may provide one possible mechanism involved in stimulating the progression of prostate cancer. These factors include cytokines, growth factors, and G-protein-coupled receptors, and their activity often leads to the inactivation of GSK3β. In this report, we have demonstrated that GSK3β modulates AR transcriptional activity by measuring the expression of several androgen-regulated reporters. Previous studies indicate that protein kinase A can activate the AR through modification of its NH2-terminal domain in the absence of androgen (8Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Google Scholar). Because it is known that protein kinase A reduces AR phosphorylation (41Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Brinkmann A.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3850-3857Google Scholar) and that the NH2 terminus of AR mediates the effect of both protein kinase A and GSK3β and can be phosphorylated by GSK3β, our results suggest that GSK3β may, in part, regulate the effects of protein kinase A on AR. Future studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Since GSK3β is highly active in normal prostate cells, the kinase may inhibit AR transactivation under normal physiological conditions. This hypothesis fits well with our data showing that the inhibition of GSK3β activity by LiCl enhances AR activity (Fig. 2). Our data demonstrate that GSK3β suppresses AR activity (Figs. 2 and 3), phosphorylates AR (Fig. 4), and interacts with AR in vivo (Fig. 5), suggesting the AR may be a novel target of the GSK3β signaling pathway. Addition of the constitutively active S9A-GSK3β leads to the growth arrest of prostate cancer cells (Fig. 6); thus, the inhibition of GSK3β may contribute to the development and progression of androgen-independent prostate cancers. Considering that protein kinase A, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibit GSK3β (27Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Google Scholar, 42Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Google Scholar), the data presented here are consistent with what is known regarding the stimulation of prostate cancer cell growth by growth factors and cytokines and fit very well with the proapoptotic roles of GSK3β in other tissues (16Hardt S.E. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1055-1063Google Scholar, 44Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Frame S. Hagen T. Cross D.A. Bax B. Reith A.D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 288-294Google Scholar, 45Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Google Scholar). Numerous studies have suggested potential links between the androgen/AR and GSK3β signaling pathways. First, testosterone, but not estrogen, prevents the heat shock-induced overactivation of GSK3β, suggesting that androgen may display a neuroprotective effect against Alzheimer's disease (46Papasozomenos S. Shanavas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1140-1145Google Scholar). Second, GSK3β plays a pivotal role in the degradation of the free cytoplasmic β-catenin, an AR coregulator, through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (25Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that disregulation of β-catenin expression is found in a variety of human malignancies, including prostate cancer in which β-catenin may act as a coactivator of AR (47Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713Google Scholar). Third, GSK3β also phosphorylates c-Myc and cyclin D1, resulting in ubiquitin-mediated degradation (20Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Google Scholar, 48Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar). This is relevant in that elevated cyclin D1 and c-Myc levels may be associated with prostate cancer progression (49Chen Y. Martinez L.A. LaCava M. Coghlan L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1913-1920Google Scholar, 50Drobnjak M. Osman I. Scher H.I. Fazzari M. Cordon-Cardo C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1891-1895Google Scholar, 51Balaji K.C. Koul H. Mitra S. Maramag C. Reddy P. Menon M. Malhotra R.K. Laxmanan S. Urology. 1997; 50: 1007-1015Google Scholar). Recent studies also demonstrate that GSK3β may regulate AR activity through an AR coactivator, β-catenin. Our study raises the possibility that GSK3β directly influences AR activity independently of the β-catenin-mediated pathway. The interaction between AR and β-catenin is DHT-dependent, and our data demonstrate that the inhibition of GSK3β by LiCl increases AR transcriptional activity in the absence of DHT. Also, several factors that inhibit GSK3β, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin, do not stabilize β-catenin or stimulate β-catenin-dependent gene transcription (52Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Google Scholar). This observation argues for the direct effect of GSK3β on AR. Moreover, β-catenin enhances AR activity through interaction with the AR-LBD, which contains the AF-2 domain. Our data suggest that AF-1 activity, but not that of AF-2, is reduced by GSK3β (Fig. 4). Furthermore GSK3β directly phosphorylates the NH2-terminal region of AR. Our GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay indicate the interaction between GSK3β and AR (Fig. 5A). Together, these lines of evidence indicate that GSK3β and β-catenin may affect the AR at different levels and that the inhibition of GSK3β followed by elevated β-catenin levels may cooperate to enhance AR activity and lower the requirement for androgen in prostate cancer cells. Although we favor the hypothesis that AR phosphorylation and the resulting inhibition of AR activity contribute to the blockage of DHT-induced cell growth imposed by activated GSK3β (Fig. 6), we cannot rule out the possibility that the phosphorylation of a variety of other substrates by GSK3β might influence cell growth. For example, by inhibiting GSK3β, growth factors might promote the dephosphorylation and stabilization of cyclin D1 and c-Myc (20Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Google Scholar, 48Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Google Scholar, 53Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Google Scholar). Elevated cyclin D1 might enhance the activities of cyclin-dependent protein kinases CDK4 and CDK6, resulting in the inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene and entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. c-Myc is known to stimulate prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival as shown in many reports (54Kokontis J. Takakura K. Hay N. Liao S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1566-1573Google Scholar, 55Miyoshi Y. Uemura H. Fujinami K. Mikata K. Harada M. Kitamura H. Koizumi Y. Kubota Y. Prostate. 2000; 43: 225-232Google Scholar). GSK3β is also known to phosphorylate c-Jun, resulting in inhibition of the DNA binding of this transcription factor that has been implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and development (56Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Google Scholar, 57Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Google Scholar). Active GSK3β, therefore, is implicated as a key factor in maintenance of the basal states of several important signaling pathways, and disregulation of GSK3β may lead to transformation to malignancy. In summary, our data demonstrate that AR might be a substrate for GSK3β and that GSK3β negatively regulates AR-mediated gene transcription to modulate androgen/AR-mediated cell growth. Our study raises the possibility that this pathway may function in the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence. These findings suggest potential approaches for the development of pharmacological inhibitors designed to increase GSK3β activity, an effect that may be useful for prostate cancer therapy.

As nitric oxide (NO) signaling is linked to muscle activity, we investigated altered expression of the three major isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS 1-3) at cellular compartments during prolonged HDT BR without (control group) and with resistance exercise interventions (exercise group) using a flywheel ergometer (FWE). Atrophy detected in mixed (fast-slow) m. vastus lateralis (VL) and slow-type m. soleus (SOL) myofiber Types I and II (minus 35-40% of myofiber cross-sectional area) was prevented by FWE training. Concomitant to muscle atrophy, reduced NOS 1 protein and immunostaining was found in VL not in SOL biopsies. In trained VL, NOS 1 protein and immunostaining at myofibers II were significantly increased at the end of BR. Exercise altered NOS 2/caveolin 3 co-immunostaining patterns of subsarcolemmal focal accumulations in VL or SOL myofibers, which suggests reorganization of sarcolemmal microdomains. In trained VL, increased capillary-to-fiber (C/F) ratio and NOS 3 protein content were documented. Activity-linked NO signaling may be widespread in skeletal muscle cellular compartments that may be directly or indirectly impacted by adequate exercise countermeasure protocols to offset the negative effects induced by disuse, immobilization, or extended exposure to microgravity."
https://openalex.org/W2148155050,"Angiogenesis, new capillary blood vessel formation, is essential for embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer growth. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis by activating endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor important for embryonic development and activation of immediate early gene expression. The roles of SRF in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis have not been explored. Here we demonstrate that SRF is a downstream mediator of VEGF signaling in endothelial cells and a critical requirement for VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Knockdown of SRF protein levels in human and rat endothelial cells abolished VEGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis, impaired endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited VEGF-induced actin polymerization and immediate early gene expression. Injection of SRF antisense expression plasmid into gastric ulcers in rats significantly inhibited in vivo angiogenesis in granulation tissue. Mechanistically, this study also revealed that VEGF promotes SRF expression and nuclear translocation and increases SRF binding activity to DNA in endothelial cells through both Rho-actin and MEK-ERK dependent signaling pathways. These findings have potential therapeutic implications, e.g., local anti-SRF treatment may inhibit angiogenesis crucial for tumor growth."

Here we identify two basic amino acid residues within the L-selectin tail that are required for binding to ezrin-radixinmoesin (ERM) proteins: arginine 357 and lysine 362.

The 17-amino acid-long cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin can bind to several proteins that are implicated in regulating its function. In resting cells, the membrane-proximal region of the L-selectin tail interacts with calmodulin (11Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Matala E. Alexander S.R. Kishimoto T.K. Walcheck B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Upon PMA stimulation, calmodulin is released from the L-selectin tail, and this is predicted to induce a conformational change in the ectodomain that may render the L-selectin cleavage site susceptible to proteolysis. Calmodulin antagonists can also induce rapid shedding of L-selectin in the absence of PMA stimulation, suggesting that calmodulin negatively regulates L-selectin shedding. However, such antagonists have been shown to induce shedding of other integral membrane proteins, suggesting that this mechanism is not specific for L-selectin (13Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The membrane-distal portion of L-selectin tail is reported to interact with the cytoskeletal protein α-actinin (14Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells expressing L-selectin with a deletion of the α-actinin binding domain (known as LΔcyto) were initially shown to bind L-selectin ligand but failed to roll in vivo (15Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that α-actinin was important for rolling. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that LΔcyto, like wild type L-selectin, is localized to the tips of microvilli (14Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More recently, in vitro microkinetic analysis of cells expressing LΔcyto demonstrated that they are in fact able to tether and roll, although less efficiently than cells expressing wild type L-selectin (16Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that the six-amino acid-long tail of LΔcyto contributes to microvillar positioning and is sufficient to mediate tethering and rolling. We have recently shown that two members of the ezrinradixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins, ezrin and moesin, can bind to the L-selectin tail (17Ivetič A. Deka J. Ridley A. Ager A. J. Biol.

ERM-binding sites on the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins are often close to the membrane and contain basic amino acid residues. Using a biochemical screen, we have determined the relative contribution of different basic amino acids within the L-selectin tail on binding to the N-terminal domain of moesin. Two amino acid residues, Arg357 and Lys362, were found to be most critical for moesin binding. Using murine 300.19 pre-B cells, stable transfectants expressing wild type L-selectin or L-selectin with alanine mutations at position Arg357 or Lys362 (termed R357A and K362A, respectively) were generated to address the role of ERM binding on L-selectin function. The ERM-binding mutants of L-selectin exhibited defects in PMA-induced shedding, microvillar positioning, and tethering, indicating that ERM proteins play a key role in L-selectin function. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Murine anti-human L-selectin monoclonal antibodies DREG200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and FMC46 FITC-conjugated anti-L-selectin (DAKO) were used for immunogold labeling and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, respectively. CA21 mouse monoclonal and JK924 rabbit polyclonal (kindly provided by Julius Kahn; Roche Applied Science) antibodies recognize the membrane-distal portion of the L-selectin tail and the membrane-proximal ectodomain of L-selectin, respectively (11Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to 20-nm colloidal gold particles (BBInternational) was used as a secondary antibody for immunogold labeling of L-selectin. Affinity-purified mouse anti-calmodulin antibody was a kind gift from David Sacks (Harvard Medical School) and was used at a dilution of 1:3000 for immunoblotting. Sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a secondary antibody for immunoblotting at a dilution of 1:3000. FITC-conjugated KPL1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect immobilized rPSGL-1-Ig. Cells—300.19 pre-B cells were kindly provided by Thomas Tedder (Duke University). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 under humidifying conditions. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Helena Biosciences), 1% (v/v) of 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and, under selection conditions, 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were grown at densities no greater than 2.5 × 106/ml. Mutagenesis of Human L-selectin Tail—pMT2 plasmid containing the cDNA of WT L-selectin (LAM/pMT2) was a kind gift from Thomas Tedder and was used as the template for generating the two ERM-binding mutants. QuikChange™ (Stratagene) PCR mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate R357A and K362A mutants. The open reading frames of both mutants were sequenced to ensure that only the correct mutations had been incorporated. The primers (all written in the direction of 5′ to 3′) used for mutagenesis were as follows: R357A forward, CTCATTTGGCTGGCAAGGGCGTTAAAAAAAGGCAAGAAATCTC; R357A reverse, GAGATTTCTTGCCTTTTTTTAACGCCCTTGCCAGCCAAATGAG; K362A forward, GGCGGTTAAAAAAAGGCGCGAAATCTCAAGAAAGGATGG; K362A reverse, CCATCCTTTCTTGAGATTTCGCGCCTTTTTTTAACCGCC. Generation of Stable Transfectants—300.19 cells were grown overnight at a starting density of 1 × 106/ml. The following day, for each transfection, 1 × 107 cells were harvested and washed twice in serumfree RPMI 1640 followed by resuspension in 300 μl of electroporation buffer (120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm K2PO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 0.5% Ficoll 400, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). For each electroporation, 20 μg of pMT2 plasmid containing the open reading frame of L-selectin (WT or mutants) was mixed with 2 μg of pBabe plasmid containing the puromycin resistance gene. Cells were transferred to a precooled 0.4-cm electoporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), electroporated at 1180 microfarads and 400 mV in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser and placed immediately on ice for 5 min. Cells were subsequently transferred to standard growth medium and were left to recover for 2 days. Transfected cells were subsequently selected in growth medium containing puromycin (2 μg/ml). Cells were labeled using FITC-conjugated L-selectin (DAKO) at a dilution of 1:500 and subsequently sorted using a FACScan (Beckman-Coulter EPICS Elite flow cytometer) under sterile conditions. Pooled clones were gated to achieve similar levels of L-selectin expression. Sorted cells were subsequently seeded and cultured in 6-well dishes. All cells were propagated and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage. Cells were maintained in culture for ∼6 weeks without any loss of L-selectin expression. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry prior to each experiment to ensure that levels of L-selectin were consistent. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For each immunoprecipitation, 1 × 107 cells were harvested and lysed using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysis buffer was used for washing immunoprecipitates. After a 15-min incubation on ice, cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and supernatants were retained for immunoprecipitation. Lysates were precleared for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose beads prior to incubation with 5-10 μl of antiserum JK294. After 2 h, 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (slurry) was added to the antibody/lysate mixture for 1 h. At least four (1-ml) washes were performed for each immunoprecipitate. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described before (17Ivetič A. Deka J. Ridley A. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2321-2329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). BIAcore-based Competition Assay—The pQE expression vector encoding the N-terminal domain of human moesin (residues 1-296) was a kind gift from Anthony Bretscher (Cornell University). N-terminal moesin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to a previously published protocol (31Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance was performed using a BIAcore system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The general principles of this method were reviewed recently (32Szabo A. Stolz L. Granzow R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To avoid covalent inactivation of essential side chains, the entire cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin was synthesized as a biotinylated peptide (conjugated to Arg356) and immobilized on the sensor surface using a noncovalent sandwich system. The peptide was coupled via the N-terminal biotin moiety to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (BIAcore AB). For analyzing interactions between N-terminal moesin and immobilized L-selectin peptide, 5 μm purified N-terminal moesin was injected in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 (HSP-P; BIAcore AB) with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A short wash in the same buffer removed excess, unbound N-terminal moesin from the L-selectin tail. Peptides used in competition assays were injected at a concentration of 100 μm over a period of ∼400 s. Regeneration of the sensor surface was achieved by injection of 100 mm NaOH followed by subsequent reloading of the sensor surface with 1 μm biotinylated L-selectin cytoplasmic tail. All measurements were monitored at 25 °C. Solid Phase Binding Assays—N-terminal moesin was immobilized onto microtiter wells for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Wells were subsequently washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 1% BSA. Biotinylated peptides were prepared in PBS containing 1% BSA at a concentration of 1 μm and subsequently added to the appropriate wells for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were subsequently washed three times in PBS. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was prepared in PBS containing 1% BSA and added to wells for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed a further three times in PBS prior to color development, using TMB peroxidase EIA substrate kit (Bio-Rad). All absorbance readings were monitored at a wavelength of 450 nm, and values were subtracted against peptides bound to BSA-coated wells (i.e. in the absence of N-terminal moesin). Immunogold Labeling of Stable Transfectants and Transmission Electron Microscopy—Stable transfectants were harvested and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106/ml. Cells were labeled on ice for 30 min with 10 μg/ml DREG 200 monoclonal antibody in RPMI 1640 containing 1% BSA. After washing excess primary antibody, cells were labeled on ice for 30 min with secondary 20-nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10). Cells were washed twice in PBS and subsequently fixed for 15 min at room temperature with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. After washing cells twice with 1% BSA, to block any reactivity of the fixation solution, cells were harvested into pellets and were kept warm at 40 °C. Pellets were resuspended in molten low melting point agarose and then immediately placed on ice. Once set, the agarose block was cut into 1-mm3 pieces for further treatment. Sectioning and mounting was undertaken by Dr. Mark Turmaine (Anatomy Department, University College London). All sections were examined using a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope. Gold particles were scored according to positioning on distinct membrane structures (cell body or microvilli). All experiments were performed in triplicate and assessed single blind. Approximately 35 cells were analyzed for each individual cell line. Minimal labeling of L-selectin-negative puromycin-resistant 300.19 cells was observed (data not shown). Parallel Plate Flow Assay—Nunc Slide Flaskettes (9 cm2; Nalge Nunc International) were disassembled in order to use the slide for rolling assays. Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 fused to human heavy chain immunoglobulin (rPSGL-1-Ig; a kind gift from Wyeth Research, Cambridge, MA) was spotted (50 μl) onto plastic slides at the indicated concentrations and incubated overnight under humidifying conditions at 4 °C. Excess rPSGL-1-Ig was removed the next day by gentle washing with PBS, after which slides were immersed in PBS containing 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 prior to use and mounted in a parallel plate flow chamber (channel height 0.15 cm). Stable transfectants expressing WT or mutant L-selectin were resuspended at a density of 3 × 105/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and 2% BSA (viscosity 0.007 poise) and perfused at 37 °C over rPSGL-1-Ig-coated slides at a fixed shear stress of 2.5 dynes/cm2. Experiments were visualized using a Diaphot 300 inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon) connected to a JVC TK-C1360B color video camera and recorded on a Panasonic AG-6730 S-VHS video recorder (Microscope Service and Sales). 10 random fields were recorded for 15 s each using a × 10 objective (800 × 600 mm2). Images were acquired into a video file (In Video PCI; Focus Enhancements, Campbell, CA) at 15 frames/s, and numbers of cells undergoing rolling and/or arrest, rolling velocity of individual cells, and mean velocity of the population were calculated using EML Motion Analysis software (Ed Marcus Laboratories, Boston, MA). Rolling cells were defined as those with a mean velocity from 3 μm/s to 200 μm/s for at least 1 s; adherent cells were specified as those moving less than 3 μm in 10 s. Mean rolling velocity was calculated from measurements of at least 300 cells in each independent experiment. Determination of Saturating Levels of rPSGL-1-Ig—Black polystyrene 96-well plates (Nunc) were used to analyze saturating levels of rPSGL-1-Ig. The binding method followed the same format as that described for immobilizing N-terminal moesin (see above). rPSGL-1-Ig was similarly blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA. FITC conjugate KPL1 antibody was used to detect immobilized PSGL-1 at a dilution of 1:100. Plates were read using a Fusion α-FP™ fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Tethering Analysis—Analyses of transient tethering events were performed on slides coated with rPSGL-1-Ig at 31.7 μg/ml. Cells at a density of 3 × 106/ml were perfused at 2.5 dynes/cm2. Transient tethering interactions, which were observed in cell trajectory reconstructions as a clear pause from free flow, were defined as episodes where cells achieved a minimum velocity below the threshold for rolling, 200 μm/s for between 0.2 and 1 s. Results are expressed as the number of tethering events/min. Identification of Amino Acid Residues within the L-selectin Tail That Are Important for Interaction with Moesin—Membrane-proximal basic amino acid residues within the cytoplasmic tails of several cell adhesion molecules are required for binding to the N-terminal domain of ERM proteins (25Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). BIA-core affinity analysis was employed to determine the relative contribution of each basic amino acid within the L-selectin tail upon binding to the N-terminal domain of moesin. As previously described, a synthetic biotinylated peptide encoding the L-selectin tail (see Table I) was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip and used as a ligand for N-terminal moesin. N-terminal moesin was injected into the sensor chip to allow it to bind to L-selectin tail. After a short wash (to remove any excess unbound N-terminal moesin), 100 μm competitor peptide containing the entire sequence of L-selectin tail was injected. Injection of peptides at or exceeding concentrations of 500 μm led to nonspecific competition. Peptide concentrations below 100 μm were found not to compete (data not shown). Injection of wild type (WT) peptide induced release of N-terminal moesin from the biotinylated WT L-selectin tail on the chip (Fig. 1A), indicating that it competed effectively for binding to N-terminal moesin.Table IPanel of synthetic peptides used to screen for interaction of N-terminal moesin with L-selectin tailPeptide nameSequenceModificationR356AARLKKGKKSKRSMNDPYR357ARALKKGKKSKRSMNDPYK359ARRLAKGKKSKRSMNDPYK360ARRLKAGKKSKRSMNDPYK362ARRLKKGAKSKRSMNDPYK363ARRLKKGKASKRSMNDPYK365ARRLKKGKKSARSMNDPYY372ARRLKKGKKSKRSMNDPAWTRRLKKGKKSKRSMNDPYScramPRSYKSRKGNLKRKDKMBio-WTRRLKKGKKSKRSMNDPYN-terminal biotinylationBio-R357ARALKKGKKSKRSMNDPYN-terminal biotinylationBio-K362ARRLKKGAKSKRSMNDPYN-terminal biotinylation Open table in a new tab A panel of synthetic competitor peptides (see Table I), each containing a single alanine mutation in place of a basic amino acid residue, was used to address which amino acids were required to compete N-terminal moesin from the WT L-selectin tail. Alanine-substituted residues in peptides that failed to compete N-terminal moesin from the L-selectin tail were considered necessary for interaction with ERM proteins. In contrast, alanine-substituted residues in peptides that could successfully compete N-terminal moesin from the L-selectin tail were considered unnecessary for interaction with ERM proteins. None of the competitor peptides could compete as well as WT, indicating that all 8 basic residues in the L-selectin tail contribute to ERM binding. However, the peptides fell into three groups based on their ability to compete: those that could not compete at all (Fig. 1B), those that competed only mildly (Fig. 1C), and those that competed best (Fig. 1D). The sensorgram profiles of K362A and R357A were similar to the profile of scrambled peptide (compare sensorgrams in Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that these particular peptides had the weakest ability to compete with WT L-selectin. Interestingly, although only one amino acid residue apart, R356A competed for binding to N-terminal moesin significantly better than R357A (compare profile of R357A in Fig. 1B with profile of R356A in Fig. 1D). Solid phase binding assays were performed to further substantiate the relative binding capacities of WT, R357A, and K362A peptides to N-terminal moesin. A range of concentrations of N-terminal moesin were immobilized onto microtiter wells (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subsequently incubated with 1 μm biotinylated WT, R357A, or K362A peptide. Unlike WT peptide, both R357A and K362A peptides did not bind detectably to N-terminal moesin across a range of dilutions (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that Arg357 and Lys362 of L-selectin tail are necessary for interaction with N-terminal moesin. We previously reported that Arg357 was important for binding to ERM proteins (17Ivetič A. Deka J. Ridley A. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2321-2329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the present results show that this amino acid together with Lys362 are the most important for moesin binding of the 8 basic amino acids in the L-selectin tail. Generation of Stable Transfectants Expressing WT, R357A, and K362A L-selectin—The 300.19 pre-B-cell line has previously been used to study L-selectin biology (33Ley K. Tedder T.F. Kansas G.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zakrzewicz A. Grafe M. Terbeek D. Bongrazio M. Auch-Schwelk W. Walzog B. Graf K. Fleck E. Ley K. Gaehtgens P.

In order to study the role of L-selectin/ERM interaction in cells, we generated 300.19 pre-B cell lines expressing WT, R357A, and K362A human L-selectin. L-selectin-positive cells were selected by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). The K362A cell line contained a sub-population of cells with lower L-selectin levels (see below). ERM-binding mutants of L-selectin Co-immunoprecipitate Calmodulin—Several reports indicate that L-selectin shedding is regulated by the calcium-binding protein, calmodulin (11Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Matala E. Alexander S.R. Kishimoto T.K. Walcheck B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutations R357A and K362A are located close to where calmodulin has been reported to bind. To address whether these mutations affect binding to calmodulin, L-selectin was immunoprecipitated with the antiserum JK924, which recognizes the extracellular membrane-proximal domain of human L-selectin. Immunoblot analysis revealed that calmodulin co-precipitated with WT, R357A, and K362A L-selectin (Fig. 3). Although one of the alanine mutations, R357A, is juxtaposed to an amino acid residue that is required for calmodulin binding (leucine 358), this mutation appeared not to affect interaction with calmodulin. These results suggest that the mutations engineered in the L-selectin tail specifically affect ERM protein binding and do not abrogate interaction with calmodulin.

https://openalex.org/W1989915490,"Neural stem cells are promising candidates for donor cells in neural transplantation. However, the mechanism by which neural stem cells differentiate into neurons is not well understood. In the present study, a serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was carried out to generate a gene file of neural stem (progenitor) cells from the mouse ventral mesencephalon. Among the 15,815 tags investigated, the mRNA of the housekeeping genes (elongation factor 1-alpha, ATPase subunit 6, GAPDH, actin), laminin receptor 1, HSP 70, pleiotrophin, and nestin were highly expressed. Because pleiotrophin (PTN) exhibits mitogenic and trophic effects on neural development and exhibits trophic effects on survival of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons, we investigated the role of PTN in neurogenesis, especially to DAergic neurons. Here, we show that PTN increased the production of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons from embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived nestin-positive cells. The expression of Nurr1 mRNA was enhanced by PTN. L-dopa in the culture medium was increased by PTN. This effect was as strong as with sonic hedgehog. Data suggest that PTN mRNA is highly expressed in neural stem (progenitor) cells of mouse ventral mesencephalon, and PTN promotes the production of DAergic neurons from ES cell-derived nestin-positive cells."
https://openalex.org/W2027635031,"During development of the heart, mitochondria proliferate within cardiomyocytes. It is unclear whether this is a response to the increasing energy demand or whether it is part of the developmental program. To investigate the role of the electron transport chain (ETC) in this process, we used transgenic murine embryonic stem (ES) cells in which the green fluorescent protein gene is under control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter (alpha-MHC), allowing easy monitoring of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Spontaneous contraction of these cells within embryoid bodies (EBs) was not affected by inhibition of the ETC, suggesting that early heart cell function is sufficiently supported by anaerobic ATP production. However, heart cell development was completely blocked when adding antimycin A, an inhibitor of ETC complex III, before initiation of differentiation, whereas KCN did not block differentiation, strongly suggesting that specifically complex III function rather than mitochondrial ATP production is necessary for early heart cell development. When the underlying mechanism was examined, we noticed that antimycin A but not KCN lead to inhibition of spontaneous intracellular Ca++ oscillations, whereas both substances decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, as expected. We postulate that mitochondrial complex III activity is necessary for these Ca++ oscillations, which in turn are a prerequisite for cardiomyocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2149707868,"Hormones are released from cells by passing through an exocytotic pore that forms after vesicle and plasma membrane fusion. In stimulated exocytosis vesicle content is discharged swiftly. Although rapid vesicle discharge has also been proposed to mediate basal secretion, this has not been studied directly. We investigated basal hormone release by preloading fluorescent peptides into single vesicles. The hormone discharge, monitored with confocal microscopy, was compared with the simultaneous loading of vesicle by FM styryl dye. In stimulated vesicles FM 4-64 (4 microM), loading and hormone discharge occurs within seconds. In contrast, in approximately 50% of spontaneously releasing vesicles, the vesicle content discharge and the FM 4-64 loading were slow (approximately 3 min). These results show that in peptide secreting neuroendocrine cells the elementary vesicle content discharge differs in basal and in stimulated exocytosis. It is proposed that the view dating back for some decades, which is that, at rest, the vesicle discharge of hormones and neurotransmitters is similar to that occurring after stimulation, needs to be extended. In addition to the classical paradigm that secretory capacity of a cell is determined by controlling the probability of occurrence of elementary exocytotic events, one will have to consider activity modulation of elementary exocytotic events as well."
https://openalex.org/W2066856908,"Our study aimed to investigate, in vivo, the relationship between vitamin A status and NF-kappaB activity, a transcription factor central in regulating inflammatory and immune responses. We used a novel transgenic murine NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter model that enabled molecular imaging of NF-kappaB activity in live mice via an intensified image-capture apparatus. Whole-body luminescence, which reflects overall NF-kappaB activity, was elevated 2.2-fold in vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mice compared with control mice. Specifically, NF-kappaB activity in VAD mice was increased 1.8-fold in the lymph nodes and 1.4-fold in the thymus and, NF-kappaB induction in UVB radiation-exposed skin was also enhanced in VAD mice compared with control mice. The administration of all-trans retinoic acid to VAD mice resulted in a transient reduction in NF-kappaB activity and, conversely, a single dose of the RAR-pan-antagonist, AGN 194310, administered to control mice, led to a marked, transient induction of whole-body luminescence. Our results suggest that vitamin A status, and vitamin A itself, affects NF-kappaB activity in vivo and that the elevated NF-kappaB activity in VAD may be a mechanism underlying some of the features of VAD syndrome."

The structure provides key information for understanding the structure and function of the eIF3 complex. Translation initiation is a sophisticated cellular process, especially in eukaryotes. In general, translation initiation in eukaryotic organisms involves three steps (1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar); first, the methionyl-initiator tRNA ( Met-tRNAiMet) binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit to form a 43 S preinitiation complex; second, the preinitiation complex binds to mRNA and scans to the AUG start codon in the mRNA; and third, the 60 S ribosomal subunit joins the mRNA-bound preinitiation complex to form an 80 S initiation complex, ready to commence translation. Each of these steps is stimulated by a number of proteins called eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; HTH, helix-turn-helix; HEAT, Huntington, elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, target of rapamycin; HAM, HEAT analogous motif; WH, winged-helix; PHAT, pseudo-HEAT analogous topology; PDB, Protein Data Bank. At least 11 eIFs have been identified, comprising over 25 polypeptides (2Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). In contrast, only three to five initiation factors are known in prokaryotes. This difference in protein complexity suggests that more protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions rather than RNA-RNA interactions are required for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. In mammalian cells, eIF3 is the largest initiation factor with an apparent molecular mass of about 600 kDa. It plays a central role in steps 1 and 2 of the translation initiation process (1Pain V.M.

For instance, eIF3 can bind to dissociated 40 S subunits and delay the reassociation with the 60 S ribosomal subunit for a long enough time to permit initiation. eIF3 also stabilizes the binding of the Met-tRNAiMet·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to the 40 S subunits and promotes the formation of a 43 S preinitiation complex comprised of the 40 S subunit, the ternary complex, eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3. In addition, eIF3 stimulates the binding of 5′-m7G-capped mRNA by interaction with the mRNA-associated factor eIF4G. eIF3 is a multisubunit protein complex. Various genes encoding eIF3 subunits have been cloned from mammals, plants, and yeasts. Twelve different subunits (eIF3a/p170, b/p116, c/p110, d/p66, e/p48, f/p47, g/p44, h/p40, i/p36, j/p45, k/p28, l/p69) have been identified in mammals, while in yeast only six subunits (eIF3a/TIF32, b/PRT1, c/NIP1, i/TIF34, g/TIF35, j/HCR1) have been found and are all homologous to the corresponding mammalian subunits. The five yeast subunits, eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3g, and eIF3I, can form a core complex (4Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.-P. Greenberg J.R. Goldfarb D.S. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mammalian and yeast eIF3s differ not only in the number of subunits but also in the structure of some subunits. For example, mammalian eIF3a contains a repeat region, but this region is absent in the yeast ortholog (2Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). These differences suggest that mammalian and plant eIF3 have evolved to include additional subunits, which are likely to function as regulatory factors and the extra structural motifs provide the capacity to mediate extra protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions required for the tighter regulation in higher eukaryotes. Some eIF3 subunits (eIF3a, eIF3c, eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3h) may serve as structural scaffolds or to provide docking sites for other proteins, since they contain PCI or MPN domains, which are found in components of large protein complexes and have been implicated in protein-protein interactions (2Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar, 5Kim T.-H.

To understand the structure and function of the eIF3 complex in eukaryotic translation initiation, we have begun a systematic structural study of the eIF3 components. Here we describe the high-resolution crystal structure of human eIF3k, the smallest non-core subunit of eIF3. Mammalian eIF3k has recently been characterized (6Mayeur G.L. Fraser C.S. Peiretti F. Block K.L. Hershey J.W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4133-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to co-express with the five core subunits of eIF3 and form a stable co-immunoprecipitatable complex with the core complex. eIF3k also interacts directly with eIF3c, eIF3g, and eIF3j. The crystal structure of eIF3k reveals a novel ear-like protein structure containing two domains. Structural comparisons and sequence conservation analysis suggest that eIF3k is likely to act as a structural scaffold for protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. It has three putative protein-binding regions and has potential RNA binding activity associated with its HTH (helix-turn-helix) motif. Expression and Purification of Human eIF3k—The complete cDNA fragment encoding human eIF3k protein was subcloned from a human brain cDNA library into a pET-22b expression vector, and human eIF3k was expressed highly as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) with a 6-residue histidine tag fused to its C terminus. Purification of the eIF3k protein was carried out through affinity chromatography with a Chelating Sepharose™ Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). For phase determination, the recombinant plasmid was transferred into Met-auxotrophic strain B834 to obtain the selenomethionyl derivative of human eIF3k protein. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Crystals of seleno-methionine-substituted eIF3k protein were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. The initial crystallization conditions (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Hepes at pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl) were obtained using Crystal Screen kits I and II from Hampton Research. By optimizing the concentration of ammonium sulfate to 1.6 m, crystals of larger size and better quality were obtained. A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected from a single seleno-methionine-substituted eIF3k crystal at 100 K on beamline 3W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility at the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data were collected at three wavelengths (λedge = 0.97992 Å, λpeak = 0.97969 Å, and λremote = 0.9 Å). All data were processed and scaled with the DENZO and SCALEPACK (7Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The initial model containing about 75% of the residues was refined against the peak data set in the 30–2.5-Å resolution range with maximum-likehood amplitude targets by using the Crystallography and NMR System (11Brunger A.T.

The HAM domain, PR65/A HEAT repeats, and the Sec17 C-terminal region all contain three antiparallel α-helical repeats, while the PHAT domain of Smaug contains only two and a half antiparallel α-helical repeats. A, a top view of four HEAT/HEAT analogous repeats; B, a lateral view. The red arrows denote the places of the locations of the helices connecting HEAT analogous motifs in the HAM domain and in the PHAT domain. The left-handed superhelix at the C termini of the HAM domain and the Sec17 is seen very clearly from the top view (A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4The hydrophobic core between the HAM and WH domains. Highly conserved hydrophobic residues in α6, α9, α10, and α12 form a main part of the core. The core-forming residues are showed in a ball-and-stick models; they include Leu128, Ile131, Leu71, Phe134, Leu74, Val138, Leu77, and Phe141 on the left side in an order from the top down and on the right side are Ile102, Leu121, Leu105, Trp118, Phe117, Leu109, and Phe114. All of these residues are highly conserved (Fig. 2) except Leu77, Leu121, and Leu128 (in α11), although the residues corresponding to these three are also hydrophobic among eIF3k homologues in other species (Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5A comparison of winged-helix domains. The recognition helix in the WH domain is α14, and W1 indicates wing w1 in the WH domain. The two winged-helix domains on the upper left side (SelB-C and Esa1) do not have DNA/RNA binding activity, while the two winged-helix domains on upper rightside (FokI-D3 and Rap30) interact weakly with DNA and are also involved in protein-protein interactions. The lower three winged-helix domains (PurR, Zα domain, and IclR) are all involved in DNA binding. The disordered region in the WH domain is indicated by a broken line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 7The cleft in the WH domain. The cleft is composed mainly of α12 and α14, the first two helices of the WH domain. The salt bridge between the Nϵ of Arg155 and a carboxyl oxygen atom of Asp167 is on the left side of the cleft (shown as a dotted line) with an interatomic distance of 2.72 Å. There are two conserved residues, Asp136 and Arg139, at the bottom of the cleft and a sulfate ion at the hatch of the cleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2Sequence alignment of eIF3k homologues. Protein sequences were from Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (house mouse), Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Oryza sativa, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence accession numbers of the Swiss-Prot data base are Q9UBQ5 (for human), Q9DBZ5 (for mouse), Q9W2D9 (for D. melanogaster), Q7QGK4 (for A. gambiae), Q9XUP3 (for C. elegans), Q94HF1 (for O. sativa), and Q9SZA3 (for A. thaiana). The sequence of A. gambiae is derived from an EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ whole genome shotgun entry, which should be considered preliminary data. The secondary structure of human eIF3k, which is mainly defined by the analysis of the structure using DSSP program (47Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12413) Google Scholar), is indicated above the alignment. Residues in the alignment that are identical are shown in red boxes; those that are similar are shown in yellow boxes. The sequences highlighted in a pink box correspond to the disordered regions (Ser184, Gly185, Ser217, and Gln218) missing from the human eIF3k structure. The characters under the alignment denote the predicted function of the conserved residues. The elucidations for these characters are listed as follows: 1, 2, and 3, the residues on the binding surface I, II, and III, respectively (Fig. 6); h, intra-molecular hydrophobic interaction (h colored in red denotes residues that participate in forming the hydrophobic core between the HAM domain and the WH domain shown in Fig. 4); s, the two highly conserved residues that form a salt bridges (Fig. 7); t, the conserved glycines that make turns between the secondary structure elements; orange triangle, the residues that are special in C. elegans compared with other organisms (hydrophobic residues in other organisms were replaced by hydrophilic residues in C. elegans or in reverse). The sequence of C. elegans eIF3k has distinct property in some position. For instance, the residues that are indicated by the orange triangle are very different between C. elegans and other organisms; and an additional sequence in the orange box between α10 and α11 that belong to the HAM domain and WH domain, respectively, exist in C. elegans only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Surface distributions of conserved residues and electrostatic potential of eIF3k.A, conserved residues are mapped onto the concave face (colored light green). The conserved residues on the binding surface I are marked by red numbers. The binding surface I was circled in brief, and it appears to be capable of interacting with a rather large protein due to its large area. B, the electrostatic potential surface on the concave face of eIF3k is colored red for electronegative residues and blue for electropositive residues. C, conserved residues are mapped onto the convex face. There are two putative binding surfaces (binding surface II and III) for other proteins on the convex face. D, the electrostatic potential surface on the convex face of eIF3k. The charged residues are fewer in this face than in concave face. Obviously, there are more electronegative residues than electropositive residues on molecular surface. This is the reason why human eIF3k is an acidic protein with pI = 4.8 (6Mayeur G.L. Fraser C.S. Peiretti F. Block K.L. Hershey J.W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4133-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All the conserved residues located on the surface could be found in Fig. 2 (labeled with numbers 1, 2, and 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Overall Structure—The human eIF3k structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion with selenomethionine substituted protein. The model was refined to 2.1-Å resolution with a good agreement with diffraction data and has high stereochemical quality (Table II). The final model includes an eIF3k monomer with 213 residues (residue 2–183 and 186–216), 6 selenium atoms, 1 sulfate ion, and 149 water molecules. The C-terminal 2 residues and the polyhistidine tag are disordered. No electron density for residues Gly184 and Ser185 and the side chains of Gln119, Asp182, Glu183, and Ser216 was observed. In addition, residues Phe56, Glu123, Trp156, Ile196, Lys197, and Lys204 have weak electron density. The overall structure of eIF3k has an ear-like shape with dimensions of 35 Å × 35 Å × 60Å. It has 16 helices (14 α helices and two 310 helices) and a three-strand β-sheet (Fig. 1). The secondary structure elements are indicated in Fig. 2. Although sequence analysis did not suggest any known structural motifs, a three-dimensional structural comparison of the crystal structure of eIF3k determined here using DALI (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) clearly showed that eIF3k consists of two distinct domains. The N-terminal region of eIF3k is a HAM domain, named for HEAT (20Kobe B. Gleichmann T. Horne J. Jennings I.G. Scotney P.D. Teh T. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) analogous motifs, in a mostly right-handed superhelical arrangement, formed by a leading α helix and three HEAT analogous repeats, H1 (consisting of α3 and α4), H2 (α6 and α7), and H3 (α9 and α10). All of the repeats and the leading α helix are followed by a short helix. The C-terminal half contains a WH (winged-helix) domain, which is followed by a long C-terminal tail flanked by an α helix at both ends. The WH domain is a compact α/β structure containing three α helices (α12, α13, and α14) and three β strands (β1, β2 and β3). Approximately 1500 E2 of solvent-accessible surface area is buried by the HAM-WH interdomain interactions. The combination of the two domains and C-terminal tail results in two distinct faces of the protein surface: a concave face and a convex face (Fig. 6). The HAM Domain; Comparison with HEAT-repeat-containing Proteins—HEAT-repeat-containing proteins such as the PR65/A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (21Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 86: 8669-8672Google Scholar), nuclear transport protein karyopherin-β2 (22Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and α-adaptin C, a subunit of the AP2 complex (23Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), play important roles in assembling multiprotein complexes in various cellular life activities (24Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1996; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The HEAT repeat motif is formed by two antiparallel α helices (named αA and αB), and it is usually 37–43 residues long. The motif occurs in blocks of at least 3 and up to 22 tandem repeats (20Kobe B. Gleichmann T. Horne J. Jennings I.G. Scotney P.D. Teh T. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HEAT repeat family members have similar patterns of hydrophobic residues, and a highly conserved proline is frequently found in certain αA helices located in the middle of many HEAT repeats to facilitate the kink of the helices (20Kobe B. Gleichmann T. Horne J. Jennings I.G. Scotney P.D. Teh T. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The human eIF3k HAM domain (residues 24–121) is generally similar to that in HEAT-repeat-containing proteins, but it also shows some unusual features. Its three HEAT analogous motifs have 21 (H3) to 32 (H1 and H2) residues. Adjacent HEAT analogous motifs are connected by a short 310 helix (h5, between H1 and H2) or a short α helix (α8, between H2 and H3). Compared with the canonical HEAT-repeat-containing protein PR65/A, two and a half HEAT analogous repeats (α3, α4, α6, α7, and α9) in the HAM domain resemble the HEAT repeats 13 and 14 and αA of repeat 15 of PR65/A, and they can be superimposed with a r.m.s.d. (root mean square deviation) of 3.2 E for 84 residues in the region (Fig. 3). An analysis of the protein sequences (data not shown) shows that several highly conserved hydrophobic residues in the HEAT analogous motifs of the HAM domain occupy the same positions as the corresponding residues in HEAT repeats (20Kobe B. Gleichmann T. Horne J. Jennings I.G. Scotney P.D. Teh T. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Müller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, unlike most other HEAT repeats, no proline residues are found in the eIF3k helices (α3, α6, and α9) corresponding to the αA of HEAT repeats. As a consequence, the α helices in the HAM domain are not kinked. These differences between the HAM domain and other HEAT domains suggest that the HEAT analogous motifs in the HAM domain are related but distinct, and they may belong to the new subfamily of ADB (named for β-adatin; Ref. 25Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Müller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The absence of a consensus proline residue in αA is a unique feature of the ADB repeat in the HEAT repeats family. This is exemplified by the high similarity (Z score = 6.4 by DALI) between the HAM domain and the HEAT motifs (residues Ala340 to Ala434) in α-adaptin C, an ADB subfamily member. Nevertheless, it is possible that the HAM domain may belong to a novel class in HEAT repeats as H1, H2, and H3 are structurally different when these three HEAT analogous motifs are compared. The intra-repeat connecting helices in the HAM domain do not exist in the PR65/A HEAT repeats and most HEAT repeats of other proteins (Fig. 3). This unusual topology is also found in a few heat-repeat-containing proteins, such as the PHAT (pseudo-HEAT analogous topology) domain of Smaug (26Green J.B. Gardner C.D. Wharton R.P. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1537-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The two and a half HEAT analogous repeats of the HAM domain are more similar to the PHAT domain (r.m.s.d. = 2.7 Å for 84 residues) than to the PR65/A HEAT repeats (Fig. 3). Another unusual conformation in the HAM domain is the packing between H3 and H2, which is almost side-by-side instead of face-to-face, as in normal HEAT repeats, due to its unusual left-handedness. The unusual H3 turn causes α6, α9, α10, and α12 to form a hydrophobic core (Fig. 4). A similar type of conformation also appears in the structure of the C-terminal region of the vesicular transport protein Sec17 (27Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In addition, the eIF3k HAM domain also shows some similarity to several other proteins containing antiparallel α helical repeats, including tetratricopeptide repeats and armadillo repeats that are both involved in protein-protein interactions (24Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1996; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and to part of the α helix domain (residues 44–164) of chondroitin AC lyase (28Féthière J. Eggimann B. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The WH Domain; Conformation of the WH Domain—The WH domain has the appearance of an earlobe in an ear-like structure (Fig. 1). This domain is stably packed against the HAM domain via the hydrophobic core formed mainly by the conserved hydrophobic residues in α6, α9, α10, and α12 (Fig. 4). The WH domain comprises three α helices and three β strands in the order of α12-β1-α13-α14-β2-β3. α12 and α13 are antiparallel to each other, while α14 is almost perpendicular to α13 (Fig. 5). The latter two helices are connected by a short turn of three amino acids. This architecture belongs to a HTH motif (29Brennan R.G. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1903-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three short β strands, each containing only 2 residues, form a twisted antiparallel β-sheet, with β1 bonding to the β hairpin formed between β2 and β3, which are bonded by exactly two hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of β strands is a common feature of HTH motifs with a α/β"
https://openalex.org/W2124229750,"The role of glutathione (GSH) in inflammation is largely discussed from the context of providing reducing equivalents to detoxify reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Inflammation is now recognized to be an underlying cause of many vascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a disease in which endothelial GSH concentrations are decreased. However, mechanisms that control GSH levels are poorly understood. Key players in the inflammatory process are endothelial adhesion molecules, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This adhesion molecule is present constitutively and can be induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli. In this study, using mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAEC) deficient in ICAM-1, we demonstrate a novel interplay between constitutive ICAM-1 and cellular GSH. Deficiency of ICAM-1 was associated with an approximately twofold increase in total GSH content. Inhibiting glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the enzyme that catalyses the rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis, prevented the increase in GSH. In addition, the catalytic subunit of GCL was increased (approximately 1.6-fold) in ICAM-1 deficient relative to wild-type cells, suggesting that constitutive ICAM-1 represses GCL expression. Furthermore, the ratio of reduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) glutathione was also increased suggesting a role for ICAM-1 in modulating cellular redox status. Interestingly, increasing cytosolic GSH in wild-type mouse endothelial cells decreased constitutive ICAM-1, suggesting the presence of an inverse and reciprocal pathway. To test the effects of inducible ICAM-1 on GSH, cells were stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha stimulated production of ICAM-1, which was however not associated with induction of GSH. In contrast, supplementation of endothelial cells with GSH before TNF-alpha addition, inhibited induction of ICAM-1. These data suggest a novel regulatory pathway between constitutive ICAM-1 and GSH synthesis in the endothelium and are discussed in the context of modulating the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1974016204,"Post-translational modifications of histone amino-terminal tails are a key determinant in gene expression. Histone methylation plays a dual role in gene regulation. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 in higher eukaryotes is associated with transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, whereas H3 lysine 4 methylation correlates with active chromatin. Methylation of lysine 4 of H3 via Set1, a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae COMPASS complex, is regulated by the transcriptional elongation Paf1-Rtf1 and histone ubiquitination Rad6-Bre1 complexes, which are required for the expression of a subset of genes. This suggests that lysine 4 methylation of histone H3 may play an activating role in transcription; however, the mechanism of Set1 function remains unclear. We show here that H3 lysine 4 methylation also negatively regulated gene expression, as strains without Set1 showed enhanced expression of PHO5, wherein chromatin structure plays an important transcriptional regulatory role. Di- and trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 was detected at the PHO5 promoter, and a strain expressing a mutant version of histone H3 with lysine 4 changed to arginine, (which cannot be methylated) exhibited PHO5 derepression. Moreover, PHO5 was derepressed in strains that lacked components of either the Paf1-Rtf1 elongation or Rad6-Bre1 histone ubiquitination complexes. Lastly, PHO84 and GAL1-10 transcription was also increased in set1Δ cells. These results suggest that H3 methylation at lysine 4, in conjunction with transcriptional elongation, may function in a negative feedback pathway for basal transcription of some genes, although being a positive effector at others.

In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged with histone proteins to form nucleosomes that are further condensed into higher order chromatin structures. Generally, this compaction serves as a barrier for the binding of factors that elicit important cellular processes such as transcription and DNA replication. Thus, genes found in heavily condensed regions, such as heterochromatin, are transcriptionally silent. Expression of genes located in euchromatic regions, which are typically less compacted, is also regulated by chromatin structure. Post-translational modifications of the amino-terminal tails of histone proteins are a key determinant in defining active and repressed chromatin. These modifications may alter chromatin structure directly by affecting histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions (1Hayes J.J. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). They also allow for the recruitment of transcriptional activators or repressors. Acetylation of histone H3 at lysines 9 and 14 is strongly correlated with transcriptionally active and accessible chromatin. Histone methylation is associated with both active and repressed chromatin states. In eukaryotes other than budding yeast, heterochromatic silencing is marked by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9. Conversely, euchromatic regions are associated with histone methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3 Lys-4) (2Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Set1 is the catalytic subunit of a large complex named COMPASS (3Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Set1 is required for full activation of a subset of euchromatic genes, including RAM2, HAS1, INO1, PPH3, and MET16 (5Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol.

Paradoxically, despite its presumed role in transcriptional activation, the absence of Set1 or other components of COMPASS leads to loss of ribosomal DNA (4Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L.

Set1-dependent methylation requires histone ubiquitination of lysine 123 of histone H2B via the ubiquitin-conjugating Rad6-Bre1 complex (9Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Set1 is still recruited in the absence of Rad6; however, no resulting H3 Lys-4 methylation is observed (10Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This is the first evidence that a modification of one histone regulates the trans-modification of another histone. Recent reports have also indicated that Set1 methylation is associated with transcriptional elongation (11Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 2003; 113: 429-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The Paf1-Rtf1 complex, which associates with RNA polymerase II, is required for H3 Lys-4 methylation as well as recruitment of the COMPASS complex (12Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J.

A paf1 null strain shows no detectable histone ubiquitination; however, Rad6 is still recruited (13Wood A. Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol.

As seen with set1Δ mutants, strains with deletions of PAF1, RTF1, or RAD6 show loss of telomeric silencing (9Sun Z.W. Allis C.D.

In this report, we explored the role of Set1 in the transcriptional regulation of select genes of the phosphate-repressible PHO cluster (15Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We found that loss of Set1 led to increased levels of expression of PHO5, coding for the repressible acid phosphatase (rAPase), 1The abbreviations used are: rAPase, repressible acid phosphatase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; COMPASS, complex proteins associated with Set1; Pi, inorganic phosphate; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase; YPD, yeast peptone-dextrose medium; YPG, yeast peptone-galactose medium; YPPD, yeast peptone-phosphate-dextrose medium. under both repressed and active conditions. The expression of the high affinity phosphate transporter PHO84 is also higher in set1Δ than in SET1+ strains. Deletions of genes encoding critical components of the Rad6-Bre1 and Paf1-Rtf1 complexes, which are required for Set1-dependent methylation, also exhibited derepression of PHO5. Finally, we observed derepression of the GAL1-10 locus in strains lacking SET1. Our results suggest that methylation at Lys-4 of histone H3 may provide an activating signal at some genes although being a repressive one at others. Further, our data are consistent with a model in which H3 Lys-4 methylation establishes a negative feedback loop on basal transcription, perhaps enforcing a temporary transcriptional elongation checkpoint (16Orphanides G.

Gene replacement was confirmed by PCR, and the resulting diploid was sporulated and tetrads were dissected to obtain two independent SET1+ (CCY1467 and CCY1468) and set1Δ haploid segregants (CCY1471 and CCY1472). The wild-type strain YPH500ΔL (20Kladde M.P. Xu M. Simpson R.T.

The cells were then washed and resuspended in minimal medium containing either 13.4 mm KH2PO4 or 13.4 mm KCl and incubated at 30 °C with shaking for6h.

In other experiments, cells were grown in rich YPD medium supplemented with 13.4 mm KH2PO4 (YPPD) overnight at 23 °C without shaking. For GAL1-10 experiments, strains were pregrown overnight in YPD and then resuspended in YPD or YP galactose (YPG) + 0.5% glucose and incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 4 h.

Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—To analyze histone H3 Lys-4 methylation levels, antibodies specific for di- and trimethylated forms of histone H3 Lys-4 were used to immunoprecipitate form-aldehyde cross-linked chromatin from strains MBY1198 and MBY1217 grown in YPD as described previously (7Bryk M. Briggs S.D. Strahl B.D. Curcio M.J. Allis C.D. Winston F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR amplification of input and immunoselected DNA was performed using primers ADO236 and LFO740 as described elsewhere (22Carvin C.D. Dhasarathy A. Friesenhahn L.B. Jessen W.J. Kladde M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7743-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deletion of SET1 Leads to Increased Levels of PHO5 Expression—To determine the role of histone H3 Lys-4 methylation at PHO5, we analyzed PHO5 expression levels in SET1+ and set1Δ strains under both repressive and activating conditions. To distinguish rAPase (Pho5) from constitutive acid phosphatase (Pho3) activity as well as to avoid potential cross-hybridization in Northern analyses, we used strains in which the entire coding sequence of PHO3 was deleted (18Neef D.W. Kladde M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3788-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Under the repressive conditions of minimal medium supplemented with Pi, set1Δ strains reproducibly showed significantly higher levels of rAPase activity than SET1+ cells (Fig. 1A). This increased rAPase activity correlated with the higher PHO5 mRNA levels in set1Δ cells, suggesting that the derepression was because of increased transcription (Fig. 1B). We also observed enhanced PHO5 expression in fully activating conditions of minimal medium lacking Pi (Fig. 1C). Although the fold increase was lower, the increase by nearly 800 Miller units was substantial. Similarly, under no-Pi conditions, a modest but reproducible increase in PHO5 transcript was observed (Fig. 1D). To better quantify the level of derepression due to the deletion of SET1, we grew cells under conditions of higher basal expression in rich medium supplemented with Pi (YPPD) at 23 °C. Under these conditions, rAPase activity was ∼10-fold higher than when grown in minimal medium containing Pi at 30 °C (compare the levels observed for SET1+ cells in Fig. 1A with those observed in Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, PHO5 expression was further derepressed in cells lacking Set1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, a strain containing a mutated version of histone H3 with Lys-4 replaced by arginine (K4R mutant), which can no longer be methylated, showed increased expression of PHO5 (Fig. 2C). It is important to note that the H3 Lys-4 strain, in which endogenous genes encoding histones H3 and H4 were deleted and complemented by a single copy episome containing histones H3 and H4, exhibited a significantly higher basal expression of PHO5 when compared with a congenic SET1+ strain. It is possible that this is because of the lower overall expression levels of these core histones, which have been shown previously to derepress PHO5 (23Han M. Kim U.J. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that histone H3 Lys-4 methylation via Set1 plays a role in the repression of the euchromatic gene PHO5. Methylation of Lys-4 of Histone H3 Is Present at the PHO5 Promoter—To see whether H3 Lys-4 methylation directly affects PHO5, we investigated the methylation state of histone H3 at the PHO5 promoter. ChIP analysis was performed using antibodies specific for di- and trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (6Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). When cells are grown in YPD, which is limiting for Pi and hence partially activates PHO5 (18Neef D.W. Kladde M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3788-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), considerable amounts of both di- and trimethylated forms of H3 Lys-4 are present at the PHO5 promoter (Fig. 3). This enrichment is abolished in the absence of Set1, a result that confirms the presence of H3 Lys-4 methylation at PHO5 (24Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and suggests that Set1 is recruited to the PHO5 promoter. Upstream Effectors of Set1-dependent H3 Lys-4 Methylation Also Regulate PHO5—Histone of histone H2B at lysine 123 by the Rad6-Bre1 complex is required for Set1 to methylate histone H3 Lys-4. Additionally, recent reports have linked Set1-dependent Lys-4 methylation of histone H3 to transcriptional elongation via the Paf1-Rtf1 complex. Because both the Rad6-Bre1 and Paf1-Rtf1 complexes are necessary for H3 Lys-4 methylation, we surmised that strains with defects in these complexes should have a similar phenotype as that observed in a set1Δ strain. Consistent with this idea, deletions of either RTF1 or PAF1 lead to significant increases in PHO5 expression, with paf1Δ having a larger effect than rtf1Δ (Fig. 4A). Previous results have shown that deletion of PAF1 leads to a larger transcriptional effect than an RTF1 deletion (25Squazzo S.L. Costa P.J. Lindstrom D.L. Kumer K.E. Simic R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Arndt K.M. Hartzog G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Further, the absence of Paf1 reduces the association of Set1 with coding regions more than does the loss of Rtf1 (10Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletions of SET1 or BRE2 of the COMPASS complex (3Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) also show enhanced rAPase expression (Fig. 4A). In addition, deletions in RAD6, BRE1, or LGE1, encoding subunits of the Rad6-Bre1 complex (26Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), lead to increased PHO5 expression (Fig. 4B). It is interesting to note that the Paf1-Rtf1 complex, which is genetically upstream of the Rad6-Bre1 and COMPASS complexes, has the largest effect on derepression. This suggests that Paf1-Rtf1 may recruit other components that regulate PHO5 expression. Set1 Is a Negative Regulator of PHO84—To test whether other genes of the PHO cluster are regulated by Set1, we examined the expression of PHO84, which codes for the high-affinity phosphate transporter. Like PHO5, PHO84 is only minimally expressed in high Pi conditions and is highly expressed in media where Pi is limiting. PHO84 mRNA levels were analyzed in SET1+ and set1Δ cells grown in minimal high-Pi medium. As for PHO5 (Figs. 1 and 2), PHO84 expression is also derepressed in a set1 null strain, showing a marked 13-fold increase in transcription over the SET1+ strain (Fig. 5A). Conversely, a slight reduction in the mRNA levels transcribed from the gene for the constitutive protein phosphatase PPH3 is observed in set1Δ cells (Fig. 5B), as has been shown previously (6Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that Set1 may be a general repressor of PHO genes although it is required for full expression of some genes that do not respond to phosphate levels. GAL1-10 Is Also Negatively Regulated by Set1—To determine whether Set1 is involved in the repression of other genes not under phosphate control, we examined the divergently transcribed GAL1-10 locus. SET1+ and set1Δ strains were grown in repressed conditions in the presence of glucose (YPD) and semi-activating conditions (YPG + 0.5% glucose) prior to assaying for GAL1 and GAL10 mRNA accumulation. GAL1 and GAL10 transcripts are not detectable in YPD; however, more GAL1 and GAL10 mRNA accumulate in a set1Δ strain in YPG + 0.5% glucose (Fig. 6). These data are consistent with two previous microarray analyses that showed increased GAL1 transcript levels in a set1Δ deletion strain (27Boa S. Coert C. Patterton H.G. Yeast. 2003; 20: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P. Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A recent study has also shown that, at early times of induction, GAL10 is expressed at higher levels in rad6Δ as well as set1Δ strains (29Daniel J.A. Torok M.S. Sun Z.W. Schieltz D. Allis C.D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1867-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, Set1 may negatively regulate a myriad of genes with different functions and regulatory mechanisms. Histone methylation at lysine 4 by Set1 via COMPASS is a prominent histone modification in yeast, with ∼34% of the total histone H3 pool being methylated (30Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has demonstrated that Set1-dependent methylation requires the monoubiquitination of histone H2B and the Paf1-Rtf1 complex, which has been implicated in transcriptional elongation through its interaction with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The observation that H3 Lys-4 methylation is primarily associated with euchromatic genes although H3 Lys-9 methylation is correlated with heterochromatin in metazoan species suggests that each may play an integral role in the establishment of active versus inactive regions, respectively. Recent evidence has shown that Lys-9 methylation via the histone methyltransferase Suv39h leads to the recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (31Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar, 32Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Artificial targeting of histone methylation or heterochromatin protein 1 via chimeric fusion proteins to euchromatic regions also leads to local gene silencing (33Li Y. Danzer J.R. Alvarez P. Belmont A.S. Wallrath L.L. Development. 2003; 130: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Snowden A.W. Gregory P.D. Case C.C. Pabo C.O. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2159-2166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although Set1-mediated Lys-4 methylation of histone H3 is associated with active chromatin, it is not known whether this modification leads to the recruitment of additional factors or serves another function. Furthermore, although this histone modification is associated with transcriptional elongation and appears to be prominent at core promoters and at the 5′ end of transcribed regions of euchromatic genes, it has been shown to be required for the full expression of only a few genes (5Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). We presented evidence that Set1 is also involved in the repression of a subset of genes in active chromatin regions, showing that the loss of Set1 leads to higher levels of expression of PHO5 (Figs. 1, 2, and 4A), PHO84 (Fig. 5), and GAL1-10 (Fig. 6). This evidence indicated that, in addition to its previously characterized role in activation, H3 Lys-4 methylation has a repressive role in gene expression. General derepression of genes in our set1Δ mutant strain was not observed, because we confirmed that PPH3 expression is down-regulated, as has been shown previously (6Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Deletions of genes coding components of complexes that regulate Set1 methylation also showed similar phenotypes as those observed in a set1 null strain (Fig. 4). Loss of Paf1, the most upstream regulator of H3 Lys-4 methylation, led to the largest derepression of PHO5. This suggests that other factors in addition to Set1 may be recruited by the Paf1-Rtf1 elongation complex. It was reported previously that a paf1 mutant causes both gene-specific increases or decreases in transcription, which demonstrates a dual role in gene regulation for transcriptional elongation (35Shi X. Finkelstein A. Wolf A.J. Wade P.A. Burton Z.F. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this study, GAL10 and GAL7 were two of the genes that required Paf1 for full expression, suggesting further that Paf1-Rtf1 recruits additional proteins that affect gene expression positively or negatively. Similarly, loss of Ctk1, which phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain repeat of RNA polymerase II, has both positive and negative effects on the transcription of various genes (36Patturajan M. Conrad N.K. Bregman D.B. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27823-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, the histone methyltransferase Set2, which methylates histone H3 at lysine 36, has also been associated with active chromatin and transcription elongation via the Paf1-Rtf1 complex and is required for full expression of a GAL1-lacZ reporter (37Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A. Cagney G. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Beattie B.K. Emili A. Boone C. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, when the Set2 protein is tethered to a heterologous promoter via LexA, it serves as a repressor lowering transcription by more than 20-fold (38Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Set2 is responsible for the repression of the basal expression of GAL4 (39Landry J. Sutton A. Hesman T. Min J. Xu R.M. Johnston M. Sternglanz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5972-5978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also found that the Rad6-Bre1 complex, which monoubiquitinates histone H2B at lysine 123 as a prerequisite to H3 Lys-4 methylation by Set1, negatively regulates PHO5 (Fig. 4B). A previous report showed that ARG1 transcription is derepressed ∼10-fold in the absence of Rad6 (40Turner S.D. Ricci A.R. Petropoulos H. Genereaux J. Skerjanc I.S. Brandl C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, GAL10 is expressed at much higher levels in a rad6 null strain; however, the corresponding histone H2B lysine 123 to the arginine (K123R) mutant did not derepress GAL10 transcription (29Daniel J.A. Torok M.S. Sun Z.W. Schieltz D. Allis C.D. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1867-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This same histone mutant was also used in another study to show that loss of histone H2B ubiquitination at GAL1 and PHO5 delays transactivation (41Kao C.F. Hillyer C. Tsukuda T. Henry K. Berger S. Osley M.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, in this report, Rad6 was dispensable for GAL1 activation. The reason for different phenotypes between rad6Δ and histone H2B K123R mutant strains was unclear and may have resulted from strain differences or altered levels of expression of the episomal copy of the histone gene. It is also conceivable that histone H2B ubiquitination is required for basal repression as well as transcriptional activation as has been reported previously for the histone deacetylase Rpd3 (42Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates that the proteosomal ATPases Rpt4 and Rpt6 are required for H3 Lys-4 methylation (43Ezhkova E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 435-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), potentially linking ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation of histone H3. Rpt4/6 recruitment is dependent on Rad6, suggesting that histone ubiquitination is required. Further, in agreement with our data (Fig. 6B), these authors show that a mutation in RPT6 leads to increased levels of GAL10 expression and state that a strain lacking Set1 shows a similar effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, despite their association with transcription elongation, specific effectors of H3 Lys-4 methylation may up- or down-regulate distinct subsets of genes. The mechanism for the opposing regulatory role at different loci remains unclear. We propose that Set1 regulates gene expression positively and negatively. Although Set1 methylation activity depends on the transcriptional elongation complex Paf1-Rtf1, our data also show that PHO5 expression is derepressed in paf1Δ and rtf1Δ mutants that lack H3 Lys-4 methylation. This suggests that H2B Lys-123 ubiquitination and H3 Lys-4 methylation may establish a negative feedback loop on basal transcription. This view is consistent with the presence of a transcriptional elongation checkpoint in which Ctk1 phosphorylates serine 5 of the RNA polymerase carboxyl-terminal domain and recruits COMPASS that contains Set1 (16Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). At initial times of transcriptional initiation, transcriptional activators, such as Pho4 or Gal4, bind to their cognate DNA sites and recruit transcriptional coactivators, e.g. the histone acetyltransferase complex SAGA and the RNA polymerase machinery, including Paf1-Rtf1. During the transition to a stably elongating polymerase, Paf1-Rtf1 leads to increasing amounts of histone H2B ubiquitination and subsequent H3 Lys-4 methylation, possibly ensuring assembly of the necessary RNA capping and processing factors (17Blackwell T.K. Walker A.K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R915-R916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, later in the activation process, recruitment of SAGA is increased, and the histone deubiquitinase Ubp8 of SAGA may remove H2B ubiquitination. This model is supported by data demonstrating a transient peak of histone H2B ubiquitination following transactivation of GAL1 and PHO5 (41Kao C.F. Hillyer C. Tsukuda T. Henry K. Berger S. Osley M.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 44Henry K.W. Wyce A. Lo W.S. Duggan L.J. Emre N.C. Kao C.F. Pillus L. Shilatifard A. Osley M.A. Berger S.L.

By using a biochemical approach and the soluble form of MalK as a model substrate, we demonstrate that MalK alone inhibits transcription activation by MalT in a purified transcription system. The inhibitory effect observed in vitro is relieved by maltotriose and by two malT mutations and one malK mutation known to interfere with MalT repression by MalK in vivo. MalK interacts directly with the activator in the absence of maltotriose but not in the presence of maltotriose. Conversely, MalK inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that MalK and maltotriose compete for MalT binding. Part, if not all, of the MalK-binding site is located on DT1, the N-terminal domain of MalT. All of these features indicate that MalK inhibits MalT by the same mechanism as two other proteins, MalY and Aes, that also act as negative effectors of MalT by antagonizing maltotriose binding by MalT. These results offer new insights into the mechanism by which gene regulation can be accomplished by the ATPase component of a bacterial ATP-binding cassette-type importer.

Recent studies have revealed that bacterial transport systems can be directly involved in signal transduction pathways and play a key role in gene regulation by displaying a regulatory function that is tightly coupled to their transport activity. Based on the few examples of transport-based sensory systems that have been characterized in detail to date, the mechanisms of signal transduction differ widely, depending on the system. For instance, BglF, a phosphotransferase system enzyme II that catalyzes the import and phosphorylation of β-glucosides, phosphorylates and sequesters the BglG antiterminator in the absence of β-glucoside transport, and dephosphorylates and releases it when transport resumes (1Lopian L. Nussbaum-Shochat A. O'Day-Kerstein K. Wright A. Amster-Choder O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7099-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Active sugar transport triggers the recruitment of the Mlc repressor by the dephosphorylated glucose-specific phosphotransferase system enzyme II (PtsG), thereby derepressing the Mlc-controlled genes (for a review, see Ref. 2Plumbridge J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the case of the ferric citrate transport system, substrate binding to the receptor located in the outer membrane triggers the activation of a specific sigma factor via a complex signaling cascade (3Braun V. Mahren S. Ogierman M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).This paper deals with the roles that ATP-binding cassette transporters play in signaling pathways. The model system is the Escherichia coli maltodextrin transporter, whose ATP-binding cassette component, the MalK protein, down-regulates the activity of MalT, a transcriptional activator that controls the expression of the maltose regulon (4Boos W. Böhm A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). MalT control by MalK was first recognized with the finding that malK null mutants express constitutively the maltose regulon, whereas MalK overproduction blocks mal gene induction (5Hofnung M. Hatfield D. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 40-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the repression by MalK is relieved both by MalT overexpression and by a class of malT mutations (malTc) that confer constitutive expression of the maltose regulon suggested further that MalT is the target of the negative control exerted by MalK (6Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The maltodextrin transport system is one of the best characterized ATP-binding cassette transporters, and its study has provided a wealth of information about the mechanism of coupling between transport and ATP hydrolysis (7Davidson A.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1038-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The physiology of the regulatory function of MalK is also well understood. MalT repression by MalK ensures that the maltose regulon is not induced by endogenous maltotriose, the inducer of the system, in the absence of external maltodextrins (8Bukau B. Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 884-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of maltotriose of internal origin is indeed high enough to cause full expression of the regulon in a malK strain in minimal medium supplemented with glycerol (8Bukau B. Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 884-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uninduced level of expression of the maltose regulon observed in a wild-type strain in the absence of maltose in the growth medium corresponds to the residual MalT activity that escapes repression by MalK. In contrast, the mechanism of MalT inhibition by MalK remains unclear. Some MalTc variants are known to display a higher affinity for maltotriose and to be less sensitive to repression by MalK, which suggests that MalK inhibits MalT by competing with maltotriose (6Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dardonville B. Raibaud O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1846-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However direct evidence for this model is still lacking. Böhm et al. (10Böhm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3708-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) identified a surface determinant on the C-terminal domain of MalK that is specifically involved in MalT repression and might represent the MalT binding site. Panagiotidis et al. (11Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) observed a MalT-MalK interaction in vitro, but this MalT-MalK complex did not respond to signals known to relieve MalT repression by MalK in vivo. Also, how maltodextrin entrance is coupled to derepression remains elusive. On the basis of genetic data, Panagiotidis et al. (11Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) proposed that only the ATP-bound form of MalK, which is expected to predominate when the transporter is resting, is able to repress MalT.MalT is the archetype of a family of ∼100-kDa transcriptional activators found in prokaryotes (12De Schrijver A. De Mot R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Valdez F. González-Cerón G. Kieser H.M. Servín-González L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2365-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transcription activation by MalT involves MalT self-association, cooperative binding to an array of MalT sites located in the target promoters, and stimulation of open complex formation by the RNA polymerase (14Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A complex interplay of signaling compounds and proteins controls the activity of the MalT protein (4Boos W. Böhm A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). MalT is active only in the presence of ATP and maltotriose, both of which are required for multimerization (16Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to MalK, two other proteins, namely MalY, a β C-S lyase, and Aes, an acyl esterase, down-regulate MalT activity (17Reidl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4862-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that both MalY and Aes interact directly with MalT and compete with maltotriose for MalT binding (19Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Available data suggest that unliganded MalT is in equilibrium between an inactive monomeric form and an active monomeric form prone to self-association. The inactive form would be stabilized by MalY or Aes, whereas the active form would be stabilized by maltotriose. The requirement for ATP as a positive effector of MalT might reflect a role for the ATPase activity of MalT in the competition between positive and negative effectors. Indeed, both ATP and ADP can promote MalT multimerization or inhibitory complex formation, but ATP is more effective in driving MalT self-association, whereas ADP is more effective in promoting the formation of an inhibitory complex (16Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Structural studies have revealed that MalT is composed of four domains (21Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DT1 (residues 1-241) binds and hydrolyzes ATP (21Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It also binds MalY and Aes (20Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Schlegel A. Danot O. Richet E. Ferenci T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) whereas maltotriose is bound by DT3 (residues 437-806) (21Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Steegborn C. Danot O. Huber R. Clausen T. Structure. 2001; 9: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DT4 (residues 807-901), which belongs to the LuxR-type family of DNA-binding domains, contains the DNA-binding site and most likely also carries a surface determinant contacting the RNA polymerase (24Danot O. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The transition between the inactive and the active form of MalT involves DT1, DT2, and DT3, three domains that are specific to the MalT family of transcriptional activators and are thought to constitute a signal integration module (21Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the mechanism whereby MalK modulates MalT activity, we developed an in vitro system that reproduces MalT inhibition by MalK. The observation that MalK causes a Mal- phenotype when overproduced (6Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that free MalK, i.e. the MalK form that is not associated with the membrane components of the transporter (MalF and MalG), is able to inhibit MalT. We therefore used the soluble form of MalK as a model substrate. We show that MalK alone impedes transcription activation by MalT in a purified transcription system. Characterization of the repression process revealed that MalK inhibits MalT by forming a complex with the activator and by blocking inducer binding. Part, if not all, of the MalK-binding site is present on DT1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(λDE3) has been described by Studier et al. (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). BL21(λDE3) ΔmalT220 contains a deletion of the entire malT gene (19Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Plasmids pOM163 and pOM163-T38R are pET28b(+) (Novagen) derivatives producing DT1 or DT1-T38R with a Strep tag at their C terminus (DT1S) (20Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol.

Nikaïdo) by PCR using the oligonucleotides KU001 (5′-GCGGCGCCATGGGGACCCACGATCAGGTCGA-3′) and KD001 (5′-GGCCGCGAAGCTTCAGGCTTTGTGTGTTTTGT-3′), digesting it with NcoI and HindIII, and inserting it between the NcoI and HindIII sites of pET28b(+) followed by the insertion of a His tag encoding linker, HTAG1/HTAG2 (HTAG1, 5′-CATGCATCATCATCACCATCA-3′; HTAG2, 5′-CATGTGATGGTGATGATGATG-3′), in the NcoI site of the intermediate construct. The sequence of the construct was verified. The encoded polypeptide has a M(H)6MG extension at the MalK N terminus. The pOM174-G346S derivative was obtained by replacing the EcoRIHindIII fragment of pOM174 with the EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pAB204 (10Böhm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol.

ATP-free MalT was prepared by precipitating the purified protein with ammonium sulfate and filtering the resuspended material through a G-75 Sephadex column according to Schreiber and Richet (16Schreiber V.

ATP-free MalT was used throughout this work.The MalK protein, with a His tag at its amino terminus, was purified from strain BL21(λDE3) harboring pOM174. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 1.5 liters of Luria-Bertani medium (5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of tryptone, and 10 g of NaCl, adjusted to pH 7) in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin, induced with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside at A600 = 0.8, and further grown at 18 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) to a final A600 = 100, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press cell at 16,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation (30 min at 30,000 × g), the supernatant was loaded on a 6-ml Ni-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. -agarose (Qiagen) column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 9 column volumes of buffer A plus 20 mm imidazole and 9 column volumes of buffer A plus 40 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with buffer A plus 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was kept on ice, where it remained active for at least 8 days. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.ATPase Assay—His-tagged MalK was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 19 μl of reaction mixture containing 36 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 27 mm tripotassium citrate, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 210 μg·ml-1 acetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma) before the addition of 1 μl of [γ-32P] ATP (1 mm, 0.01 Ci/mmol) and further incubation at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.25 m EDTA. Aliquots (2 μl) were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Schleicher and Schüll) and developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. The chromatograms were dried and scanned on a PhosphorImager.Abortive Initiation Assay—MalT was preincubated at 30 °C for 15 min in 18 μl of reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 9 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 27 mm tripotassium citrate, 17 mm NaCl, 11 mm magnesium acetate, 0.11 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm dithiothreitol, 22 mm imidazole, 230 μg·ml-1 acetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5 nmmalPp DNA fragment, and the indicated concentrations of maltotriose, AMP-PNP, and MalK. Two microliters of RNA polymerase solution (0.13 μm in 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 33 mm tripotassium citrate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg·ml-1 acetylated bovine serum albumin) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The synthesis of abortive products (ApApC) was initiated by adding 2 μl of a solution containing 5 mm ApA, 0.5 mm [α-32P]CTP (0.2 Ci·mmol-1), and 500 μg·ml-1 heparin (H-0880; Sigma) and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30 °C (heparin blocks open complex formation by trapping free RNA polymerase). The reaction products were separated from free [α-32P]CTP by chromatography on Whatman 3MM paper as described (27McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The chromatograms were dried and scanned on a Phosphor-Imager, and the amount of ApApC synthesized was quantified. The malPp DNA template is a 320-bp fragment containing the malPp promoter (from -154 to +130), prepared as described (19Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Maltotriose Binding Assay—The 30-μl reaction mixture contained 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 27 mm tripotassium citrate, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 μm [14C]maltotriose (900 mCi·mmol-1), 0.2 mg·ml-1 acetylated bovine serum albumin, and MalT and MalK as indicated. After 10 or 30 min of incubation at 20 °C, the tube was chilled on ice for 5 min, and the proteins were precipitated by adding 180 μl of a solution containing 3.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 40 mm HEPESKOH (pH 8), 33 mm tripotassium citrate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP. After 5 min on ice, the precipitate was collected by a 10-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, washed with 120 μl of the same solution, dissolved in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA, and counted in 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture for 5 min. All values represent the average of assays performed in duplicate and are corrected for the background level (60 cpm) measured in the absence of MalT and MalK. The variations observed between two assays did not exceed 13%.Affinity Chromatography with Immobilized MalK—Bacteria over-producing His-tagged MalK+ or MalK-G346S were prepared as for MalK purification. A 10-ml cell suspension (A600 = 100) was thawed, disrupted in a French press cell (16,000 p.s.i.), and centrifuged (60 min at 20,000 × g) to collect the supernatant. Affinity chromatography was performed at 4 °C in Micro Biospin® Bio-Rad columns packed with 50 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Solutions were passed through the columns by spinning at 5 × g for 30 s in a bench top centrifuge. The columns were equilibrated with buffer A and loaded with 2 ml of soluble extract. The columns were washed with buffer A (5 × 100 μl) and buffer A plus 40 mm imidazole (5 × 100 μl). The MalK-loaded column was then equilibrated with buffer A plus 2 mm ATP ± 10 mm maltotriose (2 × 100 μl), and purified MalT (200 μl at 0.5 mg·ml-1 in buffer A plus 2 mm ATP (±10 mm maltotriose) was allowed to flow through the column. Unbound proteins were washed out with 5 × 100 μl of buffer A plus 40 mm imidazole plus 2 mm ATP (±10 mm maltotriose). His-tagged MalK was eluted with 4 × 100 μl of buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. 100-μl fractions were collected starting from the MalT washing step and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1).Affinity Chromatography with Immobilized DT1—Soluble extracts containing DT1S or DT1S-T38R were prepared from BL21(λDE3) ΔmalT220 harboring pOM163 or pOM163-T38R, as described (20Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography was performed at 4 °C in Micro Biospin® Bio-Rad columns packed with 50 μl of Strep-Tactin®-Sepharose® resin (IBA), as described above. The columns were equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10% sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm AMP-PNP) plus 0.5 m KCl and loaded with 250 μl of DT1S or DT1ST38R soluble extract supplemented with 2 mm AMP-PNP. The columns were washed with 6× 100 μl of buffer B plus 0.1 m KCl. Freshly purified MalK (1 ml at 0.25 mg/ml in the washing buffer) was allowed to flow through the DT1-loaded column, and unbound proteins were washed out with 5× 100 μl of the washing buffer. DT1S or DT1S-T38R was eluted with 4× 100 μl of buffer B plus 0.1 m KCl plus 2.5 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma). Ten 100-μl fractions were collected, starting with the MalK washing step, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1).RESULTSMalK Inhibits Transcription Activation by MalT in Vitro—We first examined whether purified MalK inhibits MalT in an in vitro transcription system. MalT activity was assayed by monitoring its ability to activate open complex formation at malPp, a MalT-dependent promoter, in the presence of RNA polymerase. MalT was incubated with malPp DNA and AMPPNP 2AMP-PNP, which can replace ATP as an effector of MalT (33Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is actually more effective than ATP in driving MalT self-association in the presence of maltotriose due to the absence of ATP hydrolysis, which generates ADP-bound forms that are less prone to multimerization (16Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). in the presence or absence of MalK before adding RNA polymerase and allowing open complex formation. The amount of the open complexes formed was then determined by measuring the rate of abortive product synthesis. The assay was performed in the presence of AMP-PNP instead of ATP to avoid MalK- and MalT-driven ATP hydrolysis, which might interfere with the assay. In addition, given that MalT-dependence on maltotriose is only partial in the presence of AMP-PNP, 3MalT is 50% as active in the presence of AMP-PNP alone as it is in the presence of AMP-PNP and a saturating concentration of maltotriose. N. Joly, unpublished results. maltotriose was omitted from the assay. This omission avoided the possibility that maltotriose might impede repression by MalK. Note also that, for a given concentration of MalT, the fraction of the protein that is in the active form, as judged by the promoter response, depends on the concentrations of the positive effectors and on the MalT variant assayed. Therefore, for each combination of effectors and MalT variant used in this work, we determined an individual response curve, i.e. the amount of open complexes formed as a function of MalT concentration. The concentration of MalT that was used to test the effect of MalK was that eliciting about half of the maximum response under the chosen conditions. The presence of a limiting concentration of MalT in the assay ensures that MalT inhibition by MalK can be readily detected.As shown in Fig. 1, MalK strongly depressed malPp activation by MalT in the absence of maltotriose; the amount of open complexes formed was reduced by 80% in the presence of 8 μm MalK. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of MalK disappeared when the assay was performed in the presence of 0.1 mm maltotriose (Fig. 1). The fact that maltotriose antagonizes MalT inhibition by MalK, as was expected based on in vivo data, provides evidence that the inhibitory effect observed in vitro is physiologically relevant.malT and malK Mutations Relieving MalT Inhibition by MalK in Vivo Also Suppress the Inhibitory Effect of MalK in Vitro—To confirm that the inhibition caused by MalK in vitro is functionally significant, we examined whether two different malT mutations that are known to confer resistance to MalK in vivo (malTc26 and malT-T38R) have the same effect in vitro. The malTc26 mutation, which generates the R242P substitution in the DT1-DT2 linker, increases the affinity of MalT for maltotriose by favoring the transition from the inactive state to the active state (9Dardonville B. Raibaud O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1846-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It also suppresses MalT-sensitivity to MalK in vivo (22Schlegel A. Danot O. Richet E. Ferenci T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The T38R substitution, which is located in DT1, diminishes MalT-sensitivity to MalK in vivo (22Schlegel A. Danot O. Richet E. Ferenci T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, neither of these MalT variants was affected by MalK when assayed in the presence of AMP-PNP alone, i.e. under conditions in which wild-type MalT is inhibited by MalK.Fig. 2Effect of malT and malK mutations on MalT repression by MalK. Abortive initiation assays were performed in the presence of 0.5 mm AMP-PNP and the indicated concentrations of MalT and MalK variants.

The G346S substitution, which is thought to alter the MalT-binding site, specifically decreases the ability of MalK to down-regulate MalT in vivo without damaging its ability to catalyze maltose transport both when overproduced or when constitutively expressed from a chromosomal locus (10Böhm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3708-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 4E. Richet, unpublished results. As expected, MalT is not inhibited by the MalK-G346S variant in the presence of AMP-PNP alone (Fig. 2B). To rule out the possibility that the lack of effect of MalK-G346S was caused by protein misfolding, we verified that the purified MalK variant hydrolyzes ATP in vitro at exactly the same rate as the wild-type protein (0.32 and 0.33 molecule of ATP are hydrolyzed at 30 °C per minute per protomer of wild-type and mutant protein, respectively). The uncoupled ATPase activity of MalK is a good indicator of correct protein folding, given that ATP hydrolysis by MalK relies on protein dimerization and that dimerization involves both the nucleotide-binding domain and the regulatory domain, as revealed by the x-ray struct"

We show that thyroid hormone receptors also are single-stranded RNA binding proteins and that this binding is functionally significant. By using a series of deletion mutants, a novel RNA-binding domain was localized to a 41-amino acid segment of thyroid hormone receptor α1 between the second zinc finger and the ligand-binding domain. This RNA-binding domain was necessary and sufficient for thyroid hormone receptor binding to the steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA). Although SRA does not bind directly to steroid receptors, it has been identified as a steroid receptor coactivator, and was thought not to be a coactivator for thyroid hormone receptors. However, transfection studies revealed that SRA enhances thyroid hormone induction of appropriate reporter genes and that the thyroid hormone receptor RNA-binding domain is important for this enhancement. We conclude that thyroid hormone receptors bind RNA through a novel domain and that the interaction of this domain with SRA, and perhaps other RNAs, enhances thyroid hormone receptor function.

Thyroid hormone 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) 1The abbreviations used are: T3, 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; SRA, steroid receptor RNA activator; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DBDC, DNA-binding domain C. 1The abbreviations used are: T3, 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; SRA, steroid receptor RNA activator; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DBDC, DNA-binding domain C. plays important roles in development, differentiation, and metabolic homeostasis. T3 action is mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily that includes receptors for steroids, retinoids, vitamin D, and numerous other ligands (1Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Based upon similarities in structure and function, nuclear receptors can be divided into functional domains designated as A-E/F, which include a divergent N-terminal A/B domain that often contains a transcriptional activation function, a well conserved DNA-binding domain (C domain), a hinge region (D domain), and the C-terminal E/F domain that binds the ligand and interacts with various corepressor or coactivator proteins. TRs are encoded by two genes, Thra and Thrb, that produce several proteins through the use of alternate promoters and/or alternative splicing. The major functional TRs are denoted TRα1 and TRβ1. These proteins are highly conserved in sequence but are expressed at different levels in various organs and have distinct biological functions (2Flamant F. Samarut J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The ability to bind specific T3 response elements (TREs) in target genes is crucial for TR function. TRs bind to DNA constitutively, even in the absence of ligand, as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (3Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.Y. Staub A. Garnier J.M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) or possibly as homodimers (4Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Toyoda N. Zavacki A.M. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell.

TRs regulate gene expression essentially by functioning as scaffolding proteins; they serve as a nidus for the formation of protein complexes at the target promoter, which then regulate transcription. In the absence of T3, the conformation of the TR is such that it generally attracts a corepressor complex that has histone deacetylase activity (7Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

In the presence of T3, the corepressor complex is released, and various coactivator complexes can be recruited. It is unclear how many distinct coactivator complexes exist or how many are required for T3 induction of gene expression, but the number of coactivator proteins identified is large and growing. A major coactivator complex contains histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and protein methyltransferase activities (9Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This complex includes the steroid receptor coactivator family of p160 proteins, SRC-1 (10Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar), SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1 (11Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and SRC-3/pCIP/ACTR/AIB1/TRAM1/RAC3 (12Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The p160 proteins bind to other coactivators and also possess HAT activity, which serves to loosen chromatin structure and facilitate protein-DNA interactions (13Zhang J.S. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 14Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second coactivator complex, known as DRIP/TRAP, probably binds to the ligand-occupied receptor after the HAT complex. Numerous other coactivators have been described, and exactly where and when they function in transcriptional regulation is unclear. Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) is a steroid receptor coactivator that does not bind directly to steroid receptors, but probably functions as part of a complex with p160 proteins (15Lanz R.B. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Albrecht U. Wong J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Although most nuclear receptor coactivators are quite promiscuous in their action, SRA has been considered to be a specific steroid receptor coactivator, not a TR coactivator. The most intriguing aspect of SRA is that it seems to function as an RNA. Herein we demonstrate that TRs are RNA-binding proteins. A novel RNA-binding domain was identified distal to the TR zinc fingers and proximal to the ligand-binding domain. TRs bind SRA in vitro and in cells, and SRA functions as a TR coactivator by interaction with this novel TR RNA-binding domain. Plasmids and Proteins—Full-length mouse TRα1 (16Prost E. Koenig R.J.

Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). To maximize the recovery of full-length proteins, the constructs were further tagged with six histidines at their C termini (GST-TRα1-His6 or GST-TRβ1-His6), and the empty vector also encoded 6 histidines subsequent to GST. For simplicity, we refer to these proteins as GST, GST-TRα1, etc. TRα1 deletion mutants were constructed by inverse PCR and are described in Fig. 1. All mutations were verified by sequencing. E. coli strain BL21 carrying the fusion protein expression vectors were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. To increase the solubility of the receptor fusion proteins, the E. coli also contained a plasmid expressing thioredoxin (19Yasukawa T. Ishii C.K. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and the cells were lysed by French press (20Wu Y. Xu B. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3929-3936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were applied to TALON resin (Clontech), and the hexahistidine-containing proteins were purified according to the vendor's protocol, except that 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the buffers. The eluted proteins were further incubated with glutathione beads for 2 h. After washing three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, the agarose beads were resuspended in 1 volume of the latter buffer with 10% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. An aliquot of the beads was boiled in SDS sample buffer and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to confirm that the correctly sized protein was made and to allow adjustment to equal quantities of each of the recombinant GST fusion proteins. To create a FLAG-TRα1 mammalian expression vector, TRα1 was released from pGEX-KG as an EcoRI (filled in)-SalI fragment and was ligated to the vector 3×FLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma) that had been digested with EcoRV and SalI. FLAG-TRβ1 was cloned in a similar way. The mammalian expression plasmids pCDM-TRα1 (21Koenig R.J. Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Chin W.W. Moore D.D.

The deletion mutant pCDM-TRα1ΔC2 was derived from pGEX-KG-TRα1ΔC2 by PCR of TRα1ΔC2 with XhoI and NotI sites added to the primers, followed by ligation to pCDM. T3-responsive luciferase reporter constructs 8DR4-Luc and 2×Pal-Luc in the vector pGL3-promoter (Promega) have been described (22Rosen E.D. O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22010-22013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro RNA-binding Assay—Purified GST and the GST-TR proteins were adjusted to 1 μg of protein per 30 μl of beads by dilution with empty glutathione agarose beads. For each assay, 6 μl of the diluted beads were incubated with 200,000 cpm of a [32P]RNA probe in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5 μg of bovine serum albumin/μl) for 40 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The [32P]RNA probe was made by in vitro transcription using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP either from pBluescript KS(+) or pSCT-SRA that had been linearized by digestion with PvuII. After incubation, the beads were washed 4× with 100 μl of binding buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water, and transferred to scintillation vials for determination of radioactivity in a Beckman LS2800 liquid scintillation analyzer. Coimmunoprecipitation Assay and RT-PCR Analysis—CV-1 cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were transfected with either 6 μg of empty FLAG vector, FLAG-TRα1, or FLAG-TRβ1 using LipofectAMINE/Plus according to the vendor's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and nuclear extracts were isolated using the reagent NE-PER (Pierce). The nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing, the coimmunoprecipitated RNA was analyzed for SRA by RT-PCR. The RT-PCRs were performed by using a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit and the following conditions: 30 min at 50 °C, 15 min at 95 °C; 45 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and a final step of 10 min at 72 °C. Products were visualized on 1.4% agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining. The SRA-specific primers used for RT-PCR were SRA RT-F, 5′-CGC GGC TGG AAC GAC CCG CCG C-3′, and SRA RT-R, 5′-TAG GAG ATG GTG TCC GGT GAG TCT G-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection Assay—CV-1 cells were maintained in minimum essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transfection experiments, cells were split in 24-well plates 16 h before transfection and were grown in media with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE/Plus reagents. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with pCDM, pCDM-TRα1, pCDM-TRβ1, or pCDM-TRα1ΔC2; TRE-Luc; pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector (Promega); and pSCT-SRA or empty pSCT (doses are described subsequently). After transfection, cells were cultured with or without 100 nm T3. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h later for analysis of firefly and Renilla luciferases with the Promega dual luciferase reporter assay system. Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. TRs Bind to RNA through a Novel RNA-binding Domain—Because RNA-binding proteins commonly bind RNA with relatively low specificity, screening assays for RNA binding often utilize probes of arbitrary sequence (23Lalli E. Ohe K. Hindelang C. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed an RNA-binding assay in which purified GST fusion proteins adsorbed to glutathione agarose beads were incubated with a 32P-labeled 240-nucleotide RNA probe transcribed from PvuII-linearized pBluescript KS(+) with T3 polymerase. By using this assay, ∼35% of the input RNA probe bound to GST-TRα1 (Fig. 2, bar 2), which was 10- to 20-fold greater than the amount that bound to GST (bar 1). To identify the protein domain responsible for RNA binding, we tested a series of TRα1 truncation or deletion mutants (illustrated schematically in Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, we found that the TRα1 ligand-binding domain (amino acids 162-410) is not involved in RNA binding, because this domain by itself has almost no RNA-binding activity (bar 3), and deletion of this domain from TRα1 does not impair RNA binding (bar 4). We next found that a fragment of TRα1 extending from the amino terminus through to the end of the second zinc finger (amino acids 1-110, denoted ABDN) also does not bind RNA (Fig. 2, bar 5). By a process of elimination, this suggested that the RNA-binding domain lies between the second zinc finger and the ligand-binding domain. This was confirmed, as this domain (amino acids 111-161, denoted DNA-binding domain C (DBDC)) possessed full RNA-binding activity (Fig. 2, bar 6). In contrast to steroid receptors, the DNA-binding domain of TRs contains an extension carboxyl terminal to the zinc fingers. This extension includes previously described regions known as the T region and A helix (24Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 25Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and these lie within the DBDC fragment (Fig. 3). Therefore, we subdivided DBDC into three smaller fragments, denoted C1 (amino acids 111-127), C2 (amino acids 128-151) or C3 (amino acids 152-161). C1 contains the T region, C2 contains the A helix, and C3 contains the hinge region that separates the DBD from the ligand-binding domain. None of these fragments was capable of binding RNA (Fig. 2, bars 7-9). This led us to test the somewhat larger fragments C1C2 (amino acids 111-151) and C2C3 (amino acids 128-161), which revealed that C1C2 has full RNA-binding activity (Fig. 2, bar 10), but C2C3 does not bind RNA (bar 11). To confirm the assignment of C1C2 as the RNA-binding domain, we removed C1, C2, or C1C2 from intact TRα1 and tested these deletion mutants for RNA binding. The results indicate that TRα1ΔC1 has ∼75% of wild-type RNA binding (Fig. 2, bar 12), TRα1ΔC2 has ∼25% (bar 13), and TRα1ΔC1C2 does not bind RNA (bar 14). These data confirm that C1C2 (amino acids 111-151) accounts for the RNA-binding activity of TRα1. Because sequence analysis indicates that the RNA-binding domain C1C2 of TRα1 is highly conserved in TRβ1 (80% identity), we also tested TRβ1 for RNA binding. As expected, TRβ1 bound RNA with activity comparable with TRα1 (Fig. 2, bar 15). RNA-binding Specificity of TRα1—RNA-binding proteins commonly bind different RNA homopolymers with different binding specificities (26Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of non-radiolabeled poly(U), poly(C), poly(G), or poly(A) to compete with the radiolabeled RNA probe for binding to TRα1 (Fig. 4). The data indicate that all of the homopolymers except poly(A) compete well. We took advantage of these data to test whether TRα1 prefers to bind single-versus double-stranded RNA. We found that annealing poly(A) to poly(U) destroyed the ability of poly(U) to compete with the [32P]RNA probe, but mixing poly(A) with poly(G) had no effect upon competition by poly(G) (data not shown). These results suggest that TRα1 prefers to bind single-stranded RNA. TRα1 Binds to Steroid Receptor RNA Activator in Vitro and in Intact Cells—Steroid receptor RNA activator potentiates steroid hormone receptor transcriptional activity as an RNA transcript by an indirect mechanism that does not involve SRA-steroid receptor binding (15Lanz R.B. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Albrecht U. Wong J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Because TRs bind RNA, we tested whether TRs bind SRA. The interaction of TRα1 and SRA was first examined by using [32P]SRA as a probe in the in vitro RNA-binding assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, full-length TRα1 (bar 2), TRβ1(bar 3), and the TRα1 RNA-binding domain C1C2 (bar 6) bound the SRA probe comparably well, whereas the TRα1 deletion mutants TRα1LBD, ABDN, TRα1ΔC2, and TRα1ΔC1C2 had a very low affinity for SRA (bars 4, 5, 8, 9). These data confirm that TRs bind SRA through their RNA-binding domain, C1C2. To examine whether TRs bind SRA in cells, CV-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-TRα1, FLAG-TRβ1, or empty FLAG vector. Nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads, and the RNA that coprecipitated was applied to an RT-PCR using SRA-specific primers. SRA was detected in the samples from cells expressing FLAG-TRα1 or FLAG-TRβ1, but was not detected in the immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with empty FLAG vector (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that TRs also bind SRA in cells. It should be noted also that the RT-PCRs produced, in addition to the expected 680-bp product, a band of ∼490 bp. Apparently, identical products were detected in cells by RT-PCR using the same primers in the original characterization of SRA (15Lanz R.B. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Albrecht U. Wong J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Whether this smaller band represents an alternative splice product or the product of a closely related gene is not known. SRA Functions as a Thyroid Hormone Receptor Coactivator—SRA has previously been cloned and characterized as a steroid receptor RNA coactivator that functions through an indirect mechanism possibly involving p160-SRA interaction (15Lanz R.B. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Albrecht U. Wong J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Because we found that TRs bind SRA, we examined whether SRA functions as a TR coactivator. Indeed, by cotransfection we found that SRA enhanced T3 induction of 8DR4-Luc ∼2-fold (Fig. 6A). Coactivation was observed for the modest T3 induction because of endogenous TRs (Fig. 6, bars 1-4), as well as for cotransfected TRα1 (bars 5-8) or TRβ1 (bars 9-12). Similar results were obtained by using a second TRE reporter construct, 2×Pal-Luc, except that endogenous TRs did not support T3 induction from this TRE (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the TR RNA-binding domain is required for SRA coactivation, we performed cotransfection experiments comparing wild-type TRα1 with TRα1ΔC2 (Fig. 7). With wild-type TRα1, SRA stimulated the T3 induction of luciferase from ∼40 units to ∼140 units (Fig. 7, bar 6 versus 8). However, with TRα1ΔC2, SRA stimulation only reached ∼80 units (Fig. 7, bar 12), even though TRα1 and TRα1ΔC2 had identical activities in the absence of exogenous SRA (bar 6 versus 10). These data suggest that the TR RNA-binding domain is important for coactivation by SRA. Our in vitro RNA-binding assay revealed a novel RNA-binding domain in TRα1, which we denoted C1C2, consisting of a 41-amino acid segment located between the second zinc finger and the ligand-binding domain. The crystal structure of an RXR DBD-TRβ DBD dimer complexed with DNA has been solved, and this revealed that C1C2 includes the previously described T region and A helix (24Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 25Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3. The T region is a connector between the zinc fingers and the A helix, which is an α-helix composed of 24 mostly charged residues. The A helix binds to the minor groove of DNA and, hence, can strengthen the major protein-DNA interactions formed through the zinc fingers. In fact, the A helix was first described in the orphan nuclear receptor nerve growth factor inducible gene B, where it was shown to be required for receptor monomer binding to DNA (24Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). TR monomers also can bind DNA (6Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18915-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in general, nuclear receptors that can bind DNA as monomers contain an A helix. In contrast, steroid receptors do not bind DNA as monomers and do not contain an A helix. The A helix, which corresponds to our region C2, may be the most critical component of the C1C2 RNA-binding domain. Although C2 by itself is not capable of binding RNA, deletion of C2 resulted in the loss of ∼75% of RNA binding in TRα1 (Figs. 2 and 5A). In contrast, deletion of C1 resulted in the loss of only ∼25% of RNA binding. Interestingly, all-helical structures have also been found in various other RNA-binding domains (27Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the α-helical nature of the A helix and possibly its charged character are critical for RNA binding of TR. In addition, we speculate that other nuclear receptors that contain A helix sequences also might be RNA-binding proteins. It is interesting to compare the sequence of the TR RNA-binding domain with the RNA-binding motifs of other RNA-binding proteins, such as SR, DEAD box, and ribonucleoproteinsS. There is no obvious strong sequence homology between C1C2 and these other proteins. However, C1C2 does appear to share some homology with DEAD box proteins, especially the DEAD box subfamily p72 and p68 (Fig. 8; Ref. 28Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). DEAD box proteins comprise a large family of RNA-binding proteins, some of which have helicase activity. They participate in many cellular events, including transcription, RNA splicing, nuclear export of RNA, translation, and RNA degradation (29Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). DEAD box proteins contain six short conserved motifs, but otherwise share very little sequence conservation. The limited homology between C1C2 and p68/p72 is most apparent around motif II, which classically participates in ATP binding but not substrate RNA binding. The significance of this homology is unclear. However, it is interesting to note that the p68/p72 proteins participate in transcriptional regulation; more specifically, they interact with estrogen receptor α, p160 coactivators, and SRA to enhance gene activation by estrogen (28Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a functional similarity between these DEAD box proteins and the TR C1C2 domain. Our transfection data strongly suggest that SRA is an RNA coactivator for TRs as well as steroid receptors. However, the mechanism of coactivation seems to differ, in that steroid receptors do not interact directly with SRA (15Lanz R.B. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Albrecht U. Wong J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). We found that deletion of the C2 portion of the TR RNA-binding domain severely impaired but did not abolish the ability of SRA to function as a TR coactivator. This might simply reflect the fact that TRα1ΔC2 retains ∼25% of wild-type RNA binding by in vitro assay, or it could suggest that SRA has an additional mechanism of action with TRs, such as the indirect effect through SRA-p160 protein interactions that seems to apply to steroid receptors. We were unable to interpret cotransfection data with the full RNA-binding domain deletion TRα1ΔC1C2, as this protein was completely non-functional (data not shown), suggesting that it is deficient as a TR for reasons unrelated to SRA. In any case, the mechanism(s) by which TR-SRA interactions enhance the transcriptional activity of T3 are not known. Because SRA interacts with the RNA-binding DEAD box proteins p72/p68 as well as SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1 to enhance estrogen receptor α transactivation, SRA coactivation of TRs also might involve the formation of a complex with additional RNA-binding proteins. As is typical of many RNA-binding proteins (23Lalli E. Ohe K. Hindelang C. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), in vitro binding studies indicate that TRs bind RNA in a relatively promiscuous manner. Thus, homopolymers of poly(C), (U), or (G) all compete with the [32P]RNA probe, although poly(A) does not. An important question is how to resolve these data with the presumed need for TRs (or other RNA-binding proteins) to bind specific RNA molecules. Perhaps the RNA-binding specificity of TRs is controlled primarily by their location within the cell and the overall protein context of the TR ribonucleoprotein complex. However, it is possible that subtle preferences for binding to specific RNA sequences become important in vivo. The selection and characterization of RNAs that bind TRs with high affinity from a random sequence RNA pool could shed light on this question. In addition, it is plausible that TRs have important functional interactions with RNAs other than SRA. For example, although TRs are almost entirely nuclear, they do shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (30Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins include hnRNPs and other RNA-binding proteins (31Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). In addition, the TRα primary transcript is subject to alternative splicing, and it is interesting to consider that TR proteins might regulate TR RNA splicing as part of a ribonucleoprotein spliceosome complex.

Here we characterized the F1395S mutant of the nNOS flavoprotein domain (nNOSr) regarding its physical properties, NADP+ binding characteristics, flavin reduction kinetics, steady-state and pre-steady-state cytochrome c reduction kinetics, and ability to shield its FMN cofactor in response to CaM or NADP(H) binding. F1395S nNOSr bound NADP+ with 65% more of the nicotinamide ring in a productive conformation with FAD for hydride transfer and had an 8-fold slower rate of NADP+ dissociation. CaM stimulated the rates of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction in wild-type nNOSr but not in the F1395S mutant, which had flavin reduction kinetics similar to those of CaM-free wild-type nNOSr. CaM-free F1395S nNOSr lacked repression of cytochrome c reductase activity that is typically observed in nNOSr. The combined results from pre-steady-state and EPR experiments revealed that this was associated with a lesser degree of FMN shielding in the NADP+-bound state as compared with wild type. We conclude that Phe1395 regulates nNOSr catalysis in two ways. It facilitates NADP+ release to prevent this step from being rate-limiting, and it enables NADP(H) to properly regulate a conformational equilibrium involving the FMN subdomain that controls reactivity of the FMN cofactor in electron transfer.

In the NOS polypeptide, an N-terminal oxygenase domain is linked to a C-terminal reductase domain by a calmodulin (CaM)-binding sequence. The NOS oxygenase domain contains binding sites for iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), (6R)-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B), and l-Arg and is the site where oxidative catalysis takes place. The NOS reductase domain (NOSr) contains binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH and functions to transfer reducing equivalents from NADPH to the oxygenase domain.NOSr belongs to a small family of structurally related dual-flavin reductases that also includes cytochrome P450 reductase (CYPR) (7Bredt D.S.

These proteins are comprised of separate FMN and FAD/NADPH modules attached by a flexible hinge region (11Kim J.J.P. Wang M. Roberts D. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S.

It is believed that these reductases are the product of gene fusion because their FMN and FAD/NADPH subdomains show a high similarity to flavodoxins (13Watenpaugh D.K. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and ferredoxin NADP+ reductases (FNR) (14Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), respectively. In NOSr and related flavoproteins, the FAD receives electrons from NADPH via hydride transfer and then sequentially passes the electrons to the FMN cofactor. Ultimately, it is the 2-electron reduced FMN hydroquinone that transfers an electron to the ferric heme in the NOS oxygenase domain (15Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B.C. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This electron transfer allows the heme to bind dioxygen and initiate its reductive activation in conjunction with H4B as is required for NO synthesis (16Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The FMN hydroquinone in NOSr can also reduce external electron acceptors such as cytochrome c (17Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this activity is widely used as a tool to study electron transfer by NOSr. The binding of CaM to NOS elicits responses in the enzyme that include activation of the ferric heme reduction (18Abu-Soud H.M.

The rate of ferric heme reduction by NOSr is very important because it and the rates of ferric heme-NO dissociation and ferrous heme-NO oxidation are the three key kinetic parameters identified by this laboratory that define the characteristics of NO release by any given NOS (20Stuehr D.J.

Although these studies serve as a guide, it is important to appreciate that in NOSr there are additional complexities that do not exist in related flavoproteins. For example, rates of NOSr electron transfer reactions are repressed relative to most other related flavoproteins, but this repression is relieved upon CaM binding (27Stuehr D.J. Ghosh S. Mayer B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 143. Springer, New York2000: 33-70Google Scholar). Studies of NOSr and its unique regulatory elements typically utilize purified NOSr domains constructed to include their adjacent CaM-binding motifs so that the native electron transfer and CaM-response profiles of the proteins are retained (28Gachhui R.

Although their mechanisms of action remain speculative, these elements are thought to act in concert to positively and negatively regulate electron transfer by NOSr.This laboratory recently reported that Phe1395 in rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) is also involved in regulation (48Adak S. Sharma M. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13516-13521Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phe1395 is representative of a conserved group of aromatic amino acids that shield the re face of the FAD isoalloxazine ring in NOS, related flavoproteins, and simpler FNR proteins (12Zhang J.

The aromatic side chains of these shielding residues must move away from the FAD isoalloxazine ring to allow a productive binding interaction with the nicotinamide ring of NADPH that is essential for hydride transfer to FAD (12Zhang J.

In addition to an influence on NADPH binding specificity, we found that the aromatic side chain of Phe1395 was needed to repress electron transfer in CaM-free nNOS and to fully relieve the repression upon CaM binding (48Adak S. Sharma M. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13516-13521Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The unexpected significance of Phe1395 prompted us to study our most interesting mutation, F1395S, in the isolated nNOSr in order to understand better how Phe1395 helps regulate electron transfer and catalysis by nNOS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Methods and Materials—UV-visible spectra and steady-state kinetic data were obtained by using a Hitachi U-2000 or Cary 100 Bio-spectrophotometer. Single wavelength stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed by using a Hi-Tech (Salisbury, UK) SF-51MX instrument equipped for anaerobic work and photomultiplier detection. Full spectra stopped-flow experiments were performed by using a Hi-Tech SF-61 instrument equipped for anaerobic work and rapid-scanning diode array detection. Data from multiple identical stopped-flow experiments were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and fit to exponential functions using software (IS-2) provided by the instrument manufacturer. The buffer used for all experiments and protein purifications (Buffer A), unless noted otherwise, contained 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl. Samples were made anaerobic when necessary by repeated cycling of vacuum followed by a positive pressure of catalyst-deoxygenated nitrogen in an airtight anaerobic cuvette or by the addition of glucose oxidase (10 units/ml), catalase (134 units/ml), and glucose (2–3 mm) to the sample. Larger volumes of buffer were made anaerobic by extended bubbling of catalyst-deoxygenated nitrogen through the liquid. Wild-type nNOSr was prepared for use by oxidizing the purified air-stable semiquinone form with potassium ferricyanide followed by passing the mixture through a PD-10 desalting column. F1395S nNOSr was prepared for use by briefly incubating with 1 mm 2′-AMP and passing the mixture through a PD-10 column, unless noted otherwise. The concentration of nNOSr samples was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 22,900 m–1 cm–1 at 457 nm for the fully oxidized form (29Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Graphing of all data and curve fitting of data not obtained in stopped-flow experiments was done by using Origin software. Human CaM was expressed with the pACYC plasmid in Escherichia coli and purified with standard procedures utilizing phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. 5-Deazariboflavin, prepared using the method of Yoneda and co-workers (51Nagamatsu T. Hashiguchi Y. Yoneda F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1984; 1: 561-565Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 52Chen X. Tanaka K. Yoneda F. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 612-615Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), was obtained as a gift from Dr. John K. Hurley (University of Arizona). PD-10 desalting columns, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, and CaM-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. NADPH was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification.Generation of Wild-type and F1395S nNOSr Proteins—The wild-type rat nNOSr construct (Met695 to Ser1429) was created by using a PCR-based method with primer 1 (AGATTCCATATGCTCAACTATAGACTCACC) that inserted an NdeI site adjacent to the translation start site at Met695 and primer 2 (CCCCCACGCAGAACACATCACAG). The PCR product fragment so generated and pCWori vector containing full-length rat nNOS DNA were both digested with NdeI and SphI, and the resulting 256-bp PCR fragment was cloned into the double-digested pCWori/nNOS vector at these restriction sites.For the F1395S mutant, rat nNOSr cDNA was inserted into the pCWori vector by using its 5′ NdeI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites. The F1395S substitution in the nNOSr cDNA was engineered by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment from pCWori/nNOSr with a 5′-oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation. This mutated nNOS cDNA fragment, coding from the KpnI unique restriction site at position 4170 to the XbaI restriction site at position 4441, was amplified using the following primers: F1395S forward primer, AACGGTACCACGAGGACATCTCTGGAGTCACCCTCAGAACG; F1395S reverse primer, AAATCTAGAAGGACCAGGACACAGCAACAGGACAAG. The restriction sites are indicated by underlines, and the mutation site is denoted with boldface. The PCR product and wild-type pCWori/nNOSr were digested by both KpnI and XbaI restriction enzymes. The double-digested fragment of wild-type pCWori/nNOSr was replaced with the double-digested PCR fragment to generate the recombinant plasmid. After DNA sequencing to confirm the desired results, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the nNOSr plasmids and selected with ampicillin for protein expression. When applicable, the cells were also transformed with a pACYC plasmid containing human CaM and selected with chloramphenicol.Protein Expression and Purification—The nNOSr proteins and CaM (when present) were expressed in E. coli. The cells were lysed and centrifuged, and the protein was precipitated from the supernatant with ammonium sulfate in the presence of CaCl2 using a procedure described previously (53Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resulting protein pellets were resuspended in Buffer A containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A plus β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm), FAD (2 μm), FMN (2 μm), and EDTA (0.5 mm) when necessary to remove the co-expressed CaM. The bound protein was washed extensively with the equilibration buffer and then eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm NADPH. The eluted protein sample was immediately brought to a final concentration of 2 mm CaCl2 and applied to a column of CaM-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with Buffer A plus 2 mm CaCl2. The bound protein was washed extensively with the equilibration buffer and then eluted with Buffer A containing 3 mm EGTA. The resulting protein sample was concentrated and stored frozen in aliquots at –80 °C. The flavin content of the nNOSr proteins was obtained by boiling a known amount of nNOSr protein for 3 min followed by centrifugation and determination of the flavin concentration in the supernatant by using an extinction coefficient of 12.2 mm–1 cm–1 at 447 nm.Steady-state Cytochrome c Reduction Assays—Cytochrome c reductase activities of the nNOSr proteins were determined by using an assay procedure as described previously (53Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) without the addition of superoxide dismutase or catalase.Interaction between the nNOSr Proteins and NADP+—UV-visible spectral changes resulting from the association of NADP+ with 20 μm nNOSr proteins were observed by calculating a difference spectrum between the proteins in solution and the same protein sample after treatment with a 3-fold excess of NADP+. Determination of NADP+ apparent dissociation constant (Kd) values was done by titrating the nNOSr proteins (20 μm) with aliquots of a known concentration of NADP+ and recording the visible spectrum after a short (3–4 min) equilibration time at 20 °C. Mathematical determination of the Kd values was attempted by plotting Δ(A510 nm – A700 nm) versus NADP+ concentration for each titration point and fitting the data by using nonlinear regression analysis to the protein-ligand complex model developed by Wang et al. (54Wang Z.X. Kumar N.R. Srivastava D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rate constant (koff) values for the dissociation of NADP+ from the oxidized nNOSr proteins were determined by rapidly mixing a solution containing nNOSr (30–40 μm) and NADP+ (100 μm) with a solution of 2′,5′-ADP (4 mm) in the stopped-flow instrument at 10 or 23 °C and fitting the absorbance decreases at 510 nm to single exponential functions.Anaerobic Equilibrium Photoreduction—The nNOSr protein samples with and without a saturating amount of NADP+ (based on Fig. 2) were diluted in Buffer A containing a final concentration of 3 mm EDTA and a catalytic amount of 5-deazariboflavin with care taken to shield the sample from ambient light. Each titration point was obtained by illuminating the sample with a commercial slide projector bulb for a fixed length of time (3–10 s) and then acquiring a visible spectrum after a 2–3-min equilibration. The titration was complete when further irradiation of the sample produced no additional absorbance changes. Reduction of F1395S nNOSr in the presence of NADP+ yielded a stable reduced nNOSr-NADP+ charge transfer complex. The extinction coefficient of this complex (1200 m–1 cm–1 at 700 nm) was estimated from a 25 μm sample of F1395S nNOSr protein that gave ΔA700 = 0.030 at the end of the titration (1-cm cuvette).Anaerobic Stopped-flow Flavin Reduction Kinetics—The absorbance changes associated with nNOSr flavin reduction by NADPH were recorded by rapidly mixing a solution of oxidized nNOSr (6–10 μm) containing either EDTA (1 mm) or CaCl2 (2 mm) + CaM (18–24 μm) with a solution of 60–100 μm NADPH (excess NADPH) or a single molar equivalent of NADPH at 10 °C in the stopped-flow instrument. The maximum absorbance value for a given protein sample at 457 nm during single wavelength experiments was obtained by replacing the NADPH solution in one of the stopped-flow syringes with buffer only and recording additional mixing events. The individual rate constants associated with absorbance changes at 457 nm were first estimated by analysis of experiments of varying lengths. The final reported values were obtained by fitting an experiment on a time scale capturing all four rate constants to a quadruple exponential function such that the residuals were minimized and contained little or no systematic deviation between the fit curve and the actual data. Percent absorbance changes were calculated based on the percent absorbance change in the instrument dead time and the relative proportions of the Δ A values for each kinetic phase obtained from the fitting program. Analysis of absorbance changes observed at 600 nm and correlation of these data with rapid-scanning stopped-flow diode array spectra were done as described (see “Results”).Anaerobic Pre-steady-state Cytochrome c Reduction—A solution of nNOSr (16 μm), glycine (3 mm), 5-deazariboflavin (catalytic), and either EDTA (1 mm) or CaCl2 (2 mm) + CaM (30 μm) was completely photoreduced in an anaerobic cuvette by using a commercial slide projector bulb until no changes in the UV-visible spectrum of the sample were observed upon further irradiation of the sample. The pre-reduced protein sample was rapidly mixed with a solution of cytochrome c (4 μm) at 10 °C, and the absorbance changes at 550 nm were recorded. In some cases 1 mm NADPH was added to the pre-reduced protein sample, and the mixture was incubated at 10 °C for at least 15 min prior to mixing. Absorbance data were fit to a single exponential function.Oxidation of Reduced F1395S nNOSr—A solution of F1395S nNOSr protein (8 μm) containing either EDTA (1 mm) or CaCl2 (2 mm) + CaM (20 μm) in air-saturated buffer was reduced by adding NADPH (160 μm) and then allowed to autoxidize at room temperature in an open cuvette while following the process at 457 nm and recording visible spectra at the indicated time points during the experiment (see “Results”).Preparation of EPR Samples—All EPR experiments were carried out in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, with 25% glycerol (v/v). The nNOS protein concentrations used were 40–60 μm. The dysprosium(III) complex with HEDTA (Dy(III)-HEDTA) was prepared by chelating DyCl3·6H2O with an excess (5:4) of HEDTA in the same buffer as the nNOS samples. The nNOS samples were prepared in the presence or absence of CaM (Sigma) with different concentrations of Dy(III)-HEDTA. The full-length nNOS samples contained 1 mmNω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and H4B with a molar ratio of 2:1 H4B to nNOS. For all samples containing CaM, the molar ratio of CaM to nNOS was 2:1, and the Ca2+ concentration was 1–2 mm. Protein samples were treated with NADPH followed by air oxidation to generate the flavin semiquinone radical and then transferred to sealed EPR tubes. Sperm whale myoglobin (MbNO) was prepared as described previously (55Innes J.B. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and used as a reference.EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded at 35 K using a Varian E-9 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 flowing helium cryostat. The microwave frequency was 9.28 GHz, modulation amplitude was 4 G at 100 kHz, and the field center was set as 3300 G. Microwave power saturation data were plotted and fit to the following empirical equation as described by Rupp et al. (56Rupp H. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 537: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar):S=KP12/(1+P/P12)0.5b(Eq. 1) where S is the signal height; K is a proportionality factor; P is the microwave power; P ½ is the power required for half-saturation; and b is the inhomogeneity parameter which was set at 1 in this case (55Innes J.B. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).RESULTSProtein Expression and Purification—Given recent data contradicting the effects of CaM on flavin reduction kinetics (31Knight K. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 19-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), special consideration was given to the protein expression and purification methods used in this work. Proteolytic degradation of the CaM-binding site in nNOSr is often observed during its expression and purification (28Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. AbuSoud H.M. McArt"
https://openalex.org/W2167290692,"The molecular events associated with acute and chronic exposure of mesangial cells (MC) to hyperglycemia were evaluated. We found that, unlike high glucose (HG) and Amadori adducts, advanced glycation end products (AGE) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induced p21waf expression and accumulation of MC in G0/G1. TGF-beta1 blockade inhibited AGE-mediated collagen production but only partially affected AGE-induced p21waf expression and cell-cycle events, indicating that AGE by binding to AGE receptor (RAGE) per se could control MC growth. Moreover, AGE and TGF-beta treatment led to the activation of the signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT)5 and the formation of a STAT5/p21SIE2 complex. The role of STAT5 in AGE- and TGF-beta-mediated p21waf expression and growth arrest, but not collagen production, was confirmed by the expression of the dominant negative STAT5 (DeltaSTAT5) or the constitutively activated STAT5 (1*6-STAT5) constructs. Finally, in p21waf-/- fibroblasts both AGE and TGF-beta failed to inhibit cell-cycle progression. A potential in vivo role of these mechanisms was sustained by the increasing immunoreactivity for the activated STAT5 and p21(waf) in kidney biopsies from early to advanced stage of diabetic nephropathy. Our data indicate that AGE- and TGF-beta-mediated signals, by converging on STAT5 activation and p21waf expression, may regulate MC growth."

Hsp104 is a member of the Hsp100/Clp family of proteins, itself a subset within the AAA+ family.

The AAA+ module consists of two domains. The first domain is a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FFL, firefly luciferase; SD, small domain; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; WT, wild type. that adopts an α/β Rossman fold. The second is a small domain (SD) mostly α-helical in character. The crystal structures of assembled, hexameric molecules also reveal how the SD contributes to the assembly of AAA+ proteins and the coordination of nucleotide-induced structural changes within the assembled AAA+ ring; the small domain contacts both the NBD within the AAA+ module and the NBD of an adjacent protomer in the assembled ring contributing residues to binding of nucleotide in both NBDs simultaneously. The biochemical properties and biological functions of Hsp104 have been probed by the introduction of amino acid substitutions in conserved residues involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Amino acid substitutions in the first and second NBDs of two AAA+ modules of the Hsp104 have distinct structural and functional consequences (18Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Substitutions in the Walker A or P-loop motif (GX4GKT) of the first NBD (K218T or G217V) dramatically impair Hsp104 ATPase activity without affecting assembly. In contrast, substitutions in the second Walker A motif (K620T or G619V) impair oligomerization as well as ATPase activity (18Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In each case, these amino acid substitutions disrupt both thermotolerance and prion propagation. Thus far there has been only one demonstration of an in vitro interaction between Hsp104 and a bona fide substrate (Sup35) (21Schirmer E.C. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because a robust method of detecting a direct interaction between Hsp104 and substrates was not available, we developed an in vivo visual screen to investigate this process. We based our screening procedure on the ability of Hsp104 to localize to the periphery of heat shock-induced aggregates in vivo (22Kawai R. Fujita K. Iwahashi H. Komatsu Y. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 46-53PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fujita K. Kawai R. Iwahashi H. Komatsu Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the identification of mutant Hsp104 molecules that failed to localize in this manner would yield insight into the mechanism of substrate recognition by Hsp104. To probe the role of the C terminus of Hsp104 in substrate recognition, we introduced random amino acid substitutions into the second AAA+ module of Hsp104. Hsp104 variants that failed to redistribute in living cells following heat shock also failed to oligomerize and either contained multiple amino acid substitutions, including the introduction of polar residues in conserved hydrophobic positions, or were truncated by nonsense codons that eliminated the SD. The presence of multiple substitutions was required for these characteristics because proteins engineered to contain only single substitutions oligomerized and refolded proteins in vivo and in vitro. Three derivatives of Hsp104 that functioned well in prion propagation and low temperature stress tolerance failed to confer high temperature survival. We found that these had a conditional defect that was temperature-dependent and resulted in a decreased solubility of these proteins in vivo at high temperature. Rather than interacting directly with substrates, as has been suggested (24Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Cashikar A.G. Schirmer E.C. Hattendorf D.A. Glover J.R. Ramakrishnan M.S. Ware D.M. Lindquist S.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), our analysis indicates that the second AAA+ module of Hsp104 contributes to substrate recognition by stabilizing the oligomeric structure of Hsp104. Yeast Strains—W303Δ104 (MATa, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1, his3-11, his3-15, ade2-1, can1-100, hsp104::HIS3) was created by replacing the HSP104 open reading frame with a PCR-amplified cassette containing the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS3 gene (26Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and was used for immunofluorescence studies. YPH499Δ104 (MATa ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, hsp104::LEU2) (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for direct fluorescence microcopy, stress tolerance determinations, and in vivo luciferase refolding assays. For analysis of the interaction between HSP104 alleles and the yeast prion [PSI+], GT81-1C (28Chernoff Y.O. Newnam G.P. Kumar J. Allen K. Zink A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8103-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) ([PSI+] MATa ade1-14, his3-Δ200, leu2-3, lys2, trp1-Δ, ura3-52) and GT234 (29Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D.

DNA Methods—A DNA segment encoding amino acids 710–908 of Hsp104 and including 116 bp of the 3′-untranslated region was inserted into pBluescript II SK+ as an SpeI/SacI fragment and used as a template for error-prone PCR (30Lin-Goerke J.L. Robbins D.J. Burczak J.D. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using the T3 and T7 promoter primers. The PCR product was digested with SpeI/SacI and used to replace the corresponding fragment of a fusion between GFP and a modified Hsp104 open reading frame (HSP104R) (31Schirmer E.C. Lindquist S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) under the control of the Gal1-10 promoter in a pRS313 backbone (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α), and library DNA was prepared from ∼3000 colonies. To remove the GFP coding region, plasmids were digested with BamHI and closed using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Rescued DNA was sequenced with a primer (5′-CGATGAAGTAGAAAAGGCACATC-3′) by dye termination at The Centre for Applied Genomics DNA Sequencing Facility (Hospital for Sick Children). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Point mutations were inserted into the genome of GT234 by a pop-in/pop-out strategy (32Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Integration of mutant sequences was confirmed by colony PCR. Fluorescence Microscopy Techniques and Visual Screen—Library DNA was transformed into yeast strain YPH499Δ104. Individual colonies were grown to saturation in 2% glucose minimal synthetic media (SD) lacking histidine and diluted in media supplemented with 2% galactose and 0.1% glucose (SGD) for growth to mid-log phase (∼2 × 106 cells/ml) at 30 °C. Live cells from each strain were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with a standard fluorescein filter set and a ×100 1.4 NA objective. Images were recorded with a SPOT junior CCD camera (Diagnostics Instruments, Inc). Cells were re-imaged immediately after a 1-h heat shock at 37 °C. For localization of unfused Hsp104, W303Δ104 was transformed with CEN/ARS plasmids directing the expression of Hsp104WT, Hsp104K218T, and Hsp104K620T under the control of a copper-inducible promoter (33Santoro N. Johansson N. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6340-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prior to heat shock, mid-log phase cultures were induced for 1 h with 10 μm copper sulfate and sampled for immunofluorescence before heat shock and after 30 min at 37 °C. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using standard techniques (34Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal α-Hsp104 antibody at 1:5000. Stress Tolerance—Yeast were grown to saturation in SD lacking histidine and diluted in SGD lacking histidine for growth to mid-log phase. For thermotolerance, after a heat shock of 37 °C for 1 h, 1 ml of the culture was transferred to sterile glass tubes warmed to 50 °C in a water bath. For multistress tolerance, induced cultures were pretreated at 37 °C for 30 min and then exposed to a temperature of 40 °C and 6% (v/v) ethanol (3Lindquist S. Patino M.M. Chernoff Y.O. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Liebman S.W. Lee K.H. Blake T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In both cases, aliquots of cells were removed at various time points and serially diluted in 5-fold steps in YPD in a 96-well plate. A pin replicator was used to transfer cells to YPD agar. Cell survival was assessed after incubation at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Polyclonal Anti-Hsp104 Antibody—To minimize variability in detection of Hsp104 molecules as a result of altering or deleting epitopes, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with full-length recombinant H6-Hsp104. The specificity of the immune serum was assessed by Western blotting yeast lysates prepared from wild type and hsp104 mutant yeast and by immunofluorescence microscopy of the same strains. For Western blot analysis, 10 μg of protein from glass bead lysates was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. Hsp104 antiserum was used at a 1:150,000 dilution. Immunocomplexes were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (AP Biotech) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (AP Biotech). Protein Purification—DNAs encoding full-length Hsp104 and the mutagenized variants were subcloned into a modified pPROEX-HT-b (Invitrogen) vector, as BamHI/SacI fragments, and transformed into BL21 codon plus (Stratagene). Polyhistidine-tagged Hsp104 was isolated by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). Following tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) cleavage of the tag, the protein was re-applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid. The unbound (cleaved) fraction was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and frozen at –80 °C. Recombinant Ydj1 purification was performed as described previously (35Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Hsp70 was purified by anion exchange chromatography and ATP-agarose as described elsewhere. 2Mosser, D. D., Ho, S., and Glover, J. R. (2004) Biochemistry43, 8107–8115. Analytical Gel Filtration—Gel filtration analysis was carried out as described previously (19Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the KCl concentration of the elution buffer was reduced from 200 to 50 mm. The protein content of each fraction was determined by a protein microassay (Bio-Rad). Refolding Assays—Refolding assays were conducted on pre-aggregated substrate proteins that are efficiently refolded only in the presence of Hsp104 (35Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (FFL; Promega) was denatured in refolding buffer (RFB) (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 8 m urea for 30 min at 30 °C. The unfolded protein was rapidly dispersed 1:100 into ice-cold refolding buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min, and aliquoted into pre-cooled tubes, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen, aggregated FFL was thawed on ice immediately before use. Refolding reactions contained refolding buffer, 5 mm ATP, an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.02 units of phosphocreatine kinase, 2.5 μm each of Hsp104, recombinant human Hsp70, and recombinant yeast Ydj1. After 90 min of refolding at 25 °C, duplicate 1-μl aliquots were dispersed into luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and light emission was recorded in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, EG & G Berthold). β-Galactosidase was prepared in essentially the same manner. The activity of refolded β-galactosidase was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as the substrate (36Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For ex vivo refolding experiments, control (nonheat-shocked) and heat-shocked cells (37 °C 1 h, 50 °C 15 min) were disrupted by glass beads in refolding buffer containing protease inhibitors. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The extract was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. 100 μg of the 100,000 × g supernatant was used in FFL refolding assays. For the heat-treated lysates, separate refolding reactions were supplemented with 5 μg of purified Hsp104. For in vivo FFL refolding, FFL cDNA with a defective peroxisomal targeting signal (37Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) was inserted into p426GPD (38Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) for expression in yeast. Cells were grown to saturation in SD lacking histidine and uracil and diluted for re-growth to midlog phase in SGD lacking histidine and uracil. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml immediately before FFL inactivation at 44 °C for 20 min or 50 °C for 5 min. Cultures were permitted to recover at 25 °C. FFL activity was determined as described (37Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) by the addition of 0.5 mm d-luciferin (Sigma) to equal numbers of intact cells immediately before heat shock, immediately after heat shock, and at indicated intervals during recovery. ATPase Assays—2.5 μg protein was added to ice-cold XLB (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were incubated at the indicated temperature for 5 min, and reactions were initiated by addition of ATP to 5 mm. Total reaction volumes were 25 μl. After 3–10 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of Malachite Green. All activities were determined through the linear range of ATP hydrolysis and background subtracted for phosphate present in reactions containing ATP alone. For kinetic analysis 25 μl of ATP was added to 2 μg of protein in 25 μl of XLB20 (XLB with 20 mm KCl instead of 200 mm) to initiate the reaction. All solutions were warmed to 25 °C. Co-aggregation Assays—2 μg of purified protein was added to RFB with (+lysate) or without (–lysate) 100 μg of a crude (16,000 × g supernatant) yeast lysate from a strain deleted for HSP104. All reactions contained ATP at a final concentration of 5 mm and had a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated on ice for 5 min, shifted to 50 °C for 10 min, and cooled on ice for 5 min. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Equivalent amounts of the supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were Coomassie-stained (–lysate) or transferred to PVDF for Western blotting with anti-Hsp104 antibodies (+lysate). Subcellular Redistribution of Hsp104 in Response to Heat Shock—The accumulation of Hsp104 around the periphery of heat-induced aggregates has been observed previously by using immunoelectron microscopy (22Kawai R. Fujita K. Iwahashi H. Komatsu Y. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 46-53PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fujita K. Kawai R. Iwahashi H. Komatsu Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By using indirect immunofluorescence, we first tested whether a change in Hsp104 localization could be observed at the level of light microscopy. Because Hsp104 expression is barely detectable in unstressed cells, wild type Hsp104 and two Hsp104 mutants with amino acid substitutions in each of the two NBDs for Hsp104, Hsp104K218T and Hsp104K620T, were expressed in an hsp104 deletion strain under the control of a copper-inducible promoter (33Santoro N. Johansson N. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6340-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In all nonstressed cells Hsp104 was diffusely distributed (Fig. 1A). After heat shock, Hsp104WT formed 1–3 foci in most cells. In contrast, Hsp104K218T and Hsp104K620T formed numerous bright foci. To facilitate a visual screening procedure, we examined the subcellular distribution of Hsp104 with GFP fused to its N terminus. GFP-tagged Hsp104 complemented the survival defect of an Δhsp104 yeast strain exposed to combined heat shock and ethanol stresses (40 °C and 6% ethanol) but not a high temperature (50 °C) treatment (data not shown). GFP itself remained diffuse after a mild heat shock at 37 °C, whereas the GFP-Hsp104 fusion protein formed a few concentrated foci comparable with those observed for the unmodified wild type Hsp104 by immunofluorescence produced under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). A library of plasmids encoding GFP-Hsp104 fusion proteins with random mutations in the C-terminal region of Hsp104 was generated by error-prone PCR and transformed into a yeast strain deleted for HSP104. In a screen of 400 individual transformants, we identified 20 clones that remained diffuse after heat shock (Fig. 1C). Sequencing the mutagenized segment of HSP104 DNA revealed the existence of multiple base substitutions predicted to result in 2–7 amino acid substitutions per clone, and in some cases nonsense codons were detected (Table I). 3J. M. Tkach and J. R. Glover, unpublished results. Of the initial 20 clones we focused our attention on hsp104-27, hsp104-101, and hsp104-138 (Table I).Table IAmino acid substitutions in Hsp104–27, -101, and -138CloneAmino acid substitutionsHsp104-27S745P, F772S, E774TermHsp104-101K747R, L814S, L840Q, E878GHsp104-138I722T, F772S, K774E, L775P, L845I Open table in a new tab To gain insight into the contributions of individual amino acid substitutions to the targeting defect of the multiply substituted Hsp104 mutants, we studied five singly substituted proteins in detail; Hsp104I722T, Hsp104F772S, and Hsp104K774E were derived from hsp104–138 and Hsp104L814S and Hsp104L840Q were derived from hsp104–101. First we examined the subcellular distribution of the singly substituted proteins as GFP fusions before and after heat shock (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the multiply substituted parental clones, these proteins formed foci that resembled those formed by GFP-Hsp104WT (Fig. 1C). Thus the defect in heat-induced redistribution requires more than one substitution and could not be recapitulated by any single amino acid substitution we introduced into the wild type protein. Oligomerization of Hsp104 Mutants—We reasoned that amino acid substitutions could interfere with substrate binding directly, by perturbing a substrate-binding site, or indirectly, by preventing the proper folding and assembly of Hsp104. To differentiate between these possibilities, we undertook an analysis of Hsp104 assembly by gel filtration using purified recombinant proteins expressed without the GFP fusion domain used in the initial screening procedure. Previously, Hsp104 oligomerization was analyzed by using stringent, high ionic strength buffers (140–200 mm KCl) (18Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that enabled the detection of gross oligomerization defects. To increase our ability to detect subtle oligomerization differences between Hsp104 molecules, we used a low ionic strength buffer (50 mm KCl). Under these conditions, Hsp104WT was partially assembled in absence of nucleotide and completely assembled into hexamers in the presence of nucleotide (Fig. 2). The multiply substituted proteins, Hsp104–101 and Hsp104–138 and the truncated protein Hsp104–27 were unassembled in the absence of nucleotide and did not respond to the presence of nucleotide in the elution buffer. For comparison with other singly substituted proteins, we incorporated into our analysis an Hsp104 derivative with a Walker A lysine substitution in NBD2, Hsp104K620T, that is defective in nucleotide-dependent assembly (19Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under our conditions, Hsp104K620T assembled into hexamers with a shoulder of lower molecular weight species in the presence of ATP. The elution profiles obtained for Hsp104F772S and Hsp104K774E most closely resembled this pattern. Hsp104I722T was indistinguishable from the wild type protein (data not shown). Hsp104L814S and Hsp104L840Q were almost completely assembled with a smaller shoulder of incompletely assembled species. Thus, although the point mutants have assembly defects, they still retain some ability to assemble. ATPase and in Vitro Protein Refolding Activities of Hsp104 Mutants—We next analyzed the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104WT and the singly substituted derivatives (Table II). The ATPase activities of the multiply substituted and truncated Hsp104 derivatives were too low to obtain reliable kinetic parameters. For the wild type protein we obtained a Km of 120 μm. Although there are slight differences in buffer composition and assay temperature, our data agree with the published kinetic constants for NBD1 of Hsp104 (39Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002;"
https://openalex.org/W2150472047,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is the ligand for a family of specific G protein-coupled receptors that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell motility. Because of the pivotal role of S1P, its levels are low and tightly regulated in a spatial-temporal manner through its synthesis catalyzed by sphingosine kinases and degradation by an S1P lyase and specific S1P phosphatases (SPP). Surprisingly, down-regulation of SPP-1 enhanced migration toward epidermal growth factor (EGF); conversely, overexpression of SPP-1, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, attenuated migration toward EGF. To determine whether the inhibitory effect on EGF-induced migration was because of decreased S1P or increased ceramide as a consequence of acylation of increased sphingosine by ceramide synthase, we used fumonisin B1, a specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase. Although fumonisin B1 blocked ceramide production and increased sphingosine, it did not reverse the negative effect of SPP-1 expression on EGF- or S1P-induced chemotaxis. EGF activated the epidermal growth factor receptor to the same extent in SPP-1-expressing cells, yet ERK1/2 activation was impaired. In agreement, PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK-activating enzyme MEK, decreased EGF-stimulated migration. We next examined the possibility that intracellularly generated S1P might be involved in activating a G protein-coupled S1P receptor important for EGF-directed migration. Treatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate Gαi suppressed EGF-induced migration. Moreover, expression of regulator of G protein signaling 3, which inhibits S1P receptor signaling and completely prevented ERK1/2 activation mediated by S1P receptors, not only reduced migration toward S1P but also markedly reduced migration toward EGF. Collectively, these results suggest that metabolism of S1P by SPP-1 is important for EGF-directed cell migration. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is the ligand for a family of specific G protein-coupled receptors that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell motility. Because of the pivotal role of S1P, its levels are low and tightly regulated in a spatial-temporal manner through its synthesis catalyzed by sphingosine kinases and degradation by an S1P lyase and specific S1P phosphatases (SPP). Surprisingly, down-regulation of SPP-1 enhanced migration toward epidermal growth factor (EGF); conversely, overexpression of SPP-1, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, attenuated migration toward EGF. To determine whether the inhibitory effect on EGF-induced migration was because of decreased S1P or increased ceramide as a consequence of acylation of increased sphingosine by ceramide synthase, we used fumonisin B1, a specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase. Although fumonisin B1 blocked ceramide production and increased sphingosine, it did not reverse the negative effect of SPP-1 expression on EGF- or S1P-induced chemotaxis. EGF activated the epidermal growth factor receptor to the same extent in SPP-1-expressing cells, yet ERK1/2 activation was impaired. In agreement, PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK-activating enzyme MEK, decreased EGF-stimulated migration. We next examined the possibility that intracellularly generated S1P might be involved in activating a G protein-coupled S1P receptor important for EGF-directed migration. Treatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate Gαi suppressed EGF-induced migration. Moreover, expression of regulator of G protein signaling 3, which inhibits S1P receptor signaling and completely prevented ERK1/2 activation mediated by S1P receptors, not only reduced migration toward S1P but also markedly reduced migration toward EGF. Collectively, these results suggest that metabolism of S1P by SPP-1 is important for EGF-directed cell migration.

In addition to its extracellular functions, S1P acts intracellularly to regulate cell survival (8Olivera A. Rosenfeldt H.M. Bektas M. Wang F. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Both belong to the family of type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPPs) (17Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 18Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) which are magnesium-independent, membrane-associated, and N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive. Although specific biological roles for the LPPs have not yet been established, the Drosophila gene wunen, which encodes a homologue of LPP1 and LPP2, negatively regulates primordial germ cell migration (19Starz-Gaiano M. Cho N.K. Forbes A. Lehmann R. Development. 2001; 128: 983-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); LPP3 mediates gastrulation and axis formation, probably by influencing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (20Escalante-Alcalde D. Hernandez L. Le Stunff H. Maeda R. Lee Jr., H.S. Gang C. Sciorra V.A. Daar I. Spiegel S. Morris A.J. Stewart C.L. Development. 2003; 130: 4623-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Except for the conserved residues within three domains present in the active sites of LPPs (17Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the two S1P phosphatases have little overall homology to other known LPPs and, in contrast to the broad specificity of the other LPPs (18Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), are specific sphingoid base phosphate phosphatases. Recently, it has been shown that SPP-1 and SPP-2 are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they degrade S1P to terminate its actions (13Johnson K.R. Johnson K.Y. Becker K.P. Mao C.

These findings have far reaching implications, because the ER also contains the enzymes of ceramide biosynthesis, and suggest an important role for SPP in the regulation of de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Indeed, we have recently found that SPP-1 functions in an unprecedented manner to up-regulate biosynthesis of long chain C16-ceramide (14Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (21Kroesen B.J. Pettus B. Luberto C.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in proliferation and migration of diverse cell types and cancers. These processes are mediated through binding to the EGF receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase activity, and the consequent regulation of various downstream targets (22Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 23Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to this study, many signaling events of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in diverse cell types transduced by potent lipids, such as LPA and S1P, are dependent on the function of the EGFR (24Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 25Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). EGFR transactivation is important for LPA-induced head and neck cancer cell proliferation and motility (26Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6329-6336PubMed Google Scholar). Because a recent study suggested that S1P also activates ERK1/2 by trans-activating EGFR (27Kim J.H. Song W.K. Chun J.S. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 119-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the role of SPP-1 in EGF-induced cell locomotion. We found that overexpression of SPP-1 abolished the chemotactic effect of EGF, and, conversely, knockdown of SPP-1 enhanced migratory responses to EGF. Our results suggest that intracellular metabolism of S1P may play an important role in EGF-directed chemotaxis. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences). S1P and fumonisin B1 (FB1) were from Biomol Research Laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingosine was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, PA). Serum and media were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). G418 and EGF were obtained from Invitrogen. Collagen type I was purchased from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). Polycarbonate filters were from Neuro Probe (Gaithersburg, MD). PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293, ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (28Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described (14Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were typically 90%. Non-clonal pools of HEK 293 cell stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 1 g/liter G418. SPP-1 expression was down-regulated with sequence-specific siRNA. siRNA for human SPP-1 (AGUGGCCCGUUUCCAGCGGdTT and CCGCUGGAAACGGGCCACUdTT) and control siRNA were synthesized at Xeragon-Qiagen. Cells (1.5 × 106) in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from HEK 293 cells using Trizol and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplification of a 574-bp fragment of hSPP-1 using PCR primers (5′-CTACTGCCTGTTCTGCTTCG and 5′-TGTGTCTCCTCGGGATGTG) was achieved with 30 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with 18 cycles (94 °C, 45 s; 65 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 1.5 min). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. S1P Phosphohydrolase Assay—S1P phosphohydrolase activity was determined by measuring the degradation of 32P-labeled S1P essentially as previously described (12Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thornton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped on ice with 1 ml of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing seven times and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. S1P phosphohydrolase activity is expressed as pmol of S1P degraded per min/mg of protein. To measure cellular S1P phosphohydrolase activity, HEK 293 cells (5 × 105) were permeabilized with 50 μm digitonin and incubated with [32P]S1P or [32P]phosphatidic acid (500,000 cpm, 1 μm). Loss of membrane integrity was determined by the inability of cells to exclude trypan blue (>95% when permeabilized with digitonin compared with <5% in untreated cells). Lipids were extracted from 1 ml of medium with 2.7 ml of methanol/CHCl3/HCl (100/200/2, v/v). 1.2 ml of 2 m KCl and 1.2 ml of CHCl3 were then added for phase separation. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in CHCl3/methanol (95/5, v/v). Lipids were separated by TLC and the remaining [32P]S1P quantified as described above. Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis was measured in a modified Boyden chamber using polycarbonate filters (25 × 80 mm, 12-μm pore size) coated with collagen type I (50 μg/ml in 5% acetic acid) as described previously (28Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Briefly, chemoattractants were added to the lower chamber, and cells (5 × 104/well) were added to the upper chamber. After the indicated times, non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were mechanically removed, and the cells that traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (VWR, Buffalo Grove, IL). Migratory cells were counted using a microscope with a ×10 objective. Each data point is the average number of cells in three random fields and is the mean ± S.D. of three individual wells. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min and incubated with 2 μg of anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (20 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated for an additional 1hat4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoblotting, equal amounts of lysate proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transblotted to nitrocellulose. Anti-EGF receptor polyclonal antibody and phospho-p38 and ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz), phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), p38, and phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and immunoreactive signals visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak BioMax film. SPP-1 Regulates Chemotaxis toward EGF—Similar to its effect on chemotaxis of many other cell types (29Spiegel S. English D. Milstien S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 236-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), low concentrations of S1P enhanced chemotaxis of HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1A). EGF also induced a dose-dependent increase in migration of HEK 293 cells, with an optimum effect at ∼100 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). As expected, the effect of EGF was completely abolished by AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the intrinsic EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, pertussis toxin, which ADP ribosylates and inactivates Gαi, decreased EGF-induced chemotaxis by almost 50% (Fig. 1B). Consistent with other studies (30Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R.

Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), migration toward S1P, but not fibronectin, was also inhibited by pertussis toxin (data not shown). These results suggest that EGF-directed migration of HEK 293 cells may involve, at least in part, activation of a Gi-coupled receptor. Recently, we reported that SPP-1 plays an important role in regulation of intracellular levels of S1P (14Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that although sphingosine kinase 1-generated S1P stimulates survival independently of S1PRs (8Olivera A. Rosenfeldt H.M. Bektas M. Wang F. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46452-46460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it can act in an autocrine manner to stimulate the S1P1 cell surface receptor and consequently regulate cytoskeleton rearrangement and focal adhesions (8Olivera A.

Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and chemotaxis (35Jolly P.S. Bektas M. Olivera A. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Proia R.L. Rivera J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This “inside-out” signaling by S1P, which can regulate pathways downstream of S1P1 receptors important for cell locomotion, prompted us to investigate the potential function of SPP-1 in chemotaxis. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of SPP-1 drastically reduced migration of HEK 293 cells not only toward S1P but also toward EGF and serum (Fig. 2A). In sharp contrast, IGF-1-stimulated migration was unaltered (Fig. 2B), suggesting that overexpression of SPP-1 does not disrupt all essential mechanisms of cellular locomotion. To better understand the physiological functions of SPP-1, we also examined the effect of down-regulating its expression with siRNA on migration toward EGF. In agreement with a recent report (13Johnson K.R. Johnson K.Y. Becker K.P. Mao C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34541-34547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), transfection with siRNA targeted to SPP-1, but not control siRNA, specifically reduced expression of SPP-1 as determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). Importantly, knockdown of SPP-1 markedly enhanced EGF-directed motility but did not influence chemotaxis toward serum or fibronectin (Fig. 3B). Role of Ceramide—Dephosphorylation of S1P to sphingosine by SPP-1 has been associated with a large increase of ceramide levels resulting mainly from acylation of increased sphingosine by ceramide synthase (14Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because ceramide inhibits signaling pathways downstream of the EGFR (36Auge N. Garcia V. Maupas-Schwalm F. Levade T. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Taupin D.R. Kinoshita K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the inhibitory action of SPP-1 on chemotaxis was mediated by changes in ceramide biosynthesis. To this end, we used FB1, a specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase. In agreement with our previous results (12Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thornton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), FB1 blocked ceramide production in SPP-1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A) and concomitantly increased sphingosine (Fig. 4B). It did not reverse the negative effect of SPP-1 expression on EGF- and S1P-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that, in fact, inhibition of chemotaxis by SPP-1 is not a result of ceramide or sphingosine accumulation but rather dephosphorylation of S1P. Moreover, treatment with FB1 did not influence migration of vector cells toward EGF yet somewhat reduced chemotaxis toward S1P (Fig. 4D). S1P Is Cleaved Intracellularly by SPP-1—Although SPP-1 is mainly localized in the ER (13Johnson K.R. Johnson K.Y. Becker K.P. Mao C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34541-34547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is possible that similar to other LPPs (38Brindley D.N. English D. Pilquil C. Buri K. Ling Z.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) a small fraction could also be localized to the plasma membrane where it might act as an ecto-S1P phosphatase. To examine this possibility, we permeabilized the plasma membrane of cells expressing SPP-1 with digitonin, an approach developed by Brindley and co-workers (39Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C.

J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to determine ectophosphatase activity of the LPPs. If exogenous S1P were cleaved at the plasma membrane by ectophosphatase activity of SPP-1, then its rate of hydrolysis by cells overexpressing SPP-1 would be independent of permeabilization, as was shown to be the case for LPA hydrolysis by cells overexpressing LPP1 (39Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast to LPP1, we found that when HEK 293 cells expressing SPP-1 were incubated with [32P]S1P there was no detectable hydrolysis over a 20-min period as long as cell integrity was maintained (Fig. 5A). However, when the plasma membrane was permeabilized with digitonin, S1P was rapidly dephosphorylated by SPP-1 transfectants compared with vector-transfected cells and almost completely disappeared within 20 min (Fig. 5B). In agreement with the substrate specificity of SPP-1 determined in vitro (14Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), HEK 293 cells overexpressing SPP-1 and permeabilized with digitonin failed to cleave non-sphingoid base phospholipids, such as [32P]phosphatidic acid (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that SPP-1 is unable to cleave S1P at the plasma membrane and is active only when S1P is produced inside the cells or transported there. SPP-1 Expression Does Not Abrogate EGF-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of EGFR yet Inhibits ERK Activation—Because SPP-1 expression potently inhibited migration toward EGF, it was possible that this was caused by either reduction in EGFR expression, interference with activation of the EGFR, and/or inhibition of its downstream signaling. However, no significant changes in EGFR expression were detected in cells transfected with SPP-1 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR to the same extent in vector and SPP-1 transfectants (Fig. 6A). We noticed, however, that expression of SPP-1 decreased levels of two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 42 and 44 kDa, likely phospho-ERK1/2. Previous studies suggest that S1P activates the EGFR through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway that links Ras signaling to the activation of ERK1/2 in Rat-2 cells (27Kim J.H. Song W.K. Chun J.S. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 119-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although overexpression of SPP-1 did not significantly decrease EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 6, A and B), it markedly reduced ERK1 activation and had a lesser effect on ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C) without affecting p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6D). Similarly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by S1P was also markedly inhibited in SPP-1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7A). Because ceramide has been implicated as a negative regulator of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (40Ruvolo P.P. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the inhibitory action of SPP-1 on ERK1/2 activation was mediated by increased ceramide synthesis. However, treatment with FB1, which inhibited ceramide accumulation in SPP-1-expressing cells (Fig. 4A), had no significant effect on EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). In many cell types and cancers, activation of ERK1/2 plays an important role in EGF-induced migration (26Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Cancer Re"
https://openalex.org/W2032118370,"BmBKTx1 is a novel short chain toxin purified from the venom of the Asian scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch. It is composed of 31 residues and is structurally related to SK toxins. However, when tested on the cloned rat SK2 channel, it only partially inhibited rSK2 currents, even at a concentration of 1 μm. To screen for other possible targets, BmBKTx1 was then tested on isolated metathoracic dorsal unpaired median neurons of Locusta migratoria, in which a wide variety of ion channels are expressed. The results suggested that BmBKTx1 could specifically block voltage-gated Ca2+-activated K+ currents (BK-type). This was confirmed by testing the BmBKTx1 effect on the α subunits of BK channels of the cockroach (pSlo), fruit fly (dSlo), and human (hSlo), heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. The IC50 for channel blocking by BmBKTx1 was 82 nm for pSlo and 194 nm for dSlo. Interestingly, BmBKTx1 hardly affected hSlo currents, even at concentrations as high as 10 μm, suggesting that the toxin might be insect specific. In contrast to most other scorpion BK blockers that also act on the Kv1.3 channel, BmBKTx1 did not affect this channel as well as other Kv channels. These results show that BmBKTx1 is a novel kind of blocker of BK-type Ca2+-activated K+ channels. As the first reported toxin active on the Drosophila Slo channel dSlo, it will also greatly facilitate studying the physiological role of BK channels in this model organism.

Most scorpion toxins specific for K+ channels (KTx) 1The abbreviations used are: KTx, K+ channel toxin; BmK, Buthus martensi Karsch; BK channel, big conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; IK channel, intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; SK channel, small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; DUM neuron, dorsal unpaired median neuron; ChTx, charybdotoxin; IbTx, iberiotoxin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Bzl, benzyl; Me, methyl; TTX, tetrodotoxin; rSK2, rat SK2 channel. 1The abbreviations used are: KTx, K+ channel toxin; BmK, Buthus martensi Karsch; BK channel, big conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; IK channel, intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; SK channel, small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; DUM neuron, dorsal unpaired median neuron; ChTx, charybdotoxin; IbTx, iberiotoxin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Bzl, benzyl; Me, methyl; TTX, tetrodotoxin; rSK2, rat SK2 channel. are short chain peptides comprising 23–47 amino acid residues cross-linked by 3 to 4 disulfide bridges. All these toxins are composed of an α-helix connected to a double- or triple-stranded β-sheet by highly conserved disulfide bridges (1Rodriguez de la Vega R.C. Merino E. Becerril B. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The scorpion KTx have been classified into three subfamilies: α-, β-, and γ-KTx (2Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 3Corona M. Gurrola G.B. Merino E. Cassulini R.R. Valdez-Cruz N.A. Garcia B. Ramirez-Dominguez M.E. Coronas F.I. Zamudio F.Z. Wanke E. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among them, the α-KTx have become valuable tools for testing pharmacological, physiological, biochemical, biophysical, and even structural characteristics of K+ channels and their associated ionic currents (1Rodriguez de la Vega R.C. Merino E. Becerril B. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The classification of KTx is mainly based on their primary structures rather than on their pharmacological profiles, because the pharmacology of some toxins still remains to be determined and only a few of the characterized toxins are selective for only one K+ channel subtype (2Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, highly selective toxins deserve particular attention as tools in research and potential resources for drug development. Big conductance Ca2+-activated K+ currents, also termed BK or Slo currents, are activated both by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and by depolarization (4Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). BK channels were first studied in smooth muscle cells, where they are particularly abundant and play a key role in setting the contractile tone. Many nerve cells also contain Ca2+-activated K+ currents that play a key role in controlling excitability and action potential waveform. These currents prevent excessive Ca2+ entry, and are involved in the inhibition of neurotransmitter release (5Wickenden A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 94: 157-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BK channels are essential for innate immunity (6Ahluwalia J. Tinker A. Clapp L.H. Duchen M.R. Abramov A.Y. Pope S. Nobles M. Segal A.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To date, no human disease has been found to be firmly associated with BK channels (7Ashcroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2000Google Scholar), but their ubiquitous presence in excitable and non-excitable cells underlies their fundamental role in coupling chemical signaling with electrical signaling. BK channels are widespread in the animal kingdom. Pore-forming α subunits of BK channels (Slo) have been cloned from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, insects (Drosophila melanogaster, and Periplaneta americana), and mammals. For mammalian BK channels, the α-subunit may be linked to a regulatory β-subunit that affects channel kinetics and pharmacology (8Zeng X.H. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Some scorpion α-KTx, such as charybdotoxin (ChTx) and iberiotoxin (IbTx), are frequently used as tools to block BK channels. They consist of more than 36 amino acid residues connected by three disulfide bridges, and show high sequence homology. Nevertheless, only IbTx and limbatotoxin were found to block BK channels selectively (9Schroeder N. Mullmann T.J. Schmalhofer W.A. Gao Y.D. Garcia M.L. Giangiacomo K.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). ChTx and others affect both BK channels and the voltage-gated Kv1.3 channel (10Giangiacomo K.M. Sugg E.E. Garcia-Calvo M. Leonard R.J. McManus O.B. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2363-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pharmacophores of ChTx responsible for the interactions with BK and Kv channels seem to be overlapped in the C-terminal β-sheet region, suggesting that the outer vestibules of BK and Kv channels may, at least partially, share the same topology (11Goldstein S.A. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Munujos P. Knaus H.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10771-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Obviously, research on BK channels would benefit from identifying more highly selective BK blockers. Moreover, there is a lack of a specific blocker for dSlo, the Drosophila BK channel, because neither ChTx nor IbTx affect this channel (13Wicher D. Walther C. Wicher C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 431-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Asian scorpion BmK has been used for many years in traditional Chinese medicine. Its venom has recently been investigated in detail, and more than 70 different neurotoxins including 18 KTx have been isolated from it (14Goudet C. Chi C.W. Tytgat J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Here, we present the purification and characterization of a novel BK blocker, designated BmBKTx1, from the Asian scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch (BmK). We have tested BmBKTx1 on various voltage-gated and Ca2+-activated K+ currents and observed a potent blocking effect on insect BK currents. The venom of the Asian scorpion BmK was first fractionated on a Sephadex G-50 column as previously described (15Wang C.G. He X.L. Shao F. Liu W. Ling M.H. Wang D.C. Chi C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2480-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Peak 2, containing various neurotoxins, was applied to a DEAE Sephacel column (3 × 6.5 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer, pH 10.5. The breakthrough fraction was pooled and loaded onto a semipreparative reverse-phase HPLC C18 column (1 × 25 cm, Beckman) equilibrated with buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Proteins were eluted by a two-step gradient system: 0 to 36% buffer B (70% acetonitrile in buffer A) for 36 min, and 37 to 46% buffer B for 15 min. Fraction 3 from the C18 column was applied to a Mono-S column (0.5 × 5 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HAc-NaAc buffer, pH 4.3, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl in the acetate buffer for 30 min. The component isolated in the third peak (BmBKTx1) was used in the subsequent studies. The complete amino acid sequence of BmBKTx1 was obtained from a signal sequencing run on an Applied Biosystems 491 pulsed liquid-phase sequencer. BmBKTx1 was synthesized on Boc-Lys (2ClZ)-OCH2-phenylacetamidomethyl resin using a custom-modified, machine-assisted chemistry tailored from the published in situ DIEA neutralization/O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation protocol for Boc solid-phase peptide synthesis (16Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The following side chain protections were used: Cys(4MeBzl), Asp(OcHxl), Lys(2ClZ), Asn(xanthyl), Arg(tosyl), Ser(Bzl), and Tyr(BrZ). After chain assembly, the peptide was cleaved and deprotected by HF for 1 h in the presence of 5% p-cresol/thiocresol (1:1) at 0 °C, followed by precipitation with cold ether. The crude product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC to homogeneity, and its molecular weight ascertained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Oxidative folding of the purified BmBKTx1 was performed by dissolving the peptide at 3 mg/ml in 6 m guanidine HCl containing 18 mm reduced glutathione and 1.8 mm oxidized glutathione, followed by a rapid 6-fold dilution with 0.25 m NaHCO3. The folding/disulfide formation proceeded quantitatively at room temperature overnight, and the final product was purified by HPLC and lyophilized. Cell Preparation—Adult migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria) of both sexes were taken from the crowded laboratory colony 2 to 10 days after imaginal moult. Animals were reared at ∼32 °C on a 14:10 h light/dark cycle on a diet of grass and oatmeal (17Ashby G.J. UFAW The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory Animals. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1972: 582-587Google Scholar). Isolated DUM neuronal cell bodies from the metathoracic ganglion were prepared as described previously (18Brone B. Tytgat J. Wang D.C. Van Kerkhove E. J. Insect Physiol. 2003; 49: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dorsal median region from ganglia of 6 to 7 animals was removed and subjected to collagenase/dispase (2 mg/ml) treatment. The cells were centrifuged and subsequently washed three times. Cells were isolated by repetitive suction through a pipette tip, plated on Nunc Petri dishes, and incubated overnight at 28 °C under 5% CO2. All products were obtained from Invitrogen except the collagenase/dispase mixture (Roche Applied Science). Patch Clamp Recording—K+ currents in isolated DUM neurons of L. migratoria at room temperature were studied using the whole cell patch clamp technique (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). The electrodes were filled with standard intracellular solution (SIS) containing concentrations of (in mm) 160 K+-gluconate, 6.5 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgATP, 50 glucose, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, at pH 6.65. The standard extracellular solution (SES) contained concentrations of 172.5 mm NaCl, 6.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 7.7 MgCl2, 13 glucose and 10 HEPES, at pH 6.80. To separate K+ currents, tetrodotoxin (TTX) was added to the extracellular solution (standard extracellular solution + TTX), to a concentration of 100 nm, to block the voltage-gated Na+ current in the DUM neurons. When necessary, Ca2+ currents were blocked by further addition of Cd2+ to the extracellular solution (KCdES = standard extracellular solution + TTX + Cd2+) to a concentration of 1 mm. KCaIS was equivalent to standard intracellular solution except containing an increased free Ca2+ concentration of 5 μm (using 2 mm EGTA and 1.48 mm CaCl2) to potentiate the Ca2+-activated K+ currents in DUM neurons. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the program CaBuf, taking into account the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, EGTA, and ATP. 400 nm IbTx was used to block BK-type Ca2+-activated K+ currents. Application and washout of different extracellular solutions was accomplished with a bath perfusion system. Voltage clamp experiments and data acquisition were performed with a PC-controlled EPC 9 or EPC 10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), as previously described (18Brone B. Tytgat J. Wang D.C. Van Kerkhove E. J. Insect Physiol. 2003; 49: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were clamped at a holding potential of –100 mV. Capacitive and leak currents were compensated using an online routine provided by the PULSE software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), the residual currents being eliminated through the P/4 protocol. The outward currents recorded in the DUM neurons showed some variability in amplitude, probably because of differences in the sizes (ranging from 40 to 60 μm in diameter) of the DUM neurons used in the experiments. Transfection and Expression—For electrophysiological recording, SK and Slo channels were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Cells were cultured at a density of ∼2 × 104/35-mm dish, and transfected with 1 μg of channel DNA as specified below, and 0.5 μg of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). We expressed the Periplaneta Slo channel (pSlo) using pSlo/pcDNA3.1 (splice form AAAAΔ), the Drosophila Slo channels (dSlo) using dSlo/pRC (splice form A1/C2/E1/G3/I0), the human Slo channel (hSlo) using hSlo/pcDNA3.1, and the rat SK2 channel (rSK2) using rSK2/pcDNA3.1. Patch Clamp Recording on HEK293 Cells—Whole cell currents from HEK293 cells expressing Slo or SK channels were measured at room temperature using borosilicate pipettes with resistances of 2 to 5 mΩ. Current measurements and data acquisition were performed with an EPC 9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), which was controlled by PULSE software (HEKA Elektronik). Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2.9 kHz. Capacitive and leakage currents were compensated using a P/n protocol (the holding potential for leakage measurement was –110 mV). Series resistance error was compensated by >75%. The bath solution for measuring Slo currents contained concentrations of (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 2 sodium pyruvate, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES. For measuring SK currents, the bath solution differed from the above by containing 110 mm NaCl and 30 mm KCl. The pipette solution contained concentrations of 140 mm KCl, 4 NaCl, 2 MgATP, and 10 HEPES; the free Ca2+ concentration was measured with a calcium-sensitive electrode (KWIK tips; WPI, Berlin, Germany), and adjusted to 2.5 μm for measuring SK and hSlo currents, and to 25 μm for measuring insect Slo currents. The pH of the bath solution was adjusted to 7.4, and that of pipette solution to 7.25. Liquid-junction potentials between pipette and bath solution were taken into account before establishing the seal. The holding potentials (Vhold) for Slo and SK current measurements were –90 and –40 mV, the K+ equilibrium potentials amounting to –84 and –39 mV, respectively. For toxin application, the bath perfusion system BPS4 (ALA, Westbury, NY) was used. Injection and Expression—Stage V–VI X. laevis oocytes were isolated as previously described (20Huys I. Dyason K. Waelkens E. Verdonck F. van Zyl J. du Plessis J. Muller G.J. van der Walt J. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1854-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The oocytes were defolliculated by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase in zero-calcium ND-96 solution. Between 2 and 24 h after defolliculation, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 1–100 ng/μl cRNA using a Drummond microinjector. The oocytes were then incubated in ND-96 solution at 18 °C for 1–4 days. ND-96 solution, pH 7.5, contained concentrations of (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin sulfate (only for incubation). The in vitro synthesis of cRNAs encoding Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kir2.1, respectively, were performed as previously described (20Huys I. Dyason K. Waelkens E. Verdonck F. van Zyl J. du Plessis J. Muller G.J. van der Walt J. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1854-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Tytgat J. Buyse G. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Daenens P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To prepare the cRNAs of HERG, KCNQ1, and minK, plasmids containing these channel genes were first linearized by restriction endonucleases. The pSP64 plasmids containing the HERG gene were linearized with EcoRI. The pEXO plasmids containing the mKCNQ1 clone were linearized with BamHI. The original pBlueScript SK–vector containing the mIsK gene was first subcloned into the pGEM HE vector. Then the pGEM HE vector was linearized with PstI. Using the linearized plasmids as templates, cRNAs were synthesized in vitro using the large scale T7 or SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit. Voltage Clamp Experiments—Whole cell currents from oocytes were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Voltage and current electrodes (0.4–2 mΩ) were filled with 3 m KCl. The bath solution was ND-96, pH 7.5. Current records were sampled at 0.5-ms intervals after low pass filtering at 1 kHz. Linear components of capacity and leak currents were not subtracted. All experiments were performed at room temperature (19–23 °C). Results are mostly shown as mean ± S.E., n being the number of experiments. The significance of differences between two means was calculated with the Wilcoxon matched pairs test using Prism software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Nonlinear fitting procedures of data sets were performed using Origin 6.0 (Micoral Software, Northampton, MA) or IGOR (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) software. The significance of the differences between parameters obtained by curve fitting (mean ± S.E.) was calculated using the Student's t test with Welch correction (Prism, Graphpad Software). Differences in the mean values were considered significant at probability ≤0.05. Concentration-response relationships were fitted according to: Im = 1/1 + ([BmBKTx1]/EC50)p, where Im is the normalized peak current (see below) and [BmBKTx1] is the concentration of BmBKTx1. The parameters to be fitted were concentration of half-maximal effect (EC50), the Hill coefficient (p). For calculation of Im, peak currents measured in the presence of the toxin (after equilibration of toxin effect) were normalized to peak currents obtained under control conditions. Toxin Purification, Protein Sequencing, and Chemical Synthesis—As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a novel toxin was purified from the crude venom of the Asian scorpion BmK by gel filtration chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, and cation-exchange HPLC (Fig. 1). The purified toxin was sequenced by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystem 491 pulsed liquid phase sequencer. The results indicate that the toxin is a short chain peptide composed of 31 amino acid residues cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. Given its potent activity on the BK channel (see following sections), this toxin was designated as BmBKTx1. Because the native BmBKTx1 is scarce in the crude venom (less than 1%), the toxin was synthesized to obtain enough material for further characterization. The native and synthetic BmBKTx1 were co-eluted on reverse-phase HPLC, indicating their identity. In terms of peptide length, BmBKTx1 is similar to scorpion SK blockers such as scyllatoxin (LeTxI), which is also composed of 31 residues (22Sabatier J.M. Zerrouk H. Darbon H. Mabrouk K. Benslimane A. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Van Rietschoten J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Sabatier J.M. Fremont V. Mabrouk K. Crest M. Darbon H. Rochat H. Van Rietschoten J. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but shorter than the classical Kv/BK blockers, composed of more than 36 residues (24Schneider M.J. Rogowski R.S. Krueger B.K. Blaustein M.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Flinn J.P. Murphy R. Johns R.B. Kunze W.A. Angus J.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 45: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, BmBKTx1 lacks a pronounced sequence homology with SK blockers. On the other hand, its C-terminal region is similar to that of α-KTx1.x toxins active on Kv/BK (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of the toxin had already been deposited in the NCBI Protein Data base before it was classified and functionally described (Protein Data Bank code P83407). Named BmK37 at that time, it was also included in a phylogenetic tree in a recent review on the interaction between K+ channels and scorpion toxins (1Rodriguez de la Vega R.C. Merino E. Becerril B. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), where it was assigned to a cluster of one group of the Kv1.x channel blockers that are closely related to the SK channel blockers. Effect of BmBKTx1 on SK2 Channels—Considering the similarity of the amino acid number of BmBKTx1 and SK channel toxins, we tested its effect on rat SK2 channels (rSK2) heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. Whereas specific SK toxins such as apamin or scyllatoxin nearly totally block SK2 channels at 1 nm (26Shakkottai V.G. Regaya I. Wulff H. Fajloun Z. Tomita H. Fathallah M. Cahalan M.D. Gargus J.J. Sabatier J.M. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43145-43151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), BmBKTx1 failed to affect these currents when applied at this concentration. At a higher concentration of 1 μm, BmBKTx1 did cause a slowly developing reduction of the current, but the block remained incomplete. The toxin-insensitive part of the current could be blocked by subsequent application of 50 nm apamin. Fig. 3A shows typical voltage ramps recorded sequentially for control conditions, at 8 min after BmBKTx1 application, and at 3 min after apamin application in the continuous presence of BmBKTx1. The current block because of 1 μm BmBKTx1 developed slowly, a typical example being given in Fig. 3B, in which the time course of the block was well fitted by a monoexponential function with a time constant of 200 s down to a current level of about 20% of the original. Apamin caused a considerable further reduction of this residual current. Considering the sum of the currents blocked by BmBKTx1 and the residual current blocked by apamin as the total rSK2 current, we estimated the fraction of rSK2 channels sensitive to 1 μm BmBKTx1 to be 64 ± 22% (n = 8, Fig. 3C). These findings support the conclusion that BmBKTx1 cannot be considered as a highly potent SK channel blocker. We thus tested BmBKTx1 on other ion channels that might be targets for its blocking activity. The Effect of BmBKTx1 on Locust DUM Neurons—To screen for the effect of BmBKTx1 on various ion channels, we tested the toxin on isolated DUM neurons of the migratory locust, L. migratoria (Fig. 4). Locust DUM neurons express a large variety of ion channels, and the K+ current pattern in these neurons is very similar to that in cockroach DUM neurons (27Grolleau F. Lapied B. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We first checked the effect of BmBKTx1 on the total membrane current of locust DUM neurons as shown in Fig. 4, A.1. There was an obvious reduction of the overall outward current, whereas the inward Na+ current remained unaffected. This experiment was repeated in the presence of TTX in the bath to block the Na+ current (Fig. 4, A.2). A comparable effect was seen on the outward current: 200 nm BmBKTx1 blocked 24% of this current (p ≤ 0.002, n = 11). We then applied Cd2+ to block the voltage-gated Ca2+ current, and thus the Ca2+-activated K+ current (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, BmBKTx1 only caused a very small reduction of outward current. Using a pipette solution containing 5 μm free Ca2+, we facilitated the activation of Ca2+-activated K+ currents independently of the blocked Ca2+ influx. Again, 200 nm BmBKTx1 significantly reduced outward K+ currents (by 30%, p ≤ 0.002, Fig. 4C). Fig. 4D summarizes the effects of 200 nm BmBKTx1 on DUM neuron currents under the different conditions. Significant differences between control and test values are indicated by the asterisk (*), and between two test values by the symbol § (p ≤ 0.05, one sample t test and Welch corrected unpaired t test, respectively). Finally, to confirm that the Ca2+-activated K+ current was indeed part of the outward current of locust DUM neurons in the KCdES-KCaIS medium combination, the selective Ca2+-activated K+ current blocker IbTx was used as a positive control. Four hundred nm IbTx also reduced the outward current significantly (data not shown). Additional experiments (Fig. 4E) demonstrated the presence of the Ca2+-activated K+ current in locust DUM neurons. Application of 1 mm Cd2+ resulted in a reduction of the outward current (current trace, ②), which indirectly points to the presence of the Ca2+ channel: the block of the voltage-gated Ca2+ current by Cd2+ prevents the Ca2+ influx necessary to facilitate the activation of the Ca2+-activated K+ current by depolarizing voltage jumps. It is this that causes the reduction in the net outward current upon Cd2+ application. The Ca2+-activated K+ current trace was obtained by subtracting current trace ②, from that of ①. As shown in trace ① of Fig. 4, E.1, the net current under the control condition recorded by a depolarizing step to 40 mV was purely outward, indicating that the inward Ca2+ current was completely masked by the large outward K+ currents. A family of Ca2+-activated currents, evoked by depolarizing the voltage step by step (see inset), is shown in Fig. 4, E.2. The above results suggested that BmBKTx1 could selectively block the voltage-gated Ca2+-activated K+ current. The K+ channel affected by BmBKTx1 was thus most probably a BK-type Ca2+-activated K+ channel. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. 1) The Ca2+-activated current measured in locust DUM neurons was voltage-gated like all BK currents. 2) This K+ current was sensitive to the BK-type specific blocker IbTx, although the current affected by it seemed to be somewhat smaller than that affected by BmBKTx1, or the Cd2+-sensitive outward current. This might indicate that the concentration of IbTx was too low, and/or that IbTx-insensitive BK channels might be present in the locust DUM neurons. In the olfactory neurons of the locust, three different subtypes of BK channels were found, and one of them was insensitive to ChTx, another potent BK blocker comparable with IbTx with respect to BK subtype discrimination (28Wegener J.W.

Changes in intracellular calcium handling, including a reduced activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA), contribute to this contractile dysfunction. As the regulatory protein phospholamban can inhibit the calcium pump, we evaluated it as a potential target to improve cardiac function. In this study, we describe a recombinant antibody-based protein (PLN-Ab) that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of phospholamban. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies suggest that PLN-Ab mimics the effects of phospholamban phosphorylation. PLN-Ab accelerated the decay of the calcium transient when expressed in neonatal rat and adult mouse ventricular cardiac myocytes. In addition, direct injection of adenovirus encoding PLN-Ab into the diabetic mouse heart enhanced contractility when measured in vivo by echocardiography and in ex vivo Langendorff perfused hearts. The PLN-Ab provides a novel therapeutic approach to improving contractility through in vivo expression of an antibody inside cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2105212289,"In-stent restenosis is a hyperproliferative disease which can be successfully treated by drug-eluting stents releasing compounds that exhibit cell-cycle inhibitory properties to inhibit coronary smooth muscle cell (CASMC) proliferation and migration, resembling the key pathomechanisms of in-stent restenosis. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle. CDK activity may be blocked by novel compounds such as flavopiridol. Therefore, CDK inhibitors are attractive drugs to be used for the local prevention of in-stent restenosis. In this study, we demonstrate that flavopiridol leads to potent inhibition of CASMC proliferation and migration. Molecular effects on cell-cycle regulatory mechanisms and distribution were evaluated by post-transcriptional assessment of distinct cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) levels and flow cytometry. Cellular necrosis and apoptosis was assessed in CASMC and coronary endothelial cells. Flavopiridol induced a potent antiproliferative effect by cell-cycle inhibition in G1 and G2/M and led to increased protein levels of CKIs p21cip1 and p27kip1 as well as p53 in CASMC. Hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein was abrogated and mitogen-mediated smooth muscle cell migration significantly reduced. No accelerated cytotoxicity or increased apoptosis was detectable. Flavopiridol-coated stents, implanted in rat carotid arteries, led to significant decrease of neointima formation. As proof of principle, our results demonstrate that stents eluting CDK inhibitors such as flavopiridol effectively inhibit neointima formation. Therefore, this new class of therapeutics may be suitable for further clinical investigations on drug-eluting stents to prevent in-stent restenosis."

The analysis of IGRP-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene expression through transient transfection of islet-derived βTC-3 cells revealed that a promoter region, located between –273 and –254, is essential for high IGRP-CAT fusion gene expression. The sequence of this promoter region does not match that for any known islet-enriched transcription factor. However, data derived from gel retardation assays, a modified ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in situ footprinting technique and a SDS-polyacrylamide separation/renaturation procedure led to the hypothesis that this protein might be Pax-6, a conclusion that was confirmed by gel supershift assays. Additional experiments revealed a second non-consensus Pax-6 binding site in the –306/–274 IGRP promoter region. Pax-6 binding to these elements is unusual in that it appears to require both its homeo and paired domains. Interestingly, loss of Pax-6 binding to the –273/ –246 element is compensated by Pax-6 binding to the –306/–274 element and vice versa. Gel retardation assays revealed that another islet-enriched transcription factor, namely Pdx-1, binds four non-consensus elements in the IGRP promoter. However, mutation of these elements has little effect on IGRP fusion gene expression. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that both Pax-6 and Pdx-1 bind to the IGRP promoter within intact cells, in contrast to the critical role of these factors in β cell-specific insulin gene expression, IGRP gene transcription appears to require Pax-6 but not Pdx-1.

As its name implies, this protein is a homologue of the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose and orthophosphate (5Foster J.D.

This activity is restricted to a limited number of tissues, principally the liver and kidney (5Foster J.D. Pederson B.A. Nordlie R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

In the liver, G6Pase is positioned at the junction of the metabolic pathways that mediate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and thereby catalyzes the final step in hepatic glucose production. The role of G6Pase has also been studied in the context of other tissues, notably the pancreatic β cell (5Foster J.D. Pederson B.A. Nordlie R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

J. 2002; 362: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Interest in this cell type stems from the hypothesis that elevated G6Pase activity in certain settings, such as type II diabetes, could lead to the uncoupling of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by reversing a required step in this process, the phosphorylation of glucose. Reports have varied, however, as to the level of and even existence of G6Pase activity/expression in islets (5Foster J.D. Pederson B.A. Nordlie R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Interestingly, in studies that have been able to demonstrate islet G6Pase activity, different kinetic characteristics from those of the hepatic enzyme were observed, suggesting the presence of a unique islet G6Pase (1Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cloning of IGRP served to identify a candidate for this hypothetical enzyme (1Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C.

Mars L.T. Santamaria P. Immunity. 2002; 17: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the NOD (non-obese diabetic) mouse, which spontaneously develops a disease similar to type I diabetes in humans, a substantial portion (40%) of the CD8 cells infiltrating the islet are IGRP-reactive (10Lieberman S.M. Evans A.M. Han B. Takaki T. Vinnitskaya Y. Caldwell J.A. Serreze D.V. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Nathenson S.G. Santamaria P. DiLorenzo T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whether these observations directly translate to humans is unknown, however, numerous similarities between disease etiology in NOD mice and Type I diabetics have been noted (15Delovitch T.L. Singh B.

Originally, this work was undertaken in an attempt to identify novel, islet-enriched transcription factors important for pancreatic development and/or function. We believe this approach is reasonable given that similar work, focused on other islet-specific genes, has led to the identification of such proteins (19Yamaoka T. Itakura M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 247-261PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bonner-Weir S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Bramblett D.E. Huang H.P. Tsai M.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 255-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With data now implicating IGRP as an autoantigen in Type I diabetes, the possibility exists that this work could also be useful for the design of strategies aimed at preventing immune recognition through suppression of β cell antigens. The viability of this approach has already been investigated using antisense RNA directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), another protein identified as a type I diabetes autoantigen. In transgenic NOD mice expressing this antisense RNA, it was noted that suppression of GAD protein levels was associated with lower incidence of diabetes (22Yoon J.W. Yoon C.S. Lim H.W. Huang Q.Q. Kang Y. Pyun K.H. Hirasawa K. Sherwin R.S. Jun H.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although controversial (23Jun H.S. Khil L.Y. Yoon J.W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1892-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the results of this study suggest that the manipulation of other autoantigens, such as IGRP, should be investigated as a potential means to slow or prevent β cell destruction and type I diabetes. Previous studies investigating the molecular mechanisms that determine the islet-specific expression of the IGRP gene established the boundaries of a functional promoter (2Ebert D.H. Bischof L.J. Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This sequence, which consists of 306 bp upstream of the transcription start site, is sufficient to drive expression of reporter genes specifically in β cell-derived cell lines in vitro and pancreatic islets in vivo (24Frigeri C. Martin C.C. Svitek C.A. Oeser J.K. Hutton J.C. Gannon M. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Further, the results of a 5′ deletion analysis, coupled with in situ footprinting, indicated that multiple cis-acting elements within this 306-bp region contribute to IGRP promoter activity (17Bischof L.J. Martin C.C. Svitek C.A. Stadelmaier B.T. Hornbuckle L.A. Goldman J.K. Oeser J.K. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A recent publication examining the importance of two conserved E-Box motifs extended these findings by demonstrating that the transcription factors NeuroD/BETA2 and Upstream Stimulatory Factor contribute to IGRP promoter activity (18Martin C.C. Svitek C.A. Oeser J.K. Henderson E. Stein R. O'Brien R.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report we show that IGRP promoter activity in insulinoma cell lines is highly dependent on the binding of the transcription factor Pax-6 to two non-consensus binding sites. Interestingly, despite interacting directly with the IGRP promoter in situ, our data do not support a similar critical role for the transcription factor Pdx-1. [α-32P]dATP (>3000 Ci mmol–1) and [3H]acetic acid, sodium salt (>10 Ci mmol–1) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and ICN, respectively. Specific antisera to Pdx-1 and Pax-6 were obtained from Dr. Christopher Wright (Vanderbilt (25Gannon M. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Dev.

The construction of mouse IGRP-CAT fusion genes, containing promoter sequence from –306 to +3, –273 to +3, and –254 to +3, has been previously described (2Ebert D.H. Bischof L.J. Streeper R.S.

The Pax-6 binding site located between –273 and –246 in the IGRP promoter was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis within the context of the –273 to +3 promoter fragment. Two constructs, designated –273 MUT 1 and –273 MUT 2 (Fig. 1), were generated using PCR and the following oligonucleotides as the 5′ primers: 5′-GCGGATCCAAGCT(–273)TTAAGGGAAATcgcagtTATGAAAAATTGCAAG-3′ (MUT 1) and 5′-GCGGATCCAAGCT(–273)TTAAGcactgaGAACTGTATGAAAAATTG-3′ (MUT 2). BamHI cloning sites are underlined, and the mutated sequences are in lowercase letters. The 3′ PCR primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGATCCAGATCCTC-3′; XhoI cloning site underlined) and the 5′ PCR primers were designed to ensure that the 3′ and 5′ junctions of the IGRP promoter were the same as those in the wild-type –273 IGRP-CAT fusion gene construct. A three-step PCR strategy (28Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) was used to create a site-directed mutation of the –273/–246 Pax-6 motif within the context of the –306 to +3 IGRP promoter fragment. The resulting construct, designated –306 Pax MUT A, was generated using two complementary PCR primers that were designed to mutate nucleotides within the –273/–246 Pax-6 motif. The sequence of the sense strand oligonucleotide was as follows (mutated nucleotides in lowercase): 5′-(–277)GCCCTTAAGGGAAATcgcagtTATGAAAAATTGC-3′. With the –306 IGRP-CAT plasmid as the template, this sense strand oligonucleotide was used in conjunction with a 3′ PCR primer to generate the 3′ half of the IGRP promoter, whereas the complementary antisense strand oligonucleotide was used in conjunction with a 5′ PCR primer to generate the 5′ half of the IGRP promoter. The 3′ primer was the same as described above. The 5′ PCR primer (5′-CGGGATCCAAGCT(–306)CTAGCCAAGC-3′; BamHI cloning site underlined) was designed to conserve the junction between the IGRP promoter and CAT vector to be the same as that in the wild-type –306 IGRP-CAT fusion gene plasmid. The PCR products from each reaction pair were then combined and used themselves as both primer and template in a second PCR reaction step to a generate small amount of the full-length, mutated IGRP promoter fragment. Finally, the 5′ and 3′ PCR primers were then used to amplify this fragment. Similarly, the Pax-6 binding site located between –306 and –274 in the IGRP promoter was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis within the context of the –306 to +3 promoter fragment. The construct, designated –306 Pax MUT B (Fig. 10), was generated, with the wild-type –306 IGRP-CAT plasmid as the template, using PCR with the same 3′ PCR primer as described above and the following oligonucleotide as the 5′ primer: 5′-CGGGATCCAAGCT(–306)CTAGCCAAGCGTAGAtcggGCTAATGTCTGCC. A BamHI cloning site is underlined, and the mutated sequence is in lowercase letters. The 5′ junction of the resulting IGRP promoter fragment was the same as that in the wild-type –306 IGRP-CAT fusion gene construct. The mutation selectively targets the Pax-6 paired domain binding site. In addition, the –306 Pax MUT A construct described above served as the template for a PCR reaction with the Pax MUT B primer that led to the creation of a construct designated –306 Pax MUT AB, which contains mutations in both Pax-6 paired domain binding sites in the IGRP promoter. Using a combination of unique restriction enzyme sites in the IGRP promoter and the three-step PCR strategy described above, the mutations shown in Table I were introduced in combination into Pdx-1 binding sites 1, 2, 3, and 4 to generate the plasmid IGRP –306 Quad MUT (Fig. 9). Promoter fragments generated by PCR were completely sequenced to ensure the absence of polymerase errors. Plasmid constructs were purified by centrifugation through cesium chloride gradients (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Table IOligonucleotides used in the Pdx-1 studies Open table in a new tab Fig. 9Mutation of the four TAAT-like motifs in the IGRP promoter causes a minimal reduction in basal fusion gene expression. βTC-3 cells were transiently co-transfected, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using a LipofectAMINE solution containing various IGRP-CAT or Insulin-CAT fusion genes (2 μg) and an expression vector encoding firefly luciferase (0.5 μg). The IGRP-CAT fusion genes incorporated either the wild-type promoter sequence, located between –306 and +3 (–306 WT), or contained a quadruple mutation of all four TAAT-like motifs (IGRP –306 Quad MUT) within the context of the –306 to +3 promoter fragment. The Insulin-CAT fusion genes incorporated either the wild-type promoter sequence, located between –238 and +2 (Insulin –238 WT), or contained a site-directed mutation of the insulin A3 element (Insulin –238 A3 MUT), generated within the context of the –238 to +2 promoter fragment. Following transfection, βTC-3 cells were incubated for 18 –20 h in serum-containing medium. Cells were then harvested, and CAT and firefly luciferase activity were assayed as previously described (2Ebert D.H. Bischof L.J. Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Mathews C.E.

Results are presented as the ratio of CAT:luciferase activity, expressed as a percentage relative to the value obtained with the wild-type IGRP and Insulin fusion genes, and represent the mean of three experiments ± S.E., each using an independent preparation of all fusion gene plasmids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mouse pancreatic islet β cell-derived βTC-3 cells, α cell-derived αTC-6 cells, mouse adrenocortical-derived Y1 cells, human cervix-derived HeLa cells, and rat liver-derived H4IIE cells were passaged as subconfluent cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cell cultures were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and with either 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 15% (v/v) horse serum (βTC-3 and αTC-6 cells), and 10% (v/v) newborn bovine serum (Y1 and HeLa cells) or 2.5% (v/v) newborn bovine serum and 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (H4IIE cells). βTC-3 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of an expression vector encoding SV40-firefly luciferase (Promega) and 2 μg of the indicated CAT plasmids using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (17Bischof L.J. Martin C.C. Svitek C.A. Stadelmaier B.T. Hornbuckle L.A. Goldman J.K. Oeser J.K. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transfected βTC-3 cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and then solubilized in passive lysis buffer (Promega). After two cycles of freeze/thawing, firefly luciferase activity was assayed as described previously (30Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Streeper R.S. Culbert A.A. Eaton E.M. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K.

The remaining βTC-3 lysate was heated for 10 min at 65 °C, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. CAT assays were then performed on the supernatant as previously described (2Ebert D.H. Bischof L.J. Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, the results are expressed as the ratio of CAT:firefly luciferase activity. In addition, three independent preparations of each IGRP-CAT plasmid construct were analyzed to obtain the data shown in each figure. Labeled Probes—Sense and antisense oligonucleotides representing various IGRP promoter sequences, as indicated in the figure legends, were synthesized with BamHI-compatible ends and subsequently gel-purified, annealed, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I to a specific activity of ∼2.5 μCi/pmol (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). High Salt Nuclear Extract Preparation—High salt βTC-3 nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (31Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 32O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that nuclei were lysed by resuspension in a buffer containing 800 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 25% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C to ensure complete lysis, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad assay and was typically ∼1 μg μl–1. Low Salt Nuclear Extract Preparation—Low salt βTC-3, αTC-6, Y1, HeLa, and H4IIE nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (31Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 32O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the nuclear pellet was extracted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 25% glycerol containing 200 mm NaCl, instead of 0.4 m ammonium sulfate, and the supernatant was used directly in gel retardation assays. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad assay and was typically ∼1 μg μl–1. Binding Assays—∼14 fmol of radiolabeled probe (∼50,000 cpm) was incubated with 1.5–3 μg of the indicated nuclear extract in a final 20-μl reaction volume. For experiments using high salt nuclear extract, these reactions contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm DDT, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 100 mm KCl. In experiments using low salt nuclear extract the final concentrations of EDTA, EGTA, and glycerol were 0.1 mm, 1 mm, and 12.5%, respectively. In addition, the binding reaction contained 0.375 mm spermidine, 0.075 mm spermine, and 100 mm NaCl instead of 100 mm KCl. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TGE (25 mm Tris base, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA) and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. Samples were electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 150 V in 1× TGE buffer before the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XB film with intensifying screens. Competition Experiments and Gel Supershifts—For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was mixed with the radiolabeled oligomer at the indicated molar excess prior to addition of nuclear extract. For supershift experiments, specific antisera (1 μl) were preincubated with βTC-3 nuclear extract for 10 min on ice prior to the addition of the labeled IGRP WT oligonucleotide probe. All subsequent steps were carried out as described above. Nuclear extract proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm DTT, 0.007% bromphenol blue) and fractionated on 1.5-mm thick 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For molecular weight standardization, samples containing high molecular weight markers (Rainbow Molecular Weight markers, Amersham Biosciences) were run in lanes adjacent to those containing experimental samples. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from SDS-PAGE gel lanes to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes"
https://openalex.org/W2169486241,"In the K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse model of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated squamous cell cancers, HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes and E1 and E2 regulatory genes are driven by the K14 keratinocyte-specific promoter. HPV transcription varies within the different layers of the epithelium. The correlation between HPV transcription patterns and disease pathogenesis is not well understood. Understanding these patterns is critical to designing and testing new HPV-specific therapeutic strategies. We examined HPV gene expression in homogenous populations of cells microdissected from the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, and stratum corneum of lesions from the transgenic mice using PALM microlaser technology. RNA extracted from each cell layer was subjected to two-step gene-specific RT-PCR and real-time quantitative nested PCR. To ensure specific amplification of spliced transcripts, the primers used for real-time nested PCR spanned the splice sites. High levels of E2 were detected in the basal and supra-basal layers of hyperplastic and dysplastic lesions. E7 and E6* levels increased significantly over time in stratum basale and stratum spinosum. E6** was expressed at much lower levels. We showed that the transgenic mice express correctly spliced E2 transcripts and are suitable as a preclinical model to test a therapeutic strategy using transcriptional regulation by the E2 protein."
