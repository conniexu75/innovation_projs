https://openalex.org/W1555210583,"Methoxypolyethylene glycols of 1900 daltons (PEG-1900) or 5000 daltons (PEG-5000) were covalently attached to bovine liver catalase using 2,4,6-trichloro-s-triazine as the coupling agent. Rabbits were immunized by the intravenous and intramuscular routes with catalase modified by covalent attachment of PEG-1900 to 43% of the amino groups (PEG-1900-catalase). The intravenous antiserum did not yield detectable antibodies against PEG-1900-catalase or native catalase, as determined by Ouchterlony and complement fixation methods, whereas the intramuscular antiserum contained antibodies to both PEG-1900-catalase and catalase. PEG-1900 did not react with either antiserum. Catalase was prepared in which PEG-5000 was attached to 40% of the amino groups (PEG-5000-catalase). This catalase preparation did not react with either antiserum. PEG-1900-catalase retained 93% of its enzymatic activity; PEG-5000-catalase retained 95%. PEG-5000-catalase resisted digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and a protease from Streptomyces griseus. PEG-1900-catalase and PEG-5000-catalase exhibited enhanced circulating lives in the blood of acatalasemic mice during repetitive intravenous injections. No evidence was seen of an immune response to injections of the modified enzymes. Mice injected repetitively with PEG-5000-catalase remained immune competent for unmodieied catalase, and no evidence of tissue or organ damage was seen."
https://openalex.org/W1561931582,"Human alpha-thrombin, the thromboplastin activation product of prothrombin with high clotting and esterase activity, was produced from Cohn Fraction III paste. The procedure started with 0.4 to 3.2 kg of frozen paste and was completed in 2 or 3 days. Some 23 g of thrombin were recorded for 65 quantitated preparations made from 11 lots of Fraction III paste. These preparations were obtained at protein concentrations of 3.9 +/- 1.3 mg/ml with a yield of 340 +/- 110 mg/kg of paste, which represented 48 +/- 14% of the clotting potential extracted as prothrombin. They had specific clotting activities of 2.8 +/- 0.4 U.S. (NIH) units/microng of protein and titrated to 88 +/- 8% active with p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB). Those (N - 29) examined by labeling with [14C]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (iPr2P-F) and electrophoresing in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels were found to contain only (N = 4) or predominantly alpha-thrombin (97 +/- 3%) and corresponding amounts of ists degradation product, beta-thrombin (2.6 +/- 3.1%). No plasmin(ogen), prothrombin complex factors (II, VII, IX, IXalpha, X, Xalpha), or prothrombin fragments were detected in representative preparations. As produced in 0.75 M NaCl, pH approximately 6, thrombin was stable for approximately 1 week at 4 degrees and for greater than 1 year at less than or equal to 50 degrees; freeze-dried thrombin stored at 4 degrees for greater than 1 year displayed stable clotting activity and no vial to vial variation, permitting its use for reference purposes. Human thrombin generated by Taipan snake venom activation was compared with that produced by rapid thromboplastin activation: after treatment with [14C]iPr2P-F, greater than 95% of the label in both thrombins migrated at the same rate during electrophoresis in SDS; identical pairs of NH2-terminal residues were released in three consecutive Edman degradation cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1490352408,"In rabbit heart homogenates about 50% of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was associated with the low speed particulate fraction. In homogenates of rat or beef heart this fraction represented approximately 30% of the activity. The percentage of the enzyme in the particulate fraction was not appreciably affected either by preparing more dilute homogenates or by aging homogenates for up to 2 h before centrifugation. The particulate enzyme was not solubilized at physiological ionic strength or by the presence of exogenous proteins during homogenization. However, the holoenzyme or regulatory subunit could be solubilized either by Triton X-100, high pH, or trypsin treatment. In hearts of all species studied, the particulate-bound protein kinase was mainly or entirely the type II isozyme, suggesting isozyme compartmentalization. In rabbit hearts perfused in the absence of hormones and homogenized in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl, at least 50% of the cAMP in homogenates was associated with the particulate fraction. Omitting NaCl reduced the amount of particulate-bound cAMP. Most of the particulate-bound cAMP was probably associated with the regulatory subunit in this fraction since approximately 70% of the bound nucleotide was solubilized by addition of homogeneous catalytic subunit to the particulate fraction. The amount of cAMP in the particulate fraction (0.16 nmol/g of tissue) was approximately one-half the amount of the regulatory subunit monomer (0.31 nmol/g of tissue) in this fraction. The calculated amount of catalytic subunit in the particulate fraction was 0.18 nmol/g of tissue. Either epinephrine alone or epinephrine plus 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine increased the cAMP content of the particulate and supernatant fractions. The cAMP level was increased more in the supernatant fraction, possibly because the cAMP level became saturating for the regulatory subunit in the particulate fraction. The increase in cAMP was associated with translocation of a large percentage of the catalytic subunit activity from the particulate to the supernatant fraction. The distribution of the regulatory subunit of the enzyme was not significantly affected by this treatment. The catalytic subunit translocation could be mimicked by addition of cAMP to homogenates before centrifugation. The data suggest that the regulatory subunit of the protein kinase, at least that of isozyme II, is bound to particulate material, and theactive catalytic subunit is released by formation of the regulatory subunit-cAMP complex when the tissue cAMP concentration is elevated. A model for compartmentalized hormonal control is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1561945007,"Purified Photosystem I reaction center preparation catalyzed a plastocyanin-dependent cytochrome f photooxidation. Euglena cytochrome 552 replaced plastocyanin in all photochemical reactions catalyzed by the purified reaction center and was also photooxidized. A reaction center preparation lacking Subunit III was obtained by means of Triton X-100 treatment and DEAE-cellulose chromatography or sucrose gradient centrifugation. This preparation was incapable of cytochrome f photooxidation or of NADP photoreduction in the presence of plastocyanin. However, the reaction center lacking Subunit III photoreduced NADP when plastocyanin was replaced by N-methylphenazonium-3-sulfonate, serving as direct electron donor for P700. It was concluded that Subunit III mediates reduction of P700+ by plastocyanin. Mild treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate yielded reaction center preparations which were partially depleted in Subunits II, III, IV, V, and VI. The NADP photoreduction activity and EPR-detectable bound ferredoxin were correlated to the presence of Subunits IV, V, and VI in the depleted preparations. Subunits IV, V, and VI might mediate photoreduction of soluble ferredoxin by the primary electron acceptor, in the reducing site of Photosystem I. The P700 reaction center (Subunit I) was further purified. Preparations with chlorophyll a to P700 ratios below 40 were obtained with the use of higher concentrations of Triton X-100, which caused antenna chlorophyll a to be partially solubilized. Removal of the sdlubilized chlorophyll by DEAE-cellulose chromatography resulted in preparations which contained 10 to 20 chlorophyll a molecules/P700. It is suggested that a unit of about 20 chlorophyll a molecules is specifically associated with the reaction center protein (Mr = 70,000) in the vicinity of P700. A model has been presented which depicts probable organization of the Photosystem I reaction center in the thylakoid membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2001711966,"Nigral basal adenylate cyclase and dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, glutamate decarboxylase, choline acetyltransferase, and tyrosine hydroxylase activities were measured in rats with hemitransections at various levels or with electrolytic lesions of the medial forebrain bundle or the crus cerebri. The loss of nigral dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity after the various brain lesions was correlated with the loss of nigral glutamic acid decarboxylase but not that of tyrosine hydroxylase; nigral choline acetyltransferase was unaffected in all cases. The data indicate that the nigral dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity may be localized on neurons afferent to the nigra, probably originating from the globus pallidus and possibly from the tail of the caudate. The results suggest that dopamine, released from nigral dendrites, may influence dopaminergic activity indirectly by modulating impulses transmitted to the nigrostriatal neurons through the crus cerebri."
https://openalex.org/W1484092144,"Methods for measurements of catabolic reduction charge (defined as NADH/(NADH+NAD+)) and anabolic reduction charge (defined as NADPH/(NADPH + NADP+)) are described using [14C]nicotinamide labeling of Escherichia coli cultures. Together with these parameters the adenylate energy charge (ATP + 1/2ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP) was measured using labeling with [2-3H]adenine. These three charges were found under different exponential growth conditions to have values independent of the growth conditions: catabolic reduction charge, 0.05; anabolic reduction charge, 0.45; and adenylate energy charge, 0.9. The charges were examined during interruption of growth primarily affecting catabolism, respiration, or anabolism, leading to changes of the charges. The changes of charges are evaluated as a possible regulation of the metabolic rates utilizing or producing the nucleotides by their respective charges."
https://openalex.org/W1841512813,"The acidic dissociation constants in the range HO--1.5 to pH 7 of folic acid, dihydrofolic acid, methopterin (N(10)methylfolic acid), and methotrexate have been measured by potentiometric and spectrophotometric titrations. Assignment of these dissociations was made by comparison to model compounds, by proton magnetic resonance measurements, and by examination of associated ultraviolet absorbance changes. For folic acid, the dissociation constants are as follows: N(1), pK' 2.35; N(10), pK' 0.20; N(5), pK' greater than -1.5. For dihydrofolic acid: N(5), pK' 3.84; N(1), pK' 1.38; N(10), pK' 0.28. For methotrexate: N(1), pK' 5.71; gamma-carboxyl, pK' 4.70; alpha-carboxyl, pK' 3.36; N(10), pK' 0.50; N(5), boxyl, pK' 4.70; alpha-carboxyl, pK' 3.36; N(10), pK' 0.50; N(5) pK' greater than -1.5.

https://openalex.org/W2150125176,"HEPPEL,~ AND ILAN FRIEDBERG§ From the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London, England External ATP produces an extensive change in the mem- brane permeability of transformed cultured mouse cells, leading to a depletion of intracellular pools labeled with 13Hluridine, L3H1adenosine, ““Rb, or Z-deoxy[“HIglucose. For example, when 3T6 (a cell line derived from 3T3 by spontaneous transformation), SV3T3 (3T3 cells transformed by simian vacuolating virus 40), and PY3T3 (3T3 cells trans- formed by polyoma virus) cells are exposed to as little as 0.2 mM ATP in buffered saline medium for several minutes, there results a 20- to 30-fold increase in rate of efflux of the acid-soluble uridine nucleotide pool. A much smaller stimu- lation (from 0- to 3-fold) is seen with resting or growing 3T3 cells or with secondary cultures of mouse embryo fibro- blasts. The increase in permeability produced by ATP is highly specific; it was not obtained with GTP, CTP, UTP, ADP, inorganic phosphate, and various chelating agents. The effect of ATP in increasing permeability is pa-depend- ent and occurs much faster at 37.5” than at 20”. Stimulation of efflux persists after removal of ATP and the enhanced rate of efflux is the same at 20” as at 37.5”. The effect of ATP is seen in various buffered saline media. When the solutions are removed and replaced with Dul- becco’s modified Eagle’s serum-free medium (Smith, J. D., Freeman, G., Vogt, D., and Dulbecco, R. (1960) Virology 12, 185-196), the increased rate of efflux is quickly suppressed. The presence of bicarbonate, divalent cations, and a more neutral pH all contribute to restore a normal permeability barrier. Upon addition of serum, the acid-soluble pools are restored in 1 h and the process can be repeated. This treat- ment with ATP does not affect the subsequent appearance of the cultured cells or their rate of growth."
https://openalex.org/W1513412720,"An aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) from human liver has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is NADPH-dependent, prefers aromatic to aliphatic aldehydes as substrates, and is inhibited by barbiturates and hydantoins. The following physicochemical parameters were determined: molecular weight, 36,200; sedimentation coefficient, 2.9 S; Stokes radius, 2.65 nm; isoelectric point, pH 5.3; extinction coefficient at 280 nm, 54,300 M-1 cm-1. Results from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with and without sodium dodecyl sulfate, gel filtration, and ultracentrifugation suggest a monomeric structure. On molecule of NADPH binds to the enzyme causing a red shift of the coenzyme absorption maximum from 340 to 352 nm. The amino acid composition has been determined and a partial specific volume of 0.74 was computed from these data. An alpha-helicity of 7 and 18% was estimated from the ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm, respectively. Combination of the most reactive thiol group with p-mercuribenzoate does not cause loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation occurs when more than one thiol group is modified. The presence of NADPH or NADP+ prevents loss of activity by thiol modification. The comparison of structural features of aldehyde reductase with other monomeric and oligomeric dehydrogenases suggest similarities of aldehyde reductase with octopine dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1557668700,"1. The substrate specificity of membrane-bound and purified epoxide hydrase from rat liver microsomes has been studied. Both enzyme preparations catalyzed the hydration of a variety of alkene oxidase as well as arene oxides of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 2. Unlike the membrane-bound enzyme, the rate of hydration for most of the substrates catalyzed by the purified epoxide hydrase was constant for only 1 or 2 min. The addition of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine or heated microsomes to the incubation mixture extended the linearity of the reaction. 3. When rat liver microsomes were used as the source of the enzyme, the apparent Km values for many of the substrates were dependent on the amount of microsomes used. When purified epoxide hydrase was used as the enzyme source and benzo(a)pyrene 11,12-oxide as substrate, the apparent Km for benzo(a)pyrene 11,12-oxide was independent of enzyme concentration but dependent on added lipid concentration. Thus, in the absence of added dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine or in the presence of this lipid at a concentration below its critical micelle concentration, the observed Km for benzo(a)pyrene 11,12-oxide remained constant. However, when the lipid concentration was greater than the critical micelle concentration, the apparent Km value increased linearly with lipid concentration. These results are consistent with a model based on the partition of lipid-soluble substrate between the lipid micelle and the aqueous medium."

https://openalex.org/W1536645275,"The pH dependence of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and oxygen affinity of cobaltous porphyrin-containing myoglobin (CoMb) have been examined. The hyperfine structures of the EPR spectrum of oxy-CoMb undergo small, reversible pH-dependent changes with pK values of 5.33, 5.55, and 5.25 +/- 0.05 for proto-, meso-, and deutero-CoMb's, respectively, whereas deoxy-CoMb does not exhibit any pH dependence of its EPR spectrum. The partial pressure of oxygen at half-saturation of proto-CoMb decreases from 26 to 42 Torr on lowering the pH from 7.0 to 4.8. For comparison, we have prepared cobaltous porphyrin-containing monomeric Glycera hemoglobin (CoHb (Glycera)), in which the distal histidyl group of myoglobin is replaced by a leucyl residue, and examined the equilibria and kinetics of its oxygenation and EPR spectrum. CoHb (Glycera) has exhibited a very low oxygen affinity (p50 = 7 X 10(2) Torr at 5 degrees) and a large dissociation rate constant (more than 8 X 10(4) S-1 at 5 degrees). The EPR spectrum of oxy-CoHb (Glycera) was affected by neither pH nor replacement of H2O with D2O. Low temperature photodissociation studies by EPR and spectrophotometry have shown that the photolyzed form of the ligated hemoglobin (Glycera) is similar to its deoxy form, in contrast to myoglobin which gives a new intermediate states as the photolyzed form. These differences between CoMb and CoHb (Glycera) are interpreted with relation to the possible role of the distal histidyl residue in CoMb."

The peptidase has been purified to homogeneity from chicken embryos. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.5 to 8.5, and isoelectric point of 5.0, and a molecular weight of 77,000. The kinetic parameters at pH 8 and 37 degrees are: Km = 2 X 10(-4) M and Vmax = 4.2 mumol/min/mg of protein. The enzyme is inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (100%), N-ethylmaleimide (60%), and chelating agents (40 to 60%). Maximum activity is attained in the presence of reducing agents and Ca2+, Sr2+, or Mg2+. The peptidase has no detectable action on casein, serum albumin, collagen, collagen alpha chains, various collagen peptides (alpha1)(I)-CB2, alpha1(I)-CB3, alpha1(I)-CB4), (Gly-Pro-Pro)10, or (Gly-Pro-Pro)5. It does catalyze the hydrolysis of the Hyp--Gly bond in the 17-residue collagen peptide alpha1(II)-CB6-C2 and it partially digested a mixture of collagen peptides of molecular weight 350 to 2500. A role of this peptidase in collagen breakdown appears to be restricted to a late stage when degradation products would fall in the range of 5 to 30 residues."

The protein-folate complex was purified 100-fold and recovered in a 22% yield by adsorption and elution from microgranular silica (Quso G-32), followed by passage through Sephadex G-150. When subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified preparations showed only a single, protein-staining band whose molecular weight was 25,000. Bound folate (34 nmol/mg of protein) corresponded to 0.85 mol/mol of protein. Analyses of the protein revealed relatively few charged or polar amino acids, an unusually high content of hydrophobic residues and methionine, and the absence of cysteine. The purified protein-folate complex was contained within a Triton micelle (molecular weight, 220,000; about 340 mol of detergent per mol of protein). Bound folate was retained when the micelle was exposed at 4 degrees to solutions whose pH values ranged between 3 and 12; at 23 degrees, however, stability was decreased, especially above pH 8. Folate could be released by treatment of the micelle with ethanol or with chaotropic agents such as guanidinium chloride, perchlorate, or thiocyanate."

These enzymes are solubilized by sedimentation of the ribosomes through buffered sucrose containing 0.5 M KCl, and have been partially purified from the high salt wash fraction by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose. The ribosomal-associated enzymatic activities include cyclic AMP-regulated and cyclic nucloetide-independent protein kinase, phosphoprotein phosphatase, and acetyltransferase activities. These enzymatic activities have been shown to modify specific ribosomal and ribosomal-associated proteins. The cycli c AMP-regulated protein kinase phosphorylate the 40 S ribosomal subunit from rabbit reticulocytes. One of the cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of two different factors involved in the initiation of hemoglobin synthesis. A single phosphoprotein phosphatase activity is shown to remove phosphate from 40 S ribosomal subunits.

https://openalex.org/W1571786315,"Reproducible induction of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase by dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) in a line of HTC hepatoma cells in suspension culture requires that the cells be preinduced with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid which itself induces tyrosine aminotransferase. Concentrations of dexamethasone that do not induce tyrosine aminotransferase fail to support Bt2cAMP induction, removal of the steroid from the medium leads to a loss of the Bt2cAMP effect, and an HTC cell line whose aminotransferase is not steroid-inducible does not respond to the cyclic nucleotide. We show that the further induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by Bt2cAMP in dexamethasone-treated cells is due to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis. The cyclic nucleotide has no effect on aminotransferase synthesis in cells grown in the absence of steroid. Several lines of evidence suggest that dexamethasone acts at a step beyond the activation of protein kinase by cAMP: (a) basal levels of cAMP are not altered by growth of HTC cells in dexamethasone; (b) accumulation of cAMP from the medium is not enhanced; (c) the glucocorticoid does not induce cAMP-dependent protein kinase in HTC cells; and (d) there is no augmentation of cAMP binding to the regulatory protein, nor is there any change in cAMP activation of protein kinase caused by growth in dexamethasone. These results help define a system that should be useful in studying the interaction of cyclic nucleotides and steroid hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1562086975,"The sialyltransferase (= glycoprotein-sialic acid transferase) was studied in the sponge Geodia cydonium, a mesozoan organism. The experiments were performed both in intact cellular and in isolated enzyme systems. It is shown, that desialylated cells show a lower aggregation potency than the controls. During aggregation enzymic sialylation of desialylated sponge cells occurs in the presence of an aggregation factor, which is associated with a high molecular weight particle. The sialylation process is temperature-dependent and can be inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Sialylation occurs predominantly at a distinct cell surface component, the aggregation receptor. The sialyltransferase was isolated and purified by the following steps: Sepharose 4B, CM-cellulose, Nonidet treatment, and Sephadex G-100. By this procedure the enzyme was purified 680-fold with a 31% yield. The sialyltransferase is originally associated with the high molecular weight particle also carrying the aggregation factor. In the last step the aggregation factor was separated from the sialyltransferase. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to the desialylated aggregation receptor. The molecular weight of the sialyltransferase has been determined to be 52,000. Kinetic studies revealed no lag phase and a dependence on enzyme concentration.

https://openalex.org/W1486468268,1. Difference spectra of tryosyl residues obtained on denaturation of tropomycosin with urea or guanidinium chloride indicate that strong hydrophobic environments exist in the native coiled-coil state. 2. Solvent perturbation difference spectra indicate that tyrosyl residues are partially accessible to the solvent. The accessiblity decreases with increasing size of the solvent molecules. 3. Spectral pH titration of tyrosyl residues cannot provide information on the tyrosyl accessibility because conformational change accompanies the increase in pH. 4. Circular dichroism of tyrosyl and phenylalanyl residues is consistent with the effect of imposed conformational rigidity on the partially asymmetrical vibrational fine structure of the 1Lb absorption band of phenyl and benzyl chromophores; the effect is reduced by 70% on unfolding of tropomyosin.
https://openalex.org/W1588836810,"Increase in hydrostatic pressure to 1000 atm increased the affinity of human and menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) hemoglobins for oxygen. With necessary assumptions about the form of the equilibrium curve, and after correction for changes in pH and volume due to pressure, the increase in affinity is about 2-fold for both hemoglobins. At pH 6.5, Hill's n for menhaden hemoglobin is near 1, and it is believed to remain in the T state, whereas human hemoglobin undergoes a T to R transition. This suggests that the R-T equilibrium is not disturbed by pressure. In direct experiments the binding of a fluorescent effector (8 hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene (trisulfonic acid) to deoxyhemoglobin was not changed by pressure. The binding of n-butylisocyanide to hemoglobin and to myoglobin is also greater at high pressures, similarly suggesting that the R-T transition is not involved in the pressure effect."

As evidence, they showed apparent competitive inhibition of activation by globin, indication a pepsinogen-globin complex. Previous work had shown pepsinogen activation to occur very rapidly in the presence of high concentrations of hemoglobin, a very similar pepsin substrate (McPhie, P. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 56, 789-792). This contradiction has been resolved by a re-evaluation of the techniques used in the two investigations. The experimental conditions of Marciniszyn et al. Were inadequately defined to ensure denaturation of pepsin, a prerequisite of their method. A small decrease in pH, caused by the presence of extraneous protein, prevents this denaturation and leads to consistent underestimates of the rate of zymogen activation."
