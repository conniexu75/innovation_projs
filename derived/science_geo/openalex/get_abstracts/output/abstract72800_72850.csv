https://openalex.org/W1618699366,"The recent isolation of the glyoxysome, a cellular organelle containing the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, raised the possibility that this metabolic sequence may be compartmentalized in plant tissues actively converting fat to carbohydrate. To sustain this view it is necessary to demonstrate that all of the pertinent enzymes are present in quantities consistent with the conversion of fat to sucrose in the intact tissue. To this end we have assayed each of the enzymes of the citric acid and glyoxylate cycles in preparations of mitochondria and glyoxysomes from 5-day-old castor bean endosperm. This survey shows that the glyoxysome contains more than 85% of the total isocitratase and malate synthetase activities, and the mitochondria less than 5%. With the exception of aconitase, which appears to be easily solubilized, all enzymatic activities observed in the glyoxysome are sufficient to support rates of acetate metabolism that are greater than those known to be occurring in the intact tissue. In addition to those enzymes which have been previously reported to be compartmented in the glyoxysome, a specific glutamate: oxalacetate transaminase has been found in very high concentrations in both the glyoxysomes and the mitochondria. Our inability to detect succinic dehydrogenase and fumarase in the glyoxysome suggests that the succinate produced from isocitrate cleavage must be transported to the mitochondria (where these activities are high) before undergoing oxidation to malate. With the use of isolated particle preparations, isotopic evidence supporting this conclusion has been obtained."

As light source, we used a 5 mW He–Ne continuous wave laser (Spectra-Physics Model 120). An improved prototype is under construction; in a year or two we expect to have a microscope suitable for advancing studies of brain cells in living animals1–4."

While making extensive microbiological surveys Kriss et al.2 found actinomycetes only occasionally and so it was assumed that these microorganisms are confined to the terrestrial habitat, and that those isolated from ocean sediments are forms not indigenous to the sea."

https://openalex.org/W2070127264,"As judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, 5-hydroxytryptamine and adenosine-5'-triphosphate form micelles in artificial mixtures and also in storage organelles containing 5-hydroxytryptamine of blood platelets of rabbits. Their average apparent molecular weights depend on the concentration and on the molar ratio of the two constituents. The 5-hydroxytryptamine and adenosine triphosphate of these 5-hydroxytryptamine organelles may be stored in vivo together as micelles with apparent molecular weights of several hundred thousands or more."

https://openalex.org/W1964753430,Cells derived from mixed Syrian hamster embryo cultures were treated with pyrene (control) or with benzo[a]pyrene. Transformed clones were obtained only with the carcinogen. Some of the transformed clones were responsible for cell lines that produced tumors when injected into hamsters. These observations provide evidence that chemical-induced oncogenesis can be studied by an in vitro model.

https://openalex.org/W1569506818,"Abstract Pre-steady state kinetic parameters pertaining to chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of specific substrate esters can be obtained from measurements of the displacement of the competitive inhibitor proflavin from enzyme by substrate. This method, which was previously used in experiments with specific substrate amides, has now been applied to the investigation of N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester, N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester, and N-furylacryloyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester. Results were found to be in agreement with data obtained by established procedures including measurement of spectral changes of the enzyme upon formation of complexes with substrate and direct measurement of product formation. All available data on chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of specific substrate esters are consistent with the previously proposed mechanism [see PDF for equation] in which P1 represents an alcohol and P2 an acid."
https://openalex.org/W1992464212,"The O,p'-DDT in technical DDT is broken down to p,p'-DDT and then to 1,1-dichloro- 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene in living avian tissue. In the anaerobic conditions existing after death, O,p'-DDT is metabolized to 1,1-dichloro-2-(O-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane. The absence of O,p'-DDT and metabolites in field specimens is ascribed to the rapid rate of breakdown and a masking of the 1,1-dichloro-2-(O-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane residue during analysis by the relatively large amounts of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene."

https://openalex.org/W2017599154,"IN some cases of infectious tetanus a neuromuscular block with tetraplegia may follow the state of muscle spasms. We suggested1 that this effect was caused by the tetanus toxin itself rather than to an after-effect of muscle relaxants or other drugs. This hypothesis, however, had to be verified by experiments with animals."

https://openalex.org/W1639415798,"Abstract Interactions at the allosteric and catalytic sites of Pseudomonas tryptophan oxygenase were explored by measuring the effects of tryptophan, α-methyltryptophan, and indole on the catalytic, spectral, and structural properties of the native enzyme in the presence and in the absence of the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In the absence of effector substances, SDS treatment leads to an irreversible loss of catalytic activity and a profound hypochromicity in the Soret region of the absorption spectrum of tryptophan oxygenase. Either tryptophan or α-methyltryptophan antagonizes this effect of SDS, i.e. a higher concentration of SDS is required to produce an equivalent response in the presence of either effector substance. The competitive inhibitor indole, however, exerts no such protective effect. Sedimentation studies revealed that SDS promotes dissociation of the tetrameric form of the native enzyme into catalytically inactive subunits. α-Methyltryptophan markedly protects the native enzyme against the SDS-induced disruption of its quaternary structure. The structural changes elicited by the action of SDS correlate well with the catalytic and spectral changes effected by the detergent, indicating that both the catalytic and the chromophoric properties of the native enzyme are dependent upon an intact quaternary structure. These results are compatible with the view that the binding of tryptophan or α-methyltryptophan to allosteric sites mediates a conformational alteration in quaternary structure of such a nature that the noncovalent bonds between subunits are strengthened, thereby requiring a higher concentration of SDS to effect dissociation."

https://openalex.org/W2013429339,"When electrical heat sources were implanted in the abdominal cavities of sheep and heated to dissipate 20 to 22 watts of additional endogenous heat in the animal, a rapid increase in respiratory frequency and respiratory water loss occurred 3 to 5 minutes after the initiation of heating. The response was accompanied by a marked decline of the temperature of the hypothalamus, with an increase of less than 1.0 degrees C in skin temperature over the location of the heaters in the abdomen. When the same skin area was heated externally in the absence of internal heating, no significant response was seen. The results support the concept of the existence of thermoreceptors, located in deep tissues or veins, which play a role in the regulation of body temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1624149099,"Abstract Amino acid sequence analysis has led to the concept that the NH2-terminal portion of Bence-Jones proteins is subject to variation in sequence whereas the COOH-terminal portion is invariant, yet the proof of sequence has in no case been reported. For determination of the sequence of the soluble tryptic peptides, the human κ Bence-Jones protein Ag, which has served as the standard for comparison, was reduced and carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. The soluble peptides were purified by column chromatography, paper chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. The amino end groups and the composition of the intact protein and the tryptic peptides were determined. The amino acid sequences of 16 soluble tryptic peptides were determined by standard procedures, principally by use of the Edman degradation and further enzymatic cleavage. The sequences of the 16 tryptic peptides account for 140 residues and are in accord with the tentative sequence reported earlier for Protein Ag. Eleven of the peptides are derived from the constant portion of the human κ light chain which has a uniform sequence except for a genetic variation at 1 residue. The remaining peptides are from the variable portion of the κ chain and differ in many respects from corresponding portions of the provisional sequences of other human κ chains."

https://openalex.org/W2092622317,"IT has recently been postulated1 that mice are sensitive to electric fields occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and may obtain “time cues” from the daily variations in this field, and further suggested that the field may be responsible for the 24 h rhythm exhibited by certain polar-dwelling animals. I find this untenable for the following reasons."
