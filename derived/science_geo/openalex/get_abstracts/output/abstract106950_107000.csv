https://openalex.org/W1977312644,"The tools of molecular biology were used to solve an instance of the directed Hamiltonian path problem. A small graph was encoded in molecules of DNA, and the ""operations"" of the computation were performed with standard protocols and enzymes. This experiment demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out computations at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W4213262935,A simple technique has been devised that allows the direct synthesis of native backbone proteins of moderate size. Chemoselective reaction of two unprotected peptide segments gives an initial thioester-linked species. Spontaneous rearrangement of this transient intermediate yields a full-length product with a native peptide bond at the ligation site. The utility of native chemical ligation was demonstrated by the one-step preparation of a cytokine containing multiple disulfides. The polypeptide ligation product was folded and oxidized to form the native disulfide-containing protein molecule. Native chemical ligation is an important step toward the general application of chemistry to proteins.
https://openalex.org/W2081894694,"The therapeutic responsiveness of genetically defined tumors expressing or devoid of the p53 tumor suppressor gene was compared in immunocompromised mice. Tumors expressing the p53 gene contained a high proportion of apoptotic cells and typically regressed after treatment with gamma radiation or adriamycin. In contrast, p53-deficient tumors treated with the same regimens continued to enlarge and contained few apoptotic cells. Acquired mutations in p53 were associated with both treatment resistance and relapse in p53-expressing tumors. These results establish that defects in apoptosis, here caused by the inactivation of p53, can produce treatment-resistant tumors and suggest that p53 status may be an important determinant of tumor response to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1994452959,"For survival, embryonic motoneurons in vertebrates depend on as yet undefined neurotrophic factors present in the limb bud. Members of the neurotrophin family are currently the best candidates for such neurotrophic factors, but inactivation of their receptor genes leads to only partial loss of motoneurons, which suggests that other factors are involved. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), originally identified as a trophic factor specific for dopaminergic neurons, was found to be 75-fold more potent than the neurotrophins in supporting the survival of purified embryonic rat motoneurons in culture. GDNF messenger RNA was found in the immediate vicinity of motoneurons during the period of cell death in development. In vivo, GDNF rescues and prevents the atrophy of facial motoneurons that have been deprived of target-derived survival factors by axotomy. GDNF may therefore be a physiological trophic factor for spinal motoneurons. Its potency and specificity in vitro and in vivo also make it a good candidate for treatment of motoneuron disease."
https://openalex.org/W2090763940,"The ability of antibodies to neutralize diverse primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 in vitro has been questioned, with implications for the likely efficacy of vaccines. A recombinant human antibody to envelope glycoprotein gp120 was generated and used to show that primary isolates are not refractory to antibody neutralization. The recombinant antibody neutralized more than 75 percent of the primary isolates tested at concentrations that could be achieved by passive immunization, for example, to interrupt maternal-fetal transmission of virus. The broad specificity and efficacy of the antibody implies the conservation of a structural feature on gp120, which could be important in vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2067736347,"The tomato Cf-9 gene confers resistance to infection by races of the fungus Cladosporium fulvum that carry the avirulence gene Avr9. The Cf-9 gene was isolated by transposon tagging with the maize transposable element Dissociation. The DNA sequence of Cf-9 encodes a putative membrane-anchored extracytoplasmic glycoprotein. The predicted protein shows homology to the receptor domain of several receptor-like protein kinases in Arabidopsis, to antifungal polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins in plants, and to other members of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins. This structure is consistent with that of a receptor that could bind Avr9 peptide and activate plant defense."
https://openalex.org/W2070609323,"In primates, the premotor cortex is involved in the sensory guidance of movement. Many neurons in ventral premotor cortex respond to visual stimuli in the space adjacent to the hand or arm. These visual receptive fields were found to move when the arm moved but not when the eye moved; that is, they are in arm-centered, not retinocentric, coordinates. Thus, they provide a representation of space near the body that may be useful for the visual control of reaching."
https://openalex.org/W2056182522,"Interaction forces between single strands of DNA were measured with the atomic force microscope by a procedure in which DNA oligonucleotides were covalently attached to a spherical probe and surface. Adhesive forces measured between complementary 20-base strands fell into three distinct distributions centered at 1.52, 1.11, and 0.83 nano-newtons, which are associated with the rupture of the interchain interaction between a single pair of molecules involving 20, 16, and 12 base pairs, respectively. When a third long DNA molecule was coupled between complementary surfaces, both intra- and interchain forces were observed. The intrachain interaction resulting from the molecule's elasticity manifested itself as a long-range cohesive force."
https://openalex.org/W2034064964,"The EPH-related transmembrane tyrosine kinases constitute the largest known family of receptor-like tyrosine kinases, with many members displaying specific patterns of expression in the developing and adult nervous system. A family of cell surface-bound ligands exhibiting distinct, but overlapping, specificities for these EPH-related kinases was identified. These ligands were unable to act as conventional soluble factors. However, they did function when presented in membrane-bound form, suggesting that they require direct cell-to-cell contact to activate their receptors. Membrane attachment may serve to facilitate ligand dimerization or aggregation, because antibody-mediated clustering activated previously inactive soluble forms of these ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2021820438,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1984821767,"The function of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in normal and wounded skin was assessed by expression of a dominant-negative KGF receptor transgene in basal keratinocytes. The skin of transgenic mice was characterized by epidermal atrophy, abnormalities in the hair follicles, and dermal hyperthickening. Upon skin injury, inhibition of KGF receptor signaling reduced the proliferation rate of epidermal keratinocytes at the wound edge, resulting in substantially delayed reepithelialization of the wound."
https://openalex.org/W2063987809,"The decay of excitatory postsynaptic currents in central neurons mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors is likely to be shaped either by receptor desensitization or by offset after removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Native AMPA receptors show desensitization time constants of 1 to about 10 milliseconds, but the underlying molecular determinants of these large differences are unknown. Cloned AMPA receptors carrying the ""flop"" splice variants of glutamate receptor subtype C (GluR-C) and GluR-D are shown to have desensitization time constants of around 1 millisecond, whereas those with the ""flip"" variants are about four times slower. Cerebellar granule cells switch their expression of GluR-D splice variants from mostly flip forms in early stages to predominantly flop forms in the adult rat brain. These findings suggest that rapid desensitization of AMPA receptors can be regulated by the expression and alternative splicing of GluR-D gene transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2033222990,"The interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of three subunits: the IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ chains, the last of which is also used in the receptors for IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9. Stimulation with IL-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 were found to be selectively associated with the ""serine-rich"" region of IL-2Rβ and the carboxyl-terminal region of IL-2Rγ, respectively. Both regions were necessary for IL-2 signaling. Furthermore, Jak3-negative fibroblasts expressing reconstituted IL-2R became responsive to IL-2 after the additional expression of Jak3 complementary DNA. Thus, activation of Jak1 and Jak3 may be a key event in IL-2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2004188090,Confocal fluorescence microscopy coupled with a diffraction-limited laser beam and a high-efficiency detection system has been used to study the diffusive movement and emission process of individual fluorescent molecules in the liquid phase at room temperature. The high detection sensitivity achieved at fast data acquisition speeds (greater than 1 kilohertz) allows real-time observation of single-molecule fluorescence without statistical analysis. The results show fluorescence-cycle saturation at the single-molecule level and multiple recrossings of a single molecule into and out of the probe volume as well as the triplet state.
https://openalex.org/W2044813037,"Inward rectifier K+ channels pass prominent inward currents, while outward currents are largely blocked. The inward rectification is due to block by intracellular Mg2+ and a Mg(2+)-independent process described as intrinsic gating. The rapid loss of gating upon patch excision suggests that cytoplasmic factors participate in gating. ""Intrinsic"" gating can be restored in excised patches by nanomolar concentrations of two naturally occurring polyamines, spermine and spermidine. Spermine and spermidine may function as physiological blockers of inward rectifier K+ channels and ""intrinsic"" gating may largely reflect voltage-dependent block by these cations."
https://openalex.org/W1995630780,"Components of the protein import machinery of the chloroplast were isolated by a procedure in which the import machinery was engaged in vitro with a tagged import substrate under conditions that yielded largely chloroplast envelope-bound import intermediates. Subsequent detergent solubilization of envelope membranes showed that six envelope polypeptides copurified specifically and, apparently, stoichiometrically with the import intermediates. Four of these polypeptides are components of the outer membrane import machinery and are associated with early import intermediates. Two of these polypeptides have been characterized. One is a homolog of the heat shock protein hsp70; the other one is a channel-protein candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2072920810,"The three-dimensional structure of a ternary complex of the purine repressor, PurR, bound to both its corepressor, hypoxanthine, and the 16-base pair purF operator site has been solved at 2.7 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography. The bipartite structure of PurR consists of an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain and a larger carboxyl-terminal corepressor binding and dimerization domain that is similar to that of the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins. The DNA-binding domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif that makes base-specific contacts in the major groove of the DNA. Base contacts are also made by residues of symmetry-related α helices, the ""hinge"" helices, which bind deeply in the minor groove. Critical to hinge helix-minor groove binding is the intercalation of the side chains of Leu54and its symmetry-related mate, Leu54′, into the central CpG-base pair step. These residues thereby act as ""leucine levers"" to pry open the minor groove and kink the purF operator by 45 degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1992221541,"Fluorescence-imaged micropipette aspiration was used to map redistribution of the proteins and lipids in highly extended human red blood cell membranes. Whereas the fluid bilayer distributed uniformly (+/- 10 percent), the underlying, solidlike cytoskeleton of spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1 exhibited a steep gradient in density along the aspirated projection, which was reversible on release from deformation. Quantitation of the cytoskeletal protein density gradients showed that skeletal elasticity is well represented by a grafted polymer network with a ratio of surface dilation modulus to shear modulus of approximately 2:1. Fractionally mobile integral proteins, such as band 3, and highly mobile receptors, such as CD59 as well as glycophorin C in protein 4.1-deficient cells, appeared to be squeezed out of areas dense in the underlying network and enriched in areas of network dilation. This complementary segregation demonstrates patterning of cell surface components by cytoskeletal dilation."
https://openalex.org/W2009417025,"When stimulated through their antigen receptor without requisite costimulation, T cells enter a state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness, termed anergy. In this study, signaling through the common γ chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-7 receptors in the presence of antigen was found to be sufficient to prevent the induction of anergy. After culture with IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7, Jak3 kinase was tyrosine-phosphorylated, which correlated with the prevention of anergy. Therefore, a signal through the common γ chain may regulate the decision of T cells to either clonally expand or enter a state of anergy."
https://openalex.org/W2002454175,"Two of four proteins that associated with translocation intermediates during protein import across the outer chloroplast envelope membrane were identified as guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. Both proteins are integral membrane proteins of the outer chloroplast membrane, and both are partially exposed on the chloroplast surface where they were accessible to thermolysin digestion. Engagement of the outer membrane's import machinery by an import substrate was inhibited by slowly hydrolyzable or non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs. Thus, these GTP-binding proteins may function in protein import into chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W2058563502,"Hydroxyurea, a drug widely used in therapy of several human diseases, inhibits deoxynucleotide synthesis--and, consequently, DNA synthesis--by blocking the cellular enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Hydroxyurea inhibits human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) DNA synthesis in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes by decreasing the amount of intracellular deoxynucleotides, thus suggesting that this drug has an antiviral effect. Hydroxyurea has now been shown to block HIV-1 replication in acutely infected primary human lymphocytes (quiescent and activated) and macrophages, as well as in blood cells infected in vivo obtained from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The antiviral effect was achieved at nontoxic doses of hydroxyurea, lower than those currently used in human therapy. Combination of hydroxyurea with the nucleoside analog didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine, or ddl) generated a synergistic inhibitory effect without increasing toxicity. In some instances, inhibition of HIV-1 by hydroxyurea was irreversible, even several weeks after suspension of drug treatment. The indirect inhibition of HIV-1 by hydroxyurea is not expected to generate high rates of escape mutants. Hydroxyurea therefore appears to be a possible candidate for AIDS therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1974325028,"A protein phosphatase was cloned that interacts with a serine-threonine receptor-like kinase, RLK5, from Arabidopsis thaliana. The phosphatase, designated KAPP (kinase-associated protein phosphatase), is composed of three domains: an amino-terminal signal anchor, a kinase interaction (KI) domain, and a type 2C protein phosphatase catalytic region. Association of RLK5 with the KI domain is dependent on phosphorylation of RLK5 and can be abolished by dephosphorylation. KAPP may function as a signaling component in a pathway involving RLK5."
https://openalex.org/W2082607200,"For the understanding of the catalytic function of the RNA hammerhead ribozyme, a three-dimensional model is essential but neither a crystal nor a solution structure has been available. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to study the structure of the ribozyme in solution in order to establish the relative spatial orientation of the three constituent Watson-Crick base-paired helical segments. Synthetic constructs were labeled with the fluorescence donor (5-carboxyfluorescein) and acceptor (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) located at the ends of the strands constituting the ribozyme molecule. The acceptor helix in helix pairs I and III and in II and III was varied in length from 5 to 11 and 5 to 9 base pairs, respectively, and the FRET efficiencies were determined and correlated with a reference set of labeled RNA duplexes. The FRET efficiencies were predicted on the basis of vector algebra analysis, as a function of the relative helical orientations in the ribozyme constructs, and compared with experimental values. The data were consistent with a Y-shaped arrangement of the ribozyme with helices I and II in close proximity and helix III pointing away. These orientational constraints were used for molecular modeling of a three-dimensional structure of the complete ribozyme."
https://openalex.org/W2003520876,"Drug-induced lupus is a serious side effect of certain medications, but the chemical features that confer this property and the underlying pathogenesis are puzzling. Prototypes of all six therapeutic classes of lupus-inducing drugs were highly cytotoxic only in the presence of activated neutrophils. Removal of extracellular hydrogen peroxide before, but not after, exposure of the drug to activated neutrophils prevented cytotoxicity. Neutrophil-dependent cytotoxicity required the enzymatic action of myeloperoxidase, resulting in the chemical transformation of the drug to a reactive product. The capacity of drugs to serve as myeloperoxidase substrates in vitro was associated with the ability to induce lupus in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2038414255,"Long-tailed manakins mate in leks and cooperate in multiyear male-male partnerships. An alpha male is responsible for virtually all mating, whereas a beta male assists in the courtship displays. Such altruism by the beta male poses a problem for evolutionary theory because most theoretical treatments and empirical examples of cooperative behavior involve kin selection or reciprocity. Here it is shown that alpha and beta partners are not relatives and that reciprocity is not involved. Instead, direct, though long-delayed benefits to beta males are demonstrated, which include rare copulations, ascension to alpha status, and female lek fidelity. These benefits maintain this unusual form of male-male cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W1977096318,"Currently Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 20 million people worldwide, can only be definitely diagnosed by histological examination of brain tissue obtained at autopsy or biopsy. There is a great need for an early, noninvasive, sensitive, and easily administered diagnostic test of Alzheimer's disease. Here it is reported that patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease by standard clinical criteria exhibited a marked hypersensitivity in their pupil dilation response to a cholinergic antagonist, tropicamide, placed in their eyes. It was possible to distinguish 18 of 19 individuals (95%) either clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or classified as suspect Alzheimer's individuals by neuropsychological screening from 30 of 32 normal elderly controls (94%)."
https://openalex.org/W2029391886,"The SecA protein is an essential, azide-sensitive component of the bacterial protein translocation machinery. A SecA protein homolog (CPSecA) now identified in pea chloroplasts was purified to homogeneity. CPSecA supported protein transport into thylakoids, the chloroplast internal membrane network, in an azide-sensitive fashion. Only one of three pathways for protein transport into thylakoids uses the CPSecA mechanism. The use of a bacteria-homologous mechanism in intrachloroplast protein transport provides evidence for conservative sorting of proteins within chloroplasts."

https://openalex.org/W2039917407,"Optical imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution of neural activity in rat cortical slices was used to investigate the dynamics of signal transmission through neural connections in the visual cortex. When inhibition due to γ-aminobutyric acid was slightly suppressed, horizontal propagation of excitation in both the supra- and infragranular layers became prominent. This propagation was not affected by vertical cuts in either the supra- or infragranular layer, which suggests that excitation is at least partially conveyed horizontally by reciprocal vertical connections between neurons in these layers."
https://openalex.org/W2036273359,"The venom of the funnel-web spider Agelenopsis aperta contains several peptides that paralyze prey by blocking voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Two peptides, omega-Aga-IVB (IVB) and omega-Aga-IVC (IVC), have identical amino acid sequences, yet have opposite absolute configurations at serine 46. These toxins had similar selectivities for blocking voltage-sensitive calcium channel subtypes but different potencies for blocking P-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels in rat cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as calcium-45 influx into rat brain synaptosomes. An enzyme purified from venom converts IVC to IVB by isomerizing serine 46, which is present in the carboxyl-terminal tail, from the L to the D configuration. Unlike the carboxyl terminus of IVC, that of IVB was resistant to the major venom protease. These results show enzymatic activities in A. aperta venom being used in an unprecedented strategy for coproduction of necessary neurotoxins that possess enhanced stability and potency."
https://openalex.org/W2037685690,"An activity in human cell extracts is described that repairs DNA with loops of five or more unpaired bases. Repair is strand-specific and is directed by a nick located 5′ or 3′ to the loop. This repair is observed in a colorectal cancer cell line that is devoid of a wild-type hMLH1 gene and is deficient in repair of mismatches. However, a cell line with deletions in both hMSH2 alleles is deficient in repair of both loops and mismatches. Defects in loop repair may be relevant to the repetitive-sequence instability observed in cancers and other hereditary diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2014568288,"The crystal structure of beta-D-cellotetraose shows the same molecule packing as cellulose II, with two antiparallel molecules in the unit cell: For cellulose II, the orientation of the C6-O6 bonds has been described as gauche-trans and trans-gauche, respectively, for the two antiparallel molecules, which otherwise have identical conformations. In contrast, in beta-D-cellotetraose all C6-O6 bonds are gauche-trans, but the conformations of the two antiparallel molecules are different. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics studies suggest that the structure of cellulose II should be reinvestigated in light of these findings."
