https://openalex.org/W1989165300,"The hydration rates of 12 obsidian samples of different chemical compositions were measured at temperatures from 95 degrees to 245 degrees C. An expression relating hydration rate to temperature was derived for each sample. The SiO(2) content and refractive index are related to the hydration rate, as are the CaO, MgO, and original water contents. With this information it is possible to calculate the hydration rate of a sample from its silica content, refractive index, or chemical index and a knowledge of the effective temperature at which the hydration occurred. The effective hydration temperature can be either measured or approximated from weather records. Rates have been calculated by both methods, and the results show that weather records can give a good approximation to the true EHT, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. If one determines the EHT by any of the methods suggested, and also measures or knows the rate of hydration of the particular obsidian used, it should be possible to carry out absolute dating to +/- 10 percent of the true age over periods as short as several years and as long as millions of years."

An expedition was organized to observe the event in the waters off Peru and Ecuador during two cruises in order to study its occurrence and its development with time. During the first cruise a massive transgression of warm low salinity water across the equator to 4 degrees S was observed, as well as a depression of the thermocline along the equator and off the coast of South America, indicating the start of El Niño development. During the second cruise the oceanographic situation had changed and conditions were returning to normal."

The note which follows, admittedly incomplete, is published in this form because the subject is one which I can not pursue and which may be of interest to those who are actively enagaged in the study of language."
https://openalex.org/W1976944461,"When anthers of henbane containing uninucleate pollen grains were cultured, a large number of embryoids originated exclusively from the division of the generative cell. In a small proportion of pollen grains, both generative and vegetative cells contributed to embryoid formation. Embryogenesis by segmentation of the vegetative cell alone was rarely observed."
https://openalex.org/W2050129424,The 115-gigahertz microwave line of carbon monoxide has been detected in the spectrum of Venus. The measurement proves that the carbon monoxide mixing ratio increases above an altitude of 85 kilometers in the Venus stratosphere and provides quantitative information on carbon monoxide in the altitude region from 80 to 110 kilometers. This altitude region is well above that which has been previously sensed.
https://openalex.org/W2014569077,Panhandling was used to study sharing of resources. Male panhandlers were more successful in spring than in autumn. Female panhandlers were more successful than males in autumn. Panhandlers were generally successful only when submissively approaching individuals who were eating. Families and male-female pairs were resistant to panhandling. The results are discussed in terms of reciprocal altruism and kinship selection.
