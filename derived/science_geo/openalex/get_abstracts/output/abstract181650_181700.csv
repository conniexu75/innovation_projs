https://openalex.org/W1985425785,"Studies in invertebrates have led to the identification of a number of genes that regulate lifespan, some of which encode components of the insulin or insulin-like signalling pathways. Examples include the related tyrosine kinase receptors InR (Drosophila melanogaster) and DAF-2 (Caenorhabditis elegans) that are homologues of the mammalian insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R). To investigate whether IGF-1R also controls longevity in mammals, we inactivated the IGF-1R gene in mice (Igf1r). Here, using heterozygous knockout mice because null mutants are not viable, we report that Igf1r(+/-) mice live on average 26% longer than their wild-type littermates (P < 0.02). Female Igf1r(+/-) mice live 33% longer than wild-type females (P < 0.001), whereas the equivalent male mice show an increase in lifespan of 16%, which is not statistically significant. Long-lived Igf1r(+/-) mice do not develop dwarfism, their energy metabolism is normal, and their nutrient uptake, physical activity, fertility and reproduction are unaffected. The Igf1r(+/-) mice display greater resistance to oxidative stress, a known determinant of ageing. These results indicate that the IGF-1 receptor may be a central regulator of mammalian lifespan."

Here we show that the SUMO conjugation system operates in plants through a characterization of theArabidopsis SUMO pathway. An eight-gene family encoding the SUMO tag was discovered as were genes encoding the various enzymes required for SUMO processing, ligation, and release. A diverse array of conjugates could be detected, some of which appear to be SUMO isoform-specific. The levels of SUMO1 and -2 conjugates but not SUMO3 conjugates increased substantially following exposure of seedlings to stress conditions, including heat shock, H2O2, ethanol, and the amino acid analog canavanine. The heat-induced accumulation could be detected within 2 min from the start of a temperature upshift, suggesting that SUMO1/2 conjugation is one of the early plant responses to heat stress. Overexpression of SUMO2 enhanced both the steady state levels of SUMO2 conjugates under normal growth conditions and the subsequent heat shock-induced accumulation. This accumulation was dampened in an Arabidopsis line engineered for increased thermotolerance by overexpressing the cytosolic isoform of the HSP70 chaperonin. Taken together, the SUMO conjugation system appears to be a complex and functionally heterogeneous pathway for protein modification in plants with initial data indicating that one important function may be in stress protection and/or repair.

SUMO-activating enzyme SUMO-conjugating enzyme SUMO ligase ubiquitin small ubiquitin-like modifier expressed sequence tag reverse transcribed heat shock protein heat shock cytosolic protein heat shock transcription factor Post-translational modifications of proteins play a critical role in most cellular processes through their unique ability to alter rapidly and reversibly the functions of preexisting proteins, multiprotein complexes, and intracellular structures. Although originally thought to be restricted to small molecules like phosphate and sugars, emerging data now show that several distinct types of polypeptide tags are important modifiers as well (1Vierstra R.D. Callis J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3Hay R.T.

Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These polypeptides become covalently attached to various intracellular targets via mechanistically similar ATP-dependent reaction cascades involving activation (E1s)1 and conjugation (E2s) enzymes. Sometimes an additional enzyme (E3s) also participates in target recognition and ligation. Ultimately, a protein conjugate is formed bearing the tag linked via an isopeptide bond between its C-terminal glycine and free lysyl ε-amino groups within the target. Depending on the tag and/or the target protein, the function, location, and/or half-life of the target can be affected. A family of tag-specific proteases also participates in each of the pathways. These proteases help generate the active form of the tag by removing extra residues that cap the C-terminal glycine of the polypeptide and/or are used to disassemble conjugates by cleaving the isopeptide bond between the tag and the target, thus releasing each in an unmodified form. The most pervasive and best understood tag is the 76-amino acid polypeptide ubiquitin (Ub) (5Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar, 6Callis J. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Its main function is to become attached post-translationally to proteins destined for degradation. In most cases, a poly-Ub chain is assembled on the target via reiterative rounds of conjugation. These poly-ubiquitinated intermediates are then recognized by the 26 S proteasome, a protease complex with broad specificity that degrades the target with the concomitant release of the Ub moieties undigested. In other cases, a single Ub is added. These mono-ubiquitinated intermediates help affect vesicular trafficking and shuttle short lived membrane proteins to the lysosome/vacuole where they are degraded by resident proteases (7Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). More recently, a family of polypeptides distantly related to Ub calledsmall ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs; also known as sentrin, Smt3, ULP, and PIC1) has emerged as a second influential modifier (2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These ∼100-amino acid tags are only 8–15% identical to Ub but fold into a similar globular structure with a flexible protruding C-terminal tail that ends in the glycine necessary for target ligation (8Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Like Ub, SUMOs are synthesized as inactive precursors that require processing by specific protease(s) to expose this glycine. SUMOs then employ an E1 → E2 → E3 conjugation scheme similar to ubiquitination (Fig. 1) but appear to impart unique non-proteolytic functions to the target (2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although most targets are modified by a single SUMO moiety, others can bear chains of SUMOs polymerized by concatenation of the individual SUMOs through a specific lysine in each unit (9Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). By analysis of conjugation mutants and the identification of specific targets, it has become apparent that SUMOs play an influential role in various cellular processes in yeast and animals by regulating protein-protein interactions and subcellular location or by antagonizing ubiquitination (2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3Hay R.T. Trends Biochem.

Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For example, both SUMO and all the enzymes in the ligation pathway are essential in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the corresponding temperature-sensitive mutants arrest at the G2/M transition, implicating a critical role for SUMO in the cell cycle (10Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 11Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Sumolation of RanGAP1 in animals directs its relocation from the cytosol to the nuclear pore complex where it activates the Ran GTPase, a regulator of nuclear protein transport (14Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A number of DNA-binding proteins are SUMO targets, including p53, c-Jun, c-Myb, AP-2, the androgen receptor, and the heat shock transcription factors (HSF)-1 and -2 (15Eloranta J.J. Hurst H.C. J.

In some cases sumolation localizes the proteins to nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies or increases their ability to activate gene expression. In mammalian culture cells, the levels of SUMO conjugates are increased by heat shock, oxidative stress, and DNA-damaging agents, suggesting a role in stress protection (22Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the various SUMO targets have identified a consensus binding motif, ΨKXE, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic amino acid, K is the lysine to which SUMO is conjugated, X is any amino acid, and E is glutamic acid (2Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). For the cytosolic inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα, the same lysine can be either sumolated or ubiquitinated, suggesting in some cases that SUMO conjugation blocks Ub attachment and thus protects proteins from degradation (24Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In plants, little is known about the SUMO pathway or the nature of its targets. In preliminary studies, we identified a family ofArabidopsis genes that encode proteins substantially similar to yeast and animal SUMOs (1Vierstra R.D. Callis J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunoblots with anti-SUMO1 antibodies detected a plethora of SUMO conjugates in a variety of plant species, indicating that the conjugation cascade is present as well. More recent data suggested that SUMO conjugation plays an important role in plant defense. Hanania et al. (25Hanania U. Furman-Matarasso N. Ron M. Avni A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) isolated a tomato SUMO gene in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with ethylene-inducing xylanase from the fungus Trichoderma viride. This xylanase is a strong elicitor of the rapid defense response in tomato. Orth et al. (26Orth K. Xu Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) identified AvrBsT in the plant pathogen Xantomonas campestris as a potential SUMO protease. AvrBsT enters its hosts via a type III secretion system where it then interferes with the host defense response, possibly by de-sumolating a key defense regulator. To understand further the roles of sumolation in plants, we have begun to characterize the SUMO pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana(1Vierstra R.D. Callis J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of many of the core components, including eight genes encoding the full-length SUMO tag and the predicted E1, E2, E3, and SUMO proteases required for SUMO processing, ligation, and conjugate disassembly. Immunoblot analysis with isoform-specific antibodies against SUMO1/2 and -3 detected different profiles of conjugates in crude Arabidopsis extracts, indicating that the individual SUMOs have distinct targets. The array of SUMO1/2 conjugates are substantially increased in plantaby exposing seedlings to heat shock, H2O2, ethanol, and canavanine, with the kinetics of accumulation suggesting that sumolation by SUMO1/2 has an early role in the plant stress response. Arabidopsis genes encoding SUMOs (SUMs), SUMO-activating enzyme (E1: SAE1 and-2), SUMO-conjugating enzyme (E2: SCE), SUMO ligase (E3: SIZ1), and SUMO proteases (ULPs) were identified by Blast searches (27Altschul S.F.

Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar)). Gene structures for SUM1–3, SAE1a-b,SAE2, SCE1a-b, and SIZ1 were determined by comparison of chromosomal DNA sequences with those obtained from full-length cDNAs provided from the expressed sequence tag (EST) database or by reverse-transcribed (RT)-PCR. Sequences not yet described were deposited in the GenBankTMdatabase under accession numbers AF510519 (SUM1), AF510520(SUM2), AF510521 (SUM3), AF510522(SUM5), AF510523 (SAE1a), AF510524(SAE1b), and AF510525 (SAE2). The structures of the remaining loci were predicted from partial cDNAs (when available) and comparisons with Arabidopsis, yeast, and animal relatives. Sequences were analyzed using the ClustalW algorithm (www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). Multiple sequence alignments and neighbor joining analyses were displayed using SeqVu 1.0 (The Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia) and the Njplot programs ([email protected]), respectively. Protein domains were identified by the Smart prediction program (smart.embl-heidelberg.de), and sequence homology was detected by Block Maker (blocks.fhcrc.org/blocks/blockmkr/make_blocks.html). A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 tissues were obtained from plants grown on soil at 22 °C in continuous light. For the stress treatments, plants were grown at 24 °C in liquid Gamborg's B5 medium (Invitrogen) in continuous light with shaking (100 rpm) after a 4 °C stratification for 2 days. To initiate temperature stress, cultures where transferred to shaking water baths preset to the designated temperatures. For chemical treatments, compounds were added directly into the liquid culture medium. Antibodies were raised against full-length recombinant Arabidopsis SUMO1 and -3. The full-length SUM1 and SUM3 cDNAs were generated by PCR using either the cDNA (SUM1) or a RT-PCR product from total RNA isolated from A. thalianaCol-0 (SUM3) as the templates. The 5′ and 3′ primers were designed to introduce NdeI and XhoI sites orNdeI and SmaI sites at the predicted start and stop codons, respectively. The SUM1 cDNA was inserted into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and mobilized into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Following a 3-h induction at 37 °C with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the clarified extract was heated to 90 °C for 30 min and clarified, and the supernatant was subjected to Sephadex G-75 column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The SUMO1-containing eluate, which represented a nearly homogeneous preparation as determined by SDS-PAGE, was injected directly into rabbits. For SUMO3, the RT-PCR product was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), released as aNdeI/SmaI fragment, and then introduced into the pTYB2 vector linearized with SmaI and NdeI for expression in E. coli as an intein/chitin-binding protein fusion (IMPACT I, New England Biolabs). Following a 3-h induction at 37 °C, the BL21(DE3) cells were lysed, and total soluble protein was applied to a chitin column according to manufacturer's recommendations (New England Biolabs). The bound protein was treated with 30 mm dithioerythritol for 12 h at 4 °C. The intein cleavage product was eluted, heated for 30 min at 90 °C, and separated from precipitated proteins by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-75 column; the SUMO3-containing fractions were used directly as the antigen. Anti-SUMO1 antibodies were affinity-purified from serum by adsorption to SUMO1 protein coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad). Anti-SUMO3 antibodies were purified by protein A affinity chromatography (Sigma). The anti-Ub antibody, anti-PBA1 antiserum, and anti-HSP101 antiserum were described previously (33Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 34Hong S.W. Vierling E. Plant J. 2001; 27: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses were performed as described (33Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), using proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder and probed with antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% milk powder. Detection employed either alkaline phosphatase- or peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) in conjunction with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or Super Signal chemiluminescence (Pierce) and X-Omat autoradiographic film (Eastman Kodak), respectively. Immunolocalization was performed as described using thin sections of developing Arabidopsis embryos (35Lynn K. Fernandez A. Aida M. Sedbrook J. Tasaka M. Masson P. Barton M.K. Development. 1999; 126: 469-481PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were probed with preimmune antiserum or anti-SUMO1 antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibodies against rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and visualized by fluorescence confocal microscopy. DNA was detected by staining the sections with the TO-PRO 3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Purified recombinant SUMO1 was 32P-labeled using protein kinase A (Sigma) as described (36Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and separated from unincorporated 32P by filtration on a NAP10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Plant extracts were prepared by homogenizing pulverized frozen tissue in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm Na4EDTA, 300 mm sucrose, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (37Bates P.W. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 1999; 20: 183-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (100 μl) contained 0.5 μg of 32P-SUMO1 and either an ATP-regenerating or an ATP-depleting system (38Hatfield P.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 735-742Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the reactions were quenched by addition of SDS sample buffer, and the products were visualized by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. The coding region for SUM2 was PCR-amplified from the full-length cDNA using primers designed to introduceXbaI sites at both ends (underlined) 5′-CCCGCGAATCTCTCTAGAGGCTTCGCTTATATC and 3′-CCATTAAAATAATCTAGAGTAAAAGCAGAAGAGCTT. The product was digested with XbaI and inserted into theXbaI-linearized binary T-DNA vector pGSVE9 immediately downstream of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35Spromoter (33Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The 35S-SUM2 construction was introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AtC58RifR(pMP90), which was then used to transform A. thaliana ectotype Col-0 by the floral dip method (33Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Initial transformants and selfed T2 progeny were identified by hygromycin resistance. The T3 progenies homozygous for hygromycin resistance were confirmed to overexpress SUMO2 by immunoblot analysis with anti-SUMO1 antibodies. Homozygous T3 and T4 plants overexpressing the HSC70-1cDNA under the direction of the Figwort Mosaic Virus promoter and the Nopaline Synthase 3′ end were created (lines 8–7 and 8–9 as described). 2D.-Y.

Previous studies by us and others (1Vierstra R.D. Callis J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Hanania U. Furman-Matarasso N. Ron M. Avni A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) indicated that plants express SUMOs and likely much of the associated conjugation/deconjugation pathway. For a more comprehensive analysis, we used yeast and animal genes encoding various SUMO pathway components as queries to search for orthologs in theArabidopsis protein and DNA databases. Our initial search identified nine Arabidopsis SUM genes that encode all or part of the canonical SUMO sequence (TableI). The similarity of their intron/exon structures suggested that the Arabidopsis SUM family evolved recently from a common progenitor. With the exception ofSUM5 and SUM9, each contains two introns interrupting the coding region at the same location (Fig.2 A). For SUM5, the first intron is absent. For SUM9, the first exon is absent; the remaining coding region contains a number of in-frame stop codons, suggesting that this locus is a pseudogene. Interestingly, six of the nine SUM loci (SUM2 and -3,SUM4 and -6 (on chromosome 5), andSUM7 and -8 (on chromosome 4)) are arranged as tandem pairs in the genome without apparent intervening genes (Fig.2 A).Table IComponents of the SUMO pathway in ArabidopsisProtein activityGeneChromosomeAGI no.aAGI, Arabidopsis Genome Initative; NA, not yet annotated.Expression (ESTs)bExpression confirmed by the presence of ESTs (number shown in parentheses) in the Arabidopsis database (www.arabidopsis.org) and/or by RT-PCR of Arabidopsis total RNA.SUMOAtSUM14At4g26840Yes (13)AtSUM25At5g55160Yes (9)AtSUM35At5g55170Yes (0)AtSUM45At5g48170NoAtSUM52At2g32760Yes (3)AtSUM65At5g48700NoAtSUM74NANoAtSUM84NANoAtSUM94NANoE1AtSAE1a4At4g24940Yes (6)AtSAE1b5At5g50580Yes (13)AtSAE22At2g21470Yes (4)E2AtSCE1a3At3g57870Yes (9)AtSCE1b5At5g02240cAnnotated as part of this open reading frame.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequence comparisons showed that the ArabidopsisSUMOs are 32–86% similar to each other but only 17–25% similar toArabidopsis Ub and RUB1. When compared with yeast Smt3 and human SUMO-1 (9Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), the Arabidopsis SUMO family is 31–54% similar. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the eight full-lengthArabidopsis SUMO proteins into five subfamilies: SUMO1/2, SUMO3, SUMO5, SUMO4/6, and SUMO7/8 (Fig. 2 B). Given thatSUM4/6 and SUM7/8 genes are arranged in tandem, it is likely these pairs arose from regional duplications of the respective chromosomes. Clustal analysis failed to group any of theArabidopsis SUMO proteins with animal and yeast versions (Fig. 2 B). For example, SUMO1 is equally related to human SUMO-1, -2, and -3 (42, 42, and 40% similar, respectively). This prevented the assignment of orthologous polypeptides and suggested that the Arabidopsis subfamilies arose after the evolutionary split of the animal, fungal, and plant kingdoms. Sequence alignments of an array of Arabidopsis, human,Drosophila, and yeast SUMO proteins showed that the central region is most conserved (Fig. 2 C). This region encompasses the “Ub fold” recently identified as a three-dimensional structure common among plant and animal Ubs, yeast RUB1, rat SUMO-1, and the autophagy polypeptide tag APG8 (or GATE-16) (8Bayer P.

https://openalex.org/W2135196225,"Caspase-3 is a member of the cysteine protease family, which plays a crucial role in apoptotic pathways by cleaving a variety of key cellular proteins. Caspase-3 can be activated by diverse death-inducing signals, including the chemotherapeutic agents. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of caspase-3 expression in breast tumor samples and to determine whether alterations in its expression can affect their ability to undergo apoptosis. Primary breast tumor and normal breast parenchyma samples were obtained from patients undergoing breast surgery and the expression of caspases-3 was studied. Similarly, normal mammary epithelial cells and several established mammary cancer cell lines were studied for caspases-3 expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, and Western blot analysis. Approximately 75% of the tumor as well as morphologically normal peritumoral tissue samples lacked the caspase-3 transcript and caspase-3 protein expression. In addition, the caspases-3 mRNA levels in commercially available total RNA samples from breast, ovarian, and cervical tumors were either undetectable (breast and cervical) or substantially decreased (ovarian). Despite the complete loss of caspase-3, the expression levels of other caspases, such as caspase-8 and caspase-9, were normal in all of the tumor samples studied. The sensitivity of caspase-3-deficient breast cancer (MCF-7) cells to undergo apoptosis in response to doxorubicin and other apoptotic stimuli could be augmented by reconstituting caspase-3 expression. These results suggest that the loss of caspases-3 expression may represent an important cell survival mechanism in breast cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W1993398538,"The human genomic sequencing effort has revealed the presence of a large number of Rho GTPases encoded by the human genome. Here we report the characterization of a new family of Rho GTPases with atypical features. These proteins, which were called Miro-1 and Miro-2 (for mitochondrialRho), have tandem GTP-binding domains separated by a linker region containing putative calcium-binding EF hand motifs.

These data indicate a novel role for Rho-like GTPases in mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis. Small GTPases have been shown to be pivotal signaling intermediates in cell growth, cell cycle progression, cell survival, cell transformation, and cell trafficking (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Google Scholar). The potential of small GTPases to function as signaling switches resides in their ability to cycle between active, GTP-bound states, and inactive, GDP-bound states. This cycling is regulated in a precise manner by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (4Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar), GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; EST, expressed sequence tag; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; JNK/SAPK, Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; EST, expressed sequence tag; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; JNK/SAPK, Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone (5Zalcman G.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors stimulate the replacement of GDP by GTP, whereas GTPase-activating proteins stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of the GTPase. GDIs act by blocking GDP dissociation, and in resting cells, Rho GTPases are thought to reside in an inactive complex with RhoGDI. According to this model, cell stimulation leads to a dissociation of the complex, resulting in the subsequent activation of the released Rho GTPase (6Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene ras was the first small GTPase to be identified over 20 years ago (see Ref. 7Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Google Scholar and references therein); however, the recently published draft of the human genome indicate the presence of roughly 150 genes encoding small GTPases (8Venter C.J. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Google Scholar, 9International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Google Scholar). Among these genes, the rho subfamily has been shown to be involved specifically in regulating the morphogenic and motile properties of vertebrate cells, primarily by affecting the actin filament system (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Google Scholar). Most of our current knowledge regarding the Rho GTPases originates from work on the triad RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, which have each been found to regulate distinct actin-containing structures. RhoA regulates the formation of focal adhesions and the subsequent assembly of stress fibers (10Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar); Rac1 regulates the formation of membrane lamellae or lamellipodia (11Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar), and Cdc42 triggers the outgrowth of peripheral spike-like protrusions, also known as filopodia (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). However, over the years, it has become evident that the Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation of several additional cellular processes. Rac1 and Cdc42 participate in transcriptional control via the Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38MAPK signaling cascades; RhoA has a role in serum-response factor-regulated gene transcription, and all three contribute to transcriptional activation via NFκB signaling pathway (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Rho GTPases are also participants in signaling pathways that control cell cycle progression and apoptosis (13Aznar S. Lacal J.C. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 1-10Google Scholar). So far, 20 distinct genes encoding family members of Rho GTPases have been identified. These genes can be further divided into seven subgroups: cdc42 (consisting of cdc42, tc10, tcl, chp, and wrch1/chp2), rac (rac1, rac2, rac3, and rhoG), rho (rhoA, rhoB,and rhoC), rnd (rnd1, rnd2, andrnd3), rhoD (rhoD and rif), and rhoH (see Ref. 14Aspenström P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Google Scholar and references therein and Refs.15Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Landopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Blagny A. Fort P. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Google Scholar). The seventh subgroup is formed by three additionalrho-like genes, called kiaa0740, kiaa0717, andkiaa0878, which have been identified by the Kazusa Institute in Japan (18Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Google Scholar). These genes encode human orthologs of theDrosophila melanogaster rhoBTB gene, suggesting that more appropriate names for them would be rhoBTB1, rhoBTB2, and rhoBTB3, respectively (18Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Google Scholar, 19Rivero F. Dislich H. Glöckner G. Noegel A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1068-1079Google Scholar). The work in this article describes a novel subgroup of the Rho GTPases. This subgroup is formed by two Rho-like genes, which were named Miro (for mitochondrial Rho). These genes encode proteins that are similar to the Rho GTPases in their N-terminal GTPase domains, but in addition they contain potential calcium-binding motifs, so called EF-hands (20Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Google Scholar, 21Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Google Scholar), and an additional putative GTPase domain in the C terminus which is diverged from the Rho GTPases. Data presented in this report showed that ectopically expressed Miro-1 and Miro-2, as well as endogenous Miro-1, are present at mitochondria. Furthermore, transient transfection of a constitutively active Miro-1 (Miro-1/Val-13) destroyed the mitochondrial network, which collapsed into perinuclear assemblies; moreover, it resulted in an increased apoptosis rate. These data suggested a role for Miro proteins in mitochondrial homeostasis and in apoptosis. Miro-1 and Miro-2 were identified by searching the public DNA and protein data bases for novel members of the Rho GTPases employing the Blast search motor. The translated amino acid sequence for Miro-1 and Miro-2 were then used to search EST data bases for the presence of EST clones encoding putative full-length Miro-1 and Miro-2, and two such clones were obtained from the UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre in Hinxton, Cambridge, UK. The nucleotide sequences of Miro-1 and -2 have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base with accession numbers AJ517412(Miro-1) and AJ517413 (Miro-2). DNA fragments encoding full-length Miro-1 and Miro-2 were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pRK5Myc vector. The Miro-1/Val-13 and Miro-1/Asn-18 mutants were generated employing the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene) according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer. The fidelity of all DNA constructs was conformed by DNA sequencing employing the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. cDNA probes of the open reading frame of Miro-1 and Miro-2, respectively, were labeled with [32P]dCTP employing the rediprime labeling kit (AmershamBiosciences). The probes were thereafter hybridized to hybridization-ready Northern blots (Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot, Clontech) according to the ExpressHyb (Clontech) protocol provided by the manufacturer. NIH3T3 cells and COS 7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For immunostaining purposes, cells were seeded on coverslips and transfected by LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Transfections of COS 7 cells for immunoprecipitation purposes were performed by the DEAE-dextran method essentially as described before (22Richnau N. Aspenström P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35060-35070Google Scholar). Metabolic 35S labeling of Miro-1 was performed as described before (22Richnau N. Aspenström P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35060-35070Google Scholar). Miro-1 immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fixed for 15 min in 25% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid. The gels were thereafter dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager (Fujix BAS 2000). A Miro-1-specific antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated Miro-1-specific peptide representing amino acid residues 560–574 of human Miro-1. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to determine the subcellular localization of Myc-tagged Miro-1 and Miro-2 as well as Miro-1 mutants. The mouse monoclonal M30 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to stain apoptotic cells. MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) and a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen) were used according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer to visualize mitochondria, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI) was used to visualize nuclei. Filamentous actin was visualized by TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Microtubules were visualized by a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The following secondary antibodies were used: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse, FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit, TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (Dako), and a TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK were obtained from Calbiochem. For the immunocytochemistry, transiently transfected NIH3T3 and COS 7 cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were thereafter washed again and incubated in the presence of 5% FCS in PBS for 30 min. Primary as well as secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% FCS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies for intervals of 1 h with a washing step in between. The coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) on object slides. Cells were photographed by a Hamamatsu ORCA CCD digital camera employing the QED Imaging System software using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope. Searches in the public genomic DNA sequence data bases generated by the human genome projects implicated the presence of several novel members of the Rho GTPases (8Venter C.J. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Google Scholar,9International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Google Scholar). Expressed sequence tag (EST) clones, encoding two putative Rho GTPases, were obtained. Sequence analysis demonstrated that these clones encoded two related Rho GTPases, which were named Miro-1 and Miro-2, respectively. Miro-1 and Miro-2 were found to be 60% identical to each other, and both proteins encoded polypeptides of 618 amino acid residues with predicted molecular masses of 70 kDa (Fig.1, A and B). The amino acid sequence of Miro-1 and -2 revealed an unusual domain organization; the N-terminal part encoded a GTPase domain, which is related to the Rho GTPases (Fig. 1 C). This domain was followed by two EF hands (Fig. 1 D), a type of domain that confers binding to calcium ions (20Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Google Scholar, 21Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a second potential GTP-binding domain, but in this case without homology to the Rho GTPases, was found in the C terminus (Fig. 1 E). In addition, Miro lacks a so-called CAAX motif, a domain usually found in the C termini of small GTPases. The CAAXmotif undergoes post-translational isoprenylation, a modification that confers membrane targeting of the protein. The unusual domain organization of Miro implicates that the proteins are regulated in a manner distinct from the archetypal Rho GTPases.Figure 1Primary structure of Miro.

X-Y-ZG#Ix—z marks the consensus calcium-binding motif typical for EF hands (20Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Google Scholar, 21Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J.

F, dendritic tree representation of the similarity of all currently known Miro proteins.G, Northern blot analysis of human Miro-1 and Miro-2 expression in the human tissues depicted in the panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, data base searches demonstrated the presence of genes, orthologous to Miro, in several eukaryotic organisms includingSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana,and D. melanogaster (Fig. 1 F). This observation indicated that the Miro genes evolved early during evolution. Northern blot analysis, employing human multiple tissue Northern blots, demonstrated the presence of Miro mRNA in most human tissue (Fig. 1 G). Miro-1 mRNA of a size of 3 kb was abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and Miro-2 mRNA of 2.4 kb was abundant in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 1 G). The Rho GTPases have been shown to have a major impact on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Google Scholar). For this reason the effect on the cytoskeletal organization by ectopic expression of Miro-1 and -2 was studied. Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged Miro-1 and Miro-2 were transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells after which Miro expression was visualized by a Myc-specific antibody, whereas filamentous actin was visualized with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. Microtubules were visualized by an antibody against α-tubulin. Neither Miro-1 nor Miro-2 expression visibly affected the organization of the actin filament system (Fig. 2, A andC) or the microtubules (Fig. 2, B andD). Interestingly, it was noticed that Miro staining followed a very distinct pattern; both Miro-1 and Miro-2 were organized in worm-like structures in a manner reminiscent of the mitochondrial network (Fig. 2). A Miro construct expressing only the N-terminal GTPase domain did not localize into such worm-like structures, instead this deletion mutant was dispersed evenly in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 2 E). In order to test if the localization of Miro coincided with mitochondria, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-Miro-1 and co-stained with the mitochondria marker MitoTracker Green FM. Miro-1 overlapped to a large extent with the MitoTracker staining, suggesting that Miro-1 is present at the mitochondria (Fig. 2 F, detail). Transiently transfected Miro-2 colocalized with mitochondrial marker in a similar fashion (data not shown). In addition, Myc-Miro-1 staining colocalized with the mitochondria protein cytochrome c, further emphasizing the notion of Miro as a mitochondria-associated protein (Fig. 2 G). A peptide derived from the C terminus of Miro-1 was synthesized and used to raise a Miro-1-specific antiserum in rabbits. The antiserum was affinity-purified over a column of Sulfolink-conjugated Miro-1-specific peptide. The antiserum, as well as the affinity-purified antibody, was tested in immunoprecipitation experiments employing lysates from35S-labeled COS 7 cells transiently transfected with Myc-Miro-1. The Miro-1 antiserum and the affinity-purified antibody, as well as the Myc antibody, precipitated a band of 70 kDa. This band was neither precipitated by pre-immune serum nor with the Miro-1 antiserum pre-blocked with the antigenic Miro-1-specific peptide (Fig. 3 A). Next, a number of cell lines were tested for expression of Miro-1 by Western blotting. Human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep G2 cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells contained high levels of Miro-1, whereas NIH3T3 fibroblasts and COS 7 cells expressed lower levels of Miro-1 (Fig.3 B). Hep G2 and HEK293T cells grow in a fashion that made visualization of their mitochondria difficult. For this reason, despite the lower expression of Miro-1, COS 7 cells turned out to be more useful for immunocytochemical analysis of the mitochondrial network. The Miro-1-specific antibody was used to stain COS 7 cells in order to examine if endogenous protein was localized to mitochondria. The staining pattern overlapped to a large extent with cytochromec; moreover, the Miro-1-specific staining was quenched by pre-treatment with the blocking peptide. Collectively, these observations strongly suggested that endogenous Miro-1 is indeed a mitochondrial protein (Fig. 3 C). Studies employing constitutive active and dominant negative mutants of Rho GTPases have been extensively used to examine the involvement of these proteins in numerous signal transduction pathways (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Google Scholar). In analogy with the mutation employed for studies of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, we made a constitutive active mutant Miro-1 in which the amino acid residue at position 13 was replaced with a valine. This mutation locks the GTPase in a GTP-bound conformation. By the same analogy, a dominant negative Miro-1 was made by mutating codon 18 to an asparagine, a mutation that locks the GTPase in a GDP-bound conformation. Myc-Miro-1/Asn-18 or Myc-Miro-1/Val-13 was transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells or into COS 7 cells. The overexpression of Miro mutants had no obvious effects on the cell morphology or on the organization of the actin filament system or the microtubules (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, the Miro-1/Val-13 staining was altered in a striking manner compared with wt-Miro-1. The Miro-1/Val-13-expressing cells had lost the mitochondrial network, and instead Miro-1/Val-13 was localized into large perinuclear assemblies in both NIH3T3 (data not shown) and COS 7 cells (Fig. 4 B). Co-staining with MitoTracker Green FM indicated that the mitochondrial network had in fact collapsed in these cells, and instead the mitochondria were organized in these perinuclear assemblies (Fig. 4 B). Myc-Miro-1/Asn-18 expressing cells appeared less affected, and a majority of the cells exhibited a normal mitochondrial network; however, some cells with condensed mitochondria were seen also under these conditions (Fig. 4 B,arrowhead). These data suggested that the GTP/GDP loaded status of Miro-1 was important for the heterogeneity of the mitochondrial network and hence the mitochondrial homeostasis. We next studied if cytochrome c was still present in the collapsed mitochondrial membranes. Cytochrome c has been shown to be released from the mitochondria during apoptosis (23Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar); therefore, COS 7 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-Miro-1 or Myc-Miro-1/Val-13 and analyzed for Myc-Miro-1 expression and cytochromec localization 24 and 48 h post-transfection. In Myc-Miro-1-expressing COS 7 cells the cytochrome ccolocalized exactly with the Myc-Miro-1 (Fig. 4 C) similarly to the transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 2 G). This was further emphasized by confocal microscopy analysis, which demonstrated a colocalization between cytochrome c and Miro-1 (data not shown). Myc-Miro-1/Val-13 overexpression resulted again in a loss of the mitochondrial network. Miro-1/Val-13 was present in the mitochondrial assemblies, but it was also dispersed into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C). The cytochrome c staining was present in the mitochondrial assemblies, but an increased number of cells with cytoplasmic cytochrome c staining were seen after 48 h (Fig. 4 C, arrowhead). Disturbances of mitochondrial homeostasis have been shown to result in an increased rate of apoptosis (24Parone P.A. James D. Martinou J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 105-111Google Scholar). We noticed a clear reduction of Miro-1/Val-13-expressing cells over time, compared with the amount of wt-Miro-1-expressing cells, which could implicate an increased rate of apoptosis in this cell population. For this reason we stained COS 7 cells transiently transfected with Myc-Miro-1, Myc-Miro-1/Val-13, or Myc-Miro-1/Asn-18 with a Myc-specific antibody as well as with the apoptosis marker antibody M30 (which specifically recognizes the caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18). We calculated the amount of M30 positive cells that was also transfected with the Miro-1 mutants. A clear increase in M30 positive cells was noticed in the population of cells expressing Miro-1/Val-13. After 24 h the M30 positive and Myc-Miro-1/Val-13-expressing cells often showed a network of cytokeratin filaments (Fig.5 A). However, after a longer time the M30 staining was confined to dot-like structures, in particular in the frequent rounded up Myc-Miro-1/Val-13-expressing cells (Fig. 5 B). The Miro-1/Val-13 and M30 positive cells also had fragmented nuclei, which could be visualized by DAPI staining (Fig. 5 C). We counted the ratio between M30 positive cells and Myc-Miro-1-expressing cells. In the population of Miro-1/Val-13 33.0% of the cells were apoptotic. In contrast in cells expressing Miro-1 wild type or Asn-18 only 10.7 or 9.2%, respectively, of the cells were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 5 D). The Miro-1/Val-13 induced apoptosis was drastically reduced from 33 to 7.5% when the cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 5D). Treatment of the cells with caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK also reduced the Miro-1/Val-13-induced apoptosis, from 33 to 14.3% (Fig. 5 D), indicating that this response is dependent on the caspase cascade. Collectively, these data implicate that Miro proteins are mitochondrial constituents and that the activity of Miro affects the homeostasis of mitochondria leading to an increased rate of apoptosis. The roles of Cdc42, Rac, or Rho in cell migration and morphogenesis are well documented. A majority of the studies involving Rho GTPases are still focused to this archetypal triad; however, there are increased indications that other Rho GTPases have equally important cellular roles. For example, members of the Rnd subfamily have been suggested to function as antagonists to Rho but, in contrast to Rho, their activation leads to stress fibers breakdown and a decreased attachment to the substratum, thereby causing a rounding up of cells (25Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar). RhoH has been implicated to counteract Rac-dependent activation of the p38MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways (26Li X. Bu X. Lu B. Avraham H. Flavell R.A. Lim B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1158-1171Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoD and Rif appear to have specific roles during membrane trafficking, but they also induce the formation of filopodia, apparently by a mechanism distinct from Cdc42 or the Cdc42-like GTPases (16Ellis S. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1387-1390Google Scholar, 27Murphy C. Saffrich R. Grummt M. Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Google Scholar). Finally, Chp and Wrch1 are two closely related Cdc42 family GTPases that are involved in the formation of peripheral protrusions such as lamellipodia and filopodia (17Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Google Scholar, 28Aronheim A. Broder Y.C. Cohen A. Fritsch A. Belisle B. Abo A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1125-1128Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations form the basis for a model, which suggests that dynamic reorganizations of cellular processes require a tightly balanced regulated activation of different Rho GTPases. Miro proteins are unique not only by means of their size, because they are bigger than the classical small GTPases, but also by the presence of additional protein domain structures. Another group of atypical Rho-like proteins, the RhoBTBs, has also a domain organization that is much different from the other Rho GTPases (19Rivero F. Dislich H. Glöckner G. Noegel A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1068-1079Google Scholar). The RhoBTBs contain, in addition to their N-terminal GTPase domains, two so-called Broad complex, Tramtrack, Bric-à-brac/Poxvirus, and zinc finger domains (29Collins T. Stone J.R. Williams A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Google Scholar). This type of domain was first identified in a number ofDrosophila gene products but were subsequently found in several proteins from yeast to man. Typically, this domain is found in proteins with functions in the regulation of transcription and differentiation; however, the currently available literature does not ascribe any obvious cellular function for RhoBTB (19Rivero F. Dislich H. Glöckner G. Noegel A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1068-1079Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, none of the Rho GTPases have been implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis, and in this respect Miro constitutes a subfamily of Rho GTPases with unique properties. Interestingly, another group of proteins, unrelated to the Rho GTPases but with GTP-binding properties, has been shown to have roles in mitochondrial homeostasis. Work in budding yeast, D. melanogaster and C. elegans, as well as in mammalian cells has identified three conserved GTPases in this process: Fzo/mitofusin, Dnm1/Drp1/Dlp1, and Mgm1/Opa1/MspI (30Westermann B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 527-531Google Scholar, 31Van der Bliek A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F1-F4Google Scholar). Fzo/mitofusin is a transmembrane protein residing on the outside of mitochondria where it regulates fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane during mitochondrial fusion (29Collins T. Stone J.R. Williams A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Google Scholar). The converse process is regulated by Dnm1/Drp1/Dlp1. This protein bears resemblance to dynamins and regulates outer mitochondrial membrane fission (31Van der Bliek A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F1-F4Google Scholar). Yet another dynamin-like molecule, Mgm1/Opa1/MspI, seems to regulate several aspects of inner mitochondrial membrane remodeling. Interestingly, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant form of the mitofusin Mfn2 in COS 7 cells resulted in the formation of a continuous mitochondrial network, presumably caused by a shift in the balance of the mitochondrial dynamics favoring an over activity of mitochondrial fusions (32Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Google Scholar). This observation may relate to the mitochondrial aggregates seen in cells expressing constitutively active Miro-1/Val-13. Thus, these aggregates might be caused by an increase in mitochondrial membrane fusion; however, the exact mechanisms for remains to be studied. Mitochondrial homeostasis is a vital cellular process, and alterations in the intracellular environment that affect mitochondrial function normally triggers the apoptosis program (23Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar). In this respect, the mitochondria are functioning as cellular sensors that, upon the receipt of proapoptotic signals, release factors such as apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, which assist in inducing the caspase cascade (23Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar, 24Parone P.A. James D. Martinou J.C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 105-111Google Scholar). Rho GTPases have been implicated in various aspects of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 13Aznar S. Lacal J.C. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 1-10Google Scholar). For example, Cdc42 is necessary for the nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells (33Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3984-3989Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc42 is a caspase substrate, and mutation of the caspase cleavage site results in a marked protection against Fas ligand-induced apoptosis (34Tu S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19656-19663Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of the constitutively active mutant Miro-1/Val-13 in COS 7 cells increased the apoptotic rate of expressing cells. The exact molecular mechanism for this remains to be studied, but one possible causative might be the altered mitochondrial properties, seen as the aggregation of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, it has been shown that interference of the activity of Dnm1/Drp1/Dlp1 in such a way that the mitochondrial fission was inhibited resulted in decreased apoptosis (35Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Google Scholar), further emphasizing the importance for a correct balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission for cell viability. We have identified an evolutionarily conserved family of Rho GTPases, Miro, with atypical domain organization and unique cellular properties. Experiments employing NIH3T3 fibroblasts and COS 7 cells indicated that Miro is a constituent of mitochondria and that the protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2084583180,"Cyclin D1 is a proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in many cancers including breast and prostate. It plays a role in cell proliferation through activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. Curcumin, a diferuloylmethane, is a chemopreventive agent known to inhibit the proliferation of several breast and prostate cancer cell lines. It is possible that the effect of curcumin is mediated through the regulation of cyclin D1. In the present report we show that inhibition of the proliferation of various prostate, breast and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines by curcumin correlated with the down-regulation of the expression of cyclin D1 protein. In comparison, the down-regulation by curcumin of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 was found only in selective cell lines. The suppression of cyclin D1 by curcumin led to inhibition of CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. We found that curcumin-induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 was inhibited by lactacystin, an inhibitor of 26S proteosome, suggesting that curcumin represses cyclin D1 expression by promoting proteolysis. We found that curcumin also down-regulated mRNA expression, thus suggesting transcriptional regulation. Curcumin also inhibited the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter-dependent reporter gene expression. Overall our results suggest that curcumin down-regulates cyclin D1 expression through activation of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, and this may contribute to the antiproliferative effects of curcumin against various cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2064474659,"In response to DNA damage, the cell cycle checkpoint is an important biological event in maintaining genomic fidelity. Gadd45, a p53-regulated and DNA damage inducible protein, has recently been demonstrated to play a role in the G2-M checkpoint in response to DNA damage. In the current study, we further investigated the biochemical mechanism(s) involved in the GADD45-activated cell cycle G2-M arrest. Using the tetracycline-controlled system (tet-off), we established GADD45-inducible lines in HCT116 (wild-type p53) and Hela (inactivated p53 status) cells. Following inducible expression of the Gadd45 protein, cell growth was strongly suppressed in both HCT116 and Hela cells. Interestingly, HCT116 cells revealed a significant G2-M arrest but Hela cells failed to arrest at the G2-M phases, indicating that the GADD45-activated G2-M arrest requires normal p53 function. The GADD45-induced G2-M arrest was observed independent of p38 kinase activity. Importantly, induction of Gadd45 protein resulted in a reduction of nuclear cyclin B1 protein, whose nuclear localization is critical for the completion of G2-M transition. The reduced nuclear cyclin B1 levels correlated with inhibition of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity. Additionally, overexpression of cyclin B1 substantially abrogated the GADD45-induced cell growth suppression. Therefore, GADD45 inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity through alteration of cyclin B1 subcellular localization may be an essential step in the GADD45-induced cell cycle G2-M arrest and growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2135709160,"Caveolae, specialized flask-shaped lipid rafts on the cell surface, are composed of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and structural proteins termed caveolins; functionally, these plasma membrane microdomains have been implicated in signal transduction and transmembrane transport. In the present study, we examined the role of caveolin-1 in multiple myeloma cells. We show for the first time that caveolin-1, which is usually absent in blood cells, is expressed in multiple myeloma cells. Analysis of myeloma cell-derived plasma membrane fractions shows that caveolin-1 is co-localized with interleukin-6 receptor signal transducing chain gp130 and with insulin-like growth factor-I receptor. Cholesterol depletion by β-cyclodextrin results in the loss of caveola structure in myeloma cells, as shown by transmission electron microscopy, and loss of caveolin-1 function. Interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor-I, growth and survival factors in multiple myeloma, induce caveolin-1 phosphorylation, which is abrogated by pre-treatment with β-cyclodextrin. Importantly, inhibition of caveolin-1 phosphorylation blocks both interleukin-6-induced protein complex formation with caveolin-1 and downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-1 pathway. β-Cyclodextrin also blocks insulin-like growth factor-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin-responsive substrate-1 and downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-1 pathway. Therefore, cholesterol depletion by β-cyclodextrin abrogates both interleukin-6- and insulin-like growth factor-I-triggered multiple myeloma cell survival via negative regulation of caveolin-1. Taken together, this study identifies caveolin-1 and other structural membrane components as potential new therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.

The annual incidence of MM is ∼3.8 per 100,000 population (∼14,400 new cases of MM/year), and it is almost twice as common in the black versus Caucasian population (1Brown L.M. Linet M.S. Greenberg R.S. Silverman D.T. Hayes R.B. Swanson G.M. Schwartz A.G. Schoenberg J.B. Pottern L.M. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Cancer. 1999; 85: 2385-2390Google Scholar). The median age at diagnosis is ∼62 years, and despite current therapeutic approaches, the median survival remains at 3–4 years. New biologically based targeted therapies are therefore urgently needed. Cholesterol is an essential component of MM cell membranes, has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, and represents one such target (2Sato J.D. Kawamoto T. Okamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1761-1766Google Scholar). Cholesterol and sphingolipids form lipid rafts, which represent dynamic assemblies in the otherwise homogeneous, phospholipid-rich two-dimensional lipid layer of the plasma cell membrane. As “liquid-ordered” membranous microdomains, they function as platforms for membrane trafficking and signal transduction, initiating complex protein-protein interactions between ligands, receptors, and kinases in response to intra- and extracellular stimuli (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). However, the role of lipid rafts in MM cell growth and survival in the BM milieu is not yet defined.Caveolae (“little caves”) are specialized lipid raft microdomains forming 50–100 nm flask-shaped vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane, which serve as a scaffold for signaling molecules related to cell adhesion, growth, and survival (4Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar). They are composed of caveolins, 22–24-kDa integral membrane proteins with cytoplasmic N and C termini, and a central intramembrane domain, which forms an unusual hairpin loop structure in the membrane (5Glenney Jr., J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Google Scholar, 6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar). Caveolins are functionally and structurally highly conserved and initiate formation of caveolae from raft-derived components. Specifically, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is required for caveola formation, because caveolae are not formed in the Cav-1 knockout mouse (7Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Google Scholar, 8Razani B. Lisanti M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1553-1561Google Scholar); conversely, caveolin-deficient lymphocytes acquire plasma membrane caveolae when transfected with Cav-1 cDNA (9Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Google Scholar). Three distinct caveolin genes have been identified: caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3; in addition, alternate initiation of translation creates two isoforms of Cav-1, Cav-1α (containing residues 1–178) and Cav-1β (containing residues 32–178). Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are expressed in most cell types, including adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells, whereas caveolin-3 is found specifically in muscle cells. A number of investigators have shown absence of caveolin isoforms in human peripheral blood cells including myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid cell lines (9Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Google Scholar, 10Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Google Scholar, 11Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Google Scholar), but Cav-1 is expressed in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cell lines (12Hatanaka M. Maeda T. Ikemoto T. Mori H. Seya T. Shimizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 382-387Google Scholar). Importantly, diseases including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and muscular dystrophy have also been associated with caveolae (13Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C.

Cancer (Phila.). 2002; 94: 929-933Google Scholar). To date, however, the expression as well as biologic and clinical importance of caveolae and Cav-1 in MM is undefined.Caveolae regulate signal transduction (13Smart E.J. Graf G.A.

Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar); specifically, Cav-1 interacts with lipid-anchored, integral membrane and soluble signaling proteins including Src family tyrosine kinases, G-protein subunit α, endothelial nitric-oxide synthetase, protein kinase C α, Ca2+ pumps, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor. By binding signal transducers within a distinct region of the plasma membrane, caveolin regulates the activation state of caveolin-associated signaling molecules and integrates signal transduction pathways into discrete modules. Conversely, malfunctioning of caveolin leads to indiscriminate cross-talk among distinct pathways. Importantly, Cav-1 directly binds cholesterol, a cofactor in formation of caveolae (6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar, 22Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The threshold of plasma membrane cholesterol below which caveolae cannot be formed is 40 mol % (23Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Google Scholar); therefore, cholesterol-binding substances like β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), lovastatin (LS), nystatin, and filipin prevent caveolae formation, with the caveolin-containing caveolar coat initially remaining as a precipitate on the flattened membrane and then being lost from the membranes (6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar). Cav-1 mRNA levels are up- and down-regulated by cholesterol and oxysterols, respectively (24Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that protein-protein interactions and protein-lipid interactions modulate caveolae formation and related initiation of signaling pathways. In MM cells, we have characterized growth, survival, drug resistance, and apoptotic signaling cascades (25Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Podar K. Schlossman R.L. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 607-612Google Scholar, 26Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 47-55Google Scholar), but the role of caveolae in modulating these sequelae is unknown at present.In the current study we demonstrate for the first time that Cav-1 is present in human MM cells, and we suggest a functional model in which caveolae play a pivotal role in interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced complex formation and activation of downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt-1 signaling, which enhances MM cell survival and confers resistance to dexamethasone (27Hideshima T. Nakamura N. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5991-6000Google Scholar). These studies provide the basis for novel therapeutic strategies targeting caveolae, Cav-1, and other structural components of the MM cell membrane to improve patient outcome.

The annual incidence of MM is ∼3.8 per 100,000 population (∼14,400 new cases of MM/year), and it is almost twice as common in the black versus Caucasian population (1Brown L.M. Linet M.S. Greenberg R.S. Silverman D.T. Hayes R.B. Swanson G.M. Schwartz A.G. Schoenberg J.B. Pottern L.M. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Cancer. 1999; 85: 2385-2390Google Scholar). The median age at diagnosis is ∼62 years, and despite current therapeutic approaches, the median survival remains at 3–4 years. New biologically based targeted therapies are therefore urgently needed. Cholesterol is an essential component of MM cell membranes, has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, and represents one such target (2Sato J.D. Kawamoto T. Okamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1761-1766Google Scholar). Cholesterol and sphingolipids form lipid rafts, which represent dynamic assemblies in the otherwise homogeneous, phospholipid-rich two-dimensional lipid layer of the plasma cell membrane. As “liquid-ordered” membranous microdomains, they function as platforms for membrane trafficking and signal transduction, initiating complex protein-protein interactions between ligands, receptors, and kinases in response to intra- and extracellular stimuli (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). However, the role of lipid rafts in MM cell growth and survival in the BM milieu is not yet defined. Caveolae (“little caves”) are specialized lipid raft microdomains forming 50–100 nm flask-shaped vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane, which serve as a scaffold for signaling molecules related to cell adhesion, growth, and survival (4Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar). They are composed of caveolins, 22–24-kDa integral membrane proteins with cytoplasmic N and C termini, and a central intramembrane domain, which forms an unusual hairpin loop structure in the membrane (5Glenney Jr., J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Google Scholar, 6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar). Caveolins are functionally and structurally highly conserved and initiate formation of caveolae from raft-derived components. Specifically, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is required for caveola formation, because caveolae are not formed in the Cav-1 knockout mouse (7Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J.

Invest. 2001; 108: 1553-1561Google Scholar); conversely, caveolin-deficient lymphocytes acquire plasma membrane caveolae when transfected with Cav-1 cDNA (9Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Google Scholar). Three distinct caveolin genes have been identified: caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3; in addition, alternate initiation of translation creates two isoforms of Cav-1, Cav-1α (containing residues 1–178) and Cav-1β (containing residues 32–178). Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are expressed in most cell types, including adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells, whereas caveolin-3 is found specifically in muscle cells. A number of investigators have shown absence of caveolin isoforms in human peripheral blood cells including myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid cell lines (9Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Google Scholar, 10Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Google Scholar, 11Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Google Scholar), but Cav-1 is expressed in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cell lines (12Hatanaka M. Maeda T. Ikemoto T. Mori H. Seya T. Shimizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 382-387Google Scholar). Importantly, diseases including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and muscular dystrophy have also been associated with caveolae (13Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C.

Moreover, Cav-1 expression has been associated with progression of human prostate cancer, primary and metastatic human breast cancer (15Yang G. Truong L.D. Timme T.L. Ren C. Wheeler T.M. Park S.H.

Cancer (Phila.). 2002; 94: 929-933Google Scholar). To date, however, the expression as well as biologic and clinical importance of caveolae and Cav-1 in MM is undefined. Caveolae regulate signal transduction (13Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar); specifically, Cav-1 interacts with lipid-anchored, integral membrane and soluble signaling proteins including Src family tyrosine kinases, G-protein subunit α, endothelial nitric-oxide synthetase, protein kinase C α, Ca2+ pumps, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor. By binding signal transducers within a distinct region of the plasma membrane, caveolin regulates the activation state of caveolin-associated signaling molecules and integrates signal transduction pathways into discrete modules. Conversely, malfunctioning of caveolin leads to indiscriminate cross-talk among distinct pathways. Importantly, Cav-1 directly binds cholesterol, a cofactor in formation of caveolae (6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar, 22Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The threshold of plasma membrane cholesterol below which caveolae cannot be formed is 40 mol % (23Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Google Scholar); therefore, cholesterol-binding substances like β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), lovastatin (LS), nystatin, and filipin prevent caveolae formation, with the caveolin-containing caveolar coat initially remaining as a precipitate on the flattened membrane and then being lost from the membranes (6Rothberg K.G.

https://openalex.org/W2329407609,"Cisplatin (CDDP) is an efficient DNA-damaging antitumor agent employed for the treatment of various human cancers. CDDP activates nuclear as well as cytoplasmatic signaling pathways involved in regulation of the cell cycle, damage repair and programmed cell death. Here we report that CDDP also activates a membrane-integrated protein, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We show that EGFR is activated in response to CDDP in various types of cells that overexpress the receptor, including transformed human glioma cells and human breast tumor cells. CDDP-induced EGFR activation requires its kinase activity, as it can be blocked by an EGFR kinase inhibitor or by expression of a kinase dead receptor. We also show that CDDP-induced EGFR activation is independent of receptor ligand. CDDP induces the activation of c-Src, and EGFR activation is blocked by Src-family inhibitor PP1, suggesting that Src kinases mediate CDDP-induced EGFR activation. We propose that EGFR activation in response to CDDP is a survival response, since inhibition of EGFR activation enhances CDDP-induced death. These findings show that signals generated by DNA damage can modulate EGFR activity, and argue that interfering with CDDP-induced EGFR activation in tumor cells might be a useful approach to sensitize these cells to genotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1966333562,"Most small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients relapse within 12 months of starting combination chemotherapy plus radio-therapy, due to the development of acquired chemo- and radio-resistance. This phenomenon relates to the induction of tumour differentiation, resulting in apoptosis-resistant, morphologically variant (v-SCLC) cells, which lack the neuroendocrine expression of classic (c-) SCLC cells. In this study spontaneously adherent SCLC sublines were shown by differential gene expression analysis to provide an in vitro model of variant differentiation in SCLC, with down-regulation of neuroendocrine markers and up-regulation of epithelial differentiation markers cyclin D1, endothelin, the cell adhesion molecules CD 44 and integrin subunits α2, β3 and β4. The sensitivity of adherent SCLC sublines to etoposide, cyclophosphamide and gamma radiation was significantly diminished relative to parent suspension cell lines. Western blot analysis using phosphorylation-specific antibodies to Akt and MAP kinase revealed markedly elevated activation in adherent SCLC sublines, paralleled by increased levels of phosphorylated Bad protein and activated NF-κB. Subcultivation of the adherent sublines on uncoated surfaces reversed their adherent phenotype immediately and under these conditions Akt activity reverted to low levels. These results suggest that c-SCLC cells can differentiate spontaneously to v-SCLC and that the associated cellular adhesion may trigger Akt-dependent inhibition of apoptosis in SCLC cells, thus leading to acquired chemo- and radio-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1997243978,"Evaluations of androgen regulated gene (ARG) repertoire provide new insights into the androgen receptor (AR) mediated signaling at the transcriptional level. Definition of ARGs having critical functions in the biology of normal and malignant prostate should aid in identifying new bio-markers and therapeutic targets for prostate cancer (CaP). Using Affymetrix HuGene FL oligonucleotide arrays, temporal expression profiles of ARGs in widely used hormone responsive LNCaP cells, were analysed by hierarchical clustering methods and functional classification. ARGs in response to different androgen concentrations showed temporal co-regulation of genes involved in specific biochemical pathways. This study focuses on our new observations of the coordinated androgen induction of genes (NDRG1, PDIR, HERPUD1, ORP150) involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Expression analysis of the two selected ER stress responsive genes, NDRG1 and HERPUD1 in primary CaPs revealed a significantly reduced tumor associated expression. Intriguing linkage of the androgen signaling to ER stress responsive genes, a protective response to protein unfolding or protein damage resulting from cellular stress signals, suggests that androgens may induce such stress signals in CaP cells. Decreased CaP associated expression of two ER stress responsive genes also suggests that possible abrogation of this pathway in prostate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1984658452,"Liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) transcription factors have been found to induce a number of genes involved in the regulation of cellular cholesterol efflux, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the active efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to extracellular acceptors, such as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). In a screen for macrophage LXR/RXR target genes, we identifiedstearoyl-CoA desaturases 1 and 2(Scd1 and Scd2), and subsequently tested the hypothesis that SCD activity might modulate cellular cholesterol efflux. In HEK 293 cells co-transfection of ABCA1 with either SCD1 or SCD2 inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux but not phospholipid efflux. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with moderate stable overexpression of SCD1, cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was inhibited by 73%, whereas phospholipid efflux and ABCA1 protein levels were unchanged. In contrast, cholesterol efflux to HDL2, which is not dependent on ABCA1, was increased 2-fold in CHO-SCD1 cells. The effect of SCD on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was independent of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity. SCD activity led to an increased content of plasma membrane monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1) at the expense of saturated fatty acids (18:0). As shown by confocal microscopy, SCD overexpression led to a decrease of Triton X-100-resistant domains in the plasma membrane, indicating a decrease in membrane-ordered regions. The data suggest that SCD changes membrane organization and depletes a specific pool of membrane cholesterol supporting ABCA1-mediated efflux, whereas increasing availability of cholesterol for passive efflux by HDL2.

Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I is increased in cells loaded with cholesterol (14Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Google Scholar). Cholesterol loading induces ABCA1 gene transcription, as a result of oxysterol activation of LXR (LXRα, LXRβ) that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) on a direct repeat 4 element in the promoter of the ABCA1 gene (15Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that ABCA1 is also regulated on a post-transcriptional level. Wang et al. (16Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5692-5697Google Scholar) showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids reduced cellular ABCA1 protein content by enhancing ABCA1 degradation. In contrast, apoA-I and apoA-II stabilized ABCA1 protein without changing the mRNA, as a result of decreased degradation by thiol proteases (17Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Google Scholar). The ability of ABCA1 to mediate cholesterol efflux is also modulated by trafficking and compartmentalization of cholesterol in cells. Overexpression of SR-BI in cells inhibits cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway, either by sequestering cholesterol in the membrane, or by promoting reuptake of newly effluxed cholesterol (18Chen W. Silver D.L. Smith J.D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30794-30800Google Scholar). In macrophages lipoprotein cholesterol deposited in late endosomes/lysosomes acts as a preferential source of cholesterol for ABCA1-mediated efflux (19Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A.

In these studies LXR/RXR activation increased cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, but the magnitude of the change was much less than the increase in ABCA1 protein levels. This finding raised the possibility that there might be other LXR/RXR target genes that could act to oppose ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. In this study, we identified the LXR/RXR target gene, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), as an inhibitor of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Transient and stable transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The CHO-SCD1 cell line was established by transfecting CHO cells with pcDNA3.1/Hygro-mSCD1. Hygromycin-resistant clones were pooled for experiments. Thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected as described (19Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43564-43569Google Scholar). 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol and the synthetic LXR activator TO-901317 were purchased from Sigma. 9-cis-Retinoic acid was purchased from Biomol. Selective subtractive hybridization was performed as described (20Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Google Scholar). Poly(A)+mRNA (2 μg) was made from treated or untreated thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages. Selective subtractive hybridization was performed with a PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with modifications (20Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Google Scholar). The subtracted cDNA libraries were generated by inserting the cDNA obtained after hybridization and PCR amplification into a cloning vector pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). Individual clones were sequenced. Total RNA was extracted from macrophage using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc.). For Northern analysis, total RNA was separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels (30 μg of RNA per lane), and transferred to Zeta-probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were hybridized with randomly primed 32P-labeled probes of cDNA fragments overnight at 65 °C, and washed twice each for about 15 min at 65 °C with 0.2% SDS in 0.2× SSC. The membranes were then exposed to storage a phosphorimaging screen (Amersham Biosciences) to detect signals. RNA was treated with DNase I (DNA-freeTM; Ambion, Inc). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA with oligo(dT) primers using Superscriptase II (Invitrogen). cDNA from 6 individual samples was pooled for each condition for real time PCR analysis. Real time PCR was performed in triplicate and analyzed by using the MX4000 system (Stratagene). High density lipoprotein 2 (HDL2, 1.063 < d < 1.125 g/ml) was isolated from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation using an L8 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) was purchased from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol by two different methods (1Tall A.R. Costet P. Wang N. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 899-904Google Scholar). The first method was 5 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin labeling. Cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [1,2-3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Science) in DMEM containing 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin:cholesterol at a molar ratio of 8:1 for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were equilibrated in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 30 min and then used for efflux experiments (2Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Google Scholar). The second method was with 10% FBS/DMEM. Cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were then equilibrated in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 2 h and then used for cholesterol efflux experiments. In experiments with the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, Dup128, the compound was present for 24 h before efflux at a concentration of 100 nm and during the efflux period. To test the efficiency of Dup128 at 100 nm, we labeled CHO and CHO-SCD1 cells with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm Dup128. The cells were then equilibrated in DMEM, 0.2% BSA overnight. Cellular lipids were extracted with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) three times and the organic phase was collected, evaporated under N2, and fractionated by TLC using hexane:ethyl ether:methanol:acetic acid (85:15:1:1). Spots corresponding to free cholesterol and cholesterol ester were collected and counted by liquid scintillation. The radiolabeled cholesterol ester:free cholesterol ratio in mock treated cells was 0.04 (CHO) and 0.12 (CHO-SCD1). In Dup128-treated cells, the cholesterol ester:free cholesterol ratio was decreased to 0.006 (CHO) and 0.009 (CHO-SCD1). After labeling and equilibration, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified human apoA-I or 15 μg/ml human HDL2 in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for the indicated time. Then medium was collected and centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris and cholesterol crystals. The cells were lysed in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, 0.1% SDS and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were labeled for 24 h in DMEM, 10% FBS supplemented with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]choline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 2 h equilibration in DMEM, 0.2% BSA, the cells were washed and efflux was performed in DMEM, 0.2% BSA containing 10 μg/ml apoA-I. Both medium and cell lysates were extracted with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) three times and the organic phase was used to determine radioactivity. Efflux was expressed as the percentage of radioactivity in the medium relative to the total radioactivity in cells and medium. As described before (21Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Google Scholar) the donor cells were incubated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min, medium was changed to DMEM, 0.2% BSA containing 10 μg/ml apoA-I. 4 h later this conditioned medium was transferred to [3H]cholesterol-labeled recipient cells for the efflux assay. The efflux was performed in recipient cells for 4 h. Postnuclear lysates were fractionated in 7.5 or 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal anti-ABCA1 and anti-SR-BI antibodies were purchased from Novus (Littlton, CO). Monoclonal anti-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-SCD antibodies were developed in a rabbit using a peptide corresponding to C-terminal 14 amino acids of SCD protein. This region is highly conserved among human SCD and mouse SCD1 and SCD2. Confluent cells were lysed in 0.1m sodium hydroxide and 0.1% SDS. The lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle five times, and analyzed for protein by the Lowry method. Cellular lipids were extracted with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) three times. The organic phases were combined and dried under N2. The residue was dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100. Cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine were determined enzymatically (Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA). Plasma membrane was isolated by nitrocellulose-treated DEAE-Sephadex beads as described (22Seo T. Velez-Carrasco W. Qi K. Hall M. Worgall T.S. Johnson R.A. Deckelbaum R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7885-7894Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from the beads and methyl-esterified and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography (23Lepage G. Roy C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 114-120Google Scholar). Cold Triton X-100 extractability of surface-bound DiI C18incorporated into the plasma membrane of various cell lines was performed as described (24Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Google Scholar). Cells were transferred from growth medium to Medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 g/liter glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Lipid analogs were transferred as monomers from fatty acid-free BSA carriers (25Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar). Cells were double labeled with C6-NBD-SM (fluid preferring) and DiI C18 (ordered preferring) at 37 °C for 20 s, washed with ice-cold Medium 1, and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed using an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser scanning unit and a 63X1.4 NA plan Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Cells labeled with DiI C18 were excited with a 1.0-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm, and a 560-nm long pass filter was used for collecting emissions; C6-NBD-SM was excited with a 25-milliwatt argon laser emitting at 488 nm and a 505–530 band-pass filter was used for emissions. To minimize cross-talk, the two channels were scanned alternately in a line-by-line fashion, having only one laser line and one detector channel on at each time. For quantification, cells were treated as described above, with the exception of replacing 1% Triton X-100 with Medium 1 for control cells, and imaged on a Leica DMIRB wide-field microscope (Leica Mikroscopie und Systeme GmbH, Germany) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Frame Transfer MicroMAX camera with a 512 × 512 back-thinned EEV chip, number 512BFT; Princeton Instruments) driven by Image-1/MetaMorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp., Wester Chester, PA). Images were acquired using a ×25 oil immersion objective (0.75 NA) to include a large number of cells in one field and to acquire fluorescence from the entire cell thickness. DiI C18 was imaged using a standard rhodamine filter set. Images were first background corrected (26Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Google Scholar), and then quantified by manually outlining each cell and taking the average fluorescence power associated with the cells. The ratio of average intensities obtained from the control and extracted cells of each cell line was determined as the percentage remaining cell associated. Cholesterol and phospholipid efflux were expressed as the percentage of the radioactivity in the medium relative to the total radioactivity in cells and medium. Data shown are the average of at least three independent experiments with triplicates in each experiment unless specified otherwise. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The tests for the significant differences between groups were performed by Student's t test. In an attempt to identify genes that modulate the cholesterol efflux pathway, we carried out selective subtractive hybridization on mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with or without LXR/RXR activators, 22(R)-OH cholesterol (5 μm) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (10 μm). Among the genes induced by this treatment, we identified stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (Scd2), and this was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.1 A). Consistent with these observations, the related hepatic Scd1 is induced in animals treated with LXR ligand (27Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar). Scd1 and Scd2, expressed in an overlapping tissue distribution, catalyze the conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA and thereby regulate the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids (28Enoch H.G. Catala A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Google Scholar). Quantitative real time PCR showed that bothScd1 and Scd2 are expressed in mouse peritoneal macrophages (11.7 and 35.4% of actin, respectively), and both were induced by treatment of macrophages with the synthetic LXR activator TO-901317 (1 μm) (Fig. 1 B). To evaluate SCD protein levels, we developed a specific SCD antibody using a peptide recognizing a common region in SCD1 and SCD2. As shown in 293 cells transfected with either SCD1 or SCD2, the antibody provided specific recognition of SCD1 and SCD2 protein, with no signal in control cells (Fig. 1 C). In macrophages treated with LXR/RXR activators, there was a 5-fold induction of SCD protein (the combined signal from SCD1 and SCD2) (Fig. 1 D). SCD activity is increased in the liver in ob/ob mice (29Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Google Scholar), and in transgenic mice overexpressing sterol responsive element-binding protein (SREBP)-1. Using our SCD antibody, we showed 2–3-fold increase in SCD protein in liver of ob/ob mice compared with wild type controls (Fig.1 E), but no change in protein levels in mouse peritoneal macrophages (not shown). We next carried out experiments to evaluate the effects of increased SCD levels on cellular cholesterol efflux. Transient co-expression of either SCD1 or SCD2 with ABCA1 in 293 cells resulted in a significant inhibition of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (Fig.2 A). In contrast, phospholipid efflux to apoA-I was slightly increased in cells expressing ABCA1 and either SCD1 or SCD2 (data not shown). To further assess the role of SCD in modulating cellular cholesterol efflux, we developed CHO cell lines with stable expression of SCD1 (CHO-SCD1), and carried out cholesterol efflux experiments using a pool of clones. The CHO-SCD1 cells showed a moderate 4-fold increase in SCD protein expression (Fig. 1 F), comparable with the relative SCD protein overexpression observed in macrophages treated with LXR/RXR activators, and in liver in ob/ob mice, compared with wild type mice (Fig. 1). Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was decreased by 40% in CHO-SCD1 cells compared with control CHO cells (Fig.2 B). In these experiments, cells were labeled by 24 h incubation with [3H]cholesterol:FBS. In contrast, when cells were labeled by brief exposure to cyclodextrin, [3H]cholesterol (30Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Google Scholar), there was a more pronounced 73% decrease in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in CHO-SCD1 cells compared with control CHO cells (Fig.3 A). Time course experiments showed that the effect of SCD was observed throughout the 4-h efflux period (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to cholesterol efflux, phospholipid efflux was slightly increased in CHO-SCD1 cells (Fig.3 C) and ABCA1 protein levels were identical in CHO and CHO-SCD1 cells (Fig. 3 D). In contrast to these findings, cholesterol efflux to HDL2, which is independent of ABCA1 (21Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Google Scholar), was increased 2-fold in CHO-SCD1 cells (Fig. 4 A), and the effect was observed over a wide range of HDL concentrations (Fig.4 B). Cholesterol efflux to HDL can occur by passive diffusion (3Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Google Scholar) and can be facilitated by SR-BI (2Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Google Scholar). SR-BI protein levels were identical in control and SCD overexpressing cells (Fig.4 A, inset). Moreover, incubation of CHO cells with SR-BI neutralizing antibody showed only minor effects on cholesterol efflux, reflecting the low level of SR-BI protein in this cell type (2Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Google Scholar). Thus, SCD overexpression results in an increase in passive cholesterol efflux to HDL2, which is independent of ABCA1 and SR-BI. Increased SCD activity is known to enhance cellular ACAT activity and apoA-I promotes cholesterol efflux from an ACAT-accessible pool (31Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30132-30138Google Scholar, 32Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Google Scholar). Thus, we tested if an ACAT inhibitor would reverse the effect of SCD. However, at concentrations shown to be effective in inhibiting cellular cholesterol esterification (see “Materials and Methods”) the specific ACAT inhibitor, Dup128, did not alleviate the inhibitory effect of SCD on apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 5). We next considered that in cells expressing SCD, ABCA1 might generate phospholipid·apoA-I complexes with a lower capacity to accept membrane cholesterol. To evaluate this possibility we conducted a media transfer experiment. Media containing complexes from control or SCD1 expressing CHO cells were transferred to a second set of cells (control or SCD1 expressing). These experiments showed that inhibition of cholesterol efflux was primarily a characteristic of cells expressing SCD1, and not of the media obtained from SCD1 expressing cells (Fig.6). The effects of SCD were less pronounced in cells subjected to a prolonged labeling procedure with FBS, [3H]cholesterol, compared with the rapid cyclodextrin labeling procedure (cf.Fig. 3 with Figs. 2 and 6). These results suggested that changes in plasma membrane composition or organization might be responsible for the effects of SCD. Cellular lipid measurements did not show any major differences in total cholesterol, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, or phosphatidylcholine levels in control or SCD1 overexpressing cells (Table I). However, in SCD1 expressing cells there was a 71% increase in 18:1 to 18:0 ratio in plasma membrane phospholipid fatty acids (TableII). This -fold change in phospholipid fatty acids is comparable with that occurring in ob/ob liver compared with wild type liver (29Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Google Scholar).Table ILipid composition of CHO cells and CHO-SCD cellsTCFCCEPCμg/mg proteinCHO25.4 ± 1.322.9 ± 1.52.5 ± 1.643.0 ± 3.3CHO-SCD23.7 ± 1.323.0 ± 3.62.8 ± 1.841.4 ± 3.2Lipids from CHO and CHO-SCD cells were extracted and measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values are expressed as mean ± S.D.

Cholesterol-enriched membrane regions, known as liquid ordered domains or “rafts” (33Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar), are formed from sphingolipids and glycolipids (34London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Google Scholar). Such regions are insoluble in Triton X-100. A new technique involving confocal microscopy of cells containing a fluorescent phospholipid marker (24Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We considered the possibility that SCD might change the overall organization of the plasma membrane. The presence of liquid-ordered domains was assessed by confocal microscopy, where we observed the incorporation of the fluorescent phospholipid analog DiI C18:0 into the plasma membrane of intact cells (Fig.7). In control cells, treatment with Triton X-100 resulted in the appearance of a small number of holes in the plasma membrane, indicating that in intact cells the major portion of the mem"
https://openalex.org/W2320125856,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the BCR-ABL genetic translocation and constitutive activation of the Abl tyrosine kinase. Among members of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, Stat5 is activated by the Bcr-Abl kinase and is implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. We recently identified PD180970 as a new and highly potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase. In this study, we show that blocking Bcr-Abl kinase activity using PD180970 in the human K562 CML cell line resulted in inhibition of Stat5 DNA-binding activity with an IC(50) of 5 nM. Furthermore, abrogation of Abl kinase-mediated Stat5 activation suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 cells, but not in the Bcr-Abl-negative myeloid cell lines, HEL 92.1.7 and HL-60. Dominant-negative Stat5 protein expressed from a vaccinia virus vector also induced apoptosis of K562 cells, consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated an essential role of Stat5 signaling in growth and survival of CML cells. RNA and protein analyses revealed several candidate target genes of Stat5, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, c-Myc and cyclin D2, which were down-regulated after treatment with PD180970. In addition, PD180970 inhibited Stat5 DNA-binding activity in cultured primary leukemic cells derived from CML patients. To detect activated Stat5 in CML patient specimens, we developed an immunocytochemical assay that can be used as a molecular end-point assay to monitor inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling. Moreover, PD180970 blocked Stat5 signaling and induced apoptosis of STI-571 (Gleevec, Imatinib)-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Together, these results suggest that the mechanism of action of PD180970 involves inhibition of Bcr-Abl-mediated Stat5 signaling and provide further evidence that compounds in this structural class may represent potential therapeutic agents for CML."
https://openalex.org/W2163208301,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein is composed of a complex between the surface subunit gp120, which binds to cellular receptors, and the transmembrane subunit gp41. Upon activation of the envelope glycoprotein by cellular receptors, gp41 undergoes conformational changes that mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Prior to formation of a fusogenic “trimer-of-hairpins” structure, gp41 transiently adopts a prefusogenic conformation whose structural features are poorly understood. An important approach toward understanding structural conformations of gp41 during HIV-1 entry has been to analyze the structural targets of gp41 inhibitors. We have constructed epitope-tagged versions of 5-Helix, a designed protein that binds to the C-peptide region of gp41 and inhibits HIV-1 membrane fusion. Using these 5-Helix variants, we examined which conformation of gp41 is the target of 5-Helix. We find that although 5-Helix binds poorly to native gp41, it binds strongly to gp41 activated by interaction of the envelope protein with either soluble CD4 or membrane-bound cellular receptors. This preferential interaction with activated gp41 results in the accumulation of 5-Helix on the surface of activated cells. These results strongly suggest that the gp41 prefusogenic intermediate is the target of 5-Helix and that this intermediate has a remarkably “open” structure, with exposed C-peptide regions. These results provide important structural information about this intermediate that should facilitate the development of HIV-1 entry inhibitors and may lead to new vaccine strategies.

This “trimer-of-hairpins” structure is a six-helix bundle consisting of an internal triple-stranded coiled-coil (three N-peptide helices) with three outer C-peptide helices packed along hydrophobic grooves. In this conformation, the fusion peptide and the transmembrane segment are placed in closed proximity, providing a plausible mechanism for apposition of the target and viral membranes (2Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 9Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These peptide inhibitors are unlikely to target the trimer-of-hairpins structure, because of its extreme stability and the high effective concentrations of the N- and C-peptide regions within a hairpin. These observations suggest that native gp41 converts to a transiently populated “prehairpin” intermediate prior to formation of the fusogenic trimer-of-hairpins structure (see Fig. 6) (2Chan D.C.

Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), may also bind this intermediate, although there is no direct evidence for this hypothesis. An understanding of the structural features of this prefusogenic intermediate is critical because it appears to be an attractive drug target (15Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 20Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Hong L.H. Carr P.A. Kim P.S.

Indeed, clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the C-peptide DP178 (also called T-20) in reducing viral titers in HIV-1-infected patients (21Kilby J.M. Hopkins S. Venetta T.M. DiMassimo B. Cloud G.A. Lee J.Y. Alldredge L. Hunter E. Lambert D. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Johnson M.R. Nowak M.A. Shaw G.M. Saag M.S. Nat.

Retroviruses. 2002; 18: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 5-Helix is a designed, recombinant protein (see Fig. 1, cand d) that consists of three N-peptide regions and two C-peptide regions (19Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This protein is thought to bind the C-peptide region of gp41 and potently inhibits the fusogenic activity of gp41 at nanomolar concentrations. However, it is unknown which conformation of gp41 is the target of 5-Helix. In this study, we designed a tagged 5-Helix protein containing the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) and investigated the target of 5-Helix using a surface co-immunoprecipitation assay. Our results show that 5-Helix binds to HIV-1 gp41 only after gp41-expressing cells come in contact with cellular receptors, resulting in association of 5-Helix on the surface of such cells. These results strongly suggest that 5-Helix binds to the prehairpin intermediate of gp41 and that this intermediate is in an “open” conformation that is accessible to inhibitory compounds. The plasmid pMMHa3×Myc was used as a template to amplify three tandem copies of the Myc epitope tag by PCR with primers encoding both 5′ and 3′ NdeI sites (for N-terminally tagged versions) and with primers encoding both 5′ and 3′BamHI sites (for C-terminally tagged versions). The amplified 120-base pair fragments were ligated into the p5-Helix plasmid to generate p3Myc/5-Helix and p5-Helix/3Myc, respectively. Aspartate substitutions (V549D, L556D, Q563D, and V570D) in p5-Helix/3Myc were introduced individually into the final (third) N40 segment by PCR to generate p5-Helix(D4)/3Myc. The p3Myc/6-Helix and p6-Helix/3Myc constructs were prepared in the same manner as above by ligating the PCR products into p6-Helix. All of the proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS using the T7 expression system (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures (10 ml) were used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria Broth medium and grown to log phase at 37 °C. Overproduction of the protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h of induction, the cells were harvested and stored frozen (−20 °C) until purification. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mmNaCl, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged (6,000 × gfor 30 min) to obtain an inclusion body fraction. Each 5-Helix and 6-Helix variant was enriched in this fraction. The pellets were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After clarification by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), the histidine-tagged proteins were affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Qiagen) columns at room temperature. The proteins were eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 6 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was refolded by dialyzing against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After dialysis, all of the proteins were purified to >95% purity by anion exchange chromatography on an ÄKTA Purifier 10 (Amersham Biosciences), using a MonoQ column and a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). CD measurements were performed in PBS (pH 7.4) with an Aviv 62DS CD spectrometer (Aviv Associates) equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Wavelength scans (200–260 nm) were performed on 10 μm protein solutions. Thermal denaturation profiles were obtained by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm (θ222) as a function of temperature. Protein solutions (10 μm) were measured at 1-degree intervals starting at 4 °C, with an equilibration time of 2 min and an acquisition time of 0.5 min. The apparent melting temperature (T m) was estimated from the maximum of the first derivative of θ222 with respect to temperature. Because of the extreme thermal stability of these proteins, these experiments were performed in PBS in the presence of 3.7 m guanidine hydrochloride. NIH3T3 and 293T cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum or 10% bovine calf serum, respectively, at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Syncytia assays were performed as described previously (15Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For the cell surface co-immunoprecipitation assays, 2 μg of the HIV-1 envelope expression plasmid pCMVgp160 was transfected by the calcium phosphate method into 2 × 105 293T cells/well in a six-well dish. Two days after transfection, the 293T cells were incubated with 100 μg of each protein in the presence or absence of receptors (10 μg of sCD4 or 3 × 106 target cells) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). The clarified supernatants were incubated overnight (4 °C) with 25 μl of Sepharose beads coupled to the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10. After four washes with PBS, the immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with the anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody Chessie 8 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). To detect binding of 5- or 6-Helix to the cells, the immunoprecipitates were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody 9E10. The sCD4 and target cell lines (3T3.T4, 3T3.T4.CCR5, 3T3.T4.CXCR4) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The C34 peptide precipitation experiment was performed in 500 μl of PBS (pH 7.4) with 10 μm protein (5-Helix or 6-Helix variants) and 10 μm C34 peptide. The solution was added to 25 μl of anti-Myc beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the unbound supernatant was removed, the beads were washed four times with 1.5 ml of PBS buffer. The bead-bound samples were analyzed by a 16.5% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted with an anti-C34 polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). To use 5-Helix as a structural probe for gp41, we designed two 5-Helix variants containing three copies of the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) at either the N terminus (3Myc/5-Helix) or the C terminus (5-Helix/3Myc; Fig. 1, c and d). As a negative control, we constructed a Myc-tagged version of a mutant 5-Helix (5-Helix(D4)/3Myc) that contains a disruption of the C-peptide-binding site and that was previously shown to be ineffective in inhibiting gp41-mediated fusion (19Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We also constructed N- and C-terminally Myc-tagged versions of 6-Helix (3Myc/6-Helix and 6-Helix/3Myc, respectively), a protein that does not inhibit HIV-1 membrane fusion because the C-peptide-binding site has been filled by an attached C-peptide. Our two Myc-tagged versions of 5-Helix have biophysical properties nearly identical to untagged 5-Helix (TableI and Fig.2). By CD analysis, all three proteins show CD spectra with minima at 208 and 222 nm, as is typical for helical proteins (Fig. 2 a). The molar ellipticities at 222 nm for each of these proteins were indistinguishable, indicating similar levels of helicity (Table I). Moreover, the three proteins were highly soluble (data not shown) and extremely stable, with a melting temperature (T m) of 98 °C in the presence of 3.7 m guanidine hydrochloride in PBS (pH 7.4) (Table I and Fig. 2 b). We thus conclude that the Myc epitope tags do not affect the overall helical structure and stability of 5-Helix protein. Likewise, the biophysical properties of 6-Helix/3Myc and 3Myc/6-Helix were nearly identical to untagged 6-Helix. Consistent with previous results, the mutant construct 5-Helix(D4)/3Myc was slightly less helical and less stable than wild-type 5-Helix (Table I) (19Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).Table IBiophysical data and inhibitory potency of 5- and 6-helix variantsProteinθ222T mIC50deg cm2/dmol°Cμm5-Helix−28,900980.015 ± 0.0023Myc/5-Helix−29,100980.111 ± 0.0045-Helix/3Myc−29,100980.046 ± 0.0035-Helix(D4)/3Myc−28,20096>106-Helix−30,800>100>103Myc/6-Helix−30,500>100>106-Helix/3Myc−30,600>100>10CD scans were performed on 10 μm protein solutions in PBS (pH 7.4). For the 3Myc-tagged proteins, the residues of the epitope tag were assumed to be nonhelical and were not included in calculating the molar ellipticity at 222 nm (θ222). The apparent melting temperatures (T m) were estimated from thermal denaturation profiles of θ222. Inhibition of cell-cell fusion was measured in a syncytium assay. The means and standard errors were calculated from triplicate experiments. Open table in a new tab CD scans were performed on 10 μm protein solutions in PBS (pH 7.4). For the 3Myc-tagged proteins, the residues of the epitope tag were assumed to be nonhelical and were not included in calculating the molar ellipticity at 222 nm (θ222). The apparent melting temperatures (T m) were estimated from thermal denaturation profiles of θ222. Inhibition of cell-cell fusion was measured in a syncytium assay. The means and standard errors were calculated from triplicate experiments. Both 3Myc/5-Helix and 5-Helix/3Myc bound to synthetic C34 peptide in an immunoprecipitation assay using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and4). In contrast, the 5-Helix(D4)/3Myc, 3Myc/6-Helix, and 6-Helix/3Myc proteins showed no C34 binding (lanes 5,7, and 8). Consistent with their C34 binding activity, both 3Myc/5-Helix and 5-Helix/3Myc showed potent inhibitory activity against cell-cell fusion mediated by HIV-1 envelope protein, with half-maximal inhibition at 111 and 46 nm, respectively (Table I). These values are ∼10- and 3-fold less potent than that of untagged 5-Helix. The reduced potency of the tagged proteins may be due to steric constraints in accessing the gp41 C-peptide region during the membrane fusion process. Furthermore, these constraints may be more severe for 3Myc/5-Helix, in which the 39 additional residues of the epitope tag are expected to be oriented toward the viral membrane (see Fig. 6). A reduction in inhibitory activity has also been observed for a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged version of the C-peptide DP178 (5Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory activity of the 5-Helix variants, four different control proteins (5-Helix(D4)/3Myc, 6-Helix, 3Myc/6-Helix, and 6-Helix/3Myc) showed no detectable inhibitory activity at the highest concentration tested (10 μm). The preservation of inhibitory activity in 3Myc/5-Helix and 5-Helix/3Myc allowed us to explore the conditions under which 5-Helix binds to gp41. Using a surface co-immunoprecipitation assay, we investigated whether these proteins could bind to gp41 expressed on the surface of transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4 a). 293T cells were transfected with a HXB2 envelope expression plasmid, which directs expression of gp160, the precursor polypeptide that is proteolytically processed to generate the envelope complex of gp120 and gp41 (26Moulard M. Decroly E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, 293T cells were incubated with the panel of 5-Helix and 6-Helix variants in the presence or absence of sCD4. Binding of these polypeptides to the surface of transfected cells was determined by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10. Both 3Myc/5-Helix and 5-Helix/3Myc showed low levels of gp41 binding in the absence of sCD4, and this binding was greatly increased in the presence of sCD4 (lanes 4 and6). The specificity of this gp41 binding was shown by the lack of binding by 5-Helix(D4)/3Myc, 3Myc/6-Helix, and 6-Helix/3Myc (lanes 8, 12, and 14). Interestingly, a high molecular weight band, corresponding in size to uncleaved gp160, was also immunoprecipitated in a parallel pattern. Reprobing of the Western blots with an anti-gp120 antibody confirmed that this band was indeed gp160 (data not shown). Because the C-peptide DP178 also has been shown to bind to receptor-activated gp160 (5Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), this result indicates that significant conformational changes can be induced in the envelope protein even in the absence of proteolytic processing. In these immunoprecipitation experiments, we also detected an 80-kDa background band whose identity is unknown. However, this band is unrelated to HIV-1 envelope, because we also detect it in immunoprecipitations from untransfected 293T cells (data not shown). We further investigated whether surface-expressed cellular receptors could similarly activate the binding of 5-Helix to gp41. 293T cells expressing gp160 were incubated with 5-Helix/3Myc in the presence of a panel of retrovirally transduced NIH3T3 cell lines that express cellular receptors for HIV-1 (Fig. 4 b). Whereas nonexpressing NIH3T3 cells showed no effect (compare lanes 1and 2), cell lines expressing CD4 triggered a large increase in binding of 5-Helix/3Myc to gp41 (lanes 4–6). The conformational changes allowing binding of 5-Helix/3Myc appear to be largely induced by CD4, because the additional expression of CXCR4 (lane 6), the co-receptor for the envelope protein (HXB2 strain) used in these studies, caused only a slight increase in binding. In all cases, the binding of gp41 by 5-Helix/3Myc was effectively inhibited by the monoclonal antibody Q4120 (lanes 7–10), which binds to CD4 and blocks its binding by gp120. These results demonstrate that 5-Helix binds to a conformation of gp41 activated by interaction of the envelope protein with cellular receptors. To further characterize our surface immunoprecipitation experiments, we determined the levels of 5-Helix/3Myc immunoprecipitated from the cell surface in the presence and absence of receptors. Low levels of 5-Helix/3Myc were precipitated in the absence of sCD4 (Fig. 5 a, lane 1), but the levels were dramatically increased in the presence of sCD4 (lane 2). In contrast, 5-Helix(D4)/3Myc and 6-Helix/3Myc showed no precipitation either in the presence or absence of sCD4 (lanes 3–6). The level of 5-Helix/3Myc precipitated was not affected by the addition of NIH3T3 cells lacking human HIV-1 receptors (Fig. 5 b,lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the levels of precipitated 5-Helix/3myc were greatly enhanced by the addition of cell lines expressing CD4 or CD4 and co-receptors (lanes 4–6). In all cases, the immunoprecipitation of 5-Helix/3Myc was drastically decreased by addition of the anti-CD4 antibody (Q4120) (lanes 7–10), paralleling the trend seen in gp41 binding experiments (Fig. 4 b). Together these results show that interaction of envelope protein to CD4 facilitates association of 5-Helix to the cell surface. Our results show that 5-Helix binds poorly to native gp41 but well to gp41 activated by interaction of envelope protein with cellular receptors. The fusogenic trimer-of-hairpins conformation is unlikely to be disrupted by 5-Helix, because this hairpin structure involves extremely stable intramolecular interactions (2Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Consistent with this assumption, we find that 5-Helix does not bind to recombinant 6-Helix, which mimics the trimer-of-hairpins conformation of gp41. 2T. Koshiba and D. C. Chan, unpublished data. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the molecular target of 5-Helix is the prehairpin intermediate, a prefusogenic conformation previously inferred from the inhibitory activity of C-peptides (2Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 5Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Because this intermediate is a transiently populated species during the membrane fusion process, it has been difficult to determine its structure directly. The analysis of peptide inhibitors, however, provides important insights into its structural features. The binding of the C-peptide DP178 to this intermediate suggests that it contains an exposed trimeric N-peptide coiled coil that has not yet formed a six-helix structure with the adjacent C-peptide region of gp41 (5Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-peptide N36Mut(e,g), which forms a homotrimer but cannot bind the C-peptide region of gp41, is also a potent inhibitor of gp41-mediated fusion (18Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It remains to be shown directly that N36Mut(e,g) binds to the prehairpin intermediate, but this observation raises the possibility that the trimeric N-peptide region of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate undergoes a monomer-trimer equilibrium (18Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,27Caffrey M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that this prefusogenic conformation also contains C-peptide regions that are exposed enough to allow access of tagged 5-Helix, a 30-kDa protein. Although this exposed C-peptide region almost certainly binds to the 5-Helix protein as an α-helix, we cannot exclude the possibility that it exists in a different conformation in the prehairpin intermediate and is induced into a helical conformation by binding of 5-Helix. Taken together, these results provide a view of the prehairpin intermediate as a largely open structure in which both the N- and C-peptide regions are accessible and thus vulnerable to binding by peptide inhibitors (Fig.6). Treatment of HIV-1 virions with sCD4 has been shown to result in gp120 dissociation and the increased binding of several gp41 monoclonal antibodies (4Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation raises the formal possibility that increased binding of 5-Helix to activated gp41 may likewise reflect exposure of large regions of gp41 because of gp120 shedding. However, we believe that the target of 5-Helix is likely to be a true fusion intermediate, because binding leads to inactivation of gp41 fusion activity. Furthermore, we find that sCD4 leads to increased binding of 5-Helix to uncleaved gp160 (Fig. 4), a result incompatible with the view that gp120 shedding is responsible for 5-Helix binding. We find that low levels of gp41 binding are observed in the absence of cellular receptors (Fig. 4, a, lanes 3 and5, and b, lanes 1 and 2), implying that the C-peptide region of gp41 is only partially accessible in the absence of activation. This poor accessibility in native gp41 may be due to steric constraints or the adoption of an alternative conformation by the C-peptide region. Alternatively, the low level detected may reflect metastability of the native state of viral envelope proteins (28Chen J. Wharton S.A. Weissenhorn W. Calder L.J. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12205-12209Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1998; 95: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); that is, a small fraction of gp41 molecules at a given time may adopt a prehairpin-like conformation even in the absence of cellular receptors. It is interesting to compare our results with the finding that several monoclonal antibodies (2F5, 4E10, and Z13) directed against the membrane proximal region of gp41 bind better to native gp41 than activated gp41 (31Zwick M.B. Labrijn A.F. Wang M. Spenlehauer C. Saphire E.O. Binley J.M. Moore J.P. Stiegler G. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Parren P.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10892-10905Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The epitopes recognized by these antibodies are located slightly C-terminal to the end of the C-peptide, because the 2F5 epitope spans residues 657–670 and the 4E10 epitope spans 671–676. It is likely that these differences in binding preference reflect different conformations recognized by 5-Helixversus the monoclonal antibodies. The study of these differences may reveal structural changes in gp41 during the fusion process. These insights into HIV-1 gp41-mediated membrane fusion will likely also apply to the entry of many other enveloped viruses that have fusion proteins with heptad repeats. Structural studies have revealed that members of the retrovirus, orthomyxovirus, paramyxovirus, and filovirus families contain fusion proteins with a trimer-of-hairpins structure (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 32Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Beyond these structural similarities, the paramyxovirus SV5 fusion protein (F) has been shown to form a transient prehairpin intermediate prior to fusion that can be inhibited by synthetic peptides corresponding to the heptad repeats (33Russell C.J. Jardetzky T.S. Lamb R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Finally, it should be noted that the N- and C-peptide regions of the gp41 prefusogenic intermediate are highly conserved among diverse HIV-1 strains (8Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 19Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that agents targeting these regions have broad neutralizing activity, although the emergence of inhibitor-resistant strains remains a concern (34Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar).

Nonetheless, it is not clear how these proteins work together at the damaged DNA site. To get insight into the molecular mechanism of damage recognition, we carried out a comprehensive analysis on the interaction between damage recognition proteins and their assembly on damaged DNA. XPC physically interacted with XPA, but failed to stabilize the XPA-damaged DNA complex. Instead, XPC-hHR23B was effectively displaced from the damaged DNA by the combined action of RPA and XPA. A mutant RPA lacking the XPA interaction domain failed to displace XPC-hHR23B from damaged DNA, suggesting that XPA and RPA cooperate with each other to destabilize the XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA complex. Interestingly, the presence of hHR23B significantly increased RPA/XPA-mediated displacement of XPC from damaged DNA, suggesting that hHR23B may modulate the binding of XPC to damaged DNA. Together, our results suggest that damage recognition occurs in a multistep process such that XPC-hHR23B initiates damage recognition, which was replaced by combined action of XPA and RPA.

In mammals, NER requires over 20 polypeptides, including damage recognition and/or structure distortion factors (XPA, XPC-hHR23B, replication protein A (RPA), and a transcription factor, TFIIH), strand separating helicases to create an open preincision complex (TFIIH containing XPB and XPD DNA helicases), two structure-specific endonucleases (ERCC1-XPF and XPG), and the enzymes needed for gap filling (DNA polymerase δ/ε, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, and RPA). Both RPA and XPA are also known as damage recognition proteins because they preferentially bind to cisplatin- or UV-damaged DNA (5Jones C.J. Wood R.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4896-4902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The XPA-DNA interaction is relatively weak and characterized by rapid dissociation, whereas RPA formed a much more stable complex with UV-damaged DNA (16Wang M. Mahrenholz A. Lee S.-H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). XPA physically interacts with RPA, which is necessary for efficient NER action (14Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Wild-type RPA, but not a mutant lacking the XPA interaction domain, led to stabilization of XPA-damaged DNA complex, implicating a unique role for RPA in stabilizing the XPA-damaged DNA complex. The XPA-damaged DNA interaction is also likely necessary for recruiting other DNA repair proteins such as XPG, ERCC1-XPF, and TFIIH to the damaged site (8He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Park C.H. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

RPA may also be involved in the later stage of NER, gap-filling, that requires proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, and DNA polymerase δ (or ε) (18Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). XPC-hHR23B is a human homolog of yeast Rad4 and Rad23 proteins, respectively, and forms a stable complex in solution. XPC-hHR23B exhibits the strongest affinity for damaged DNA (19Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33111-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rad23 without Rad4 does not show any DNA binding activity, suggesting that Rad4 is solely responsible for recognition of damaged DNA. Rad23 is essential for XPC function in NER and may also be necessary for the solubility of Rad4 (23Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). XPC-hHR23B showed a remarkable preference to UV-damaged DNA particularly in the presence of nondamaged competitor DNA and has been suggested as the initiator of global genome NER (19Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 24Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Gene Dev. 2001; 15: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A recent immunohistochemistry study also strongly supports a role for XPC as a global initiator in repair (25Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmaker P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), while suggesting a role for XPA and RPA as repair mediator proteins. XPC-hHR23B is also involved in the recruitment of TFIIH to damaged DNA (26Yokoi M. Masutani C. Maekawa T. Sugasawa K. Ohkuma Y. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9870-9875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). TFIIH, once recruited, may play a role in distinguishing the damaged strand from the nondamaged one (27Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 2000; 405: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as well as local unwinding of the damaged DNA region. TFIIH with its DNA helicase activity likely generates a junction between single-stranded DNA and duplex DNA that is recognized by two structure-specific endonucleases, XPG and ERCC1-XPF, for dual incision of damaged strand. An ongoing challenge is to understand how DNA damage is recognized and distinguished from nondamaged sites. In mammalian cells, XPC-hHR23B, XPA, RPA, and TFIIH factors may all have roles in damage recognition during the early stage of NER. In this study we carried out a comprehensive analysis on the interaction between damage recognition proteins and their assembly on damaged DNA. We found that XPC-hHR23B, like RPA, physically interacted with XPA. However, the XPA-XPC interaction, unlike the XPA-RPA interaction, failed to stabilize the XPA-damaged DNA complex. Instead, XPA cooperates with RPA to promote the destabilization of the XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA interaction. This finding supports a notion that the damage recognition process occurs in a stepwise manner such that XPC-hHR23B initiates damage recognition, which was replaced by the combined action of XPA and RPA. To study the interaction between damaged DNA and damage recognition factors, we constructed a duplex DNA with the cisplatin lesion at a specific site (Fig. 1 A). Oligonucleotides containing an intrastrand (ITR-60) cross-link were prepared according to the previously described procedure with some modifications (28Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For cross-linking, the top strand was first incubated with cisplatin (in TE, pH 8.0, 2-fold molar excess) at 37 °C in the dark for 48 h, and then ethanol-precipitated. The damaged DNA was purified by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and annealed to the bottom strand (5-fold molar excess). The duplex DNA was purified by 15% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified duplex DNA, 5′-32P-labeled at top strand, was analyzed for intrastrand cross-link by treatment with 10% dimethyl sulfate at room temperature for 5 min and 1 m piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min, followed by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B). Both RPA and XPC-hHR23B are multiprotein complexes that can be highly expressed in insect cells by coinfecting recombinant baculoviruses (21Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RPA complex was prepared by coinfecting recombinant baculoviruses encoding the individual subunits (29Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the XPC-hHR23B complex was from insect cell lysates infecting a recombinant baculovirus containing both XPC and hHR23B genes (Ref. 21Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; recombinant baculovirus containing XPC and hHR23B was kindly provided by Dr. A. Sancar, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). A high level of histidine-tagged XPA was expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the T7 promoter (5Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Both RPA and XPA have been isolated with more than 95% purity using a series of conventional column chromatography as described previously (5Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 13Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. Drissi R. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). XPC-hHR23B complex was purified using a series of column chromatography (UV-damaged dsDNA cellulose, phosphocellulose (P11), and hepharin-Sepharose) (Fig. 1 C, the details of XPC-hHR23B purification will be described elsewhere). All three proteins (XPA, RPA, and XPC-hHR23B) were functionally active in supporting in vitro NER activity with HeLa cell extracts lacking respective protein (data not shown). All GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity column as described previously (14Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TFIIH was isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts using an antibody affinity procedure described previously (31LeRoy G. Drapkin R. Weis L. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During purification, TFIIH was monitored by Western blot using anti-XPB and -XPD antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The indicated amount of GST fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (25 μl) in 0.5% nonfat milk at 4 °C for 30 min, and washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). After washing the beads 3–5 times, beads were incubated with the indicated protein either in the presence or absence of damaged DNA for an additional 20 min at room temperature on a rocker and then washed 5 times with washing buffer. Beads were then mixed with 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and proteins (or DNA) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. To quantitatively measure the damaged DNA, the gel was directly scanned on a Hitachi FMBIO II Fluorescent Image Scanner. Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE as described previously (32Park J.S. Park S.J. Peng X. Wang M. Yu M.A. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32520-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblotted with corresponding antibodies, and detected by ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Interactions of XPA, RPA, and XPC-hHR23B with DNA were monitored using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor instrument, Biacore 3000 (Biacore) as described previously (16Wang M. Mahrenholz A. Lee S.-H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34You J.-S. Wang M. Lee S.-H. Antioxidants Redox Signaling. 2001; 3: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For preparation of the biosensor surface with DNA, 5′-biotinylated 60-mer duplex DNA (prepared in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 1.0 m NaCl) was manually injected onto a streptavidin-coated surface of a BIAcore sensor chip to the desired density in different flow cells. One flow cell was left underivatized to allow for refractive index change correction. Proteins were diluted in the running buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.005% polysorbate-20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Each experiment was repeated at least twice to assure reproducibility. To get insight into the molecular mechanism of how damage recognition proteins are assembled and working together at the damaged DNA site, we carried out a comprehensive analysis on the interaction of XPA, RPA, and XPC-hHR23B with damaged DNA. Binding affinity of damage recognition factors to a duplex DNA containing an intrastrand platinum cross-link (ITR-60, Fig. 1) was measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As previously reported (Refs.1Batty D.P. Wood R.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 4Lee S.-H. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 34: 489-495Google Scholar and references therein), both RPA and XPC-hHR23B showed preferential binding to the cisplatin-damaged DNA over the nondamaged one, whereas the XPA-DNA interaction was observed only in the presence of excess amounts (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis indicated that XPC-hHR23B compared with RPA exhibited much higher affinity to the damaged DNA (Fig. 2 B). This finding is in keeping with the previous observation that XPC has a considerable preference for binding to the damaged DNA over nondamaged competitor DNA (24Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Gene Dev. 2001; 15: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 25Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmaker P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). XPC-hHR23B also differs from RPA in its preferential binding to dsDNA over ssDNA (35Hey T. Lipps G. Sugasawa K. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Krauss G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6583-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas RPA has a much higher affinity to ssDNA than to dsDNA (Fig. 2,A and B). Because all three proteins (RPA, XPA, and XPC-hHR23B) independently bind to the damaged DNA, we examined a possibility whether all three damage recognition proteins form a complex on the damaged DNA site (11Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Tanaka K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21800-21805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the interactions among damage recognition factors without DNA. Because we know that XPA and RPA interact with each other in solution as well as on damaged DNA (14Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Araujo S.J. Wood R.D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), our focus was on the interaction of XPC-hHR23B with RPA or XPA (Fig.3). GST·XPC or GST·XPC-hHR23B were incubated with an increasing amount of XPA (or RPA), pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads for co-precipitation of XPA (or RPA), and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3). XPA was co-precipitated with GST·XPC or GST·XPC-hHR23B complex, but not with GST (Fig.3 A), suggesting that XPA physically interacts with XPC-hHR23B. In the XPA-XPC interaction, GST·XPC was almost comparable with GST·XPC-hHR23B (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–4 versus lanes 5 and 6), indicating that XPC not hHR23B physically interacts with XPA. In keeping with this, hHR23B without XPC failed to interact with XPA (data not shown). Unlike XPA, however, RPA had no physical interaction with GST·XPC-hHR23B or GST·XPC in solution (Fig. 3 B). Because both RPA and XPC interact with XPA (Refs. 11Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Saijo M. Kuraoka I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21800-21805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and Fig. 3), it is possible that the binding of XPC (or RPA) to XPA may competitively exclude RPA (or XPC) from the complex. If so, we may not be able to see a complex containing all three damage recognition proteins. To examine this possibility, XPA was incubated with GST·XPC-hHR23B in the presence of an increasing amount of RPA and analyzed for the XPA-XPC interaction. Addition of a molar excess of RPA had little or no effect on the XPA-XPC interaction as determined by the GST·XPC-hHR23B pull-down assay (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that RPA and XPC-hHR23B may recognize two separate domains of XPA. Nonetheless, we were not able to detect RPA in the GST·XPC pull-down assay in the presence of XPA and RPA (Fig. 3 C). The XPA-damaged DNA interaction is weak, but markedly stimulated in the presence of a high affinity DNA-binding protein, RPA (14Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of RPA on the XPA-damaged DNA interaction occurs through the RPA-XPA interaction (14Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol.

We therefore examined whether XPC-hHR23B affects the XPA-damaged DNA interaction. In the GST·XPA pull-down assay, XPA had very little or no binding to the damaged DNA (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), which was significantly stimulated by addition of RPA (Fig.4 A, lanes 3–5). In contrast, XPC-hHR23B showed no effect on the XPA-damaged DNA interaction (Fig. 4 A,lanes 6–8). Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of RPA on the XPA-damaged DNA interaction was markedly reduced in the presence of XPC-hHR23B (Fig. 4 A, lane 9), suggesting that XPC-hHR23B, unlike RPA, may not form a stable complex with XPA on damaged DNA. To investigate this further, we examined the effect of damaged DNA on the XPA-XPC interaction (Fig. 4 B). XPA was successfully co-precipitated with GST·XPC in the pull-down assay in the absence of damaged DNA (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and5). In the presence of damaged DNA, however, the amount of XPA co-precipitated with GST·XPC was significantly reduced to an undetectable level (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6 and7), suggesting that the XPA-XPC interaction is destabilized in the presence of damaged DNA. Our result (Fig. 4) strongly suggests that XPA, RPA, and XPC-hHR23B do not form a stable complex on the damaged DNA. Instead, the damage recognition process may occur in a stepwise manner such that XPC-hHR23B interacts with damaged DNA first and then is replaced by XPA and/or RPA. To test this, biotin-labeled cisplatin-damaged DNA was first incubated with XPC-hHR23B, followed by the addition of RPA (Fig. 5 A,lanes 3–5), XPA (lanes 6–8), or XPA + RPA (lanes 9–11) to the reaction mixtures. The streptavidin-Sepharose pull-down assay revealed that XPC-hHR23B formed a stable complex with damaged DNA (Fig. 5 A, top panel, lane 2) and, the addition of RPA (lanes 3–5) or XPA (lanes 6–8) showed very little effect on the XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA interaction. In the presence of both XPA and RPA, however, the XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA interaction was significantly inhibited (Fig. 5 A,top panel, lanes 9–11). In contrast to XPC, the amount of XPA co-precipitated with damaged DNA was markedly increased in the presence of RPA (Fig.5 A,second panel, lanes 9–11), whereas the RPA-damaged DNA interaction was hardly affected by the presence of XPA (Fig. 5 A,third and fourth panels, lanes 9–11). Together, this result suggests that XPC-hHR23B can be effectively displaced from damaged DNA by the combined action of RPA and XPA. We further analyzed the effect of XPA and/or RPA on the interaction between XPC-hHR23B and damaged DNA by measuring damaged DNA co-precipitated with GST·XPC-hHR23B in the glutathione-Sepharose pull-down assay. Fluorescence (TET)-labeled damaged DNA was first incubated with GST·XPC-hHR23B before the addition of either XPA or XPA + RPA and analyzed quantitatively following GST·XPC pull-down assay (Fig. 5 B). Addition of both XPA and RPA drastically reduced the amount of damaged DNA interacting with GST·XPC-hHR23B, whereas XPA alone marginally affected the XPC-damaged DNA interaction (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that both RPA and XPA are necessary to destabilize the interaction between XPC-hHR23B and damaged DNA. Effect of XPA and/or RPA on the GST·XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA interaction was also analyzed by an antibody supershift assay using an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5 C). On a native gel electrophoresis, GST·XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA complex was identified as a distinct band (Fig. 5 C, lane 2) that was supershifted in the presence of an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5 C, lane 3). The GST·XPC-hHR23B-damaged DNA complex (lanes 12and 13) or its supershifted complex (lanes 14 and15) was significantly reduced by addition of an increasing amount of both RPA and XPA, even though the supershift may be in part because of the reaction of GST antibody to XPA and/or RPA (Fig.5 C). This result is in keeping with Fig. 5, A andB, indicating that XPC-hHR23B is displaced from damaged DNA by the combined action of RPA and XPA. XPC (Rad4) forms a stable complex with hHR23B (Rad23), which appears to be essential for NER (23Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, damaged DNA binding activity of the XPC-hHR23B complex belongs to the XPC subunit (23Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the exact role for hHR23B in repair is unclear. In an effort to explore the role for hHR23B in DNA repair, we examined whether the presence of hHR23B affects RPA/XPA-mediated displacement of XPC from the damaged DNA. GST·XPC-hHR23B (or GST·XPC) was incubated with fluorescence (TET)-labeled damaged DNA in the presence of RPA and XPA, and the amount of damaged DNA precipitated with GST·XPC was measured (Fig.6 A). Both XPC and XPC-hHR23B showed strong interaction with damaged DNA (Fig.6 A, lanes 2 and 5). In the presence of RPA + XPA, however, the damaged DNA·XPC-hHR23B complex, not the damaged DNA·XPC complex, was significantly reduced (Fig.6 A, lanes 3 and 4 versus 6 and 7), suggesting that hHR23B is somehow involved in the displacement of XPC from damaged DNA in the presence of RPA + XPA. To further investigate this, purified hHR23B was added to the reaction mixtures containing GST·XPC for its effect on the XPC-damaged DNA interaction in the presence of RPA + XPA (Fig.6 B). GST·XPC without hHR23B formed a stable complex with damaged DNA (Fig. 6 B, lane 2), which was hardly affected by RPA + XPA (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and4). In contrast, addition of purified hHR23B to the reaction mixtures significantly decreased the binding of XPC to the damaged DNA in the presence of RPA + XPA (Fig. 6 B, lanes 6and 7). This result strongly suggests that hHR23B is necessary for the RPA/XPA-mediated displacement of XPC from damaged DNA. Interaction between RPA and XPA is not only required to stabilize the XPA-damaged DNA interaction, but also necessary for NER activity (14Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.-H. J. Biol.

Downstream effectors of PKR include the translation initiation factor, eIF2alpha, and the transcription factor, NF-kappaB. We found elevated levels of PKR protein, dsRNA-dependent PKR autophosphorylation activity, and phosphorylated eIF2alpha in melanoma cells compared to nontransformed melanocytes in culture. Treatment with interferon-alpha2b further induced PKR expression and activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary melanomas demonstrated minimal PKR immunoreactivity, but melanoma lymph node metastases expressed a high level of PKR protein. Furthermore, analysis of colon cancer specimens revealed that transformation from normal mucosa to adenomas and carcinomas was coincident with an increase in PKR expression. These data do not support the concept of PKR as a classic tumor suppressor but instead suggest that PKR upregulation occurs at defined steps in cancer progression, probably as a cellular response to neoplasia."

Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar). More than 800 distinct mutations in the CFTR gene have been associated with clinical diseases characteristic of cystic fibrosis (2Welsh M.J. Ramsey B.W. Accurso F. Cutting G. Scriver C.R. Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 5121-5188Google Scholar). Whereas many organs are affected in CF, morbidity and mortality in the disease is primarily related to mucus accumulation, recurrent infections, and excessive inflammation in the lung. Whereas the pathogenesis of CF is not fully understood, abnormalities in cyclic AMP-dependent chloride secretion and excessive sodium reuptake by epithelial cells related to CFTR deficiency are thought to alter fluid homeostasis at the airway surface liquid leading to its dehydration, impaired mucociliary clearance, and infection (see Ref. 3Tarran R.

Because the elucidation of the primary structure of CFTR, a myriad of functions and numerous interactions with other cellular proteins have been ascribed to CFTR. Thus, in addition to the role of CFTR in the regulation of cAMP-dependent chloride transport, this protein may play pleotropic roles in many cellular processes by interacting with the cytoskeleton, membrane transport proteins, as well as receptors, protein routing and degradation machinery (2Welsh M.J. Ramsey B.W. Accurso F. Cutting G. Scriver C.R. Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 5121-5188Google Scholar). A number of studies support the concept that the excessive inflammatory responses occur in the CF lung, but the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities have not been clarified. Changes in levels of IL-8 and other proteins mediating inflammatory signaling including NFκB and iNOS have been associated with CF, in the presence or absence of infection, raising the possibility that abnormalities in CFTR may constitutively alter pathways mediating inflammation (4Khan T.Z.

In the lung, CFTR is distributed primarily in apical regions of airway and submucosal gland epithelial cells (7Engelhardt J.F. Zepeda M. Cohn J.A. Yankaskas J.R. Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Abundance and cellular sites of expression of CFTR are strongly influenced by developmental, spatial, and humoral factors, supporting the concept that the expression and function of CFTR are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Despite extensive study, the precise role of CFTR in the pathogenesis of CF disease remains poorly understood. At the clinical level, severity of CF disease is highly variable even among individuals bearing identical mutations, supporting the concept that environmental and hereditary factors may influence the severity of the disorder (2Welsh M.J. Ramsey B.W. Accurso F. Cutting G. Scriver C.R. Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 5121-5188Google Scholar). These clinical observations, and observations demonstrating strain differences in the severity of CF phenotype after CFTR gene targeting or mutation in mice (8Rozmahel R. Wilschanski M. Matin A. Plyte S. Oliver M. Auerbach W. Moore A. Forstner J. Durie P. Nadeau J. Bear C. Tsui L.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), support the concept that the expression of CFTR and its function in cellular processes may be influenced by many genes or pathways intensifying or mollifying CF disease in various organs. Morbidity and mortality in patients with CF is strongly associated with pulmonary disease caused by mucous accumulation, inflammation, and infection; however, deletion of CFTR mice does not cause significant pulmonary disease suggesting that expression of alternative channels or other complementary genes maintains pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse. Whereas numerous in vitro and in vivo models have been developed for study of CFTR, analysis of genomic responses to the presence or absence of CFTR are complicated by heterogeneity of cell models, and culture conditions that may influence cell function and gene expression independently of CFTR. Direct RNA analysis of pulmonary tissue from humans with CF is complicated by the nearly ubiquitous, severe pulmonary infections that may secondarily modify cellular responses and gene expression, complicating identification of responses to CFTRin vivo. In the present study, we undertook experiments to identify RNAs influenced by the presence and absence of CFTR in vivo, seeking to identify genes and pathways that interact with or compensate for the CFTR to maintain pulmonary function. In this study, stereotypic genomic responses to the lack of CFTR were observed in pulmonary tissues in the absence of infection or disease. Transgenic mice bearing a null mutation in CFTR (CFTR(−)), generally succumb to intestinal disease in the weanling period (9Snouwaert J.N. Brigman K.K. Latour A.M. Malouf N.N. Boucher R.C. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). To generate healthy mice deficient in CFTR, the human CFTR cDNA was expressed in the intestinal epithelium under control of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene promoter (iFABP), fully correcting small intestinal pathology and supporting normal postnatal survival of CFTR(−) mice (10Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. DuVall M.D. Frizzell R.A. Whitsett J.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR(−) mice have been maintained in a mixed FVB/N, C57BL/6 background without evidence of gastrointestinal or pulmonary disease for nearly a decade in our laboratory. Histological andbiochemical studies identified no overt pathology in lung tissue from these mice compared with CFTR expressing littermate controls (10Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained in filtered microisolator cages. Sentinal mice were free of mouse pathogens. Lungs of adult iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR(−), and control mice were free of bacterial pathogens or colonization as assessed by quantitative culture of lung homogenates on blood agar plates. Matings of FABP-hCFTR(+/+)/mCFTR(−/−) mice to wild type FVB/N-mCFTR(+/+) mice were used to produce F1 FABP-hCFTR(+/−)/mCFTR(−/+) mice. These mice were crossed to generate F2 offspring littermates that were then genotyped, choosing FABP-hCFTR(+)/mCFTR(−) and hCFTR(+)/mCFTR(+) mice for use in RNA comparisons. To minimize the potential influence of strain differences in this colony, lung RNA was isolated from sex-matched littermates at 3, 6, and 11 weeks of age. RNA was also isolated from lungs of surviving CFTR(−)/hCFTR(−) and CFTR(+) littermates at 3 weeks of age for comparison with those bearing the iFABP-hCFTR transgene. All CFTR(+) mice were heterozygous for the targeted mCFTR gene. Lungs from sex-matched littermates were carefully dissected and the conducting airways and mediastinal structures removed. RNA, cDNA synthesis, and microarray analysis were performed in pairs to minimize technical variability related to RNA and isolation and hybridization conditions. Lungs were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using methods recommended by the manufacturer. Genotyping was performed using the following primers: primers for mCFTR PCR: forward primer (intron 9), 5′-AGGGGCTCGCTCTTCTTTGTGAAC-3′, and reverse primer (intron 10), 5′-TGGCTGTCTGCTTCCTGACTATGG-3′; neomycin resistance gene PCR: forward primer, 5′-CACAACAGACAATCGGCTGCT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACAGTTCGGCTGGCGCGAG-3′; and hCFTR PCR: forward primer (exon 9), 5′-AAACTTCTAATGGTGATGACAG-3′, and reverse primer (exon 11), 5′-AGAAATTCTTGCTCGTTGAC-3′. Changes in selected RNA levels identified in the microarray analysis were validated by RT-PCR using a Light CyclerTM or a regular thermocycler followed by gel electrophoresis. For these studies, lung RNAs were isolated as described above. cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription and PCR analysis was performed using the following primers for: Kir 4.2 forward, 5′-CTTTGAGTTTGTGCCTGTGGTTTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTGTGTGATTTGGTAGTGCGG-3′; human CFTR, same as above; and mouse CFTR forward, 5′-TGCTTCCCTACAGAGTCATCAACGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CACAGGATTTCCCACAACGCAGAG-3′; β-actin for normalization, forward, 5′-TGGAATCCTGCGGCATCCATGAAC; reverse, 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward, 5′-CTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′; CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) δ, forward, 5′-CGCAACAACATCGCTGTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGCTGGGCAGTTTTTTG-3′; TNF-AIP-3, forward, 5′-GCACGAATACAAGAAATGGCAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCATAAAGGCTGAGTGTTCACG-3′; and Grin 2d, forward, 5′-CCTTCTTTGCCGTCATCTTTCTTGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAACTTCAGGGGTGGGTATTGCTCC-3′. Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using oligo(dT) with T7 promoter sequences attached, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis. Antisera cRNA was then amplified and biotinylated using T7 RNA polymerase, prior to hybridization to the Affymetrix genechip mouse U74aV2 using the Affymetrix recommended protocol (12Cho R.J. Huang M. Campbell M.J. Dong H. Steinmetz L. Sapinoso L. Hampton G. Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Notterman D.A. Alon U. Sierk A.J. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3124-3130PubMed Google Scholar). Affymetrix MicroArray Suite version 5.0 was used to scan and quantitate the genechips using default scan settings. Intensity data were collected from each chip, scaled to a target intensity of 1500, and the results were analyzed using both MicroArray Suite and GeneSpring 5.0 (Silicon Genetics, Inc., Redwood City, CA). cDNAs were hybridized to U74aV2 chips (Affymetrix Inc.). Hybridization data were normalized in a CCAAT enhancer-binding protein two-step process to remove or minimize systemic sources of variation at both chip and gene level. Specifically, each chip was normalized to the distribution of all genes on the chip to control for variation between samples. Each RNA from mCFTR(−) mice was normalized to its specific control (i.e. sex and age-matched mCFTR(+) littermates). Data were further transformed into log ratio for analysis and symmetry of distribution. Changes in mRNAs were identified by the combination of a distribution analysis (JMP4, SAS Institute, Inc.), and the Welch analysis of variance. Outlier box and quartile box plots were used to identify outliers with the definition of up-outlier > upper quartile + 1.5 (interquartile range), and the down-outlier < lower quartile − 1.5 (interquartile range). Significant changes were calculated by the Welch t test atp < 0.05. Adjusted p values were calculated by Westfall and Young permutation for correction of false positives (GeneSpring 4.2.1, Silicon Genetics). Comparisons between genotype and age groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance. To identify genes that were differentially expressed because of CFTR genotype regardless of age, hierarchical, and k-means clustering were used to identify consistent changes in gene expression in response to the lack of CFTR at all three time points. Candidate RNAs were further filtered on the basis of reproducibility and absolute intensity. Mean, standard deviation, and coefficient variation were calculated for each replicate. Replicates with coefficient variations > 50% were deleted from analysis. Genes whose expression was below the level of detection were eliminated as experimental noise. Selected genes were subjected to intensive search to identify biological function and associated regulatory pathways. A U74Av2 annotation data base with system identifiers was constructed for all the array elements and their associated GenBankTM accession numbers. Gene description, functional categories, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, protein domain, and literature information were identified. Information resources included NetAffy (www.affymetrix.com), Source Search genome-www5.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/SMD/source/), BLAST NCBI, Locus Link, mouse-human homolog search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and Gene Ontology data base (www.godatabase.org/chi-bin/go.cgi). Differentially expressed genes were classified into functional categories based on the gene ontology definition. To determine which functional category is overrepresented in the selected gene list, the binomial probability was calculated for each category using the entire U74Av2 (contains 12488 mice genes) as a reference data set. The binomial probability is defined by the following. P(k,n,p)=∑​k=0n(nk)pk(1−p)n−kEquation 1 It returns the probability of getting k successes ofn trials if the probability is p in the given population (U74Av2). Potential protein/protein or protein/DNA interactions were identified using the published literature information. Lungs from postnatal animals were inflation fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 cm H2O pressure via a tracheal cannula. Lung tissue was processed according to standard methods and embedded in paraffin. Procedures for immunostaining were previously described (14Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Picard L. Tichelaar J.W.

Rabbit monoclonal antibody against the 110-kDa Mac-3 antigen was used at 1:40,000 to identify alveolar macrophages (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Lung histology in adult iFABP-hCFTR, CFTR(−); iFABP-hCFTR, CFTR(+), and CFTR(+) control mice was not different (Fig. 1). There was no evidence of pulmonary inflammation, infection, or remodeling. Mac-3 staining was used to identify alveolar macrophages. Numbers and histology of alveolar macrophages were not altered by mCFTR. To identify genes responsive to CFTR, lung RNAs from iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR(−), iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR(+), mCFTR(−) and mCFTR(+) littermates at the age of 3, 6, or 11 weeks of age were compared. Microarray analyses were performed in duplicate from RNA isolated at 3 and 6 weeks of age. Data from 10 Affymetrix Murine Genome U74Av2 chips were normalized and statistical differences between CFTR-deficient (CFTR(−)) and control (CFTR(+)) mice were identified. Differences related to age were identified by outlier analysis and/or unpaired t test. After normalization, normal distributions were observed in the intensity data from lung tissue obtained at all ages. Lung RNA data from 3-week-old mCFTR(+) and mCFTR(−) mice (lacking the iFABP-hCFTR transgene) were similarly distributed to those bearing the FABP-hCFTR gene and were, therefore, included in the analysis. To identify RNAs that were differentially expressed in response to CFTR regardless of age, mCFTR(−) and mCFTR(+) data were separated into two groups. The log-ratio distribution and outlier plot of the combined data set are represented by Fig. 2. A total of 1977 outliers were identified from 12442 genes/expressed sequence tags analyzed. The abundance of 848 RNAs was increased; 1129 were decreased. Welch t test together with the Westfall and Young step-down permutation further narrowed the number of differentially expressed RNAs to 315. Hierarchical clustering was used to visualize and classify the data set (Fig.3). Data are shown in a two-dimensional matrix to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns and show remarkably ordered gene expression profiles of 315 selected genes. On the chip level (top dendrogram) RNAs influenced by CFTR formed two distinct groups. Within each group, the samples collected from age-matched pairs were more closely related than those from different ages, suggesting that age also influenced gene expression. At the RNA level (the dendrogram at the left side), genes were clearly separated into two major groups: those mRNAs increased or decreased in mCFTR(−) mice. Genes were further filtered for the consistency of differences in expression levels across all time points (coefficient variation < 50%) and for their absolute intensity above 243 (90% of genes called absent by Affymetrix software, <243 for this data set). Additional filters reduced the number of RNAs to 54, of which 29 were consistently increased and 25 were decreased in mCFTR(−) compared with their mCFTR(+) littermates (TablesI and II).

https://openalex.org/W2323165065,"Increases in the abundance of cathepsin B transcript and protein with increased tumor grade and changes in subcellular localization and activity of this enzyme. We observed progressive reductions in levels of the protease inhibitor cystatin C, an inhibitor of cathepsin B with corresponding increases in the malignancy of glioma cell lines, implying an inverse correlation between cystatin C and tumor grade. To investigate the role of cystatin C in the invasion of brain tumor cells, we stably transfected SNB19 glioblastoma cells with either a 0.4-kb cDNA construct of human cystatin C in the sense orientation or an empty vector. Clones expressing sense-cystatin C cDNA had higher cystatin C mRNA and protein levels than did control cells. Sense-transfected cells were also markedly less invasive than control cells in a Matrigel invasion assay and in a coculture assay of SNB19 spheroids and fetal rat brain aggregates. Finally, the sense-transfected cells did not form tumors in nude mice upon intracerebral injection. These results strongly implicate cystatin C in the invasiveness of human glioblastoma cells and suggest that sense transcripts of cystatin C may prove useful in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2328547481,"Testicular germ cell tumours are classified into two major histological subgroups, seminomas and nonseminomas. All tumours display several recurrent chromosomal aberrations, but few target genes have been identified. Previous studies have shown that genome-wide hypermethylation of CpG islands is significantly more prevalent in nonseminomas than in seminomas. We have studied two potential target genes in testicular cancer. A series of 70 tumours were analysed for methylation of CpG sites in the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter, and in exon 1alpha of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A). In addition, eight microsatellite markers within and flanking these genes at chromosome arms 10q and 9p, respectively, were analysed for allelic imbalances. Allele alterations were frequently seen at 9p loci (47 out of 70, 67%), but none of the tumours (none out of 55) showed methylation of CDKN2A. On the other hand, a high frequency of MGMT promoter methylation (32 out of 69, 46%) was found, as well as allelic imbalances at 10q markers (50 out of 70, 71%). A significantly higher methylation frequency was found in nonseminomas (24 out of 35, 69%) compared to seminomas (eight out of 33, 24%) (P=0.0003, Fisher's exact test). Immunohistochemical analysis of the MGMT protein in a subgroup (n=20) of the testicular tumours supported the hypothesis of gene silencing being the functional consequence of the promoter methylation. In summary, our data suggest that inactivation of MGMT contributes to development of nonseminomatous testicular cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2000826346,"Etk/Bmx, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is characterized by an N-terminal PH domain and has recently been shown to be involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, motility and apoptosis. Since VEGF and the activation of its signaling pathway have been implicated in modulating a variety of biological responses, we characterized the role of Etk-dependent signaling pathways involved in the upregulation of VEGF expression, and explored the functional implications of this enhancement in sustaining cell proliferation and survival. Using Northern and Western analyses, transient transfections, and pharmacological agents, we demonstrate that Etk activation alone is sufficient to transcriptionally induce VEGF expression, independent of the previously identified hypoxia response element (HRE), in both Pa-4 epithelial and TR-BBB endothelial cells under normoxia. In addition, Etk utilizes both MEK/ERK and PI3-K/Pak1 signaling pathways in concert to activate VEGF transcription. Functionally, Etk activation elicits a profound stimulatory effect on TR-BBB cell proliferation and formation of capillary-like networks in Matrigel containing reduced levels of growth factors. Finally, antisense oligonucleotides against either endogenous VEGF or Etk abrogate the proliferation of Etk-activated TR-BBB cells, and exogenous VEGF treatment stimulates endogenous Etk tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs. Taken together, these results indicate that VEGF is both an Etk downstream target gene and an Etk upstream activator, constituting a reciprocal Etk-VEGF autoregulatory loop. These findings, to our knowledge, are the first delineation of a network of positive feedforward signaling pathways that converge on the Etk-VEGF axis, causally associating Etk-mediation of VEGF induction with enhanced cellular processes in both epithelial and endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064303142,"The human large B-cell lymphoma cell line RC-K8 has a rearranged REL locus that directs the production of a chimeric protein, termed REL-NRG (Non-Rel Gene). In this study, we show that RC-K8 cells have constitutively nuclear heterodimeric and homodimeric DNA-binding complexes that consist of p50, REL, and REL-NRG. In vitro, IkappaBalpha can block the DNA-binding activity of wild-type REL homodimers but not REL-NRG homodimers. In vivo, REL-NRG cannot activate transcription of a kappaB site reporter plasmid, suggesting that it is a transcription repressing or blocking REL protein. By Western blotting, no IkappaBalpha protein can be detected in extracts of RC-K8 cells. The absence of IkappaBalpha protein in RC-K8 cells appears to be due to mutations that cause premature termination of translation in three of the four copies of the IKBA gene in RC-K8 cells. Re-expression of wild-type IkappaBalpha or a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha in RC-K8 cells is cytotoxic; in contrast, expression of a dominant-negative form of IkappaB kinase does not affect the growth of RC-K8 cells. By cDNA microarray analysis, a number of previously identified Rel/NF-kappaB target genes are overexpressed in RC-K8 cells, consistent with there being transcriptionally active REL complexes. Taken together, our results suggest that the growth of RC-K8 cells is dependent on the activity of nuclear wild-type REL dimers, while the contribution of REL-NRG to the transformed state of RC-K8 cells is less clear. Nevertheless, the RC-K8 cell line is the first tumor cell line identified with mutations in genes encoding multiple proteins in the Rel/NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2322467893,"The mammalian protein DEK has been implicated in multiple cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, mRNA processing, and chromatin remodeling, and is associated with a number of clinical autoimmune and neoplastic conditions. The connection between DEK and cancer exists at multiple levels: (a) the t(6;9) chromosomal translocation that characterizes a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia cases results in the formation of a DEK-CAN fusion oncoprotein; (b) a fragment of dek cDNA is capable of partially reversing the radiation-sensitive phenotype of fibroblasts cultured from ataxia-telangiectasia patients; and (c) increased levels of dek mRNA have been found to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and melanoma. Despite the growing list of cancer subtypes with a connection to DEK, the factors that mediate its expression have yet to be characterized. Here we undertake the analysis of DEK regulation by mapping the discrete elements within the proximal promoter that are responsible for constitutive transcription of dek in transformed cells. We find that functional elements include an inverted CCAAT box and a YY1 consensus binding site, and the introduction of point mutations into these sites markedly diminishes transcriptional activity. In addition, we identify the transcriptional activator NF-Y as a member of the CCAAT-binding complex, and verify binding of the transcription factor YY1 at its consensus site in the dek promoter. The discovery of NF-Y and YY1 as regulatory determinants of DEK expression is consistent with the well-documented roles of these two factors in cellular proliferation and transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1963711553,"Ligand-induced transcription activation of retinoic acid (RA) target genes by nuclear receptors (retinoic acid (RAR) and retinoid X (RXR) receptors) depends on the recruitment of coactivators. We have previously demonstrated that the small 15-kDa cellular RA-binding protein II (CRABPII) is a coactivator present in the RA-dependent nuclear complex. As identifying cell-specific partners of CRABPII might help to understand the novel control of RA signaling, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a hematopoietic HL-60 cDNA library using human CRABPII as bait and have subsequently identified human cyclin D3 as a partner of CRABPII. Cyclin D3 interacted with CRABPII in a ligand-independent manner and equally bound RARα, but not RXRα, and only in the presence of RA. We further show that cyclin D3 positively modulated RA-mediated transcription through CRABPII. Therefore, cyclin D3 may be part of a ternary complex with CRABPII and RAR. Finally, we show that cyclin D3 expression paralleled HL-60 differentiation and arrest of cell growth. These findings led us to speculate that control of cell proliferation during induction of differentiation may directly involve, at the transcriptional level, nuclear receptors, coactivators, and proteins of the cell cycle in a cell- and nuclear receptor-specific manner.

Retinoic acid (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; h, human; m, mouse; LBD, ligand-binding domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; CRABPII, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; AAD, acidic activation domain; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plays a pivotal role in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates through its ability to directly control the transcription of target genes involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Retinoids mediate transcription through two classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ), which bind as RXR·RAR heterodimers to RA-response elements located in the promoter region of RA target genes. Like most nuclear receptors, RARs and RXRs share a highly conserved structure (1Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar), with ligand-binding (LBD) and DNA-binding (DBD) domains. In addition, they possess two autonomous transcription activation functions, AF-1 and AF-2. AF-1, located at the N-terminal end (A/B region), is ligand-independent; in contrast, AF-2, located in the C-terminal E region, is ligand-dependent (1Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces conformational changes in the LBD involving helix H12, which encompasses the core of AF-2 of the nuclear receptor, resulting in the creation of a new surface for the recruitment of coactivators, such as proteins of the p160 family (SRC-1 (steroid receptorcoactivator-1)/NCoA1, TIF2/GRIP-1/SRC-2, and p/CIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB-1/TRAM-1) and CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein)/p300 (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 3Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar, 4McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar). These coactivators are also associated with other large histone acetyltransferase complexes (such as the p/CAF complex) that lead to chromatin decondensation (5Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar, 6Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors further recruit an additional complex variously termed TRAP, DRIP, SMCC, or Mediator, which establishes contacts with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors (7Woychik N.A. Hampsey M. Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Google Scholar, 8Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Google Scholar). We previously showed that a small protein (15 kDa) belonging to the family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins that bind small hydrophobic molecules such as retinoids and fatty acids (9Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Google Scholar), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABPII), also acts as a coactivator of nuclear retinoid receptors (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar). Indeed, CRABPII can be found in the nucleus (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N.

Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar). Moreover, we (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar) and others (12Jing Y. Waxman S. Mira-y-Lopez R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1668-1672Google Scholar, 13Dong D. Ruuska S.E. Levinthal D.J. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23695-23698Google Scholar, 14Wolf G. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 151-153Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of CRABPII enhances transactivation of RA target genes by RXR·RAR heterodimers either in transfected cells or in human hematopoietic cells. This coactivator effect results from a physical interaction of CRABPII with the LBD of RARα or RXRα (15Bastie J.-N. Despouy G. Balitrand N. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Delva L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 67-73Google Scholar), which releases all-trans-RA from CRABPII to RARα (13Dong D. Ruuska S.E. Levinthal D.J. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23695-23698Google Scholar). To explain the function of this novel ligand-binding coactivator, we proposed the following scenario (15Bastie J.-N. Despouy G. Balitrand N. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Delva L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 67-73Google Scholar). First, holo-CRABPII docks to the apo-receptors bound to their promoters in the nucleus; the docking occurs around key structures of the ligand entrance pockets of CRABPII and the nuclear receptor. This establishes a channel that allows the release of RA from holo-CRABPII to apo-RARα or apo-RXRα. Because the CRABPII-nuclear RAR interaction does not require the presence of RA (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar), apo-CRABPII could remain bound to the holo-receptor, preventing dissociation of RA from the nuclear receptor. Thus, CRABPII would increase the stability of the DNA-bound RXR·RAR complex (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar), further contributing to the enhancement of RA-mediated transcription. As identifying cell-specific partners of CRABPII in the RA-dependent nuclear complex may help to understand the novel control of RA signaling, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a hematopoietic HL-60 cDNA library using human CRABPII as bait and have subsequently identified human cyclin D3 as a novel partner of CRABPII. We found that cyclin D3 interacted with CRABPII in a ligand-independent manner. No interaction was noted with other D-type cyclins (D1 or D2). Interestingly, cyclin D3 was also found to interact with RARα, but not with RXRα, and only in a RA-dependent manner. Cyclin D3 enhanced RA-mediated transactivation of RA target genes by increasing the interaction of CRABPII with RARα. Furthermore, we show that cyclin D3 expression paralleled the induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells. Our results identify cyclin D3 as a partner of a ternary complex with the coactivator CRABPII and the nuclear receptor RARα and demonstrate another level of transcriptional control during RA-induced differentiation and arrest of cell growth. Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against CRABPII (5CRA3B3) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the F region of RARα (RPα(F)) or the A region of RXRα (RPRXα(A)) (a gift from P. Chambon) were as described (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against cyclins D1–D3 (sc-717, sc-181, and sc-182, respectively) and goat polyclonal antibody directed against cyclin D3 (sc-182-G) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against actin (A-2066) was from Sigma (St. Quentin Fallavier, France). All-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA were supplied by Hoffman-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). The expression vectors for RARα (pSG5-hRARα), RXRα (pSG5-mRXRα), and CRABPII (pTL1-mCRABPII) were provided by P. Chambon. Plasmids encoding cyclins D1–D3 (pRC/CMV-hcyclinD1, pRC/CMV-hcyclinD2, and pRC/CMV-hcyclinD3, respectively) (16Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Google Scholar) were provided by M. E. Ewen. The hRARβ2-luciferase reporter construct (17de Thé H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Google Scholar) was provided by H. de Thé. Plasmids encoding GST-hRARα, GST-hRARαDEF, GST-hRARαDEFΔ(408–416), GST-mRARαAB, and GST-mRXRα (18vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.-M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Google Scholar, 19Bommer M. Benecke A. Gronemeyer H. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37961-37966Google Scholar) were provided by P. Chambon. The plasmid encoding GST-hCRABPII was previously described (15Bastie J.-N. Despouy G. Balitrand N. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Delva L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 67-73Google Scholar). hCRABPII was amplified by PCR from NB4 cells and cloned into the yeast pAS2-1 plasmid (Clontech), which contains the TRP1marker and directs synthesis of Gal4DBD fusion proteins. The following primers were used: 5′-CCCGAATTCATGCCCAACTTCTCTGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTGGATCCTCACTCTCGGACGTAGACCCT-3′ (reverse). hRARαDEF was cloned into the same vector after PCR amplification from pSG5-hRARα using the following primers: 5′-CCCGAATTCATGTCCAAGGAGTCGGTG-3′ and 5′-AGTGGATCCTCACGGGGAGTGGGTGGC-3′. All constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The yeast reporter strain Y190 (HIS3, lacZ, trp1,leu2, cyhr2) was previously described by Harper et al. (20Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar). Transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate procedure (21Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar), and expression of the fusion proteins was checked by immunoblotting. Standard media (Clontech) were used for yeast growth according to the manufacturer's protocols. An HL-60 Gal4AAD fusion library (a gift from J.-M. Garnier and P. Chambon) was inserted into the pACT2 vector, which contains the LEU2 marker and a cassette expressing nuclear localized Gal4AAD preceding a polylinker with cloning sites, and introduced into the Y190 reporter strain expressing hCRABPII from the pAS2-1 vector. The cells were then spread on Trp−/Leu−/His− plates containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) and 1 μmall-trans-RA. Plasmids from the isolated positive clones were recovered into Escherichia coli strain HB101 according to the protocol provided by Clontech and subjected to restriction analysis. pACT2 plasmids containing cDNA were identified by colony PCR using primers specific for theLEU2 gene contained in pACT2. The inserts were then sequenced. The yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with pACT2 expressing cyclin D3 and with either hCRABPII or hRARαDEF in pAS2-1. The cells were plated in selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and supplemented with 25 mm 3-AT and 1 μm all-trans-RA. After 3 days, a qualitative β-galactosidase assay was performed. Protein extracts were quantified by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and by Coomassie staining after separation by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of anti-cyclin D1, D2, or D3 antibody; a 1:1000 dilution of anti-RAR antibody; a 1:500 dilution of anti-CRABPII antibody; or a 1:4000 dilution of anti-actin antibody. The proteins were identified by chemiluminescence. GST and GST fusion proteins (GST-hRARα, GST-mRARαAB, GST-hRARαDEF, GST-hRARαDEFΔ(408–416), GST-mRXRα, and GST-hCRABPII) were expressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The GST proteins bound to the beads were then incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing translated35S-labeled cyclin D3 (T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega, Madison, WI) or with extracts from COS-6 cells overexpressing cyclin D3 as described (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in the presence or absence of 1 μm all-trans-RA. Bound proteins were recovered in SDS loading buffer, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting or by autoradiography of dried gels. COS-6 cells were transiently transfected in the presence or absence of 1 μm of all-trans-RA using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described (22Rousselot P. Hardas B. Patel A. Guidez F. Gaken J. Castaigne S. Dejean A. de Thé H. Degos L. Farzaneh F. Chomienne C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 545-551Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated as follows. The extracts were first incubated with goat anti-cyclin D3 or D2 antibody for 1 h and then with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for an additional hour. The immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitated proteins were revealed by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence. HL-60 cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from BioWhittaker Europe, Verviers, Belgium). HL-60 cells were electroporated, as previously described (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar), with the luciferase reporter gene (hRARβ2-luciferase) in the presence or absence of the expression vectors for cyclin D or CRABPII. All transfections also contained the β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110) as an internal standard and pRC/CMV as a carrier. Cells were treated or not with 1 μm all-trans-RA for 24 h, and luciferase assays were performed according to a standard procedure (Promega). All results are expressed as -fold induction based on the basal activity of the reporter gene in the absence of RA and of any expression vector. Differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes was induced by treatment with 1 μm all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA or 1.3% Me2SO. Nuclear extracts of control or treated cells were prepared after 1, 3, or 6 days; resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE; and tested for D-type cyclin and actin protein expression by immunoblotting. Cell differentiation was assayed by scoring the percentage of nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells in treated cellsversus untreated controls at 6 days after treatment. Cell growth was determined by counting the number of viable cells at the different time intervals with the trypan blue exclusion dye test. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with hCRABPII. Gal4DBD fused amino-terminally to hCRABPII in the pAS2-1 vector was expressed in yeast strain Y190, which contains two reporter genes: a HIS3reporter gene and a lacZ reporter gene, both under the control of Gal4-binding sites. No growth was observed on plates lacking histidine (either in the absence or presence of 3-AT, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product), indicating that hCRABPII on its own does not transactivate the HIS3 gene (data not shown). An HL-60 cDNA library was constructed in the pACT2 vector that directs synthesis of polypeptides fused to Gal4AAD. Y190 yeast cells expressing hCRABPII were transformed with this library. Approximately 1.0 × 106 Y190 yeast transformants were spread on His− plates containing 25 mm 3-AT in the absence or presence of 1 μm all-trans-RA. We analyzed colonies that grew on selective medium in the presence of 1 μm all-trans-RA and that turned blue when tested in a β-galactosidase assay. Plasmids were recovered from the few positive clones, amplified, subjected to restriction analysis, and sequenced. Sequence comparison with the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank and the Swiss Protein Database identified one 0.651-kb cDNA insert as the sequence encoding human cyclin D3 (accession number NM_001760). This cDNA fragment depicted the known open reading frame for cyclin D3, but lacked the nucleotides encoding the first 26 N-terminal amino acids and the last 33 C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the interaction of cyclin D3 with CRABPII, the Gal4AAD-cyclin D3 hybrid protein was expressed in the Y190 yeast strain in combination with pAS2-1CRABPII or the empty vector. The transformants were spread on His− plates containing 25 mm 3-AT and 1 μm all-trans-RA. Both proteins interacted as evidenced by growth of colonies on histidine-deficient medium and activation of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 B, area 3). No clones were obtained with the unrelated bait vector pAS2-1 (Fig. 1 B, area 2). These findings demonstrate that cyclin D3 interacts with CRABPII. We also tested whether cyclin D3 is able to interact with the DEF regions of RARα. The Gal4DBD-RARαDEF hybrid protein was expressed in the Y190 yeast strain either alone or in combination with the Gal4AAD-cyclin D3 hybrid protein. Both proteins interacted as evidenced by growth of colonies on histidine-deficient medium and activation of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 B). No clones were obtained when Y190 yeast cells were transformed with the empty vector (pACT2) and either pAS2-1CRABPII or pAS2-1RARαDEF (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that cyclin D3 can interact with both CRABPII and the DEF regions of RARα in yeast. To study further the data obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, binding assays with human cyclin D3 and hCRABPII were performed in vitro with recombinant proteins.35S-Labeled cyclin D3 produced by in vitrotranslation in rabbit reticulocytes was incubated with the GST-hCRABPII fusion protein attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound cyclin D3 was revealed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. In agreement with the two-hybrid data, human cyclin D3 interacted with hCRABPII (Fig.2). Beads loaded with the control GST protein did not retain cyclin D3 (Fig. 2, lane 2). This interaction occurred either in the presence (data not shown) or absence (Fig. 2, lane 3) of RA. No interactions were identified with various hCRABPII deletion mutants fused to GST corresponding to the nuclear receptor-interacting domains and the LBD of hCRABPII (15Bastie J.-N. Despouy G. Balitrand N. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Delva L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 67-73Google Scholar) (data not shown), suggesting that the complete structure of hCRABPII is essential for its interaction with cyclin D3. Interestingly, no interactions were observed under the same conditions with cyclins D1 and D2 (Fig. 2), suggesting that CRABPII interacts with only one type of d-type cyclin, cyclin D3. Binding assays with cyclin D3 and the DEF regions of RARα were also performed in vitro. Extracts from COS-6 cells overexpressing the different cyclins (D1–D3) were incubated with the GST-RARα fusion protein attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads in the presence or absence of all-trans-RA (Fig.3). Bound cyclins were revealed by immunoblotting. No interaction was detected in the absence of RA (Fig.3 A, lane 2). However, a RA-dependent interaction was observed between RARα and cyclin D3 (Fig.3 A, lane 3). No interaction was detected with cyclins D1 and D2 (data not shown). To identify which RARα domain is involved in the interaction with cyclin D3, several GST fusion proteins carrying deletions of RARα were tested in the presence or absence of RA. Compared with full-length RARα, RARα with its DBD and LBD deleted (RARαAB) (Fig.3 B) was impaired in its ability to interact with cyclin D3 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, the LBD of RARα (RARαDEF) retained its capacity to bind cyclin D3 in the presence of RA (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7 and8). Similarly, a RARαDEF mutant bearing an internal deletion of the core motif (RARαDEFΔ(408–416)) (Fig.3 B) involved in the recruitment of coactivators retained the RA-dependent interaction with cyclin D3 (Fig.3 C, lanes 9 and 10). Altogether, these results suggest that the interaction with cyclin D3 involves a motif located in the LBD, distinct from the AF-2 domain core, but whose accessibility depends on RA binding. It must be noted that, under the same conditions, cyclin D3 did not interact with GST-RXRα even in the presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that cyclin D3 interacts in vitro specifically with RARα. The interaction of cyclin D3 with CRABPII and RARα was further investigated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using COS-6 cells overexpressing cyclin D3 either alone or in combination with RARα or CRABPII and treated or not with RA. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D3 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Anti-cyclin D3 antibody immunoprecipitated both cyclin D3 and RARα from extracts of COS-6 cells cotransfected with the corresponding expression vectors and treated with RA (Fig. 4 A). These proteins were not revealed in control immunoprecipitations. Similarly, anti-cyclin D3 antibody co-immunoprecipitated CRABPII when both proteins were coexpressed in COS-6 cells (data not shown). Such a co-immunoprecipitation occurred whether the cells were treated or not with RA, corroborating the results obtained in two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. When both RARα and CRABPII expression vectors were cotransfected with cyclin D3 in COS-6 cells, anti-cyclin D3 antibody co-immunoprecipitated the three proteins (Fig. 4 B). It must be noted that this co-immunoprecipitation was observed whether or not the cells were treated with RA. Such a ligand-independent co-immunoprecipitation of RARα with cyclin D3 and CRABPII may reflect the RA-independent interaction of the receptor with CRABPII (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar, 15Bastie J.-N. Despouy G. Balitrand N. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Delva L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 67-73Google Scholar). Thus, one can hypothesize that, in vivo in the absence of RA, CRABPII forms a bridge between RARα and cyclin D3. We previously demonstrated that CRABPII acts as a coactivator for RA-mediated transactivation of target genes in HL-60 cells through its binding to RARs (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar). Having shown herein that RARα forms a complex not only with CRABPII, but also with cyclin D3, we studied the effects of cyclin D3 on RARα transactivation in either the absence or presence of CRABPII. HL-60 cells were transiently transfected with the hRARβ2-luciferase reporter construct in the absence or presence of the CRABPII and/or cyclin D3 expression vectors and treated with RA (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, the RA-induced luciferase activity was not affected upon overexpression of cyclin D3 (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained with different amounts of cyclin D3 expression vector (Fig.5 B). However, cyclin D3 significantly enhanced the increase in luciferase activity induced by CRABPII (Fig. 5). This effect was proportional to the amount of cyclin D3 expression vector (Fig.5 B). Cyclin D2 had no such effect (Fig. 5 A). Altogether, these data indicate that cyclin D3 modulates the coactivator effect of CRABPII on the transactivation of RA target genes. To investigate further how cyclin D3 enhances the transactivation of RA target genes through CRABPII, in vitro GST pull-down assays were performed. 35S-Labeled RARα produced by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocytes was incubated with the GST-hCRABPII fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in the presence or absence of COS-6 extracts overexpressing cyclin D3 (Fig. 6). As expected, in the absence of cyclin D3, RARα interacted with CRABPII, independently of RA (Fig. 6,lanes 2 and 3) (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar). However, higher amounts of RARα were retained in the presence of cyclin D3 in a RA-independent manner (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5). Therefore, cyclin D3 appears to increase the efficiency of the formation of the CRABPII·RAR complexes in vitro. These data confirm the results from the in vivo assay showing the formation of the ternary complex involving RAR, CRABPII, and cyclin D3 (Fig. 4 B). Such a process might be required for the increase in the transactivation of RA target genes observed with cyclin D3 in the presence of CRABPII. To unravel the physiological relevance of the interactions between RARα, CRABPII, and cyclin D3, the nuclear expression of cyclin D3 was examined in several RA-sensitive hematopoietic cell lines: myeloblastic HL-60, promyelocytic NB4, and monoblastic U-937 (Fig. 7 A). As shown by Western blot analysis, cyclin D3 was expressed in the nuclear compartment of all three cell lines, with the highest amounts being detected in U-937 cells (Fig. 7 A). Cyclin D2 and, to a lesser extent, cyclin D1 were also expressed in the three cell lines (Fig. 7 A). Because the induction of expression of cyclin D3 had previously been observed during differentiation of HL-60 cells by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or Me2SO (23Bartkova J. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1027-1037Google Scholar) and in F9 teratocarcinoma cells treated with different retinoids (24Li Y. Glozak M.A. Smith S.M. Rogers M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 372-384Google Scholar), we studied its expression in HL-60 cells after treatment with all-trans-RA (1 μm), 9-cis-RA (1 μm), or Me2SO (1.3%). Differentiation and cell growth were analyzed after 6 days of culture. Nuclear extracts of control and treated cells were prepared after 1, 3, or 6 days and immunoblotted with anti-cyclin D3 antibody (Fig. 7 B). Both retinoids and Me2SO differentiated HL-60 cells as evidenced by the acquisition of redox function (nitro blue tetrazolium test). A weaker efficacy for all-trans-RA compared with 9-cis-RA was noted, as previously reported (25Kizaki M. Ikeda Y. Tanosaki R. Nakajima H. Morikawa M. Sakashita A. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1993; 82: 3592-3599Google Scholar). Arrest of proliferation was achieved after 6 days of treatment (data not shown). Me2SO increased the expression of cyclin D3 from days 1 to 6 (Fig. 7 B, lanes 4, 8, and12). Cyclin D3 expression was modulated by both retinoids, with higher levels achieved with 9-cis-RA compared with all-trans-RA from day 3 (Fig. 7 B,lanes 7 and 11 and lanes 6 and10, respectively). Likewise, the cyclin D3 up-regulation correlated with all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA differentiation efficiency (Fig. 7 B, lanes 10 and11, respectively) and cell proliferation inhibition (data not shown). In this study, we isolated human cyclin D3 as a CRABPII-interacting protein. A physical RA-independent interaction between cyclin D3 and CRABPII was evidenced both in vitroand in vivo. No interactions were observed with various CRABPII deletion mutants, suggesting that the complete structure of CRABPII is essential for its interaction with cyclin D3. Furthermore, no interactions were identified between CRABPII and cyclin D1 or D2in vitro. These data suggest that the retinoic acid-independent CRABPII-cyclin D3 interaction is specific for only one member of d-type cyclins. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that cyclin D3 interacted with RARα, but not with RXRα. Once again, cyclin D3 was the onlyd-type cyclin that could interact with RARα. This interaction involved the DEF region of RARα and was observed in vitro as well as in yeast cells. Although the CRABPII-cyclin D3 interaction was RA-independent, the cyclin D3-RARα interaction required the presence of RA both in vitro and in vivo. Although cyclin D3 interacted physically with RARα in a RA-dependent manner, this interaction did not require the AF-2 “core” harboring the LLXXXL motif of RARα generally implicated in the ligand-dependent interaction between the nuclear receptors and the LXXLL motifs of their coactivators. RA may, however, be required to induce conformational changes around the AF-2 domain to facilitate the cyclin D3-RARα interaction. Surprisingly, the presence of CRABPII allowed cyclin D3 and RARα to interact in the absence of RA. Because CRABPII interacted with both RARα and cyclin D3 in a RA-independent manner, we hypothesize that CRABPII facilitates the recruitment of cyclin D3 on RARα both in the absence and presence of RA. As we have previously identified a coactivator function of CRABPII for the nuclear RARs (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar), the interaction between cyclin D3, CRABPII, and RARα led us to investigate the role of cyclin D3 in RA-mediated transactivation. On its own, cyclin D3 had no effect on RA-mediated transactivation. By contrast, in the presence of CRABPII, cyclin D3 positively modulated transcription activation. This may be due to an increase in the recruitment of CRABPII on RARα or an increase in the stability of the CRABPII-RARα interaction. Indeed, cyclin D3 appeared to increase the efficiency of the formation of the CRABPII·RAR complexes in vitro. Thus, cyclin D3 belongs to a ternary complex with RARα and CRABPII and enhances the CRABPII coactivator transactivation activity. This is the first study demonstrating that cyclin D3 is involved in nuclear receptor transcriptional regulation. Another d-type cyclin (D1) has been described as a bridging factor between the estrogen receptor and its coactivators to positively regulate nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation. Similar functions can be found between cyclins D1 and D3, as cyclin D1 binds estrogen receptor-α in the absence of ligand and enhances estrogen-dependent transactivation (16Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Google Scholar, 26Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Google Scholar, 27Lamb J. Ladha M.H. McMahon C. Sutherland R.L. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8667-8675Google Scholar) and binds the estrogen receptor and one of its coactivators, SRC-1 (28Ratajczak T. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 2001; 13: 221-229Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 may also promote or stabilize the association between the estrogen receptor and p/CAF, thereby increasing the histone acetyltransferase activity of the transcriptional machinery (29McMahon C. Suthiphongchai T. DiRenzo J. Ewen M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5382-5387Google Scholar). Conversely, cyclin D1 has also been reported to bind the androgen receptor through the N-terminal domain and to inhibit transactivation by directly competing for p/CAF binding (30Petre C.E. Wetherill Y.B. Danielsen M. Knudsen K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2207-2215Google Scholar, 31Reutens A.T. Fu M. Wang C. Albanese C. McPhaul M.J. Sun Z. Balk S.P. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Pestell R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 797-811Google Scholar). Apart from being specific for RARα, cyclin D3 has other distinct features. In contrast to the interaction between cyclin D1 and SRC-1, which involves the LLXXXL motif of cyclin D1 and the LXXLL motif of SRC-1 (32Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Google Scholar), the interaction between cyclin D3 and CRABPII is different, as cyclin D3 does not harbor any LLXXXL motif and thus will not bind potential or candidate coactivators through their LXXLL motifs. Interestingly, CRABPII does not have a LXXLL motif, strongly suggesting that, for its interaction with cyclin D3, other recognition motifs are involved. Hence, the involvement of a d-type cyclin in the transcriptional control of ligands directly implicated in cell growth and differentiation provides a new concept in which cell cycle regulatory proteins could play a dual function. Indeed, althoughd-type cyclins are essential regulatory subunits of the cyclin-dependent kinases (33Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Google Scholar, 34Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Google Scholar, 35Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar) and operate in mid-to-late G1 to allow cell progression in S phase (34Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Google Scholar,36Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Google Scholar, 37Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar, 38Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Google Scholar), the transactivation function of cyclin D1 was shown to be independent of CDK4 and Rb phosphorylation (16Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Google Scholar, 26Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J.

Although cyclins D1 and D2 have been extensively studied, few reports are available for cyclin D3. Structurally related to cyclins D1 and D2, cyclin D3 appears nevertheless to be more ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, although its role in cell proliferation is clearly evidenced in lymphocytes, it is mainly shown to accumulate in terminally differentiated tissues (23Bartkova J. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1027-1037Google Scholar). This characteristic was corroborated in vitro during differentiation of rodent myoblasts in which cyclin D3 expression was induced and reported to play an important role in irreversible cell cycle arrest of differentiated myocytes (39Jahn L. Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 297-307Google Scholar, 40Kiess M. Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 159-166Google Scholar, 41Rao S.S. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4093-4100Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm and extend previous data on HL-60 myeloid or F9 teratocarcinoma cells. Although all three cyclins could be detected in the nuclear compartment of different hematopoietic cells (HL-60, NB4, and U-937), only cyclin D3 expression paralleled the acquisition of differentiation features and the arrest of cell growth, as previously noted (23Bartkova J. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1027-1037Google Scholar, 24Li Y. Glozak M.A. Smith S.M. Rogers M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 372-384Google Scholar). Retinoids act as regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis and have been shown to specifically arrest myeloid cells in the G1phase of the cell cycle (42Dimberg A. Bahram F. Karlberg I. Larsson L.G. Nilsson K. Oberg F. Blood. 2002; 99: 2199-2206Google Scholar). In the ML-1 myeloid cell line, the cell cycle arrest associated with all-trans-RA-induced differentiation involves regulation of the expression of cyclin D3 and cyclin kinase inhibitors (p18 and p21), affects the phosphorylation status of cyclin-dependent kinases, and ultimately triggers dephosphorylation of the Rb protein (43Shimizu T. Awai N. Takeda K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4640-4646Google Scholar). Thus, in RA-mediated myeloid differentiation, the increased levels of cyclin D3 contrast with the cells' progressive arrest in G1 and point to a distinct effect on the establishment and/or maintenance of the differentiated status of the cell. The former may be explained by titration of cyclin D3 by either the cyclin D3-RAR or CRABPII-cyclin D3 interaction, whereas the latter may be related to cyclin D3 transcription activity on RA target genes involved in either differentiation (RAR, CRABPII, CD11b, Hox, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor genes (G-CSF)) and/or cell cycle inhibition (p21 and p27 genes) (44Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified in this study a novel level of molecular control associating three distinct partners of RA-mediated transcription (cyclin D3, CRABPII, and RARα) that connects three key cellular processes: the cell cycle, ligand bioavailability, and gene expression. From our results and other published data (10Delva L. Bastie J.-N. Rochette-Egly C. Kraiba R. Balitrand N. Despouy G. Chambon P. Chomienne C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7158-7167Google Scholar, 15Bastie J.-N. Despouy G. Balitrand N. Rochette-Egly C. Chomienne C. Delva L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 67-73Google Scholar, 45Budhu S.A. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2632-2641Google Scholar), we may establish a physiological model (Fig.8). After binding to RA, CRABPII translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (45Budhu S.A. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2632-2641Google Scholar). Holo-CRABPII then docks to the apo-nuclear receptors bound to their promoters. Cyclin D3 forms a ternary complex and allows the stability of the CRABPII-RAR-RA interaction to increase and thus to enhance the transactivation activity of the complex.

https://openalex.org/W2325251560,"Ras is a major signaling molecule activated by interleukin-6. There have been no published reports, however, that specifically examine the kinetics and percentage of Ras activation in response to IL-6. Model cell lines were used to study activation of N- and K-ras induced by IL-6. All of the myeloma cell lines we tested express both N-ras and K-ras, but not H-ras. GTP-bound Ras was measured and the percentage of the total Ras pool that was activated in response to IL-6 was calculated. IL-6 is able to transiently activate both N- and K-ras in the ANBL6 cell line. In addition, increasing concentrations of IL-6 are able to activate increasing levels of both N- and K-ras. One ng/ml of IL-6 is able to activate approximately 10% of the N-ras pool and 18% of the K-ras pool. The amount of Ras-GTP in the cells correlates with the level of proliferation at low levels, but proliferation plateaus when higher levels of Ras-GTP are present. Protection from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis correlates with IL-6 concentration and Ras activation. However, IL-6 enhances apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. Interestingly, the ANBL6 cell line transfected with an N-ras12 or a K-ras12 gene is protected from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1971530571,"Mdm2 overexpression confers a growth promoting activity upon cells primarily by downregulating the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Nevertheless, Mdm2 deregulation has also been implicated in inhibiting TGF-beta growth repression in a p53 independent manner. Our goal in this study was to examine whether overexpression of Mdm2 or MdmX, a Mdm2-related protein, could affect Smad-induced transactivation. As downstream signaling elements of the TGF-beta pathway, Smads represent one potential target for Mdm2 and MdmX. Here we show that MdmX but not Mdm2 is capable of inhibiting Smad induced transactivation. Based on deletion mutant analysis, MdmX inhibition of Smad transactivation was independent of the p53 and Mdm2 interaction domains, yet required amino acid residues 128-444. Using TGF-beta sensitive HepG2 cells, MdmX overexpression was shown to inhibit TGF-beta induced Smad transactivation. Additionally, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking p53 and MdmX showed enhanced Smad transactivation when compared to MEFs lacking either p53 or p53 and Mdm2. Interestingly, the inhibition of Smad transactivation by MdmX could be reversed by p300, a functional co-activator of Smads and a necessary factor for Mdm2 nuclear export and did not result from altered Smad localization. In vitro studies demonstrate that MdmX binds to p300 as well as Smad3 and Smad4. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of Smad-induced transactivation by MdmX occurs by altering Smad interaction with its coactivator p300."
https://openalex.org/W2006200975,"The yeast vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) contains three proteolipid subunits: c (Vma3p), c′ (Vma11p), and c“ (Vma16p). Each subunit contains a buried glutamate residue that is essential for function, and these subunits are not able to substitute for each other in supporting activity. Subunits c and c′ each contain four putative transmembrane segments (TM1–4), whereas subunit c” is predicted to contain five. To determine whether TM1 of subunit c“ serves an essential function, a deletion mutant of Vma16p was constructed lacking TM1 (Vma16p-ΔTM1). Although this construct does not complement the loss of Vma3p or Vma11p, it does complement the loss of full-length Vma16p. Vacuoles isolated from the strain expressing Vma16p-ΔTM1 showed V-ATPase activity and proton transport greater than 80% relative to wild type and displayed wild type levels of subunits A and a, suggesting normal assembly of the V-ATPase complex. These results suggest that TM1 of Vma16p is dispensable for both activity and assembly of the V-ATPase. To obtain information about the topology of Vma16p, labeling of single cysteine-containing mutants using the membrane-permeable reagent 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) and the -impermeable reagent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was tested. Both the Cys-less form of Vma16p and eight single cysteine-containing mutants retained greater than 80% of wild type levels of activity. Of the eight mutants tested, two (S5C and S178C) were labeled by MPB. MPB-labeling of S5C was blocked by AMS in intact vacuoles, whereas S178C was blocked by AMS only in the presence of permeabilizing concentrations of detergent. In addition, a hemagglutinin epitope tag introduced into the C terminus of Vma16p was recognized by an anti-hemagglutinin antibody in intact vacuolar membranes, suggesting a cytoplasmic orientation for the C terminus. These results suggest that subunit c” contains four rather than five transmembrane segments with both the N and C terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

Acidification of these compartments is essential for many cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting, protein processing and degradation, and coupled transport. V-ATPases are also present in the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells, including osteoclasts (9Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Google Scholar), renal intercalated cells (10Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Google Scholar), and neutrophils (11Nanda A. Brumell J.H. Nordstrom T. Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15963-15970Google Scholar), where they function in such processes as bone resorption, renal acidification, and pH homeostasis, respectively. The V-ATPases from fungi, plants, and animals are structurally very similar and are composed of two domains (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar, 2Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Google Scholar, 3Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 61-70Google Scholar, 4Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 677-689Google Scholar). The V1domain is a 570-kDa peripheral complex composed of eight different subunits of molecular mass of 70 to 14 kDa (subunits A–H) that is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain is a 260-kDa integral complex composed of five subunits of molecular mass 100 to 17 kDa (subunits a, d, c, c′, and c“) that is responsible for proton translocation. The overall structure of the V-ATPase is therefore similar to that of the F1F0-ATP synthase (or F-ATPase) that functions in ATP synthesis in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (12Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Google Scholar, 13Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Google Scholar, 14Fillingame R.H. J. Exp.

Sequence homology between these classes of ATPase has been identified for both the nucleotide-binding subunits (16Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9102-9112Google Scholar, 17Bowman B.J. Allen R. Wechser M.A. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14002-14007Google Scholar) and the proteolipid subunits (18Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Google Scholar, 19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar). Unlike the F-ATPases, however, which contain a single type of proteolipid subunit (subunit c), the V-ATPases contain three different proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c“). All three proteolipid subunits are highly hydrophobic proteins, and all three are essential for V-ATPase function (19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar). In yeast, subunits c, c′, and c” are encoded by the VMA3, VMA11, and VMA16 genes, respectively. The V-ATPase proteolipid subunits are homologous both to each other and to the F-ATPase subunit c, from which they appear to have been derived by gene duplication and fusion (18Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Google Scholar). Thus, the F-ATPase subunit c is an 8-kDa protein containing two transmembrane segments with an essential aspartate residue present in TM2 (14Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Google Scholar). Subunits c and c′ of the V-ATPase are 16-kDa proteins containing four putative transmembrane segments with an essential glutamate residue present in TM4 (18Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Google Scholar, 19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal halves of subunits c and c′ are homologous to each other. Subunit c has been shown recently (20Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Google Scholar) to contain the binding site for the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin. By contrast, subunit c“ of the V-ATPase is a 21-kDa protein predicted to have five transmembrane helices (19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar). Although TM2 to TM5 of subunit c” are homologous to subunits c and c′, TM1 is not similar to anything in these proteins. Interestingly, the essential glutamate residue of subunit c“ is located in TM3 (19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that the C terminus of mouse subunit c is present on the lumenal side of the membrane, whereas the C terminus of subunit c” is located on the cytoplasmic side (21Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34122-34130Google Scholar). These results suggest that the membrane organization of subunit c“ is different from that of subunit c. In this study, we address the functional role of the first transmembrane segment of subunit c”, and we report additional information concerning the membrane topology of this protein. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Concanamycin A was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The monoclonal antibody 3F10 (directed against the HA antigen) that is conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was also from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A subunit (22Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Google Scholar), the monoclonal antibody 10D7 against the 100-kDa a subunit (23Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Google Scholar), 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB), and 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) were from Molecular Probes. Escherichia coli and yeast culture media were purchased from Difco. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were from Invitrogen, Promega, and New England Biolabs. ATP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strains lacking the proteolipid genes, TNY101 (vma3Δ), TNY102 (vma11Δ), and TNY103 (vma16Δ), were constructed by replacing the entire coding region of each gene (VMA3, VMA11, or VMA16) with theTRP gene in the YPH500 strain. YEPD buffered to pH 5.5 or pH 7.5 was used for selection of strains showing a vma− phenotype. VMA3, VMA11, and VMA16genes were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from yeast strain YPH500 and then cloned into the pRS413 yeast shuttle vector. The sequences of the cloned genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems. The oligonucleotides primers used for amplification of these genes are as follows: VMA3 forward, ggctctagaacttctgcgttattattaataattg, and VMA3 reverse, gccatcgatgaaatgaggtagtttggatatgaag; VMA11 forward, gatctattgaccaaaacaggtgtggaaac, and VMA11 reverse, ggaggcctagggttttctttcaagtatacacag; VMA16 forward, cacatgacgccgatttagaagtttcaatg, and VMA16 reverse, ggtctagatcccaggtctcacggaaatcttatc. An HA tag was introduced at the C terminus of each protein using a PCR-based recombination method (21Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34122-34130Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking functional endogenous Vma3p, Vma11p, or Vma16p were transformed using the lithium acetate method (24Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on histidine minus (HIS−) plates, and growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mmKH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated using a modification of the protocol described by Uchida et al. (25Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C to 1 × 107 cells/ml in 1 liter of selective medium. Cells were pelleted, washed once with water, and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.4. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, cells were pelleted again, washed once with 100 ml of YEPD medium containing 0.7m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5, resuspended in 100 ml of YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5, and 2 mg of Zymolase 100T, and incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 60 min. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients. Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Vacuolar membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8 or 12.5% acrylamide gels. The expression of Vma16p and Vma16p-ΔTM1 was detected by Western blotting using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA, whereas Vph1p or Vma1p was detected by monoclonal antibody 10D7 and 8B1-F3 (Molecular Probes, OR), respectively, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Assembly of the V-ATPase was assessed by measurement of the amount of subunit A present on isolated vacuolar membranes (23Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Google Scholar, 26Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Google Scholar). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). To determine whether the C terminus of Vma16p is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, the accessibility of the HA epitope tag introduced at the C terminus in intact vacuoles was determined. Anti-HA antibody was added to intact vacuolar membrane vesicle (100 μg) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Vacuolar membranes were washed with the overlay buffer (20 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.6, 0.25 mmMgCl2, 1.1 m glycerol) and solubilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9, and the Vma16p::HA was recovered with protein G-Sepharose. As a control, the anti-HA antibody was added to C12E9-solubilized vacuolar membranes followed by precipitation of the Vma16p::HA with protein G-Sepharose. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Vma16p was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the Supersignal ULTRA chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Chemical labeling of introduced cysteine residues by the membrane-permeant sulfhydryl reagent MPB and blocking by the membrane-impermeant reagent AMS was performed using a modification of the protocol described previously (27Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Google Scholar). Briefly, vacuolar membrane vesicles were washed using labeling buffer (10 mmMES-Tris, pH 7.0, 0.25 mm MgCl2, and 1.1m glycerol) and divided into two tubes. AMS (100 μm) was added to one tube, and both samples were incubated for 5 min at 15 °C. Samples were then transferred to ice and diluted 5-fold with labeling buffer followed immediately by addition of 250 μm MPB and incubation for 15 min at 25 °C. The labeling reaction was then stopped by addition of 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After MPB labeling, vesicles were pelleted and solubilized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9. The V0domain was immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal antibody 10D7 specific for Vph1p plus protein G-Sepharose. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated NeutrAvidin and developed using the Supersignal ULTRA chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin, as described previously (29Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured in transport buffer (25 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mmMgCl2) using the fluorescence probe ACMA (9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine) in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin, as described previously (29Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the sequence alignment of the three proteolipid subunits of the yeast V-ATPase: subunit c (Vma3p), subunit c′ (Vma11p), and subunit c“ (Vma16p). As can be seen, subunits c and c′ both contain four putative transmembrane helices and share significant sequence homology with each other and with transmembrane segments 2–5 of subunit c”. By contrast, TM1 of subunit c“ is not homologous to any other sequence in the other two proteolipid subunits. The location of the buried glutamate residue critical for function of each of the proteolipid subunits is depicted in Fig. 2 a. To address the functional role of TM1 of subunit c”, a deleted form of subunit c“ was constructed (Vma16p-ΔTM1) lacking amino acid residues 2–41 that contain TM1 (Fig. 1). We first tested the ability of this construct to complement the phenotype of yeast strains disrupted in each of the proteolipid genes. It has been shown previously that yeast lacking any of the V-ATPase genes (or the pair of genes encoding subunit a) display a conditional lethal phenotype (vma−) characterized by an inability to grow at pH 7.5 but retaining the ability to grow at pH 5.5 (31Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Google Scholar, 32Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2 b, the full-length genes are only able to complement their own disruption and not that of the other proteolipid genes. Moreover, Vma16p-ΔTM1 does not complement the loss of either Vma3p or Vma11p. Surprisingly, however, Vma16p-ΔTM1 does complement the loss of the full-length Vma16p protein. This result suggests that TM1 is not essential for V-ATPase function.Figure 2Deletion of the first transmembrane region of Vma16p does not alter V-ATPase function. a, schematic illustration of the domain structure of Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p. Putative transmembrane regions are indicated asboxes, and the positions of the essential glutamate residues in each subunit are indicated as open circles. The glutamate residue shown in the shaded circle in TM5 of Vma16p has been shown not to be essential for function (19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar).b, growth phenotype at pH 7.5 of yeast strains disrupted in the indicated proteolipid genes (host cell) upon introduction of the indicated full-length genes or the Vma16p-ΔTM1 construct. c, Western blot analysis of vacuoles isolated from a vma16Δ strain expressing HA-tagged forms of Vma16p or the Vma16p-ΔTM1 construct. Western blotting was performed using antibodies against the HA epitope, the V1subunit Vma1p, or the V0 subunit Vph1p as described under “Experimental Procedures.” d, concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity (hatched bars) or ATP-dependent proton transport (open bars) was measured for vacuoles isolated from the vma16Δ strain expressing the HA-tagged forms of Vma16p or Vma16p-ΔTM1. The specific activity of the ATPase in the vacuoles isolated from the strain expressing the full-length HA-tagged Vma16p was 0.49 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein at 30 °C and 0.5 mm ATP, which corresponds to ∼70% of the activity measured for the full-length untagged Vma16p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous results (33Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Google Scholar, 34MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Google Scholar) have suggested that retention of ∼20% of wild type V-ATPase activity is sufficient to confer on cells a wild type growth phenotype. It is therefore necessary to measure directly V-ATPase activity and proton transport in vacuoles isolated from cells expressing the Vma16p-ΔTM1 construct in order to determine quantitatively the effect of removal of TM1 of Vma16p on V-ATPase function. We first wished to test the stability of the Vma16p-ΔTM1 protein and its ability to assemble with other V-ATPase subunits. To accomplish this, an HA epitope tag was inserted at the C-terminal end of both the full-length Vma16p and the Vma16p-ΔTM1. This was necessary because of the lack of available antibodies against the native Vma16p protein. As can be seen in Fig. 2 c, although Western blots of vacuoles isolated from the strain expressing Vma16p-ΔTM1 showed somewhat reduced reactivity with the anti-HA antibody relative to vacuoles isolated from the strain expressing the full-length Vma16p, both Vma1p (subunit A of the V1 domain) and Vph1p (subunit a of the V0 domain) were present at normal levels on the vacuolar membrane. It has been shown previously (19Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Google Scholar, 23Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Google Scholar) that the absence of any of the proteolipid subunits results in the failure of V1 to assemble onto the vacuolar membrane and aberrant assembly and targeting of the V0 domain. These results thus suggest that TM1 of subunit c“ is dispensable for normal assembly of the V-ATPase complex. The lower level of antibody staining of the Vma16p-ΔTM1 construct in isolated vacuoles may reflect partial proteolytic removal of the HA tag or altered reactivity of the HA epitope in this construct. Finally, measurement of both concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport (as assessed by quenching of ACMA fluorescence) in isolated vacuoles (Fig. 2 d) indicates that V-ATPase complexes containing Vma16p-ΔTM1 have nearly the same activity and coupling as complexes containing the full-length Vma16p. These results confirm that TM1 of Vma16p is not necessary for V-ATPase function. Previously, we demonstrated that the C terminus of the mouse subunit c“ appears to be facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane in COS-1 cells transfected with a HA-tagged form of the mouse Vma16p homologue (21Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34122-34130Google Scholar). To confirm this result for the yeast protein, we compared the accessibility of an HA epitope attached at the C terminus of Vma16p in intactversus solubilized vacuolar membrane vesicles. One sample of vacuolar membranes was incubated with an anti-HA antibody followed by washing, detergent solubilization, and immunoprecipitation of the complexes containing the bound HA antibody. As a control, vacuolar membranes were solubilized with detergent first before addition of the anti-HA antibody and immunoprecipitation. Both samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, the amount of anti-HA antibody binding to Vma16p::HA is similar whether the immunoprecipitating antibody was added before or after detergent solubilization. The somewhat higher level of antibody binding observed in the right lane of Fig. 3 may be due to some change in interaction between the subunits upon detergent solubilization of the complex or to the loss of some antibody during washing of the membranes in the case where antibody is added before detergent solubilization. This result indicates that the antibody-binding site at the C terminus of Vma16p::HA is exposed in intact vacuolar membrane vesicles and hence resides on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In order to obtain additional information about the topology of subunit c“, we employed cysteine mutagenesis and covalent modification by the membrane-permeant sulfhydryl reagent MPB and the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent AMS. This method has been employed previously to study the membrane folding of subunit a of the F1F0-ATP synthase of E. coli (35Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Google Scholar, 36Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar), and we have used this method to study the topology of subunit a of the yeast V-ATPase (27Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Google Scholar). In order to apply this method to subunit c”, we first constructed a Cys-less form of Vma16p by replacing each of the three endogenous cysteine residues present at positions 67, 105, and 159 with serine (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the HA-tagged form of Vma16p described above in order to facilitate detection of the expressed proteins by Western blot. As can be seen in Fig.4 a, the Cys-less form of the HA-tagged Vma16p was expressed at normal levels in isolated vacuoles relative to the wild type HA-tagged Vma16p. Moreover, both Vma1p and Vph1p were present at normal levels in isolated vacuoles, suggesting that removal of the endogenous cysteine residues of Vma16p did not perturb assembly of the V-ATPase. Finally, measurement of concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport indicated that the Cys-less form of Vma1p gave rise to V-ATPase complexes possessing wild type levels of both ATPase activity and proton transport (Fig. 4 b). By using this Cys-less, HA-tagged form of Vma16p as the starting point, seven single-cysteine containing mutants were constructed by replacement of the endogenous residues at positions Ser-5, Ser-11, Ser-55, Ser-135, Ser-137, Ser-178, and Ser-210 with cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis. An additional mutant (Q213C) of the untagged form of Vma16p was also constructed. Because this mutant contained a cysteine residue at the very C terminus, it was felt that it would be better to use an untagged form of Vma16p to analyze labeling because of the possibility of interference with access of the labeling reagents by the presence of the C-terminal HA tag. These mutant forms of Vma16p were expressed in the VMA16 deletion strain, and the growth phenotype was analyzed at pH 7.5 and 5.5. All mutants displayed a wild type growth phenotype at both pH values (data not shown). Western blot analysis of vacuoles isolated from the mutant strains (Fig.4 a) revealed wild type levels of the HA-tagged Vma16p protein for six of the seven tagged mutants (only S210C showed somewhat lower labeling than wild type). In addition, all of the mutants (including Q213C) showed normal levels of Vma1p and Vph1p on the vacuolar membrane. Finally, vacuoles isolated from each of the mutant strains displayed at least 80% of wild type levels of activity for both concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport (Fig. 4 b). These results indicate that the cysteine substitutions in Vma16p do not significantly compromise stability, assembly, or activity of the V-ATPase complex. We next determined the ability of each of the introduced cysteine residues to react with the membrane-permeant reagent MPB. Vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from each of the mutant strains were reacted with 250 μm MPB for 15 min at 25 °C followed by detergent solubilization and immunoprecipitation of the V0complexes with the monoclonal antibody 10D7 directed against subunit a. Previous studies have shown that this antibody only recognizes its epitope on subunit a in the free V0 domain and not in the intact V1V0 complex (23Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Steven"
https://openalex.org/W1992811168,"This study evaluates the role of the N-terminal extension from yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase in tRNA aspartylation. The presence of an RNA-binding motif in this extension, conserved in eukaryotic class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, provides nonspecific tRNA binding properties to this enzyme. Here, it is assumed that the additional contacts the 70 amino acid-long appendix of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase makes with tRNA could be important in expression of aspartate identity in yeast. Using in vitro transcripts mutated at identity positions, it is demonstrated that the extension grants better aminoacylation efficiency but reduced specificity to the synthetase, increasing considerably the risk of noncognate tRNA mischarging. Yeast tRNAGlu(UUC) and tRNAAsn(GUU) were identified as the most easily mischarged tRNA species. Both have a G at the discriminator position, and their anticodon differs only by one change from the GUC aspartate anticodon.

Aminoacylation of tRNA is a key step during translation of genetic information. It is performed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; RS, tRNA synthetase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid); mcm5s2U, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; RS, tRNA synthetase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid); mcm5s2U, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine and involves specific recognition of their cognate tRNAs and amino acids (reviewed in Ref. 1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Google Scholar). Fidelity of translation depends on accurate tRNA aminoacylation, but unexpectedly, this reaction does not occur with absolute specificity (2Ebel J.-P. Giegé R. Bonnet J. Kern D. Befort N. Bollack C. Fasiolo F. Gangloff J. Dirheimer G. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 547-557Google Scholar). This dilemma is resolved since synthetases developed kinetic artifices ensuring destruction of the mischarged tRNAs (editing), thereby reducing error levels in protein synthesis (3Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 1999; 286: 1893-1897Google Scholar). Furthermore, specialized proteins, by interacting with certain synthetases, increase their affinity for the cognate tRNA and thus ensure increased aminoacylation efficiency. This is the case in the association of Arc1p with MetRS and GluRS in yeast (4Deinert K. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6000-6008Google Scholar) and of p43 with ArgRS in mammals (5Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Google Scholar). A similar “helper” role seems to be played by the extra domains within eukaryotic synthetases. Indeed, these enzymes differ usually from their prokaryotic counterparts by appendices located in their N- or C-terminal regions (6Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Google Scholar), outside the structural core defining the two classes of synthetases (7Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Google Scholar). In mammals, the extensions are involved in the formation of the multi-synthetase complex (6Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Google Scholar), but such architecture has not been detected in unicellular eukaryotes until now. In fact, little is known about the functional role of the extensions in unicellular eukaryotic synthetases, except that in two different yeast aminoacylation systems, they were shown to provide nonspecific tRNA binding properties to GlnRS (8Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Google Scholar, 9Wang C.-C. Morales A.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17180-17186Google Scholar) and AspRS (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Google Scholar). Yeast AspRS contains an N-terminal appendix of 70 amino acids that adopts a helical structure (11Lorber B. Mejdoub H. Reinbolt J. Boulanger Y. Giegé R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 155-161Google Scholar, 12Agou F. Yang Y. Gesquière J.-C. Waller J.-P. Guittet E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 569-576Google Scholar). It encompasses an RNA-binding motif (XSKXXLKKXK) conserved in eukaryotic AspRSs but also in eukaryotic LysRSs and AsnRSs (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Google Scholar), the two other class IIb synthetase families. The appendix, located next to the anticodon-binding module, was shown to considerably increase the stability of the complex between AspRS and cognate tRNAAspas shown by gel-shift binding assays and footprinting experiments. Moreover, the AspRS appendix can be replaced by the appendices of LysRS or AsnRS (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Google Scholar). Likewise, it was recently demonstrated that the extension in human LysRS shares the same properties of those in yeast AspRS (13Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Google Scholar). However, its presence in AspRS is not mandatory for tRNA aminoacylation (11Lorber B. Mejdoub H. Reinbolt J. Boulanger Y. Giegé R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 155-161Google Scholar, 14Eriani G. Prevost G. Kern D. Vincendon P. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 337-343Google Scholar). As seen in the crystal structure of yeast AspRS complexed with tRNAAsp (15Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Google Scholar), and in that recently solved of the free enzyme truncated of its first 70 amino acids (16Sauter C. Lorber B. Cavarelli J. Moras D. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1313-1324Google Scholar), only the core of the enzyme is required for tRNA aspartylation. Specificity of tRNA recognition by yeast AspRS is primarily ensured by the tRNA identity determinants. Only six such determinants, located in three distinct regions of tRNAAsp (Fig.1 A), are important to confer the aspartate identity. They are the discriminator base G73, four bases in the anticodon loop (G34, U35, C36, and C38), and base pair G10-U25 in the core region of the tRNA (17Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Google Scholar, 18Frugier M. Söll D. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9912-9921Google Scholar). Mutation of these elements leads to losses in aspartylation efficiencies (17Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Google Scholar), the strongest determinants being those leading to the strongest effects upon mutation (e.g. G73 and the aspartate anticodon G34, U35, C36). Except for identity base pair G10-U25, which is involved in the correct folding of the tRNA (19Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Google Scholar) and has no direct contact with the enzyme, all other identity bases make specific interactions with amino acid residues on AspRS (20Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. Nature. 1993; 362: 181-184Google Scholar). Nonspecific contacts, however, are much more numerous. As shown by biochemical and x-ray data, they extend along the side of the tRNA comprising the variable region (15Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Google Scholar, 21Romby P. Moras D. Bergdoll M. Dumas P. Vlassov V.V. Westhof E. Ebel J.-P. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 455-471Google Scholar, 22Rudinger J. Puglisi J.D. Pütz J. Schatz D. Eckstein F. Florentz C. Giegé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5882-5886Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B, left). Additional nonspecific contacts are provided by the N-terminal extension of native AspRS and are found along the opposite side of the tRNA (Fig. 1 B,right). They increase the stability of the complex and the global aminoacylation efficiency (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Google Scholar). Considering the better affinity of tRNAAsp for native AspRS and the increased aspartylation efficiency correlated with the presence of the N-terminal extension in the native enzyme, it can be conjectured that the additional contacts between the two macromolecular partners play a role in the mechanisms ensuring the specificity of genetic code expression at the translational level. By mutational analysis of tRNAAsp and AspRS, it is shown that the N-terminal extension is responsible for a decrease in aminoacylation specificity, thereby favoring aspartylation of noncognate tRNAs. The identified mischarged tRNAs are related with tRNAAsp by their anticodon sequence, in agreement with the concept of partial conservation of determinants in mischarged tRNAs. Altogether, a mechanistic role of the yeast AspRS N-terminal extension in the aspartylation reaction of tRNA is established. This has functional implications for the specific expression of aspartate identity in vivo. Native AspRS1–557 from yeast and truncated AspRS71–557, deleted of its N-terminal extension, were expressed and purified as described previously (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Google Scholar). In short, the genes were cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pQE70 (Qiagen) fused to a C-terminal His6 tag. AspRS variants were purified according to the Qiagen protocol, quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and stored at −20 °C in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 50% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. AspRS preparations yielded only one band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, even when overloaded, and can be estimated to be 99% pure. Specific activities, expressed as turnover numbers, correspond to 0.20 and 0.19 s−1 for AspRS1–557 and AspRS71–557, respectively (assays conducted in the presence of 25 μm aspartate, a subsaturating amino acid concentration, see Ref. 23Lorber B. Kern D. Dietrich A. Gangloff J. Ebel J.-P. Giegé R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1983; 117: 259-267Google Scholar) or to 3.4 and 3.1 s−1 for AspRS1–557 and AspRS71–557, respectively (assays conducted in the presence of 500 μm aspartate, a concentration close to the physiological level of aspartate in yeast cells, see Ref.24Messenguy F. Colin D. Ten Have J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 439-447Google Scholar). An enriched protein extract deprived of nucleic acids and ribosomes was made by chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Bio-Rad) and used as a crude enzyme preparation containing the activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (except for prolylation and glutaminylation). tRNA transcripts used in this work have been obtained by in vitrotranscription of synthetic genes cloned in pUC 118 (17Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Google Scholar). Each of these genes corresponds to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter region directly connected to the downstream tRNA sequence. In vitrotranscriptions were performed in reaction mixtures containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 (37 °C), 22 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 0.1 mm spermidine, 4 mm each of nucleoside triphosphate, 5 mm GMP, 50 ng/μl linearized plasmid, and 5 μg/ml T7 RNA polymerase. Transcription mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction. Full-length transcripts correctly ending with the CCA sequence were purified by preparative electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gels (8 m urea) followed by electroelution in Tris-borate-EDTA (Schleicher and Schuell apparatus). The concentration of tRNA transcripts was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Countercurrent fractions enriched in tRNAAsn, tRNAAsp or tRNAGlu were gifts from G. Keith. Pure tRNAAsnand tRNAGlu were obtained by purification on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (19/1), in semidenaturing conditions (4m urea). Migration was performed at 300 V for 48 h at 4 °C. Bands containing pure tRNAs were handled as described for tRNA transcripts. Pure tRNAAsp was a gift from A. Théobald-Dietrich. The purity of tRNAs (>95%) was established by testing their cognate amino acid acceptance. Aminoacylations of tRNAAsp variants have been performed at 37 °C in 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 30 mm KCl, 25 μml-[3H]aspartate (AmershamBiosciences), and appropriate amounts of tRNA transcripts. Before aminoacylation, transcripts were renatured in H2O by heating at 85 °C for 90 s and slow cooling to room temperature prior adjunction of MgCl2. Aminoacylation reactions were initiated by addition of appropriate amounts of enzyme diluted in 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithioerythritol, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Aminoacylated tRNA samples were quenched in trichloroacetic acid and treated by the conventional way on Whatman paper 3 MM (25Perret V. Garcia A. Puglisi J.D. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 735-744Google Scholar). Kinetic constants (k cat and K m) were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. In general, the concentration of tRNA transcripts ranged from 0.1 to 5 K m when possible, except for mutants with K m over 10 μm, where the highest concentration was at most 2–3K m. Plateaus of tRNA aspartylation were determined by incubating 1 μm pure tRNA (transcript or modified species) or 20 μm total tRNA in the presence of different AspRS (0.05–5 μm) and aspartate (25–500 μm) concentrations and otherwise optimal reaction conditions (as above). Reactions were stopped after 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 min incubation at 37 °C. Displayed kinetics and plateaus represent an average of at least two independent experiments. Values ofk cat/K m ratios for replicate experiments varied by at most 15%. The brewers' yeast tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Titration by aminoacylation assays, using crude synthetases extract and 25 μm aspartate, indicated a content of 4.5 ± 0.5% tRNAAsp in this total tRNA (deduced from plateau values). To avoid modification of thiolated bases during periodate oxidation (26Houssier C. Degée P. Nicoghosian K. Grosjean H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1988; 5: 1259-1266Google Scholar), the total yeast tRNA was DTNB-treated as follows. Total tRNA (20,000 pmol) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, in the presence of 0.3 mm DTNB (Sigma). DTNB was removed by dialyzing 12 h against milliQ water, and tRNA was recovered by precipitation. Total tRNA (20 μm, containing ∼1 μm tRNAAsp) was incubated with 10 μm native or truncated AspRS in the presence of 500 μm aspartic acid (ratio [AspRS]/[tRNAAsp] = 5). Aminoacylation was conducted at 37 °C for 25 min; it was stopped by phenol extraction (pH 5.0), and the tRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Controls without AspRS were run in parallel. The periodate treatment of tRNA was adapted from Hansske and Cramer (27Hansske F. Cramer F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 172-181Google Scholar). The pellet containing charged and uncharged tRNAs was dissolved in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, to a final concentration of 80 μm. Oxidation was started by addition of 40 mm m-periodate (Sigma) and was run at room temperature in the dark for 25 min. The reaction was stopped by neutralizing the excess periodate with 5% glycerol. Glycerol and remaining periodate were removed by dialysis (2 h against 5 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.0). The mixture of aspartylated and of oxidized tRNA species was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The tRNA pellet was dissolved in 1.8 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 80 μm and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for complete deacylation of aspartylated tRNA species. After precipitation, tRNAs were first incubated for 3 h on ice in 0.1m dithioerythritol (reduction of thiol groups) and for 20 min at room temperature in 0.1 m NaBH4(reduction of periodate-generated aldehyde groups on the terminal ribose of non-aspartylated tRNAs). NaBH4 was removed by an overnight dialysis in milliQ water. tRNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Three batches of partially aminoacylated tRNAs (a control and two batches that were aspartylated by native AspRS1–557 or truncated AspRS71–557) were tested for their amino acid acceptance. Aminoacylation activities were measured under the same conditions as those described above, with 25 μm amino acid, 20 μm treated tRNA, and 0.15 μg/μl crude enzymatic extract containing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities. Eighteen amino acids were tested:l-[14C]-radiolabeled amino acids were alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, tyrosine, and valine; those [3H]-labeled were asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, lysine, and threonine (all from Amersham Biosciences). Purity of [3H]-labeled aspartic acid and asparagine as well as of cold aspartic acid, asparagine, and glutamic acid was checked by TLC for possible contamination with other amino acids. No visible trace of such contamination has been detected. Aspartylation efficiencies of tRNAAsp transcripts mutated at their major identity positions (the discriminator base G73 and the anticodon bases G34, U35, C36) were monitored. For each mutant, the kinetic constants (k cat and K m) were derived from aminoacylation reactions with the truncated and native AspRS (AspRS71–557 and AspRS1–557) (TableI). For each AspRS form, aminoacylation efficiencies (k cat/K m) were calculated for mutated tRNAs. For an easier comparison, results will be discussed as losses of aminoacylation efficiency calculated as (k cat/K m)wild-type/(k cat/K m)mutant. The higher the losses of aminoacylation efficiency, the better the discrimination control of the synthetase toward the mutated position in tRNAAsp.Table IComparison of kinetic parameters for aspartylation of tRNAAspidentity mutants by truncated AspRS71–557 and native AspRS1–557 and effect of the N-terminal extension on specificitytRNAAsp variantsTruncated AspRS71–557Native AspRS1–557*Effect of Ext.1–70K mk catk cat/K mPlateausK mk catk cat/K mPlateausμm10−3(s −1)10−3(s −1 μm−1)%μm10−3(s −1)10−3(s−1) μm%Native tRNAAsp0.752503301000.007525033000100100tRNAAsptranscript0.63360571780.133002308794G73U2.0300150710.114814808310A2.77227590.250250799C12.1504.1336.27813353G34A20.0804.021.12202008350U21.0562.721.01361368450C37.060.253.338114955U35C36.5280.8181.216413783171A28.0180.663.492275045G32.0140.4812.7564.43311C36U15.818412542.23801727514A13.4544.0251.21261055426G35.7601.7300.714620892122Aminoacylation efficiencies (k cat/K m) were calculated for each mutated tRNA transcript aminoacylated with the truncated or the native AspRS.

Errors on calculated (k cat/K m) values are estimated to be 30%. Numerical values in bold are the controls for the wild-type tRNA transcript; wild-type anticodon residues are in bold. As shown previously, kinetic constants determined for aspartylation of fully modified tRNAAsp are only slightly different from those measured for the corresponding wild-type transcript (25Perret V. Garcia A. Puglisi J.D. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 735-744Google Scholar). For truncated AspRS, both k cat andK m of the aspartylation reaction stay almost the same. With native AspRS, only the K m of the modified tRNAAsp is lowered ∼17 times as compared with the wild-type transcript (Table I). With truncated AspRS71–557, mutations at single identity positions in tRNA transcripts have strong effects on the global aminoacylation efficiency, which can be reduced up to ∼3000-fold. At position 35, replacement of the wild-type U by any other base leads to sharp decreases in aminoacylation efficiency (between 700- and 1400-fold). At the three other major identity positions, 73, 34, and 36, all mutations except one lead to lower decreases of aminoacylation efficiencies with effects fluctuating between 4- and 340-fold depending on the mutation introduced. Noteworthily, the G34 → C exception is the mutation leading to the strongest effect (∼3000-fold). In general, comparison of the individual kinetic constants indicates thatK m is the most affected (exceptions are mutations G73 → A and G34 → C where both k cat andK m are changed). The same experiments, done with native AspRS1–557 under identical conditions, gave significantly different results. Although as expected, mutations of tRNAAsp identity positions still cause decreases in aspartylation efficiency, their effects are quantitatively and qualitatively changed. Indeed, with the native synthetase, the losses of aminoacylation efficiency reach at most ∼500-fold (as compared with the ∼3000-fold decrease for the strongest loss with AspRS71–557), and the involved positions are different (e.g. strongest effect for U35 → G with native AspRS1–557 and for G34 → C with truncated AspRS71–557). For 8 out of 12 mutants, losses in aminoacylation efficiency varies between 1- and 22-fold, and only four tRNAAsp mutants are poorly aminoacylated, with losses in aminoacylation efficiencies above 80. They correspond to transcripts containing mutations G73 → C, G34 → C, or U35 → A or G. Here again, affinity (reflected by K m) between native AspRS1–557 and the tRNA substrates is mostly affected, whereas k cat is only moderately affected. These kinetic differences observed in aspartylation reactions conducted with native or truncated AspRSs have dramatic consequences. To evaluate these consequences, the gain in aminoacylation efficiency consecutive to the presence of the N-terminal extension in AspRS was calculated for each tRNA variant, comparing their aminoacylation efficiencies between both native and truncated AspRSs. Whatever the tRNA substrates, wild-type or mutants, the aminoacylation efficiencies are strongly stimulated when the N-terminal extension is present in AspRS. The strengths of these positive effects, however, are dependent on the mutation introduced in the tRNA. As seen in Table I, these values comprise between 3 and 171. Indeed, the N-terminal appendix triggers only a moderate increase of the aminoacylation efficiency of tRNAAsp transcripts mutated at the discriminator position (at most 11-fold for the G73 → U mutation). In contrast, its effect is increased at least by one order of magnitude when the mutations are introduced in the anticodon (up to ∼170-fold for the U35 → C mutation). Altogether, this means that native AspRS1–557 is less discriminative than truncated AspRS71–557. This property of native AspRS1–557, a priori unexpected, is solely due to the presence of the N-terminal extension. This finding shows that the role of the extension is not marginal and has functional consequences. Globally, the data in Table I confirm the mutational analysis on tRNA aspartate identity determinants obtained previously with another AspRS sample (17Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Google Scholar), but they diverge quantitatively. The differences rely on the chemical nature of the enzymes used in the two studies. The synthetase used formerly was purified directly fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas the two enzymes used in the present study were cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. It was known that during purification from yeast, AspRS is subjected to partial proteolysis within the RNA-binding motif in its N-terminal extension (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Google Scholar, 11Lorber B. Mejdoub H. Reinbolt J. Boulanger Y. Giegé R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 155-161Google Scholar) with the consequence that the purified synthetase is a heterogeneous protein pool. Thus, the overall effects found with the degraded enzyme (17Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Google Scholar) are intermediary with those obtained with native AspRS1–557 and truncated AspRS71–557 with aminoacylation efficiencies predominantlyk cat-directed, in contrast to the present report where they are mainly K m-directed. As a consequence of the presence of the N-terminal extension in AspRS, the anticodon identity nucleotides are recognized with rather low discrimination (Table I). Since identity of a tRNA primarily relies on the presence of the major determinants rather than on the sequence context in which they are embedded (28Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Google Scholar), this implies that in a native tRNA pool, molecules having anticodon sequences close to the GUC aspartate anticodon should be recognized by native AspRS1–557 with efficiencies close to that of cognate tRNAAsp. Several yeast tRNA isoacceptors answer this prerequisite, namely tRNAAsn(GUU), tRNAGlu(UUC), tRNAHis(GUG), tRNATyr(GUA), tRNAGly(GCC), tRNAAla(GGC), and tRNAVal(GAC). Among them, tRNAHis, tRNATyr, tRNAGly, tRNAAla, and tRNAVal could be reasonably eliminated because their discriminator base is A, instead of G as in tRNAAsp. Indeed, it was shown that two mutations in tRNAAsp transcripts distributed between the anticodon and the discriminator position lead to cooperative effects that decrease severely aspartylation (29Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2949-2957Google Scholar). Considering these assumptions, only tRNAAsn(GUU) and tRNAGlu(UUC) are left as good candidates for misacylation by AspRS (Fig.2). To determine the total amount of tRNA species that can be aspartylated, total yeast tRNA was incubated in the presence of different concentrations of native and truncated AspRSs and under saturating aspartate concentrations (500 μm). Five aminoacylation conditions were tested with a fixed concentration of total tRNA (20 μm) and increasing concentrations of synthetases (from 0.125 to 5 μm). Thus, molar ratios between the tRNAAsp fraction present in total yeast tRNA (4.5%, see “Experimental Procedures”) and AspRS were 1/0.125, 1/0.5, 1/1.25, 1/2.5, and 1/5. When ratios of tRNAAsp/AspRS1–557 or tRNAAsp/AspRS71–557 were 1/0.5, both enzymes show the same charging capacity with 6% of total tRNA aspartylated. This level reflects aspartylation of part of tRNAAsppresent in total yeast tRNA (∼4.5%) plus a significant amount of mischarged tRNA species (∼1.5%). The amount of aspartylated tRNA increases with the AspRS concentration in the aminoacylation assays. However, the raise is much more pronounced in assays conducted with native AspRS1–557 (Fig. 3). Thus, when present at a 5-fold molar excess as compared with tRNAAsp, the amount of aspartylated tRNA catalyzed by native AspRS1–557 is more than 2-fold of that of tRNAAsp, whereas with truncated AspRS71–557, it reaches only 1.5-fold. This indicates that AspRS aspartylates noncognate tRNA(s) and that the level of mischarging is significantly higher with native AspRS1–557. In control experiments conducted in the presence of limiting aspartate concentration (25 μm), the mischarging potential of AspRS, even in its native version, is suppressed (Fig. 3). At first, to prevent false interpretation of results, care was taken that AspRS preparations as well as amino acids were of enough purity to avoid possible misaminoacylation catalyzed by trace contaminations ofE. coli synthetases (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mischarged tRNA species were identified in a three-step procedure. First, total tRNA was aspartylated by either native AspRS1–557 or truncated AspRS71–557 in assays conducted with 500 μm aspartate, i.e. under conditions where the specific activity of both AspRSs is the highest. Further, the AspRS concentration was in 5-fold molar excess as compared with the amount of tRNAAsp present in total yeast tRNA. Second, the pool of aspartylated tRNA (comprising tRNAAsp and putative mischarged noncognate tRNAs) was periodate-treated to inactivate all uncharged tRNAs by oxidation of their 3′-terminal ribose. This treatment does not affect the aspartylated species protected by the aspartate residue esterified on their 3′-end. Before treatment, care was taken to protect tRNAs containing thiolated bases against inactivation by periodate (see “Experimental Procedures”), i.e. yeast tRNAGlu, a potential candidate for mischarging, which contains a 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) residue in its anticodon (30Kobayashi T. Irie T. Yoshida M. Takeishi K. Ukita T. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1974; 366: 168-181Google Scholar). Third, the periodate-treated tRNA, still containing the pool of aspartylated tRNA species, was deacylated, and formerly mischarged species were identified by their original amino acid acceptance (see “Experimental Procedures”). Aminoacylation of total yeast tRNA with both truncated AspRS71–557 or native AspRS1–557 leads to quantitatively different, although qualitatively comparable, results. As seen in Table II, besides tRNAAsp, three families of noncognate aspartylatable tRNA species can be identified. The first one comprises, as anticipated, tRNAAsn and tRNAGlu and corresponds to molecules abundantly aminoacylated. The second family, with tRNAHis, tRNALys, and tRNAArg, comprises molecules moderately aminoacylated. The third family encompasses molecules that were not mischarged, or if so, mischarged to trace levels.Table IIMischarging levels of yeast tRNAs by truncated and native AspRSstRNA species% Aspartylation of cognate & noncognate tRNAsTruncated AspRS71–557Native AspRS1–557Total tRNAIndividual species2-aThe percentages of charging of each tRNA are relative to its total amount in the bulk.

Open table in a new tab With truncated AspRS71–557, the amount of aspartylated tRNA was only slightly above the predicted level of tRNAAspcharging (6.25% versus 4.5%). As expected, tRNAAsp was the major species identified, representing 40% of the charged tRNAs. The 60% tRNAs left were mischarged species. Surprisingly, tRNAGlu and tRNAAsn were mischarged to comparable levels representing each as much as half of the charged tRNAAsp. The minor species correspond to tRNAs mischarged to plateau levels comprising between 1 and 8%. With native AspRS1–557, as a consequence of the presence of the N-terminal extension, ∼50% more tRNA was aspartylated (TableII). The same tRNA species were identified in the aspartylated pool, but they were charged to a higher level. Altogether, aspartylation by the synthetase comprising the extension reaches 74% of the amount of tRNAAsp present in total yeast tRNA, 70% of tRNAGlu, 35% of tRNAAsn, and 3–9% of miscellaneous tRNAs. At this point, it is important to remember thatE. coli GluRS cannot charge yeast tRNAGlu (31Kern D. Lapointe J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5819-5826Google Scholar) and that prokaryotic AsnRSs do not recognize eukaryotic tRNAAsn species (reviewed in Ref. 32Kern D. Roy H. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003Google Scholar). Considering these facts, we can conclude that charging of both tRNAGlu and tRNAAsn did not occur as a consequence of contaminating amino acids and E. coli GluRS and AsnRS present in yeast AspRS preparations. The two major misacylated tRNAs, namely tRNAGlu and tRNAAsn, both have a G at the discriminator position (as in tRNAAsp), and their anticodon differs only by one base change from the GUC aspartate anticodon (U34 in tRNAGlu(UUC) and U36 in tRNAAsn(GUU)). The less efficient charging of tRNAHis and tRNALys can be explained by less conservation of aspartate identity elements in these tRNAs (only U35 and G73 in tRNALys(UUU) and G34 and U35 in tRNAHis(GUG)). The moderate mischarging of arginine-specific tRNA is more difficult to understand but could be accounted by the sole presence of G73. Pure fully modified tRNAAsn(GUU)and tRNAGlu(UUC) from S. cerevisiae were tested in mischarging assays with native AspRS1–557 and their aspartylation capacity as compared with that of tRNAAsp. Mischarging plateaus were determined in the presence of low (0.05 μm) and high (5 μm) AspRS1–557concentrations (data not shown). The results confirm the experiments conducted with total yeast tRNA. At a low AspRS1–557concentration, only tRNAAsp is charged to a high level (∼80%); mischarging of tRNAGlu did not exceed a plateau of 20%, and no aspartylation of tRNAAsn was detected. On the contrary, as soon as the AspRS concentration was increased, 100% of tRNAAsp was charged, and excessive mischarging was detected with plateaus reaching 75% of tRNAGlu and 30% of tRNAAsn aspartylated. Besides conservation of at least three of the four major aspartate identity elements in tRNAGlu (G73, U35, and C36) and in tRNAAsn (G73, G34, and U35), one finds also in these tRNAs large sequence homologies with tRNAAsp (Fig. 2). In tRNAGlu, they comprise, among others, residue C38, which was shown to influence aspartylation efficiency (18Frugier M. Söll D. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9912-9921Google Scholar). However, differences appear at the level of the post-transcriptional modifications (Fig. 2). In tRNAGlu, only residue U34 in the anticodon loop is hypermodified (mcm5s2U34), whereas in tRNAAsn, four specific modifications are spread all over its L-shaped structure (m2G10 and m22G26 in the core, t6A37 in the anticodon loop, and m1A58 in the T-loop). In both tRNAs, these modifications could influence negatively their recognition by AspRS. Nevertheless, both tRNAGlu and tRNAAsnbecome significantly aspartylated when the AspRS concentration is increased, which seems to be sufficient to overcome the slight sequence differences that exist between them and tRNAAsp. Thus, a high AspRS concentration is a threat for accurate expression of yeast aspartate identity. During protein synthesis, errors in amino acid incorporation have been detected (33Loftfield R.B. Vanderjagt M.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 1353-1356Google Scholar) that are tolerated by the cell if their level is low enough. Mischarging of tRNA was considered as an obvious cause leading to such errors. It can originate as the result either of misactivated amino acids transferred to the cognate tRNA or of noncognate tRNA misacylations. Different mechanisms have been considered to overcome these errors. Editing is an option for synthetases having low specificity toward their cognate amino acid, asE. coli IleRS (34Eldred E.W. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 17-23Google Scholar) and ValRS (35Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Google Scholar) and its structural foundation explicitly established for prokaryotic IleRS (36Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimida A. Nakama T. Fukai S.

The presence of antideterminants in tRNAs, responsible for blocking noncognate aminoacylation, has been studied. For example, methylation of G37 in yeast tRNAAsp blocks arginylation (38Pütz J.

Saxton T.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 675-678Google Scholar). In this manner, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues initiate signal transduction via several distinct early signaling pathways. A major unresolved question in the field of RTK signaling is whether these diverse signaling pathways result in redundant or nonredundant biological functions. Recent studies utilizing the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) RTK have begun to address some of these issues in nonhematopoietic cells (6Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Google Scholar, 7Heuchel R. Berg A. Tallquist M. Ahlen K. Reed R.K. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, relatively little is known about the biological consequence(s) of activation of diverse signaling pathways by RTKs in hematopoietic cells.In hematopoietic cells, the RTK Kit plays an essential role in regulating proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration of stem and progenitor cells (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene Kit encodes the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) and belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar). This family of cytokine receptor includes the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, the PDGF receptor, and the Flk-2/Flk-3 receptor (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). The structure of these receptors includes an extracellular domain with five Ig-like motifs, a single short membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with tyrosine kinase activity (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar). The kinase domain is separated by a kinase insert sequence that divides the kinase domain into an ATP binding region and phosphotransferase region (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar). The product of the Kit gene is a transmembrane receptor composed of 976 amino acids (aa) with 519 extracellular aa, a transmembrane domain of 23 aa, and an intracellular tail of 433 aa (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar). In addition to being expressed on hematopoietic cells, Kit is also expressed on cells of nonhematopoietic origin, including melanocytes, primordial germ cells, and interstitial cells of Cajal (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, Kit can synergize with other growth factor receptors to promote survival, proliferation, and differentiation of multiple hematopoietic lineages (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar).Intriguingly, the most profound phenotype due to the lack of Kit expression in mice is manifested in erythroid cells. Mutant mice that lack the expression of Kit (dominant white spotting, or W, mutants) demonstrate severe deficiencies in erythroid cell development (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 12Nocka K. Majumder S. Chabot B. Ray P. Cervone M. Bernstein A. Besmer P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 816-826Google Scholar). Kit-deficient mice exhibit a severe reduction of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitors in the fetal liver and die of anemia around day 16 of gestation (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 12Nocka K. Majumder S. Chabot B. Ray P. Cervone M. Bernstein A. Besmer P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 816-826Google Scholar). Epo-R-deficient mice also demonstrate a similar decrease in CFU-E progenitors and die of anemia between days 13 and 15 of gestation (13Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Google Scholar), suggesting that erythroid progenitors cannot survive, proliferate, or differentiate unless both Kit and the Epo-R signal transduction pathways are functional. Recent studies have suggested that Epo and Epo-R interactions may contribute to this process by preventing erythroid progenitors from undergoing apoptosis by activating Stat5 and subsequently inducing the expression of an antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-xL (14Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, mice deficient in the expression of Stat5 or Bcl-xL manifest a decrease in the number of erythroid progenitors due to enhanced apoptosis (14Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Google Scholar, 15Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Google Scholar, 16Motoyama N. Kimura T.

Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Google Scholar). However, the role of Kit in erythroid cell development alone or in combination with Epo-R is poorly understood. To this end, we have recently demonstrated an essential role for Kit in proliferation of erythroid progenitors (18Kapur R. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1099-1106Google Scholar). Further, we and others have also demonstrated that Kit synergizes with Epo-R in enhancing proliferation and survival of erythroid progenitors (18Kapur R. Zhang L. J. Biol.

However, the role of early activating signal transduction pathways downstream from Kit in erythroid cell growth, proliferation, and cooperation with Epo-R is not known.Activated Kit binds signaling molecules at specific tyrosine residues: PLC-γ at tyrosine 728 (26Gommerman J.L.

Other classes of signaling proteins have also been reported to bind activated Kit with unknown sequence specificity (33Duronio V. Welham M.J. Abraham S. Dryden P. Schrader J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1587-1591Google Scholar, 34Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Google Scholar, 35Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Pisick E.

Studies in multiple cell types have shown that Kit carrying tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at the critical residues fail to bind the associated signaling molecules and consequently fail to activate these signaling pathways (10Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Google Scholar, 11Boissan M. Feger F. Guillosson J.J. Arock M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 135-148Google Scholar).In this study, we took advantage of the ability of Tyr → Phe mutations in Kit to block the activation of downstream signaling molecules to comprehensively investigate the effect of lack of activation of five early signaling pathways in Kit-induced growth, proliferation, and cooperation with Epo-R in a relevant cell type. Utilizing an erythroid progenitor cell line (G1E-ER2) that closely mimics primary proerythroblasts (15Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Google Scholar, 18Kapur R. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1099-1106Google Scholar, 38Kapur R. Cooper R. Xiao X. Weiss M.J. Donovan P. Williams D.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1915-1925Google Scholar, 39Kapur R. Cooper R. Zhang L. Williams D.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1975-1981Google Scholar) and primary fetal liver cells, we demonstrate that inactivation of any one of these five early signaling pathways in Kit significantly impairs growth and proliferation in response to Kit activation. The most profound defect was observed in Kit mutants impaired in the activation of the Src kinase pathway. Interestingly, when stimulated in combination with erythropoietin (Epo), the mutant of Kit deficient in the activation of Src kinase demonstrated a profound reduction in proliferation, which was associated with impaired transphosphorylation of Epo-R and expression of c-Myc. Remarkably, restoration of the Src kinase pathway in Kit, alone, in the absence of remaining four early signaling pathways restored the cooperation and transphosphorylation of Epo-R in response to Kit activation. These results demonstrate an essential role for the Src signaling pathway in regulating growth, proliferation, and cooperation with Epo-R downstream from Kit.DISCUSSIONKit is crucial for the development of erythroid progenitors, since mice that lack Kit or its ligand SCF exhibit significant reduction of fetal liver erythroid progenitors and die of anemia (9Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Google Scholar, 12Nocka K. Majumder S. Chabot B. Ray P. Cervone M. Bernstein A. Besmer P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 816-826Google Scholar). The survival and proliferation of erythroid progenitors also depends on Epo, suggesting that erythroid progenitors cannot proliferate and/or survive unless both Kit and the Epo-R signal transduction pathways are functional. We have recently demonstrated an essential role for SCF/Kit interactions in proliferation of proerythroblasts (18Kapur R. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1099-1106Google Scholar). Further, we have shown that Epo-R, in addition to cooperating with Kit in further augmenting the expansion of proerythroblasts, also maintains their survival by inducing the activation of Stat5 and the expression of Bcl-xL, a function Kit is incapable of performing (18Kapur R. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1099-1106Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with a previously described role for Epo and consistent with the manifestation of severe anemia in mice lacking the expression of Stat5 or Bcl-xL (14Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Google Scholar, 15Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Google Scholar, 16Motoyama N. Kimura T. Takahashi T. Watanabe T. Nakano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1691-1698Google Scholar). Although a role for Epo-R/Stat5/Bcl-xL pathway has been well documented, and it is thought to be the major pathway in regulating the survival of erythroid progenitors, the nature of Kit-induced early signaling pathways in regulating erythroid cell proliferation alone or with Epo-R is not known.Activation of Kit by its ligand, SCF, activates at least five early signaling pathways via binding to specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of Kit. Whether these pathways play a redundant or a nonredundant role in erythroid cell expansion alone or in combination with Epo-R is not known. Utilizing a CHR approach and tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in Kit, we have explored the importance of these early signaling pathways in Kit-induced expansion alone and in cooperation with Epo-R. The major conclusions of our study are as follows. 1) Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in the Kit intracellular domain responsible for activating the PI 3-kinase (position 719), PLC-γ (position 728), Grb2 (position 702), and position 745 pathways show a substantial reduction in proliferation upon Kit activation alone as well as in combination with Epo. However, tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in Kit at positions 567/569, previously shown to bind Src kinase family members, are critical for Kit as well as Epo-R-induced proliferation of erythroid progenitors. 2) The lack of cooperation between a Kit mutant defective in the activation of the Src kinase pathway and Epo-R is associated with reduced transphosphorylation of the Epo-R and expression of c-Myc. 3) Remarkably, restoration of the Src binding sites in a Kit mutant stripped of all the other signaling pathways (naked receptor) restored 50% proliferation upon Kit activation alone and completely restored the cooperation with Epo-R, including its transphosphorylation.The lack of a profound effect on proliferation in erythroid cells expressing Kit mutants defective in the activation of PLC-γ, PI 3-kinase, Grb2, and Y745F is intriguing. It is possible that in erythroid cells, these pathways play only a minor role in proliferation downstream from Kit. Consistent with this interpretation, mice carrying a mutation in the PI 3-kinase binding site (position 719) of Kitin vivo also do not manifest an erythroid phenotype (43Kissel H. Timokhina I. Hardy M.P. Rothschild G. Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Google Scholar,46Blume-Jensen P. Jiang G. Hyman R. Lee K.F. O'Gorman S. Hunter T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 157-162Google Scholar), although these animals do show a defect in mast cell proliferation and germ cell maturation in response to Kit activation (43Kissel H. Timokhina I. Hardy M.P. Rothschild G. Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Google Scholar, 46Blume-Jensen P. Jiang G. Hyman R. Lee K.F. O'Gorman S. Hunter T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 157-162Google Scholar). Thus, early signaling pathways downstream from Kit may be differentially utilized in different cell lineages. Alternatively, since cooperation between Kit and Epo-R is absolutely essential for normal erythroid development in vivo, and since we demonstrate only a slight reduction in the proliferation of erythroid cells in response to co-stimulation with SCF and Epo in PI 3-kinase-defective Kit mutant, it is conceivable that mice carrying a mutation in the PI 3-kinase binding site of Kit in vivo may tolerate this mutation and hence a lack of an erythroid phenotype. Based on this interpretation and our results with the Src kinase Kit mutants, we hypothesize that other than the Src kinase-defective mutants, disrupting any of the other early signaling pathways in Kit, including the PLC-γ, Grb2, Grb7, or tyrosine Y745F would not result in an erythroid phenotype (anemia)in vivo, since at least in vitro, all of these mutations are well tolerated and do not manifest a profound phenotype upon co-stimulation with SCF and Epo.The mechanism(s) by which Kit and Epo-R cooperate to regulate the expansion of committed erythroid progenitors is poorly understood (19Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Google Scholar, 20Joneja B. Chen H.C. Seshasayee D. Wrentmore A.L. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 3533-3545Google Scholar, 21Wu H.

Thus far, two mechanisms of cooperation between Kit and Epo-R have been described in cell line models. Studies by Pircher et al. (24Pircher T.J. Geiger J.N. Zhang D. Miller C.P. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8995-9002Google Scholar) and Sui et al. (23Sui X. Krantz S.B. You M. Zhao Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 1142-1149Google Scholar) have provided evidence that mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 at least in part may function as downstream integrators of Epo-R and Kit signals (23Sui X. Krantz S.B. You M. Zhao Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 1142-1149Google Scholar, 24Pircher T.J. Geiger J.N. Zhang D. Miller C.P. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8995-9002Google Scholar). Wu et al. (19Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Google Scholar) have shown that activation of Kit induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Epo-R, and that Kit interacts with the Epo-R by physically associating with its cytoplasmic domain. Further, the ability of SCF to support proliferation of 32D cells expressing Kit requires co-expression of the Epo-R, demonstrating that at least one proliferative signal generated by Kit involves the Epo-R as a downstream signal transduction protein (19Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, a functional interaction of activated Kit with the Epo-R was shown to be crucial for CFU-E generation (21Wu H. Klingmuller U. Acurio A. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1806-1810Google Scholar). Specifically, erythroid progenitors from Epo-R−/− fetal livers, infected in vitrowith a retrovirus expressing the wild type Epo-R, require the addition of both Epo and SCF to form CFU-E colonies (21Wu H. Klingmuller U. Acurio A. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1806-1810Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Kit activates Epo-R by phosphorylating tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domains, which allows for an efficient recruitment/binding of Src homology 2-containing signaling proteins, including the Src and the PI 3-kinases, resulting in further activation of downstream signaling proteins. Our data demonstrate that tyrosine residues 567 and 569 in Kit may play an essential role in regulating this process. Since erythroid cells expressing mutants of Kit lacking these two tyrosines demonstrate a significant reduction in Kit-induced phosphorylation of the Epo-R, which is associated with reduced proliferation and c-Myc expression. Remarkably, restoring these two residues back to tyrosines in the absence of other signaling pathways is sufficient to restore the phosphorylation of Epo-R and proliferation.In fibroblasts, Src kinases play an essential role in regulating DNA synthesis by inducing the expression of c-Myc in response to PDGF stimulation (44Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Google Scholar, 45Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Google Scholar, 47Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Google Scholar). Studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies for Src kinase and dominant negative mutants for c-Src and Fyn inhibit DNA synthesis in response to PDGF, indicating that these kinases can act downstream from RTKs in a pathway that is required for proliferation. Remarkably, the expression of c-Myc was found to be sufficient to overcome the requirement for induction of DNA synthesis by RTKs (44Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Google Scholar, 45Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we demonstrate that Kit-induced activation of Src kinases also regulates the expression of c-Myc, which is associated with reduced proliferation in erythroid cells expressing Kit mutants defective in the activation of Src kinases. A similar decrease in the expression of c-Myc was also observed when G1E-ER2 cells were treated with the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 in the presence of SCF and Epo. 3B. L. Tan and R. Kapur, unpublished observation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that in addition to the above described mechanisms of cooperation between Kit and Epo-R, c-Myc at least in part may function as a downstream integrator of Epo-R and Kit signaling in erythroid cells.The observation that only 50% correction in proliferation of erythroid cells was observed in cells expressing the Src add-back Kit mutant in response to M-CSF stimulation is intriguing and requires further investigation. It is possible that the Src kinase pathway alone is unable to activate all of the necessary signaling proteins essential for efficient Kit-induced proliferation, although Src kinases have been shown to regulate multiple signaling pathways, including the activation of the Ras pathway via Shc, the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway via Cbl, and the Rac/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway via guanine exchange factors, such as Vav (29Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Google Scholar, 47Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Google Scholar, 48Corey S.J. Anderson S.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1-14Google Scholar). Whether all of these signaling molecules are activated by Src kinases in response to Kit activation is currently being investigated. It is possible that only a few of these pathways are activated in Src add-back Kit mutants and that other pathways are necessary for complete rescue in proliferation. Alternatively, it is conceivable that all of the above pathways are activated in Src add-back Kit mutants, however at a significantly reduced level compared with wild type Kit receptor. Thus, it possible that quantitative rather than qualitative differences in the activation of various signaling pathways exist between wild type and Src add-back Kit receptor. These possibilities are currently being investigated. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)1 trigger multitude of cellular events, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration. In response to ligand-induced stimulation, RTKs undergo dimerization and autophosphorylation on several distinct cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Google Scholar). These phosphorylated tyrosine residues become binding sites for a variety of Src homology 2 domain-containing enzymes and adaptor proteins such as phospholipase Cγ (PLC-γ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit (PI 3-kinase), Ras GTPase-activating protein, SHP2 phosphatase, Src kinases, Grb2, Grb7, and Shc (5Pawson T. Saxton T.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 675-678Google Scholar). In this manner, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues initiate signal transduction via several distinct early signaling pathways. A major unresolved question in the field of RTK signaling is whether these diverse signaling pathways result in redundant or nonredundant biological functions. Recent studies utilizing the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) RTK have begun to address some of these issues in nonhematopoietic cells (6Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S.

Using various biological assays, we detected a chicken interferon-γ (chIFN-γ)-neutralizing activity in supernatants of fowlpox virus (FPV)-infected cells that could be destroyed by trypsin treatment. Secreted viral proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using matrix-immobilized chIFN-γ, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis indicated that the viral IFN-γ-binding protein in question was encoded by the FPV gene 016. The chicken IFN-γ binding and neutralizing activity of the recombinant FPV016 protein was confirmed using supernatants of cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that lacked its own IFN-γ-binding protein but instead expressed theFPV016 gene. The FPV016 gene product also neutralized the activity of duck and human IFN-γ but failed to neutralize the activity of mouse and rat IFN-γ. Unlike previously known cellular and poxviral IFN-γ receptors, which all contain fibronectin type III domains, the IFN-γ-binding protein of FPV contains an immunoglobulin domain. Remarkably, it exhibits no significant homology to any known viral or cellular protein. Because IFN-γ receptors of birds have not yet been characterized at the molecular level, the possibility remains that FPV016represents a hijacked chicken gene and that avian and mammalian IFN-γ receptors have fundamentally different primary structures.

The importance of IFN-γ in host defense against poxvirus infections was clearly demonstrated in both tissue culture and animal model systems (27Huang S. Hendriks W. Althage A. Hemmi S. Bluethmann H.

Virology. 1994; 198: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The central role of IFN-γ in the host defense against poxviruses probably explains why this cytokine is one of the main targets of the poxviral immune evasion strategy. In fact, not only does vaccinia virus code for a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein, but it also targets IFN-γ by a virus-encoded phosphatase that interferes with cytokine signaling (29Najarro P. Traktman P. Lewis J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).A gene encoding a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein was first identified in the myxoma virus genome (22Upton C. Mossman K. McFadden G. Science. 1992; 258: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Homologous genes were subsequently identified in the vaccinia virus (23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J.

Virology. 1986; 152: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the ectromelia virus (35Mossman K. Upton C. Buller R.M. McFadden G. Virology. 1995; 208: 762-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Proteins with IFN-γ binding activity were further detected in supernatants of cowpox virus- and camelpox virus-infected cells (23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells infected with tanapox virus were reported to secrete a cytokine-binding protein of unknown structure that can bind IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-5 (36Essani K. Chalasani S. Eversole R. Beuving L. Birmingham L. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Soluble IFN-γ-binding proteins of various poxviruses differ in their specificity for IFN-γ from different animal species. For example, the myxoma virus M-T7 protein preferentially binds and neutralizes rabbit IFN-γ. On the other hand, the IFN-γ-binding proteins of the vaccinia virus, the cowpox virus, and the camelpox virus (23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have broad specificity. They recognize human, bovine, and rat as well as rabbit IFN-γ. The IFN-γ-binding protein of the vaccinia virus further recognizes and neutralizes chicken IFN-γ (chIFN-γ) (37Puehler F. Weining K.C. Symons J.A. Smith G.L. Staeheli P. Virology. 1998; 248: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mostly broad species specificity of poxviral IFN-γ-binding proteins contrasts with the situation for cellular IFN-γ receptors, which typically show high affinity for IFN-γ from the cognate species only (38De Maeyer E.M. De Maeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). All poxviral IFN-γ-binding proteins described to date show significant homology to mammalian IFN-γ receptors (39Smith G.L. Symons J.A. Alcami A. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 409-418Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Like their cellular counterparts, they contain two fibronectin type III domains and exhibit features of class II cytokine receptor family members. The poxviral IFN-γ-binding proteins lack transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domains.The fowlpox virus (FPV) belongs to the subfamily chordopoxvirinae. It is the prototype of the genus avipoxvirus. The complete genome sequence of a single FPV strain is presently available (40Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3815-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It contains 260 open reading frames, including that of gene 073, which shows low homology to viral and cellular IL-18 binding proteins (17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11537-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Born T.L. Morrison L.A. Esteban D.J. VandenBos T. Thebeau L.G. Chen N. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. Buller R.M. J.

Surprisingly, sequence analysis failed to provide evidence for FPV genes that might code for IFN-γ-binding proteins.Here we showed that FPV gene 016 codes for a secreted protein that binds and neutralizes the activity of chIFN-γ. This protein shows no significant homology to known IFN-γ-binding proteins of other poxviruses or to any known cellular IFN-γ receptors.DISCUSSIONSequence analysis of the complete FPV genome (40Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3815-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) yielded no evidence for the existence of a gene for a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein in this virus. Nevertheless, our experiments with the supernatants of FPV-infected chicken embryo cells clearly showed the presence of an activity that neutralized chIFN-γ (Fig.1 A). The simplest explanation for these discrepant results was that an FPV-encoded protein with no significant homology to previously described IFN-γ receptors exhibited IFN-γ-neutralizing activity. Our biochemical approach described in this paper demonstrated that this assumption was correct and that the FPV016 gene is encoding the critical viral factor.The calculated molecular mass of the secreted form of the FPV016 gene product is ∼24,000. However, our SDS gel analysis of viral proteins with high affinity for matrix-immobilized chIFN-γ showed that the factor in question presented itself as a pair of diffuse bands with apparent molecular masses of about 32–34 and 38–42 kDa (Fig.2). This difference in molecular mass probably resulted from glycosylation of the mature protein. In fact, sequence analysis showed that the FPV016 protein has three potential N-glycosylation sites and one potential O-glycosylation site. Strong glycosylation of soluble IFN-γ-binding proteins of other poxviruses has been described (22Upton C. Mossman K. McFadden G. Science. 1992; 258: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that our MALDI-TOF MS analysis of two gel spots with slightly different migration properties clearly showed that they both contained proteins encoded by the FPV016 gene and that one peptide, which presumably contains a glycosylated threonine residue, was missing in one of these proteins. Because the extent of glycosylation cannot be predicted, MALDI-TOF MS analysis most likely failed to detect the glycosylated peptide. These results suggested thatO-glycosylation at threonine 93 does occur but that it is probably incomplete. Differences in glycosylation at this and other putative glycosylation sites of the FPV016 gene product might further explain its appearance in multiple forms on two-dimensional gels (Fig.3).The FPV016 gene is localized in the terminal region of the viral genome. This localization is characteristic for genes that code for immunomodulatory proteins in other poxviruses (2Kotwal G.J. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 242-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By expressing the FPV016 gene with the help of a vaccinia virus that lacks its own soluble IFN-γ-binding protein, we verified that the FPV016 gene product is indeed active. Supernatants of host cells infected with the FPV016-expressing vaccina virus contained chIFN-γ binding and neutralizing activity, whereas supernatants of control cells infected with the parental strain did not. A computer search for characteristic protein motifs in the FPV016 protein revealed the presence of an immunoglobulin domain. This was unexpected, because all known viral and cellular IFN-γ receptors contain fibronectin type III domains rather than immunoglobulin domains (39Smith G.L. Symons J.A. Alcami A. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 409-418Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We thus identified a new type of viral IFN-γ-binding protein. This finding readily explains why our previous experiments failed to reveal the identity of the FPV016 gene product. Those attempts were all based on the assumption that IFN-γ-binding proteins of FPV and other poxviruses have similar structures.Most poxviral genes with immunomodulatory functions seem to represent pirated cellular genes (3Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Exceptions are the poxvirus-encoded type I IFN-binding proteins that contain Ig domains, whereas all known cellular type I IFN receptors are composed of fibronectin type III domains (20Colamonici O.R. Domanski P. Sweitzer S.M. Larner A. Buller R.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15974-15978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Symons J.A. Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 551-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Similarly, the FPV016 gene might have evolved independently of cellular genes with analogous functions. However, because IFN-γ receptors of birds have not yet been characterized at the molecular level, the alternative possibility remains that FPV016 indeed represents a hijacked chicken gene and that avian and mammalian IFN-γ receptors have fundamentally different primary structures. It is further possible that chickens possess an as yet unidentified gene that codes for a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein that is used to regulate the IFN-γ response and that FPV has pirated this gene.FPV and other avian poxviruses are presently being evaluated as vaccine vectors for use in humans. These viral vectors are considered to be safe because they fail to replicate productively in mammalian cells. Our finding that FPV016 is capable of binding and neutralizing human IFN-γ (Fig. 6 B) is relevant in this context. Because early IFN-γ synthesis is known to drive TH1-type immune responses, it is conceivable that FPV vaccine vectors that lack the 016 gene and, as a consequence, permit the accumulation of higher local concentrations of active IFN-γ might exhibit enhanced performance. Poxviruses have multiple evasion strategies to counteract the antiviral host defense. They code for a number of gene products that are not essential for viral replication. Many of these viral proteins are directed against the host immune system. They either block the complement system (1Rosengard A.M. Liu Y. Nie Z. Jimenez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of IFN-γ in host defense against poxvirus infections was clearly demonstrated in both tissue culture and animal model systems (27Huang S. Hendriks W. Althage A. Hemmi S. Bluethmann H. Kamijo R. Vilcek J. Zinkernagel R.M. Aguet M. Science. 1993; 259: 1742-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 28Melkova Z. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 198: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The central role of IFN-γ in the host defense against poxviruses probably explains why this cytokine is one of the main targets of the poxviral immune evasion strategy. In fact, not only does vaccinia virus code for a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein, but it also targets IFN-γ by a virus-encoded phosphatase that interferes with cytokine signaling (29Najarro P. Traktman P. Lewis J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A gene encoding a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein was first identified in the myxoma virus genome (22Upton C. Mossman K. McFadden G. Science. 1992; 258: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Homologous genes were subsequently identified in the vaccinia virus (23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J.

Virology. 1986; 152: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the ectromelia virus (35Mossman K. Upton C. Buller R.M. McFadden G. Virology. 1995; 208: 762-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Proteins with IFN-γ binding activity were further detected in supernatants of cowpox virus- and camelpox virus-infected cells (23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells infected with tanapox virus were reported to secrete a cytokine-binding protein of unknown structure that can bind IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-5 (36Essani K. Chalasani S. Eversole R. Beuving L. Birmingham L. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Soluble IFN-γ-binding proteins of various poxviruses differ in their specificity for IFN-γ from different animal species. For example, the myxoma virus M-T7 protein preferentially binds and neutralizes rabbit IFN-γ. On the other hand, the IFN-γ-binding proteins of the vaccinia virus, the cowpox virus, and the camelpox virus (23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have broad specificity. They recognize human, bovine, and rat as well as rabbit IFN-γ. The IFN-γ-binding protein of the vaccinia virus further recognizes and neutralizes chicken IFN-γ (chIFN-γ) (37Puehler F. Weining K.C. Symons J.A. Smith G.L. Staeheli P. Virology. 1998; 248: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mostly broad species specificity of poxviral IFN-γ-binding proteins contrasts with the situation for cellular IFN-γ receptors, which typically show high affinity for IFN-γ from the cognate species only (38De Maeyer E.M. De Maeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). All poxviral IFN-γ-binding proteins described to date show significant homology to mammalian IFN-γ receptors (39Smith G.L. Symons J.A. Alcami A. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 409-418Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Like their cellular counterparts, they contain two fibronectin type III domains and exhibit features of class II cytokine receptor family members. The poxviral IFN-γ-binding proteins lack transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domains. The fowlpox virus (FPV) belongs to the subfamily chordopoxvirinae. It is the prototype of the genus avipoxvirus. The complete genome sequence of a single FPV strain is presently available (40Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3815-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It contains 260 open reading frames, including that of gene 073, which shows low homology to viral and cellular IL-18 binding proteins (17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11537-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Born T.L. Morrison L.A. Esteban D.J. VandenBos T. Thebeau L.G. Chen N. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. Buller R.M. J.

Surprisingly, sequence analysis failed to provide evidence for FPV genes that might code for IFN-γ-binding proteins. Here we showed that FPV gene 016 codes for a secreted protein that binds and neutralizes the activity of chIFN-γ. This protein shows no significant homology to known IFN-γ-binding proteins of other poxviruses or to any known cellular IFN-γ receptors. DISCUSSIONSequence analysis of the complete FPV genome (40Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3815-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) yielded no evidence for the existence of a gene for a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein in this virus. Nevertheless, our experiments with the supernatants of FPV-infected chicken embryo cells clearly showed the presence of an activity that neutralized chIFN-γ (Fig.1 A). The simplest explanation for these discrepant results was that an FPV-encoded protein with no significant homology to previously described IFN-γ receptors exhibited IFN-γ-neutralizing activity. Our biochemical approach described in this paper demonstrated that this assumption was correct and that the FPV016 gene is encoding the critical viral factor.The calculated molecular mass of the secreted form of the FPV016 gene product is ∼24,000. However, our SDS gel analysis of viral proteins with high affinity for matrix-immobilized chIFN-γ showed that the factor in question presented itself as a pair of diffuse bands with apparent molecular masses of about 32–34 and 38–42 kDa (Fig.2). This difference in molecular mass probably resulted from glycosylation of the mature protein. In fact, sequence analysis showed that the FPV016 protein has three potential N-glycosylation sites and one potential O-glycosylation site. Strong glycosylation of soluble IFN-γ-binding proteins of other poxviruses has been described (22Upton C. Mossman K. McFadden G. Science. 1992; 258: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 23Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that our MALDI-TOF MS analysis of two gel spots with slightly different migration properties clearly showed that they both contained proteins encoded by the FPV016 gene and that one peptide, which presumably contains a glycosylated threonine residue, was missing in one of these proteins. Because the extent of glycosylation cannot be predicted, MALDI-TOF MS analysis most likely failed to detect the glycosylated peptide. These results suggested thatO-glycosylation at threonine 93 does occur but that it is probably incomplete. Differences in glycosylation at this and other putative glycosylation sites of the FPV016 gene product might further explain its appearance in multiple forms on two-dimensional gels (Fig.3).The FPV016 gene is localized in the terminal region of the viral genome. This localization is characteristic for genes that code for immunomodulatory proteins in other poxviruses (2Kotwal G.J. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 242-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By expressing the FPV016 gene with the help of a vaccinia virus that lacks its own soluble IFN-γ-binding protein, we verified that the FPV016 gene product is indeed active. Supernatants of host cells infected with the FPV016-expressing vaccina virus contained chIFN-γ binding and neutralizing activity, whereas supernatants of control cells infected with the parental strain did not. A computer search for characteristic protein motifs in the FPV016 protein revealed the presence of an immunoglobulin domain. This was unexpected, because all known viral and cellular IFN-γ receptors contain fibronectin type III domains rather than immunoglobulin domains (39Smith G.L. Symons J.A. Alcami A. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 409-418Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We thus identified a new type of viral IFN-γ-binding protein. This finding readily explains why our previous experiments failed to reveal the identity of the FPV016 gene product. Those attempts were all based on the assumption that IFN-γ-binding proteins of FPV and other poxviruses have similar structures.Most poxviral genes with immunomodulatory functions seem to represent pirated cellular genes (3Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Exceptions are the poxvirus-encoded type I IFN-binding proteins that contain Ig domains, whereas all known cellular type I IFN receptors are composed of fibronectin type III domains (20Colamonici O.R.

Cell. 1995; 81: 551-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Similarly, the FPV016 gene might have evolved independently of cellular genes with analogous functions. However, because IFN-γ receptors of birds have not yet been characterized at the molecular level, the alternative possibility remains that FPV016 indeed represents a hijacked chicken gene and that avian and mammalian IFN-γ receptors have fundamentally different primary structures. It is further possible that chickens possess an as yet unidentified gene that codes for a soluble IFN-γ-binding protein that is used to regulate the IFN-γ response and that FPV has pirated this gene.FPV and other avian poxviruses are presently being evaluated as vaccine vectors for use in humans. These viral vectors are considered to be safe because they fail to replicate productively in mammalian cells. Our finding that FPV016 is capable of binding and neutralizing human IFN-γ (Fig. 6 B) is relevant in this context. Because early IFN-γ synthesis is known to drive TH1-type immune responses, it is conceivable that FPV vaccine vectors that lack the 016 gene and, as a consequence, permit the accumulation of higher local concentrations of active IFN-γ might exhibit enhanced performance.

https://openalex.org/W2031119028,"The specific functions of plasminogen, stromal plasminogen activator, stromal plasminogen activator receptor, and stromal plasminogen activator inhibitor in the progression of the murine soft tissue sarcoma, T241 were investigated. Negation of plasminogen to the tumor blunted the orthotopic growth of the sarcoma in syngeneic mice. The reduced tumor growth was associated with a dramatic increase in tumor-infiltrating F4/80-positive macrophages and a diminution of vessel density, but not with obvious differences in fibrin and collagen deposition, or invasiveness of the tumor. Ablation of plasminogen activation by the tumor stroma only modestly impaired the prolonged growth of the sarcoma, suggesting that tumor cell-produced plasminogen activator is sufficient to mediate productive plasminogen activation. Plasminogen facilitated sarcoma progression, angiogenesis, and suppression of macrophage infiltration in the absence of either stromal urokinase plasminogen activator receptor or stromal plasminogen activator inhibitor. These data demonstrate that tumor cell-produced plasminogen activator and host plasminogen cooperate to facilitate soft tissue sarcoma growth and suppress the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2012152766,"Upon engagement with Fas ligand (FasL), Fas rapidly induces recruitment and self-processing of caspase-8 via the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and activated caspase-8 cleaves downstream substrates such as caspase-3. We have found that penicillic acid (PCA) inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis and concomitant loss of cell viability in Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells. PCA prevented activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 upon treatment with FasL. However, PCA did not affect active caspase-3 in FasL-treated cells, suggesting that PCA primarily blocks early signaling events upstream of caspase-8 activation. FasL-induced processing of caspase-8 was severely impaired in the death-inducing signaling complex, although FasL-induced recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 occurred normally in PCA-treated cells. Although PCA inhibited the enzymatic activities of active recombinant caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 at similar concentrations, PCA exerted weak inhibitory effects on activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in staurosporine-treated cells but strongly inhibited caspase-8 activation in FasL-treated cells. Glutathione and cysteine neutralized an inhibitory effect of PCA on caspase-8, and PCA bound directly to the active center cysteine in the large subunit of caspase-8. Thus, our present results demonstrate that PCA inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis by targeting self-processing of caspase-8.

The death receptor Fas is widely expressed in diverse cell types and plays an essential role in the killing of harmful cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as well as regulation of the immune system such as lymphocyte homeostasis (1Nagata S.

Defective apoptotic signals in the Fas/FasL system result in accumulation of abnormal T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs and develop autoimmune diseases in human and mice (1Nagata S.

In addition to death-inducing function, the Fas/FasL system is also involved in T cell proliferation, as evidenced by reports from us and other groups (5Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Maraskovsky E.

Accelerated apoptotic signals via the Fas/FasL system are involved in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis and autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, because virus-infected hepatocytes and oligodendrocytes are killed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes in a FasL-dependent fashion (8Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Google Scholar, 9Dittel B.N. Merchant R.M. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6392-6400Google Scholar, 10Okuda Y. Bernard C.C.

Therefore, suppression of Fas-mediated signals might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and fulminant hepatitis by blocking T cell-mediated killing and T cell proliferation.

Through the interaction of their mutual death effector domains, FADD binds to caspase-8, which contains two death effector domains and a caspase domain, allowing the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (11Kischkel F.C.

The early signaling pathway of Fas-mediated apoptosis is a complex process modulated at various steps by cellular and viral inhibitors (16Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin.

Functional and structural analyses of these inhibitors have contributed to clarify the molecular basis of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, membrane-permeable small molecules that modulate Fas-mediated apoptosis seem to be valuable reagents to clarify the molecular basis of initial signaling events (18Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar, 19Bando M. Miyake Y. Shiina M. Wachi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 268-274Google Scholar), as well as to lead compounds for pharmaceutical intervention. To search for specific inhibitors that block Fas-mediated apoptosis, we have screened natural products such as microbial metabolites, and we have identified penicillic acid (PCA) (Fig. 1) as an inhibitor of Fas-induced cell death. In the present paper, we show that PCA targets self-processing of caspase-8. Murine B lymphoma A20 cells and human Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS), and penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen) in the presence or the absence of 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, respectively. PCA and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma and Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was obtained from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). A20 cells were labeled with 37 kBq of [3H]thymidine (TdR) (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) for 16 h and washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium. A20 cells (5 × 104 cells, 100 μl) were cultured with hamster anti-mouse Fas antibody Jo2 (Pharmingen) for 4 h in 96-well microtiter plates and then lysed by pipetting in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. The plates were centrifuged (600 × g, 5 min), and supernatants were collected. DNA fragmentation (%) was calculated using the following formula: (experimental release − spontaneous release)/(maximum release − spontaneous release) × 100. Cross-linked FasL was used as described previously (20Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.-L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Google Scholar). Raji cells were cultured with cross-linked FasL for 4 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, followed by staining with 300 μm Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem). The number of normal and condensed nuclei was counted under fluorescent microscopy. Apoptotic cells (%) were calculated as (condensed nuclei/total nuclei) × 100. A20 cells and Raji cells were cultured with Jo2 and cross-linked FasL for 4 h, respectively, and pulsed with 500 μg/ml 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) for 4 h, and MTT-formazan was then solubilized with 5% SDS overnight. Absorbance at 595 nm was measured. Cell viability (%) was calculated as (experimental absorbance − background absorbance)/(control absorbance − background absorbance) × 100. Five thousand extracts of microbial culture broths and a hundred extracts of herbal medicines were screened to look for specific inhibitors that block DNA fragmentation induced by anti-Fas antibody Jo2 as monitored by [3H]TdR-labeled A20 cells. The first screening led to an identification of 10 positive candidates. One sample did not suppress reduced cell viability of Jo2-treated A20 cells as analyzed by MTT assay. Two samples were excluded because of lack of reproducibility when prepared from new microbial culture broths. The bleb-forming assay using the human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells was utilized to detect activators of protein kinase C (21Osada H. Magae J. Watanabe C. Isono K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1988; 41: 925-931Google Scholar), because activators of protein kinase C block apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibodies (22Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Google Scholar, 23Clément M.V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Google Scholar). Six samples induced a significant blebbing on K562 cells. Therefore, one crude extract derived from an unidentified fungus was further subjected to HPLC and UV spectrometric analysis. The active component was recovered as a single peak and identified as PCA. The anti-apoptotic activity of PCA was confirmed by the standard compound obtained from the commercial supplier. Raji cells (106 cells/ml) were pretreated with various concentrations of PCA for the indicated times and washed with the RPMI 1640 medium to remove PCA. The cells were then treated with or without cross-linked FasL (500 ng/ml) for 2 h and washed with the medium to remove FasL. The cells were diluted with the medium (10 cells/ml) and cultured in 96-well microtiter plates (1 cell/well, 100 μl) for 10 days. The number of colonies formed was counted. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Diagnostics). After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min), supernatants were collected. Postnuclear lysates (30 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies for caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-8 (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (MBL), Nagoya, Japan), caspase-9 (MBL), and FADD (BD Biosciences) were used. Ac-DEVD-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) for the caspase-3 substrate, Ac-IETD-MCA for the caspase-8 substrate, and Ac-LEHD-MCA for the caspase-9 substrate were obtained from the Peptide Institute Inc. Postnuclear lysates (40 μg) were mixed with the caspase substrates in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 1 mm DTT) for 1 h. To block caspase-8-independent cleavage of Ac-IETD-MCA, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Peptide Institute Inc.) was included in the reaction mixture at the final concentration of 2.5 μm (24Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Google Scholar). Active recombinant human caspase-3 (MBL; 2 units/ml), active recombinant human caspase-8 (MBL; 2 units/ml), and active recombinant human caspase-9 (MBL; 2 units/ml) were mixed with Ac-DEVD-MCA, Ac-IETD-MCA, and Ac-LEHD-MCA in the reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 1 mmEDTA) for 1 h, respectively. The release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was measured with an excitation at 360 nm and an emission at 460 nm by CytoFluor multiwell plate reader series 4000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Raji cells were treated with or without mouse anti-human Fas antibody DX2 (Calbiochem) for 1 h on ice. The cells were repeatedly washed and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 45 min on ice. After washing, the stained cells were analyzed under flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Raji cells were treated with 2 μg/ml FasL in the presence of 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) for 15 min and quickly cooled down by adding 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, and the protease inhibitor mixture. Postnuclear lysates were precleared with Sepharose 6B (Sigma) for 90 min and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. Sepharose beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FADD and anti-caspase-8 antibodies. DNA fragment corresponding to caspase-8 p20 was amplified by PCR from mouse full-length caspase-8 with 5′-forward primer containing BamHI site (5′-AAAGGATCCGAAGTGAGTCACGGACTTC-3′) and 3′-reverse primer containing EcoRI site (5′-GATGAATTCCTAATCCACTTCTAAAGTG-3′) and cloned into pET-32c(+) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) containing N-terminal His tag. Cell lysates were prepared from Escherichia coli AD494 (DE3) strain harboring caspase-8 p20/pET32c(+) after induction with isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. His-tagged caspase-8 p20 was purified with HiTrap chelating column (AmershamBiosciences) and desalted with PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Caspase-8 p20 (30 μg) was treated with 100 μm PCA in Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5% sucrose for 3 h. Caspase-8 p20 was precipitated by acetone and then digested with 2 μg of lysyl endoprotease (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 mm DTT in the presence of 2 m urea at 37 °C for 14 h. The resulting peptide mixture was subjected to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The digested peptides were separated by a reversed-phase column (Symmetry C18 5 μm, 0.32 × 150 mm, Waters Associates, Milford, MA) using a capillary HPLC system (CapLC system, Waters Associates). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The isolated peptides were identified by mass measurements with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK) equipped with an electrospray interface that was connected directly to the above HPLC system. Fas-mediated apoptosis is induced by agonistic Fas antibodies or physiological FasL. Murine B lymphoma A20 cells are highly sensitive to anti-Fas antibody Jo2 (19Bando M. Miyake Y. Shiina M. Wachi M. Nagai K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 268-274Google Scholar). To search for specific inhibitors that block Fas-mediated apoptosis, we screened microbial secondary metabolites and herbal medicines, and we identified PCA as an active component in the culture broth of an unidentified fungus. The rationale of the screening system was described under “Experimental Procedures.” A20 cells underwent DNA fragmentation after treatment with Jo2 in a dose-dependent manner for 16 h (Fig.1 B). Four hours of incubation with 200 ng/ml Jo2 was sufficient to induce nearly maximal DNA fragmentation (data not shown). PCA inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by Jo2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PCA exhibited apoptotic effects marginally (Fig. 1 C). PCA markedly reversed a reduction in cell viability of A20 cells treated with Jo2 (Fig. 1 D). In addition to A20 cells, human Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells were killed by cross-linked FasL in a dose-dependent manner, and most of the cells underwent apoptosis by 500 ng/ml FasL within 4 h (Fig.1 E). PCA also inhibited FasL-induced apoptosis in Raji cells at 100–200 μm (Fig. 1 F). Although PCA alone slightly affected cell viability, PCA at 100–200 μm effectively blocked FasL-induced loss of cell viability (Fig. 1 G). To determine the limits at which PCA does not affect long term viability, clonogenic assays were performed with a range of doses and incubation times with PCA (Fig. 1,H and I). One hour of treatment with 200 μm PCA reduced the long term viability by about 20% (Fig. 1 H). However, cloning efficiency was markedly decreased when Raji cells were treated with 100–200 μmPCA for 2 h (Fig. 1 I). Therefore, the 1-h treatment with 200 μm PCA was used for assessment of its inhibitory effects on FasL-induced apoptosis by using clonogenic assay. Under this condition, PCA inhibited FasL-induced apoptosis in Raji cells and increased their survival rate slightly but significantly (Fig.1 J). Upon Fas oligomerization, caspase-8 is activated by self-cleavage, and active caspase-8 subsequently processes caspase-3 to an active form (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Google Scholar, 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Google Scholar, 3Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Google Scholar, 4Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, caspase-3 activity was undetectable during the first 30 min after FasL addition and increased rapidly thereafter in FasL-treated Raji cells (Fig. 2 A). PCA inhibited caspase-3 activity at 100–200 μm in cells treated with FasL for 2 h (Fig. 2 B). To examine whether PCA inhibits active caspase-3 directly in FasL-treated cells, PCA was added to Raji cells 0 or 60 min (sufficient time to induce active caspase-3) after treatment with FasL. In contrast to the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, PCA did not prevent caspase-3 activity when PCA was added 60 min after FasL treatment (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that PCA does not inhibit active caspase-3 in FasL-treated cells. In FasL-treated cells, PCA prevented processing of caspase-3 into active subunits (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that PCA blocks the signaling pathway upstream of caspase-3 activation. Cross-linked FasL induced cleavage of two caspase-8 isoforms (8/a and 8/b) (25Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Google Scholar) into fragments corresponding to p43 and p41, respectively, and these intermediate forms were subsequently processed into a p18 active large subunit (Fig. 3 B). FasL-induced processing of caspase-8 was markedly inhibited at 100–200 μm in PCA-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). PCA still effectively prevented caspase-8 processing in cells treated with higher concentrations of FasL (2 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 C). Similar to PCA, Z-VAD-fmk inhibited processing of caspase-8 induced by cross-linked FasL (Fig.3 D). Upon FasL engagement, Fas binds to FADD via the death domain interaction, and in turn recruits caspase-8 via the homotypic interaction of their death effector domain, allowing the formation of the DISC (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Google Scholar, 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Google Scholar, 3Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Google Scholar, 4Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Google Scholar, 11Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Google Scholar, 12Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Google Scholar). Immediately after recruitment, caspase-8 molecules are placed in close proximity facilitating self-processing (13Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Google Scholar). PCA affected neither the cell-surface expression of Fas nor the cellular level of FADD and caspase-8 up to 5 h (Fig. 4,A and B). After treatment with FasL, PCA did not affect the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 into the DISC (Fig.4 C). However, in cells treated with 100–200 μm PCA, only full-length caspase-8, but not processed caspase-8 (p43 and p41), was detected in the DISC (Fig.4 C). Caspase-8 processing in the DISC was significantly increased for 30–60 min after treatment with FasL, and PCA still effectively blocked caspase-8 processing in the DISC (Fig.4 D). Similar to PCA, Z-VAD-fmk inhibited the processing of caspase-8 in the DISC without affecting the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 (Fig. 4 E). The above observations suggest the possibility that caspase-8 is a direct target of PCA. Consistent with this hypothesis, PCA inhibited the enzyme activity of active recombinant caspase-8 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). However, the enzymatic activities of active recombinant caspase-3 and active recombinant caspase-9 were also inhibited by PCA at similar concentrations (Fig. 5,B and C). To address whether PCA inhibits caspase-8 preferentially at the enzyme level, competition assay between caspase-3 and caspase-8 was performed (Fig. 5 D). Even in the presence of excess caspase-8 large subunit (p20) where the consensus active center QACXG is located (15Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Google Scholar, 26Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of PCA on caspase-3 activity was not suppressed (Fig. 5 D). Thus, these observations suggest that PCA does not selectively inhibit active caspase-8 at the enzyme level. To determine whether PCA inhibits caspase-9 at the cellular level, Raji cells were pretreated with PCA for 1 h and then incubated for 6 h with staurosporine which induces apoptosis mediated by caspase-9 (Fig. 5 E). Caspase-9 is processed into p35 subunit by self-cleavage, whereas active caspase-3 cleaves caspase-9 into p37 subunit (27Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar). Caspase-9 processing was slightly inhibited by PCA in staurosporine-treated cells, although PCA profoundly inhibited caspase-8 processing in FasL-treated cells (Fig. 5 E). Because, unlike caspase-3 and caspase-8, the cellular level of caspase-9 was markedly reduced when Raji cells were treated with 200 μm PCA for over 7 h (Fig. 5 F), a marginal reduction of caspase-9 processing might be due to the PCA-induced reduction of pro-caspase-9 rather than the inhibitory effect of PCA on caspse-9 activation. To avoid the extensive reduction of caspase-9 by PCA, Raji cells were first preincubated with staurosporine for 3 h and then treated with PCA or Z-VAD-fmk when caspase-9 activity was increasing (Fig.5 G). In contrast to Z-VAD-fmk, PCA exerted weak inhibitory effects on activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in staurosporine-treated cells. Moreover, a similar experiment was performed using FasL-treated Raji cells (Fig. 5 H). Z-VAD-fmk prevented activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3 to the background level. By contrast, PCA strongly inhibited newly activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 but partially prevented already activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 in FasL-treated cells. Thus, these observations indicate that PCA preferentially targets activation of caspase-8 in living cells. PCA has a molecular structure of α,β-unsaturated lactone moiety capable of binding cysteine sulfhydryl groups. In agreement with this, an inhibitory effect of PCA on the enzyme activity of caspase-8 was neutralized by addition of cysteine or glutathione but not serine (Fig. 6 A). Glutathione also suppressed the inhibitory effect of PCA on caspase-8 processing in the DISC (Fig. 6 B). To address whether PCA binds to the active site cysteine, the recombinant caspase-8 p20 was mixed with PCA, and direct binding of PCA was assessed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS (Fig. 6, C and D). Compared with an unmodified peptide, the profiles of fragment ions of the peptide spanning the active center clearly revealed that PCA binds to the active center cysteine of caspase-8 catalytic domain. Caspases play a central role in apoptotic cell death (14Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar, 15Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Google Scholar). Active caspases are modulated directly by cellular and viral proteins that interact with these proteases (14Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar, 16Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Google Scholar, 17Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Google Scholar). Cell-permeable caspase inhibitors are important research tools for addressing the molecular basis of apoptosis, as well as being therapeutic agents for various diseases (28Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2067-2072Google Scholar, 29Hara H. Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Ayata C. Fink K. Huang Z. Shimizu-Sasamata M. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc.

Karl I.E. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 496-501Google Scholar). In contrast to cell-free screening for inhibitors of recombinant proteins such as caspases, we adopted cell-based models of apoptosis to overcome disadvantages such as the poor membrane permeability of inhibitors. We screened for specific inhibitors that block Fas-mediated apoptosis and identified PCA. In the present paper, we demonstrate that PCA primarily blocks self-processing of caspase-8 in the DISC by binding the active center cysteine. PCA inhibited the enzymatic activities of active recombinant caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 at similar concentrations. The non-selective inhibitory effects of PCA on active recombinant caspases at the enzyme level might be explained by the fact that PCA binds to cysteine residues of proteins via an α,β-unsaturated lactone moiety. Nevertheless, PCA strongly inhibited self-activation of caspase-8 but weakly inhibited activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, in cells treated with FasL or staurosporine. These observations suggest that caspase-8 should be the preferential target of PCA in intact cells. The overall structure of caspase-8 including the substrate-binding subsite (S1) resembles the caspase-3 structure, with the exception of subsites (S3 and S4) essential for substrate specificity (34Blanchard H. Kodandapani L. Mittl P.R. Marco S.D. Krebs J.F. Wu J.C. Tomaselli K.J. Grütter M.G. Structure. 1999; 7: 1125-1133Google Scholar, 35Watt W. Koeplinger K.A. Milder A.M. Heinrikson R.L. Tomasselli A.G.

The similarity and difference in the binding cleft of caspase-3 and caspase-8 does not explain the preferential blockade of caspase-8 by PCA in intact cells. Although the three-dimensional structure of the caspase-8 zymogen is currently unknown, it seems likely that the substrate-binding pocket differs between the fully active caspase-8 heterodimer and the caspse-8 zymogen. As the likely explanation, we speculate that PCA might have a higher affinity to the caspase-8 zymogen and inactivate its intrinsic proteolytic activity. In contrast to caspase-3 and caspase-8, the cellular amount of caspase-9 was selectively reduced in PCA-treated cells. The caspase-9 reduction by PCA was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, 2M. Bando, K. Nagai, and T. Kataoka, unpublished observations. suggesting that caspase-9 is proteolytically degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in PCA-treated cells. The molecular mechanism of caspase-9 degradation induced by PCA remains to be elucidated. Among peptide-based caspase inhibitors so far developed, Z-VAD-fmk is an irreversible inhibitor that targets many (but not all) caspases (33Hotchkiss R.S. Chang K.C. Swanson P.E. Tinsley K.W.

Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Google Scholar) and is most frequently used to block apoptosis. It was reported that a series of non-peptide inhibitors of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (isatin sulfonamides) prevent apoptosis and maintain cell functionality (38Lee D. Long S.A. Adams J.L. Chan G. Vaidya K.S. Francis T.A. Kikly K. Winkler J.D. Sung C.-M. Debouck C. Richardson S. Levy M.A. DeWolf Jr., W.E. Keller P.M. Tomaszek T. Head M.S. Ryan M.D. Haltiwanger R.C. Liang P.-H. Janson C.A.

Unlike PCA, the isatin sulfonamides do not possess an α,β-unsaturated lactone moiety that is capable of binding cysteine residues. Instead, these inhibitors primarily interact with the substrate binding cleft (S2) unique to caspase-3 and caspase-7 (38Lee D. Long S.A. Adams J.L. Chan G. Vaidya K.S. Francis T.A. Kikly K. Winkler J.D. Sung C.-M. Debouck C. Richardson S. Levy M.A. DeWolf Jr., W.E. Keller P.M. Tomaszek T. Head M.S. Ryan M.D. Haltiwanger R.C. Liang P.-H. Janson C.A. McDevitt P.J. Johanson K. Concha N.O.

Most of the isatin sulfonamide derivatives do not inhibit caspase-8 (38Lee D. Long S.A. Adams J.L. Chan G. Vaidya K.S. Francis T.A. Kikly K. Winkler J.D. Sung C.-M. Debouck C. Richardson S.

Thus, PCA seems to be the non-peptide inhibitor that blocks self-processing of caspase-8 in cell-based models of apoptosis. Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase that functions as a key molecule critical for apoptosis induced by death receptors (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Google Scholar, 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Signaling by death receptors plays an essential role in homeostasis of various types of cells in the immune system and autoimmunity (41Siegel R.M. Chan F.K.-M. Chun H.J. Lenardo M.J. Nat.

Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1895Google Scholar) reported that caspase activation is required for T cell proliferation. In agreement with this notion, we have shown that the cellular caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP is essential for the regulation of T cell proliferation (44Kataoka T. Budd R.C. Holler N. Thome M.

Caspase inhibitors might thus be applicable to block T cell proliferation and prevent autoimmune diseases. Our present results demonstrate that PCA blocks self-processing of caspase-8 in the DISC. However, PCA exhibited a limited selectivity and induced unfavorable cytotoxic effects in the long term culture, possibly due to binding to sulfhydryl groups of other proteins. Thus, further design of synthetic analogues of PCA might lead to highly selective inhibitors for caspase-8. We are grateful to Drs. Ralph C. Budd and Jürg Tschopp for critical reading of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2314352263,"Erb-B-3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer and is often overexpressed in breast cancers. MMTVhuman-erb-B-3 transgenic mice were generated to evaluate the impact of erb-B-3 overexpression on lung and mammary gland tumorigenesis. These transgenic mice developed a high incidence of lung adenocarcinomas but not mammary gland tumors. The tumors overexpressed transgenic human [h]-erb-B-3 but also overexpressed endogenous erb-B-2, indicating that the heterodimer of h-erb-B-3-erb-B-2 was required for proliferative signal transduction to the nucleus. Lung tumor latency was shorter and the incidence higher in erb-B-3 transgenic mice treated with the methylating agent, methylnitrosourea [MNU]. In MNU treated mice, K-ras activating point mutations in codon 12, synergized with h-erb-B-3 in lung tumorogenesis. In bitransgenic MMTVrat-erb-B2/MMTV-human-erb-B-3 mice, lung tumor latency was also significantly shortened. Unlike over-expression of rat-erb-B-2, overexpression of h-erb-B-3 did not alter the incidence or latency of mammary tumors. Coupled erb-B-2 and erb-B-3 overexpression as well as K-ras activation induced signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This animal model links erb-B-3 with lung cancer, suggests that erb-B-2 and erb-B-3 heterodimerization is a necessary intermediate, and documents latency shortening by methylating agent-induced mutation of K-ras. This erb-B-3 mouse lung cancer model will help dissect genetic changes in lung tumorigenesis and may be useful for chemoprevention studies."

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 228-232Google Scholar). It has been well characterized that nonreceptor type tyrosine kinases including Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70 play pivotal roles in initiating the TCR signals (4Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Google Scholar,5Werlen G. Palmer E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 299-305Google Scholar). Several adaptor proteins that comprise various signaling modules mediating protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions relay the TCR-elicited signals to induce downstream immune responses (6Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Google Scholar, 7Leo A. Wienands J. Baier G. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 301-309Google Scholar, 8Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Google Scholar). In addition to integrating extracellular signals, cell type-specific expression of the signaling molecules may be critical in determining the cell type-specific response to extracellular stimuli. SLP-76 and LAT are expressed exclusively in T cells and function as essential adaptor proteins in the TCR signaling. Besides the TCR-derived signals, costimulation signals elicited by engagement of coreceptors such as CD28 are crucial to induce sufficient immune responses (9Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 295-299Google Scholar). When TCR activation occurs in the absence of the costimulation signals, T cells become anergic, and these T cells never produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) upon restimulation of the TCR (10Powell J. Ragheb J.A. Kitagawa-Sakakida S. Schwartz R.H. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 287-300Google Scholar). TCR-mediated signals activate members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (11Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Google Scholar, 12Franklin R.A.

These kinases phosphorylate various transcription factors inducing the expression of several immune response-related genes. The MAPK subgroups include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAPKs, which differ in their response and substrate specificities. In T cells, JNK and p38 MAPK are synergistically activated by costimulation of TCR and CD28 auxiliary receptors. By contrast, no synergy is observed in the ERK activation. Efficient induction of IL-2 synthesis appears to require the activation of these three distinct MAPKs. Anergic T cells exhibit defective activation of ERK and JNK (16Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondine A. Mueller D.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1272-1276Google Scholar). Recently, we proposed the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Pyk2H, as a key regulator of the JNK pathway leading to IL-2 production by Jurkat cells (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential regulation of MAPKs, which determine the T cell fate, still remain elusive. Cas-L/HEF1 functions in TCR and β1-integrin costimulation-mediated induction of cell migration and activation (18Ohashi Y. Iwata S. Kamiguchi K. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3727-3734Google Scholar,19Kamiguchi K. Tachibana K. Iwata S. Ohashi Y. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 563-568Google Scholar). HEF1 belongs to the Cas family of docking proteins consisting of an SH3 domain, substrate domain, and Src family kinase-binding domain (20Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Google Scholar, 21Bouton A.H. Riggins R.B. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Google Scholar). The substrate domain includes numerous tyrosine phosphorylation motifs that serve as binding sites for CrkL when phosphorylated by Src family kinase(s) in TCR-mediated signaling (22Kanda H. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Yamamoto K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Immunology. 1999; 97: 56-61Google Scholar). Binding of CrkL to HEF1 induces the recruitment of downstream effectors to the HEF1 sites. Two potent CrkL effectors in T cells, C3G and DOCK2, activate the small GTPases Rap1 and Rac, respectively (23Ohashi Y. Tachibana K. Kamiguchi K. Fujita H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6446-6451Google Scholar, 24Nishihara H. Maeda M. Oda A. Tsuda M. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Blood. 2002; 100: 3968-3974Google Scholar, 25Nishihara H. Maeda M. Tsuda M. Makino Y. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 716-720Google Scholar). This activation further controls cell adhesion and gene expression (26Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Google Scholar,27Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar). In our previous study, we identified Chat as a Cas/HEF1-associated adaptor protein (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar). Chat consists of an N-terminal SH2 domain, a C-terminal Cas/HEF1 association domain, and a central serine/proline-rich region containing four potential ERK phosphorylation sites. Indeed, Chat is phosphorylated by ERK when stimulated with epidermal growth factor or nerve growth factor. Overexpression of Chat induces up-regulation of JNK in COS7 cells. Another group has reported the cDNA cloning of NSP3, the human ortholog of Chat (29Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Google Scholar). Association of the NSP3 relative, NSP1, with tyrosine kinase receptors of the epidermal growth factor or insulin has been demonstrated (29Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Google Scholar). Chat also shares the most C-terminal sequence with SHEP1, which binds through its SH2 domain to a tyrosine-phosphorylated motif of Eph receptors (30Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Google Scholar). These data indicate that Chat family proteins are implicated in the signaling pathways of tyrosine kinases and MAPKs. We have also described a 115-kDa Chat isoform, which is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and forms a complex with HEF1 (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar). In this study, we report the molecular cloning of the hematopoietic Chat isoform, Chat-H. Jurkat transfectant cells overexpressing Chat-H show a marked up-regulation of IL-2 production when stimulated with a concurrent ligation of TCR and CD28. IL-2 synthesis is suppressed significantly in cells overexpressing the C-terminal deletion mutant of Chat-H. The activation of JNK in these transfectants is well synchronized with the IL-2 production. Chat-H also promotes the phosphorylation of its tyrosine 402, an intermediate of the JNK activation. Taken together, we propose a role for Chat-H as a positive regulator of TCR signaling in Jurkat cells. Anti-Chat SH and anti-Chat CT polyclonal antibodies that recognize both Chat and Chat-H were raised as described in our previous work (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar). Anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and anti-human CD28 (CD28.2) was from Immunotech. Anti-Pyk2 (N-19) and anti-Pyk2 (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-phosphotyrosine 402 Pyk2 was from BIOSOURCE. Anti-FLAG (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Antibodies detecting the active form of ERK, JNK, or p38 MAPK were obtained from Promega Corp., and anti-ERK, anti-JNK, and anti-p38 MAPK were from Santa Cruz. Mouse Chat-H cDNA was isolated from a mouse spleen λZAP II cDNA library (Stratagene) by hybridization screening using the mouse Chat cDNA (GenBank AB030442) probe, followed by nucleotide sequencing. N-terminally FLAG-tagged expression plasmids of Chat-H and its variants, Chat-H-R238K (the SH2 domain arginine 238 was mutated to lysine), Chat-H-ΔMAPK (amino acid residues 324–456 including four MAPK phosphorylation sites were deleted), or Chat-H-ΔCT (C-terminal 83 amino acid residues essential for Cas/HEF1 association were deleted) were constructed as described (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar); a schematic representation is depicted in Fig. 2 A. The human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat clone E6-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Jurkat cells were transfected with the expression plasmid together with pcDNA3.1-Hygro by electroporation (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). The transfectants were selected by 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako Chemicals). The expressed protein level of each hygromycin-resistant clone was examined by immunoblot analysis against the FLAG tag. The expression levels of CD3 and CD28 were determined by flow cytometry as described previously (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). The clones expressing FLAG-tagged Chat-H mutants with amounts of CD3 and CD28 equivalent to those of parental Jurkat cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Hygro vector alone were selected for the following analyses. Established clones were maintained in 250 μg/ml hygromycin B-containing medium. Jurkat cells (5 × 106–107 cells) were serum starved for 4–6 h to become “resting” cells and then were treated on ice for 15 min with a saturating concentration (10 μg/ml) of OKT3 and/or CD28.2 monoclonal antibodies. Goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml, Cappel) was added to the cell suspensions to cross-link CD3 and/or CD28 on the cells. The cells were then immediately placed at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. After the desired time point, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μm p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmiodoacetamide) for 30 min at 4 °C. For treatment with a MAPK inhibitor, Jurkat cells were incubated with 50 μm PD98059 or a control solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and then stimulated with anti-CD3. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by using protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described above (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitates was described previously (31Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation by active ERK, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ERK buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by resuspension in ERK buffer containing 100 units of recombinant active ERK (Calbiochem) and 50 μm ATP. After a 1-h incubation at 30 °C, samples were treated with or without alkaline phosphatase and eluted by SDS sample buffer. Immunobotting was performed by the Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) as described (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). The activated state of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK) was determined by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies that recognize the dually phosphorylated, active form of ERK, JNK, or p38 MAPK. To normalize the amount of loaded samples, the blots were reprobed with anti-ERK, anti-JNK, or anti-p38 MAPK antibodies. JNK activity was also determined by a solid phase kinase assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun1–79(Santa Cruz) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). Jurkat transfectants (2 × 106cells) were stimulated with either monoclonal antibodies OKT3 and CD28.2 cross-linked by goat anti-mouse IgG or with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml calcium ionophore (A23187; Calbiochem), as described above (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation, the concentration of IL-2 secreted in the culture supernatant was measured by using human IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Endogen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recently, we identified a novel adaptor protein, Cas/HEF1-associated signal transducer, Chat (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar). Chat is expressed in a wide range of tissues with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa. Interestingly, a 115-kDa Chat isoform is detected in hematopoietic tissues by using anti-Chat antibodies. Because it is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, we tentatively named this protein Chat-H, a hematopoietic cell-specific Chat. In this study, we isolated a cDNA encoding Chat-H from a mouse spleen cDNA library. Chat-H is encoded by an mRNA isoform that shares most of the 3′-sequence with Chat. The unique 5′-sequence implies differential initiation and splicing of the Chat-H transcript in hematopoietic cells. The Chat-H cDNA sequence is identical to that of SHEP1, reported as an activated Eph receptor-binding protein (30Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Google Scholar). Chat-H consists of 854 amino acid residues; the molecular mass ∼94 kDa (Fig.1). However, when the Chat-H mRNA was expressed ectopically in 293T cells, the translated product showed an apparent molecular mass of around 115 kDa on SDS-PAGE as observed in hematopoietic tissues (data not shown). The N-terminal amino acid sequence specific for Chat-H (amino acid residues 1–166) does not show any significant similarity to other known protein sequences. To investigate the role of Chat-H in T cell activation, we established Jurkat transfectants overexpressing Chat-H or its mutants (Fig.2 A). An SH2 domain mutant of Chat-H, Chat-H-R238K, was engineered by replacing a conserved arginine with lysine. The loss of function was verified by its abrogated binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated EphA4 in 293T cell expression system (data not shown). In Chat-H-ΔMAPK, the central region of Chat-H consisting of four ERK phosphorylation consensus sites was deleted. Based on our previous observation, the deletion of the Chat C-terminal 83 amino acid residues is enough to abolish its Cas binding activity (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed Chat-H-ΔCT; the analogous region was deleted. Impaired interaction between Chat-H-ΔCT and HEF1 was confirmed by a coimmunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). The Jurkat clones expressing these Chat-H mutants were screened by immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 2 B. The transfectants, showing an 8–10-fold expression level of Chat-H variants over the endogenous level, were selected for the following functional analyses. We also chose the clones with similar expression levels of both CD3 and CD28 to the control cells and established three to four independent clones expressing each Chat-H-related protein (data not shown). First, we examined whether Chat-H becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TCR stimulation because Chat-H has some potential target motifs for tyrosine kinases. However, we did not detect phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues upon TCR engagement (data not shown). Instead, we found that Chat-H in TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells and mouse splenic T cells exhibits reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 A, this mobility shift was also observed in TCR-stimulated Chat-H-overexpressing Jurkat cells (JT-ChatH, +Stim.). Pretreatment with a MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 prior to TCR ligation suppressed this mobility change (JT-ChatH, +Stim. +PD). As expected, Chat-H-ΔMAPK, lacking four potential ERK phosphorylation sites, did not show the mobility shift. In addition, alkaline phosphatase treatment of Chat-H reverted the mobility, whereas active ERK induced the mobility changein vitro (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that Chat-H is phosphorylated by ERK upon TCR engagement. This agrees well with our previous observation that ERK mediates Chat phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated PC12 cells (28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar). There is no difference in HEF1 binding activity between the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated states of Chat-H (data not shown). Next, we assessed the IL-2 production level by Jurkat transfectants after costimulation of TCR and CD28 (Fig. 4). The IL-2 concentration in the culture supernatant of Chat-H-overexpressing transfectants (JT-ChatH) was increased up to 4-fold compared with that of control transfectants (JT-Vector). Chat-H-ΔMAPK also enhanced IL-2 production although the impact was significantly weaker than that of Chat-H (p < 0.05). This enhancement was not observed in the transfectant overexpressing the SH2 domain mutant of Chat-H (JT-R238K). Overexpression of Chat-H-ΔCT significantly decreased the IL-2 level (p < 0.01). All of these transfectants produced essentially the same level of IL-2 in response to the combined stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate andA23187, suggesting their equivalent potential in IL-2 synthesis (Fig.4). Taken together, Chat-H is likely to play a positive role in the coupling signals from TCR and CD28 to IL-2 production, and the interactions via both the SH2 and Cas/HEF1 association domains of Chat-H are essential for the process. The MAPK family comprises three distinct kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. The activation of all three kinases is required for the full activation of T cells (11Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Google Scholar, 12Franklin R.A. Tordai A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2134-2140Google Scholar, 13Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the activation of MAPKs in the Jurkat transfectants upon costimulation of TCR and CD28 and examined the role of Chat-H in IL-2 production by Jurkat cells. We first compared the activation kinetics of ERK and p38 MAPK between Jurkat and Chat-H transfectants upon costimulation (Fig.5 A); the detection was carried out by the antibodies specific for their activated forms. The activation of ERK and p38 MAPK reached its maximum at 5 min and decreased to less than 50% at 20 min. Several independent experiments (data not shown) gave a consensus that there was virtually no difference in the activation kinetics between these transfectants. Next, we examined whether ERK and p38 activation is influenced by the presence of various Chat-H mutants. All of the transfectants were found to be similar in the TCR-induced ERK activation and costimulation-elicited p38 MAPK activation at 5 min (Fig. 5,B and C) and at 20 min (data not shown). Here we show ERK activation data from TCR-stimulated transfectants because TCR-stimulated cells (Fig. 5 B) and TCR/CD28-costimulated cells (data not shown) gave essentially the same results. Thus, the activation of ERK and p38 MAPK downstream of the TCR is not affected by the function of Chat-H. We next addressed the activation of another MAPK, JNK, in these transfectants. After concurrent ligation of TCR and CD28, JNK activation estimated by activated JNK-specific antibody was promoted significantly in Chat-H-overexpressing cells compared with the control Jurkat cells (data not shown). To quantify the JNK activation level in various transfectants, we employed a solid phase JNK assay. The JNK activity in JT-Chat-H cells was 5–8-fold higher at 10–40 min after stimulation than those in the Jurkat control (Fig.6 A). As shown in Fig.6 B, the Jurkat transfectants overexpressing Chat-H and Chat-H-ΔMAPK exhibited 3–7-fold higher levels of JNK activity over that of the control cells. In contrast, the JNK activation level of JT-ΔCT was reduced to 30–40% of the controls. The JT-R238K showed almost the control level of JNK activity. The degrees of JNK activation in different Jurkat transfectants agree well with their IL-2 production levels (Figs. 4 and 6 B). This strongly suggests the possible augmentation of IL-2 production by Chat-H via up-regulation of the JNK activity. To reveal the mechanism underlying the JNK activation by Chat-H, we examined the effect of Chat-H expression on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of several TCR signal-related molecules. Vav, SLP-76, LAT, and protein kinase Cθ are tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation and implicated in the activation of MAPKs (4Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Google Scholar). However, we did not detect significant alterations in their phosphorylation levels between the control and Chat-H-overexpressing cells (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Lck, ZAP-70, Fyn, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase also did not show any significant changes (data not shown). Nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2, highly expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage and in the central nervous system, is proposed as a key regulator of the JNK signaling pathway in various cellular responses (32Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Google Scholar, 33Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar, 34Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently that Pyk2H, an alternatively spliced isoform of Pyk2, is involved in JNK activation in T cells (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). We further found that the phosphorylation of Pyk2H tyrosine 402 is crucial for the JNK activation; this is also verified in a different system, i.e. angiotensin II signaling in smooth muscle cells (35Frank G.D. Eguchi S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 692-696Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, A and B, anti-Pyk2H immunoprecipitates from the lysates of JT-Pyk2H included a significant amount of Chat-H, and anti-Chat-H-precipitates from JT-Chat-H contained Pyk2H. This coprecipitating activity was abolished in JT-ΔCT, suggesting a HEF1-mediated interaction between Chat-H and Pyk2H. Neither tyrosine 402 phosphorylation of Pyk2H nor ERK-dependent Chat-H phosphorylation induced by TCR activation influenced the extent of the Chat-H-Pyk2H interaction. Intriguingly, overexpression of Chat-H increased the phosphorylation level of Pyk2H tyrosine 402 at about 5-fold over the control upon costimulation of TCR and CD28, whereas Chat-H-ΔCT overexpression decreased it (Fig. 7 C). These data suggest that Chat-H and Pyk2H may function together in the integration of costimulatory signals for JNK activation. Recently, we identified a novel adaptor protein, Chat, which forms a complex with Cas family docking proteins. We have also described a Chat isoform, Chat-H, abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of the Chat-H cDNA. Chat-H is encoded by a mRNA isoform that shares most of the 3′-sequence with Chat. In other words, Chat-H has an extra N-terminal domain absent in Chat. Chat-H is associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated HEF1 in both splenic T cells and thymocytes (Ref. 28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar and data not shown), suggesting a possible interplay between Chat-H and HEF1 in T cell development. By using various Jurkat transfectants overexpressing Chat-H or its mutants, we provide evidence that Chat-H is involved in the positive regulation of T cell signaling, which activates IL-2 gene expression: 1) Chat-H overexpression induces a marked enhancement of IL-2 production under costimulation with TCR and CD28; 2) the function of the Chat-H SH2 domain is essential for this up-regulation; and 3) Chat-H-ΔCT, the Cas/HEF1 association domain mutant, shows a dominant negative effect on the IL-2 production. Thus, Chat-H is likely to play a key role in coupling costimulatory signals to IL-2 gene expression collaborating with HEF1 and unknown target(s) of its SH2 domain. The activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK is required for adequate induction of IL-2 synthesis in T cells (11Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Google Scholar, 12Franklin R.A. Tordai A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2134-2140Google Scholar, 13Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Google Scholar). Indeed, the enzymatic activities of ERK and JNK are reduced after costimulation of TCR and CD28 in murine anergic T cells (16Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondine A. Mueller D.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1272-1276Google Scholar). These data suggest the close correlation between the activities of the MAPK superfamily and T cell activation. The identification of the signaling components, which integrate costimulatory signals for the differential activation of MAPKs, is a key for clarifying T cell fate determination. Intriguingly, we found that the activation level of JNK, but not of ERK or p38, is greatly augmented in response to the costimulation in Jurkat transfectants overexpressing Chat-H. These cells also exhibit a dramatic increase in their IL-2 production level. In addition, we demonstrated the importance of Chat-H-HEF1-interaction in both the up-regulation of JNK pathway and IL-2 production. Because the members of CrkL-DOCK2-Rac pathway, downstream of HEF1 in T cells, are implicated in JNK activation and IL-2 gene expression (24Nishihara H. Maeda M. Oda A. Tsuda M. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Blood. 2002; 100: 3968-3974Google Scholar, 25Nishihara H. Maeda M. Tsuda M. Makino Y. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 716-720Google Scholar, 27Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar), it is plausible that Chat-H·HEF1 complexes participate in the positive regulation of IL-2 synthesis via activation of the JNK pathway. Pyk2H has been shown to up-regulate JNK activation and subsequent IL-2 production after costimulation of TCR and CD28 (17Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Google Scholar). This process is mediated by phosphorylation of Pyk2H tyrosine 402. Interestingly, Chat-H was found to interact with Pyk2H in a phosphorylation-independent manner, and overexpression of Chat-H further enhances the tyrosine 402 phosphorylation of Pyk2H upon costimulation. Both activities of Chat-H require the functional Cas/HEF1 association domain. This implicates HEF1 in the connection because of its capability to interact with Chat-H and Pyk2H discretely (Refs. 28Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Google Scholar and 34Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar and data not shown). These findings suggest that molecular networks involving Chat-H, HEF1, and Pyk2H may function as a modulator of costimulatory signals to induce efficient T cell activation. Tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins play crucial roles in diverse immune cell signaling pathways (4Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Google Scholar, 5Werlen G. Palmer E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 299-305Google Scholar, 6Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Google Scholar, 7Leo A. Wienands J. Baier G. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 301-309Google Scholar, 8Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Google Scholar). Our data clearly indicate the functional requirement of the Chat-H SH2 domain in the Chat-H-mediated up-regulation of JNK activation and IL-2 synthesis after costimulation. However, Chat-H SH2 domain target(s) responsible for the augmentation of these T cell responses have not yet been identified. Fascinatingly, Chat-H is identical to SHEP1, which binds to activated Eph receptors via its SH2 domain (30Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Google Scholar). Eph receptor tyrosine kinases function as receptors for ephrins, and the ephrin-Eph system is implicated in a wide range of intercellular communications (36Holder N. Klein R. Development. 1999; 126: 2033-2044Google Scholar, 37Schmucker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2001; 105: 701-704Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of the ephrin-Eph system in hematopoietic cells. It is very intriguing to assess whether the ephrin-Eph system is involved in T cell activation and differentiation. Chat-H is phosphorylated by ERK upon TCR stimulation. This raises the possibility that ERK regulates Chat-H function. Chat-H promotes both JNK activation and IL-2 production in the absence of four ERK phosphorylation sites, although the latter activity shows an apparent reduction. It is possible that there is a subordinate route besides the JNK pathway for the enhancement of the IL-2 gene expression downstream of Chat-H. Identification of effector protein(s) whose function is controlled by ERK-mediated Chat-H phosphorylation will provide some insights into its significance in the TCR signaling. In this report, we illuminated the positive regulatory role of a novel hematopoietic adaptor protein Chat-H in the T cell activation. We also revealed that interactions via its domain structures are crucial for the up-regulation of costimulatory signals. Further investigations on the molecular mechanism of signal integration by Chat-H and in vivo studies using transgenic mice will be the next approaches to understanding the physiological function of Chat-H in the T cell fate determination.
