https://openalex.org/W3015554176,"Effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed to control this current pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA. Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2′-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed. These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral.

https://openalex.org/W3015258461,"Abstract Upon assembling the first Gossypium herbaceum (A 1 ) genome and substantially improving the existing Gossypium arboreum (A 2 ) and Gossypium hirsutum ((AD) 1 ) genomes, we showed that all existing A-genomes may have originated from a common ancestor, referred to here as A 0 , which was more phylogenetically related to A 1 than A 2 . Further, allotetraploid formation was shown to have preceded the speciation of A 1 and A 2 . Both A-genomes evolved independently, with no ancestor–progeny relationship. Gaussian probability density function analysis indicates that several long-terminal-repeat bursts that occurred from 5.7 million years ago to less than 0.61 million years ago contributed compellingly to A-genome size expansion, speciation and evolution. Abundant species-specific structural variations in genic regions changed the expression of many important genes, which may have led to fiber cell improvement in (AD) 1 . Our findings resolve existing controversial concepts surrounding A-genome origins and provide valuable genomic resources for cotton genetic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3015761667,"Structural variants and presence/absence polymorphisms are common in plant genomes, yet they are routinely overlooked in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we expand the type of genetic variants detected in GWAS to include major deletions, insertions and rearrangements. We first use raw sequencing data directly to derive short sequences, k-mers, that mark a broad range of polymorphisms independently of a reference genome. We then link k-mers associated with phenotypes to specific genomic regions. Using this approach, we reanalyzed 2,000 traits in Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato and maize populations. Associations identified with k-mers recapitulate those found with SNPs, but with stronger statistical support. Importantly, we discovered new associations with structural variants and with regions missing from reference genomes. Our results demonstrate the power of performing GWAS before linking sequence reads to specific genomic regions, which allows the detection of a wider range of genetic variants responsible for phenotypic variation."
https://openalex.org/W3015223754,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a high degree of immune infiltrate in the tumour microenvironment, which may influence the fate of TNBC cells. We reveal that loss of the tumour suppressive transcription factor Elf5 in TNBC cells activates intrinsic interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signalling, promoting tumour progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, we find that loss of the Elf5-regulated ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 ensures stabilization of its putative protein substrate IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) at the protein level in TNBC. Elf5low tumours show enhanced IFN-γ signalling accompanied by an increase of immunosuppressive neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment and increased programmed death ligand 1 expression. Inactivation of either programmed death ligand 1 or IFNGR1 elicited a robust anti-tumour and/or anti-metastatic effect. A positive correlation between ELF5 and FBXW7 expression and a negative correlation between ELF5, FBXW7 and IFNGR1 expression in the tumours of patients with TNBC strongly suggest that this signalling axis could be exploited for patient stratification and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for Elf5low patients with TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3015343006,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)-a neuroendocrine cancer of the skin-is caused by the integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus and persistent expression of large T antigen and small T antigen. We report that small T antigen in complex with MYCL and the EP400 complex activates the expression of LSD1 (KDM1A), RCOR2 and INSM1 to repress gene expression by the lineage transcription factor ATOH1. LSD1 inhibition reduces the growth of MCC in vitro and in vivo. Through a forward-genetics CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified an antagonistic relationship between LSD1 and the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) chromatin remodelling complex. Changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility caused by LSD1 inhibition were partially rescued by BRD9 inhibition, revealing that LSD1 and ncBAF antagonistically regulate an overlapping set of genes. Our work provides mechanistic insight into the dependence of MCC on LSD1 and a tumour suppressor role for ncBAF in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3015880009,"Objectives To assess the effects of early management of hyperglycaemia with antidiabetic drugs plus lifestyle intervention compared with lifestyle alone, on microvascular function in adults with pre-diabetes. Methods Trial design: International, multicenter, randomised, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Participants Males and females aged 45–74 years with IFG, IGT or IFG+IGT, recruited from primary care centres in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Kuwait, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Turkey. Intervention Participants were randomized to placebo; metformin 1.700 mg/day; linagliptin 5 mg/day or fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin. All patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program (diet and physical activity). Drug intervention will last 2 years. Primary Outcome: composite end-point of diabetic retinopathy estimated by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Score, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and skin conductance in feet estimated by the sudomotor index. Secondary outcomes in a subsample include insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, biomarkers of inflammation and fatty liver disease, quality of life, cognitive function, depressive symptoms and endothelial function. Results One thousand three hundred ninety one individuals with hyperglycaemia were assessed for eligibility, 424 excluded after screening, 967 allocated to placebo, metformin, linagliptin or to fixed-dose combination of metformin + linagliptin. A total of 809 people (91.1%) accepted and initiated the assigned treatment. Study sample after randomization was well balanced among the four groups. No statistical differences for the main risk factors analysed were observed between those accepting or rejecting treatment initiation. At baseline prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 4.2%, severe neuropathy 5.3% and nephropathy 5.7%. Conclusions ePREDICE is the first -randomized clinical trial with the aim to assess effects of different interventions (lifestyle and pharmacological) on microvascular function in people with pre-diabetes. The trial will provide novel data on lifestyle modification combined with glucose lowering drugs for the prevention of early microvascular complications and diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W3015691672,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a proteolytic enzyme responsible for the rapid degradation of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that is required for the secretion of insulin. DPP-4 also influences activation of node like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome under diabetic conditions. Although several polyphenols are reported for various bioactivities, they are consumed as part of the food matrix and not in isolation. Horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) is a rich source of myricetin (Myr) (35 μg/g flour), reported for its anti-hyperglycemic effect. In this investigation, we aimed to study the effect of Myr, singly, and in the presence of co-nutrient horsegram protein (HP) on DPP-4 activity and its consequential impact on GLP-1, insulin, and NLRP3 inflammasome in high-fat diet and single low dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic male Wistar rats. In diabetic control (DC), the activity of DPP-4 and its expression were higher compared to treated groups. The consequential decrease in the circulating GLP-1 levels in the DC group, but not treated groups, further indicated the effectiveness of our test molecules under diabetic conditions. Specifically, Myr decreased DPP-4 activity and its expression levels with enhanced circulating GLP-1 and insulin levels. Myr administration also resulted in a lessening of diabetes-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities. HP also proved to be efficient in reducing elevated blood glucose levels and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities. However, Myr, in the presence of HP as a co-nutrient, had diminished capacity to inhibit DPP-4 and, consequently, reduced potential in ameliorating diabetic conditions. Myr proved to be a potent inhibitor of DPP-4 in vitro and in vivo, resulting in enhanced circulating GLP-1 and insulin levels, thereby improving diabetic conditions. Though Myr and HP, individually ameliorate diabetic conditions, their dietary combination had reduced efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3016125209,"Shrimps can be used as indicators of the quality of aquatic systems exposed to a variety of pollutants. Chlorpyrifos is one of the most common pesticides found in environmental samples. In order to evaluate the effects of chlorpyrifos, adult organisms of Litopenaeus vannamei were exposed to two sublethal concentrations of the pesticide (0.7 and 1.3 μg/L) for four days. The LC50 (96-hours) value was determined and Lipid oxidation levels (LPO) and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathion peroxidase (GPx), glutathion-S-transferase (GST) were assessed on the muscle, hepatopancreas and gills from the exposed organisms. In addition, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was determined in the brain. LC50 (96-hours) was 2.10 μg/L of chlorpyrifos. Catalase activity and LPO were elevated in the three tissues, whereas a decrease of AChE activities in the brain and an increase of GST activity in the hepatopancreas were observed."
https://openalex.org/W3015250285,"Collembola are a basal group of Hexapoda renowned for both unique morphological characters and significant ecological roles. However, a robust and plausible phylogenetic relationship between its deeply divergent lineages has yet to be achieved. We carried out a mitophylogenomic study based on a so far the most comprehensive mitochondrial genome dataset. Our data matrix contained mitogenomes of 31 species from almost all major families of all four orders, with 16 mitogenomes newly sequenced and annotated. We compared the linear arrangements of genes along mitochondria across species. Then we conducted 13 analyses each under a different combination of character coding, partitioning scheme and heterotachy models, and assessed their performance in phylogenetic inference. Several hypothetical tree topologies were also tested. Mitogenomic structure comparison revealed that most species share the same gene order of putative ancestral pancrustacean pattern, while seven species from Onychiuridae, Poduridae and Symphypleona bear different levels of gene rearrangements, indicating phylogenetic signals. Tomoceroidea was robustly recovered for the first time in the presence of all its families and subfamilies. Monophyly of Onychiuroidea was supported using unpartitioned models alleviating LBA. Paronellidae was revealed polyphyletic with two subfamilies inserted independently into Entomobryidae. Although Entomobryomorpha has not been well supported, more than half of the analyses obtained convincing topologies by placing Tomoceroidea within or near remaining Entomobryomorpha. The relationship between elongate-shaped and spherical-shaped collembolans still remained ambiguous, but Neelipleona tend to occupy the basal position in most trees. This study showed that mitochondrial genomes could provide important information for reconstructing the relationships among Collembola when suitable analytical approaches are implemented. Of all the data refining and model selecting schemes used in this study, the combination of nucleotide sequences, partitioning model and exclusion of third codon positions performed better in generating more reliable tree topology and higher node supports than others."
https://openalex.org/W3015456997,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of breathing route on the collapsibility of the pharyngeal airway in patients with obstructive sleep apnea by using computational fluid dynamics technology.This study examined Japanese men with obstructive sleep apnea. Computed tomography scans of the nose and pharynx were taken during nasal breathing with closed mouth, nasal breathing with open mouth, and oral breathing while they were awake. Three-dimensional reconstructed stereolithography models and digital unstructured grid models were created and airflow simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics software.Airflow velocity was significantly higher during oral breathing than during nasal breathing with open or closed mouth. No significant difference in maximum velocity was noted between nasal breathing with closed and open mouth. However, airflow during nasal breathing with open mouth was slow but rapidly sped up at the lower level of the velopharynx, and then spread and became a disturbed, unsteady stream. In contrast, airflow during nasal breathing with closed mouth gradually sped up at the oropharyngeal level without spreading or disturbance. Negative static pressure during oral breathing was significantly decreased; however, there were no significant differences between nasal breathing with closed or open mouth.Computational fluid dynamics results during nasal and oral breathing revealed that oral breathing is the primary condition leading to pharyngeal airway collapse based on the concept of the Starling Resistor model. Airflow throughout the entirety of the breathing route was smoother during nasal breathing with closed mouth than that with open mouth."
https://openalex.org/W3015470337,"Urban shrinkage is currently spreading at global level. At the same time, the scale of urban shrinkage is not limited to urban agglomerations, metropolitan areas, or big cities, but begins to expand to a vast number of small towns. Over the years, the characteristics, models, and mechanisms of shrinkage in large cities have attracted the attention of scholars; however, the problem of shrinkage in small towns has not been fully discussed. In China, small towns are located at the margins of cities and are the first part of the countryside; hence, they are the link and the bridge between urban and rural areas, and a space carrier to solve the diseases of big cities and for rural rejuvenation as a whole. However, in the process of rapid urbanization, some small towns have experienced urban shrinkage, mainly through a decline in township enterprises and the deterioration of the living environment, which has restricted their role in coordinating the spatial support of urban and rural development. Therefore, a correct understanding of the shrinkage of small towns has considerable theoretical and practical guiding significance. We focused on the towns of the Jilin Province as the research unit, and combined township population, economy, land use, and employment indices to establish an urban shrinkage index, identifying the status, spatial distribution, and influencing factors of small towns shrinkage in the Jilin Province. Moreover, we analyzed the similarities and differences of small towns shrinkage between the Jilin Province and developed countries. The results show that small towns shrinkage in the Jilin Province shares similar characteristics with developed countries, as well as important differences in aspects such as population migration, low-level industrial structure, and administrative division adjustments."

As conventional vector control methods present many challenges, alternatives are urgently needed. Manipulation of mosquito microbiota is emerging as a field for the development of vector control strategies. Critical to this vector control approach is knowledge of the microbiota of these mosquitoes and finding candidate microorganisms that are common to the vectors with properties that could be used in microbiota modification studies. Results showed that bacteria genera including Asaia, Escherichia, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Serratia are common to both major arboviral vectors in Grenada and have previously been shown to be good candidates for transgenetic studies. Also, for the first time, the presence of Grenada mosquito rhabdovirus 1 is reported in C. quinquefasciatus."
https://openalex.org/W3015764040,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common solid tumor worldwide and has shown resistance to several immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint blockade therapy, which is effective in many other types of cancer. Our previous studies indicated that the active fraction of Garcinia yunnanensis (YTE-17), had potent anticancer activities by regulating multiple signaling pathways. However, knowledge regarding the mechanism and effect of YTE-17 in the prevention of CRC is limited. This study tested the effects of YTE-17 on colon cancer development in vivo by using two murine models: the carcigenic azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC model and a genetically induced model using ApcMin/+ mice. Here, the tumor load, tumor number, histology, and even some oncogenes were used to evaluate the effect of YTE-17. The intragastric administration of YTE-17 for 12 weeks significantly decreased CRC incidence, tumor number and size, immunity, and some tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) markers, including CD206, Arg-1, IL-10, and TGF-β. Importantly, the macrophages depletion by clodronate (CEL) also played a role in reducing the tumor burden and inhibiting tumor development, which were not affected by YTE-17 in the ApcMin/+ mice. Moreover, the YTE-17 treatment attenuated CRC cell growth in a co-culture system in the presence of macrophages. Consistently, YTE-17 effectively reduced the tumor burden and macrophage infiltration and enhanced immunity in the AOM/DSS and ApcMin/+ colon tumor models. Altogether, we demonstrate that macrophages in the microenvironment may contribute to the development and progression of CRC cells and propose YTE-17 as a new potential drug option for the treatment of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3016046144,"Primary cilia (PC) are organelles that sense and respond to dynamic changes of the extracellular milieu through the regulation of target genes. By using the epididymis as a model system, we determined the contribution of primary cilia in the regulation of epithelial cell functions through the transduction of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Both Sonic (SHH) and Indian Hedgehog (IHH) ligands were detected in epididymal epithelial cells by confocal microscopy and found secreted in the extracellular space. Gene expression profiling preformed on ciliated epithelial cells indicated that 153 and 1052 genes were differentially expressed following treatment with the Hh agonist SAG or the Hh antagonist cyclopamine (Cyclo), respectively. Strikingly, gene ontology analysis indicated that genes associated with immune response were the most affected following Hh modulation. The contribution of epididymal PC to canonical Hh pathway transduction was validated by ciliobrevin D treatment, which induced a significant decrease in PC length and a reduction in the expression Hh signaling targets. Such findings bring us closer to a molecular understanding of the subtle immune balance observed in some epithelia, including the epididymis and the intestine, which are organs featuring both tolerance toward autoimmune spermatozoa (or commensal bacteria) and defense against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3016231377,"Background Globally, emergency departments (EDs) are struggling to meet the service demands of their local communities. Across Australia, EDs routinely collect data for every presentation which is used to determine the ability of EDs to meet key performance indicators. This data can also be used to provide an overall picture of service demand and has been used by healthcare planners to identify local needs and inform service provision, thus, using ED presentations as a microcosm of the communities they serve. The aim of this study was to use ED presentation data to identify who, when and why people accessed a regional Australian ED with non-urgent conditions. Method and materials A retrospective data analysis of routinely collected ED data was undertaken. This included data obtained over a seven-year period (July 2009 to June 2016) in comparison with the Australian Bureau of Statistics census data. Analysis included descriptive statistics to identify the profile of non-urgent attendees and linear regression to identify trends in ED usage. Results This study revealed a consistently high demand for ED services by people with non-urgent conditions (54.1% of all presentations). People living in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic decile contributed to 36.8% of these non-urgent presentations while those under 25 years of age contributed to 41.1%. Diagnoses of mental health and behavioural issues and of non-specific symptoms significantly increased over the study period (p < 0.001) for both diagnostic groups. Conclusion The over-representation by those from the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas highlights an inequity in access to services. The over-representation by those younger in age indicates behavioural patterns based on age. These key issues faced by our local community and the disparity in current service provision will be used to inform future health policy and service planning."
https://openalex.org/W3015265372,"Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common short-limbed skeletal dysplasia caused by activating mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. We identified that meclizine hydrochloride inhibited FGFR3 signaling in various chondrocytic cells and promoted longitudinal bone growth in mouse model of ACH. Meclizine has safely been used for more than 50 years, but it lacks the safety data for repeated administration and pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered to children. We performed a phase Ia study to evaluate the PK and safety of meclizine administered orally to ACH children. Twelve ACH children aged from 5 to younger than 11 years were recruited, and the first 6 subjects received once a day of meclizine in the fasted condition, subsequent 6 subjects received twice a day of meclizine in the fed condition. Meclizine was well tolerated in ACH children with no serious adverse events. The mean Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-24h, t1/2 during 24 hours in the fasted condition were 130 ng/mL, 1.7 hours, 761 ng·h/mL, and 8.5 hours respectively. The simulation of repeated administration of meclizine for 14 days demonstrated that plasma concentration apparently reached steady state around 10 days after the first dose both at once a day and twice a day administration. The AUC0-10h of the fasting and fed condition were 504 ng·h/mL and 813 ng·h/mL, respectively, indicating exposure of meclizine increased with the diet. Although higher drug exposure was confirmed in ACH children compared to adults, a single administration of meclizine seemed to be well tolerated."
https://openalex.org/W3015413602,"As educators strive to incorporate more active learning and inquiry-driven exercises into STEM curricula, Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) are becoming more common in undergraduate laboratory courses. Here we detail a CURE developed in an upper-level undergraduate genetics course at Yeshiva University, centered on the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the human neurodegeneration locus PLA2G6/PARK14. Drosophila PLA2G6 mutants exhibit symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as attenuated lifespan and decreased climbing ability with age, which can be replicated by neuron-specific knockdown of PLA2G6. To ask whether the neurodegeneration phenotype could be caused by loss of PLA2G6 in specific neuronal subtypes, students used GAL4-UAS to perform RNAi knockdown of PLA2G6 in subsets of neurons in the Drosophila central nervous system and measured age-dependent climbing ability. We organized our learning objectives for the CURE into three broad goals of having students think, communicate, and perform like scientists. To assess how well students achieved these goals, we developed a detailed rubric to analyze written lab reports, administered pre- and post-course surveys, and solicited written feedback. We observed striking gains related to all three learning goals, and students reported a high degree of satisfaction. We also observed significantly improved understanding of the scientific method by students in the CURE as compared to the prior year's non-CURE genetics lab students. Thus, this CURE can serve as a template to successfully engage students in novel research, improve understanding of the scientific process, and expose students to the use of Drosophila as a model for human neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W3015407075,"Providing dietary suggestions based on an individual’s nutritional needs may contribute to the prevention of non-communicable dietary related diseases. Consumer acceptance is crucial for the success of these personalised nutrition services. The current study aims to build on previous studies by exploring whether ambivalent feelings and contextual factors could help to further explain consumers’ usage intentions regarding personalised nutrition services. An online administered survey was conducted in December 2016 with a final sample of 797 participants in the Netherlands. Different models were tested and compared by means of structural equation modelling. The final model indicated that the result of weighing personalisation benefits and privacy risks (called the risk-benefit calculus) is positively related to the intention to use personalised nutrition advice, suggesting a more positive intention when more benefits than risks are perceived. Additionally, the model suggests that more ambivalent feelings are related to a lower intention to use personalised nutrition advice. Finally, we found that the more the eating context is perceived as a barrier to use personalised nutrition advice, the more ambivalent feelings are perceived. In conclusion, the current study suggests the additional value of ambivalent feelings as an affective construct, and eating context as a possible barrier in predicting consumers’ intention to use personalised nutrition advice. This implies that personalised nutrition services may need to address affective concerns and consider an individual’s eating context."
https://openalex.org/W3016185643,"Background Yoga in school is a beneficial tool to promote the good health and well-being of students by changing the way they react to stress. The positive effects of yoga—taught in schools—on children, youth and young adults have been demonstrated in former studies using mostly subjective psychometric data. Aim The present trial aims to evaluate the potential effects of yoga on autonomic regulation in young adults by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Methods This study is a non-randomized, explorative, two-arm-pilot study with an active control group. Fourteen healthy young adults took part in a 10-week yoga program (90 min once a week) in school and were compared to a control group of 11 students who participated in conventional school sports (90 min once a week over 10 weeks). 24-hour electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded at baseline and following the 10-week intervention. From 20-minute of nocturnal sleep phases, HRV parameters were calculated from linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear dynamics (such as symbolic dynamics and Poincaré plot analysis). Analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by t-tests as post-hoc tests estimating both statistical significance and effect size were used to compare pre-post-intervention for the two groups. Results The statistical analysis of the interaction effects did not reveal a significant group and time interaction for the individual nocturnal HRV indices. Almost all indices revealed medium and large effects regarding the time main effects. The changes in the HRV indices following the intervention were more dramatic for the yoga group than for the control group which is reflected in predominantly higher significances and stronger effect sizes in the yoga group. Conclusion In this explorative pilot trial, an increase of HRV (more parasympathetic dominance and overall higher HRV) after ten weeks of yoga in school in comparison to regular school sports was demonstrated, showing an improved self-regulation of the autonomic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3015396628,"Background The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) is the leading tool intended to assess the cognitive representation of medication, however, the validated Polish version of the questionnaire is lacking. Aims To adapt the original BMQ tool to the Polish language (BMQ-PL) and to validate it. Materials and methods The BMQ was adapted to Polish according to widely accepted guidelines. A total of 311 cardiovascular in- and outpatients as well as medical students taking chronic medication were surveyed to assess data-to-model fit and internal consistency of the measure. The criterion-related validity was determined with the use of Polish version of the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were used, as well as general linear modeling. Results The BMQ-PL exhibited the same factorial structure as the original questionnaire and all the items loaded on their expected factors. Internal consistency of the questionnaire was satisfactory in the group of cardiovascular patients (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.64 to 0.82 and McDonald’s omega from 0.90 to 0.91). There were significant correlations in the predicted directions between all BMQ-PL subscales and the measure of drug adherence in cardiovascular outpatients, but not in inpatients. Medical students may conceptualize the beliefs about medicines in a different way; as a result, a modified version of the BMQ-PL-General, suitable for medically-educated people, was proposed. Conclusion The BMQ-PL exhibits satisfactory proof of validity to be used among cardiovascular patients."
https://openalex.org/W3015463789,"Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of completed gestation) is the leading cause of neonatal death, and has an incidence of 5-13% which is believed to be on the rise. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of spontaneous preterm birth and investigate the relationship between preterm birth and cervical length in a pregnant Asian population.A prospective observational study between September 2010 and November 2013 was performed at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. 1013 women with single viable pregnancies were recruited at less than 14 weeks of gestation between September 2010 and November 2013, excluding those with multiple gestation, pre-existing autoimmune or renal disease or those with current pregnancies complicated by aneuploidy or fetal anomalies. Participant characteristics were obtained from an interviewer-administered questionnaire at the first recruitment visit. Cervical length was measured using ultrasound at each of the 4 antenatal visits (Visit 1: < 14 weeks, Visit 2: 18-22 weeks, Visit 3: 28-32 weeks and Visit 4: > 34 weeks) using the Fetal Medicine Foundation protocol. Data on pregnancy outcomes were obtained from obstetric case notes and records. The main outcome measure examined in this study was that of spontaneous preterm birth and its relationship to cervical length.There was a significantly shorter cervical length both in the 2nd trimester (18 to 22 weeks) and the 3rd trimester (28 to 32 weeks) in the preterm birth group compared to the term birth group (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001 respectively). In the first trimester (11 to 14 weeks), there was no statistically significant difference in cervical length between the two groups (p = 0.425). ROC curve analysis for cervical length in the preterm birth group for 18 to 22 weeks and 28 to 32 weeks showed an AUC of 0.605 and 0.725 respectively. At 28 to 32 weeks of gestation, a cut-off level at 2.49 cm has a sensitivity of 54.8%, specificity of 82.5%, negative predictive value of 97.9% and positive predictive value of 11.1%.There is a significantly shorter cervical length in the 2nd and 3rd trimester in the preterm birth group. Cervical length is a moderate predictor of preterm birth with good negative predictive value and a relatively good specificity. Ultrasound cervical length screening for pregnant Asian women between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation with a cutoff of ≥ 2.48cm can help to identify a group of women who are at risk for preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W3015926442,"The historic use of chlordecone (C10Cl10O) as a pesticide to control banana weevil infestations has resulted in pollution of large land areas in the French West Indies. Although currently banned, chlordecone persists because it adsorbs strongly to soil and its complex bis-homocubane structure is stable, particularly under aerobic conditions. Abiotic chemical transformation catalyzed by reduced vitamin B12 has been shown to break down chlordecone by opening the cage structure to produce C9 polychloroindenes. More recently these C9 polychloroindenes were also observed as products of anaerobic microbiological transformation. To investigate the anaerobic biotransformation of chlordecone by microbes native to the French West Indies, microcosms were constructed anaerobically from chlordecone impacted Guadeloupe soil and sludge to mimic natural attenuation and eletron donor-stimulated reductive dechlorination. Original microcosms and transfers were incubated over a period of 8 years, during which they were repeatedly amended with chlordecone and electron donor (ethanol and acetone). Using LC-MS, chlordecone and degradation products were detected in all the biologically active microcosms. Observed products included monohydro-, dihydro- and trihydrochlordecone derivatives (C10Cl10-nO2Hn; n = 1,2,3), as well as ""open cage"" C9 polychloroindene compounds (C9Cl5-nH3+n n = 0,1,2) and C10 carboxylated polychloroindene derivatives (C10Cl4-nO2H4+n, n = 0-3). Products with as many as 9 chlorine atoms removed were detected. These products were not observed in sterile (poisoned) microcosms. Chlordecone concentrations decreased in active microcosms as concentrations of products increased, indicating that anaerobic dechlorination processes have occurred. The data enabled a crude estimation of partitioning coefficients between soil and water, showing that carboxylated intermediates sorb poorly and as a consequence may be flushed away, while polychlorinated indenes sorb strongly to soil. Microbial community analysis in microcosms revealed enrichment of anaerobic fermenting and acetogenic microbes possibly involved in anaerobic chlordecone biotransformation. It thus should be possible to stimuilate anaerobic dechlorination through donor amendment to contaminated soils, particularly as some metabolites (in particular pentachloroindene) were already detected in field samples as a result of intrinsic processes. Extensive dechlorination in the microcosms, with evidence for up to 9 Cl atoms removed from the parent molecule is game-changing, giving hope to the possibility of using bioremediation to reduce the impact of CLD contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3015397928,"In reproductive hens, a feed restriction is an usual practice to improve metabolic and reproductive disorders. However, it acts a stressor on the animal. In mammals, grape seed extracts (GSE) reduces oxidative stress. However, their effect on endocrine and tissue response need to be deepened in reproductive hens. Here, we evaluated the effects of time and level of GSE dietary supplementation on growth performance, viability, oxidative stress and metabolic parameters in plasma and metabolic tissues in reproductive hens and their offsprings. We designed an in vivo trial using 4 groups of feed restricted hens: A (control), B and C (supplemented with 0.5% and 1% of the total diet composition in GSE since week 4, respectively) and D (supplemented with 1% of GSE since the hatch). In hens from hatch to week 40, GSE supplementation did not affect food intake and fattening whatever the time and dose of supplementation. Body weight was significantly reduced in D group as compared to control. In all hen groups, GSE supplementation decreased plasma oxidative stress index associated to a decrease in the mRNA expression of the NOX4 and 5 oxidant genes in liver and muscle and an increase in SOD mRNA expression. This was also associated to decreased plasma chemerin and increased plasma adiponectin and visfatin levels. Interestingly, maternal GSE supplementation increased the live body weight and viability of chicks at hatching and 10 days of age. This was associated to a decrease in plasma and liver oxidative stress parameters. Taken together, GSE maternal dietary supplementation reduces plasma and tissue oxidative stress associated to modulation of adipokines without affecting fattening in reproductive hens. A 1% GSE maternal dietary supplementation increased offspring viability and reduced oxidative stress suggesting a beneficial transgenerational effect and a potential use to improve the quality of the progeny in reproductive hens."
https://openalex.org/W3015719344,"The structure and dynamics of primate social groups are shaped by the social relationships of its members. These relationships are based on different types of interactions and vary in relation to the identity of the interactants and over time. Social network analysis tools represent a powerful and comprehensive method to characterise social interactions and recent methodological advances now allow the study of the multidimensionality of sociality via multilayer networks that incorporate multiple types of interactions. Here, we use a multidimensional network approach to investigate the multidimensionality of sociality of females in a captive group of mandrills. We constructed two multiplex networks based on agonistic, proximity and grooming interactions of 6–7 mature females to analyse the multidimensionality of relationships within two independent observation periods; and three multiplex networks (one for each interaction type) to examine how relationships changed between periods. Within each period, different individuals were the most central in each layer and at the multiplex level, and different layers (i.e., interaction types) contributed non-redundant information to the multilayer structure. Across periods, relationships based on the same interaction type also contained non-redundant information. These results indicate that female mandrills engage in multidimensional and dynamic relationships, suggesting that in order to represent the full complexity of relationships, networks need to be constructed from more than a single type of interaction and across time. Our results provide evidence for the potential value of the multilayer network approach to characterise the multidimensionality of primate sociality."

The research employed multiple-source questionnaire to collect data of more than 400 R&D firms from leaders and corresponding employees in Chinese context. Bootstrapping method and response surface were used to analyze the associations between all the parameters. The results showed that: (1) in the case of the in-congruence between human capital and social capital, learning capability of R&D firms is at highest level when human capital is at low level and social capital is at high level; (2) learning capability partially mediates the impact of human capital and social capital on innovation performance; (3) environmental dynamism and environmental competitiveness have a joint moderating effect on the relationship between learning capability and innovation performance."
https://openalex.org/W3015919400,"Insect molting hormone (ecdysteroids) and juvenile hormone regulate molting and metamorphic events in a variety of insect species. Mealybugs undergo sexually dimorphic metamorphosis: males develop into winged adults through non-feeding, pupa-like stages called prepupa and pupa, while females emerge as neotenic wingless adults. We previously demonstrated, in the Japanese mealybug Planococcus kraunhiae (Kuwana), that the juvenile hormone titer is higher in males than in females at the end of the juvenile stage, which suggests that juvenile hormone may regulate male-specific adult morphogenesis. Here, we examined the involvement of ecdysteroids in sexually dimorphic metamorphosis. To estimate ecdysteroid titers, quantitative RT-PCR analyses of four Halloween genes encoding for cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in ecdysteroid biosynthesis, i.e., spook, disembodied, shadow and shade, were performed. Overall, their expression levels peaked before each nymphal molt. Transcript levels of spook, disembodied and shadow, genes that catalyze the steps in ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the prothoracic gland, were higher in males from the middle of the second nymphal instar to adult emergence. In contrast, the expression of shade, which was reported to be involved in the conversion of ecdysone into 20-hydroxyecdysone in peripheral tissues, was similar between males and females. These results suggest that ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the prothoracic gland is more active in males than in females, although the final conversion into 20-hydroxyecdysone occurs at similar levels in both sexes. Moreover, expression profiles of ecdysone response genes, ecdysone receptor and ecdysone-induced protein 75B, were also analyzed. Based on these expression profiles, we propose that the changes in ecdysteroid titer differ between males and females, and that high ecdysteroid titer is essential for directing male adult development."
https://openalex.org/W3015945406,"Barrett's esophagus is the only known mucosal precursor for the highly malignant esophageal adenocarcinoma. Malignant degeneration of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus occurs in < 0.6% per year in Dutch surveillance cohorts. Therefore, it has been proposed to increase the surveillance intervals from 3 to 5 years, potentially increasing development of advanced stage interval cancers. To prevent such cases robust biomarkers for more optimal stratification over longer follow up periods for non-dysplastic Barrett's patients are required. In this multi-center study, aberrations for chromosomes 7, 17, and structural abnormalities for c-MYC, CDKN2A, TP53, Her-2/neu and 20q assessed by DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization on brush cytology specimens, were used to determine marker scores and to perform clonal diversity measurements, as described previously. In this study, these genetic biomarkers were combined with clinical variables and analyzed to obtain the most efficient cancer prediction model after an extended period of follow-up (median time of 7 years) by applying Cox regression modeling, bootstrapping and leave-one-out analyses. A total of 334 patients with Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia from 6 community hospitals (n = 220) and one academic center (n = 114) were included. The annual progression rate to high grade dysplasia and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma was 1.3%, and to adenocarcinoma alone 0.85%. A prediction model including age, Barrett circumferential length, and a clonicity score over the genomic set including chromosomes 7, 17, 20q and c-MYC, resulted in an area under the curve of 0.88. The sensitivity and specificity of this model were 0.91 and 0.38. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99). We propose the implementation of the model to identify non-dysplastic Barrett's patients, who are required to remain in surveillance programs with 3-yearly surveillance intervals from those that can benefit from less frequent or no surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3016086440,"Background Influenza continues to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics in humans. The burden of influenza is underestimated by traditional laboratory-based surveillance, and modelled estimates are required for influenza-attributable morbidity and mortality. We aimed to estimate the influenza-attributable hospitalisation in Australia, by influenza type. Methods A generalised-additive regression model was used to estimate type- and age-specific influenza-attributable hospitalisation rates per 100,000 population by principal diagnosis in Australia, from 2001 through 2013. Weekly counts of laboratory-confirmed influenza notifications and by type, influenza A and B were used as covariates in the model. Main principal diagnosis categories of interest were influenza and pneumonia and respiratory admissions. A smoothing spline was used to control for unmeasured time varying factors. Results for 2009, in which the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated, were not included in annual averages and are reported separately. Results During the study period, the estimated annual average, all-age, annual respiratory hospitalisation rates attributable to seasonal influenza type A, B and total influenza were 45.4 (95% CI: 34.9, 55.9), 32.6 (95% CI: 22.8, 42.4), and 76.9 (95% CI: 73.6, 80.2) per 100,000 population, respectively. During 2009, the estimated total pandemic influenza-attributable, all-age, respiratory hospitalisation rate was 56.1 (95% CI: 47.4, 64.9) per 100,000. Older adults (≥85 years of age) experienced the highest influenza-attributable hospitalisation rates for both seasonal and 2009 pandemic influenza. Collinearity between influenza A and B time series in some years limited the ability of the model to resolve differences in influenza attribution between the two virus types. Conclusion Both seasonal and pandemic influenza caused considerable morbidity in Australia during the years studied, particularly among older adults. The pandemic hospitalisation rate in 2009 was lower than the average overall annual rate for seasonal influenza, but young to middle aged adults experience a hospitalisation rate similar to that of severe seasonal influenza."

The diverse specifications of components of ZP is exceptional, and the common aims of adulteration for economic profit is conducted. In this work, a novel method for the identification different species of ZP is proposed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The data used for the experiment is 5 classes obtained from camera and mobile phones. Firstly, the data considering 2 categories are trained to detect the labels by YOLO. Then, the multiple deep learning including VGG, ResNet, Inception v4, and DenseNet are introduced to identify the different species of ZP (HZB, DZB, OZB, ZA and JZC). In order to assess the performance of CNNs, compared with two traditional identification models including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Back Propagation (BP). The experimental results demonstrate that the CNN model have a better performance to identify different species of ZP and the highest identification accuracy is 99.35%.

https://openalex.org/W3016021397,"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is widely endemic in Côte d'Ivoire, and elimination as public health problem (EPHP) is based on annual mass drug administration (MDA) using ivermectin and albendazole. To guide EPHP efforts, we evaluated Wuchereria bancrofti infection indices among humans, and mosquito vectors after four rounds of MDA in four cross-border health districts of Côte d'Ivoire.We monitored people and mosquitoes for W. bancrofti infections in the cross-border health districts of Aboisso, Bloléquin, Odienné and Ouangolodougou, Côte d'Ivoire. W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen (CFA) was identified using filariasis test strips, and antigen-positive individuals were screened for microfilaremia. Moreover, filarial mosquito vectors were sampled using window exit traps and pyrethrum sprays, and identified morphologically at species level. Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Culex quinquefasciatus females were analyzed for W. bancrofti infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.Overall, we found a substantial decline in W. bancrofti infection indices after four rounds of MDA compared to pre-MDA baseline data. CFA prevalence fell from 3.38-5.50% during pre-MDA to 0.00-1.53% after MDA interventions. No subjects had detectable levels of CFA in Ouangolodougou. Moreover, post-MDA CFA prevalence was very low, and below the 1% elimination threshold in Aboisso (0.19%) and Odienné (0.49%). Conversely, CFA prevalence remained above 1% in Bloléquin (1.53%). W. bancrofti microfilariae (Mf) were not found in Aboisso, Bloléquin, and Ouangolodougou, except for Odienné with low prevalence (0.16%; n = 613) and microfilaremia of 32.0 Mf/mL. No An. gambiae s.l. and Cx. quinquefasciatus pools were infected with W. bancrofti in Bloléquin and Ouangolodougou, while they exhibited low infection rates in Aboisso (1% and 0.07%), and Odienné (0.08% and 0.08%), respectively.In cross-border areas of Côte d'Ivoire, LF infection indices in humans and mosquito vectors substantially declined after four rounds of MDA. CFA prevalence fell under the World Health Organization (WHO)-established threshold (1%) in Aboisso, Ouangolodougou and Odienné. Moreover, W. bancrofti prevalence in mosquitoes was lower than WHO-established threshold (2%) in all areas. This might suggest the interruption of W. bancrofti transmission, and possible MDA cessation. However, a formal transmission assessment survey (TAS) and molecular xenomonitoring in mosquito vectors should be implemented before eventual MDA cessation. However, MDA should pursue in Bloléquin where W. bancrofti infection prevalence remained above 1%. Our results provided important ramifications for LF control efforts towards EPHP in Côte d'Ivoire."

Whole genome sequencing was used to analyse the population of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae collected in Slovenia in 2014-2017, including OXA-48 and/or NDM-1 producing strains from the outbreak.A total of 32 K. pneumoniae isolates were analysed using short-read sequencing. Multi-locus sequence typing and core genome multi-locus sequence typing were used to infer genetic relatedness. Antimicrobial resistance markers, virulence factors, plasmid content and wzi types were determined. Long-read sequencing was used for six isolates for detailed analysis of plasmids and their possible transmission.Overall, we detected 10 different sequence types (STs), the most common being ST437 (40.6%). Isolates from the initial outbreak belonged to ST437 (12/16) and ST147 (4/16). A second outbreak of four ST15 isolates was discovered. A new ST (ST3390) and two new wzi types (wzi-556, wzi-559) were identified. blaOXA-48 was found in 17 (53.1%) isolates, blaNDM-1 in five (15.6%), and a combination of blaOXA-48/NDM-1 in seven (21.9%) isolates. Identical plasmids carrying blaOXA-48 were found in outbreak isolates sequenced with long-read sequencing technology.Whole genome sequencing of Slovenian carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates revealed multiple clusters of STs, two of which were involved in the first hospital outbreak of carbapenem producing K. pneumoniae in Slovenia. Transmission of the plasmid carrying blaOXA-48 between two STs was likely to have occurred. A previously unidentified second outbreak was also discovered, highlighting the importance of whole genome sequencing in detection and/or characterization of hospital outbreaks and surveillance of drug-resistant bacterial clones."

Methods We conducted an exploratory analysis of baseline data from the Reaching Married Adolescents Trial in Dosso region, Niger. We report counts and percents, by age group (13–14 years (VYA), 15–16 years, 17–19 years), of AGYW’s self-efficacy to use family planning (FP), accurate knowledge of FP, current use of modern FP, and unintended last pregnancy (UIP); lifetime reproductive coercion (RC), physical IPV, and sexual IPV; and gender equity attitudes. We also assess whether percents differ between VYA and older groups using Pearson’s Chi-Square and Fisher’s exact p-values. Results are stratified by parity. Finally, we use logistic regression to consider associations. Results There were 49 VYA, 248 girls aged 15–16, and 775 AGYW aged 17–19 in our sample (n = 1072). Accurate knowledge of FP, self-efficacy to use FP, current use of modern FP, and UIP increased with age; all percents between VYA and AGYW 17–19 were marginally or statistically significantly different. We also saw VYA report higher lifetime RC and sexual IPV versus older groups, with sexual IPV statistically different between VYA and girls 17–19. Parous VYA reported a significantly higher percent of lifetime RC versus older AGYW. Among 17–19 year-olds, odds of current use of FP were higher among AGYW who reported physical IPV, and odds of UIP were higher among those reporting more gender equitable attitudes, both adjusted for parity. Conclusions We observed differences in RH, RC, and sexual IPV among married VYA and older AGYW in rural Niger. VYA should be prioritized in research to confirm and further understand their RH needs."
https://openalex.org/W3015389868,"Background In the foreseeable future, patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with good healthcare access will all have been cured and the lost to follow-up (LFU) HCV-population will increasingly exist of hard-to-reach patients. Efforts to retrieve these individuals with HCV have been moderately successful so far. A deeper understanding of the reasons for loss to follow-up and the underlying processes is lacking. Aims To explore reasons for previous loss to follow-up in patients with HCV who have been brought back into care. Methods In 2017, fifteen patients with HCV who were evaluated at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) Infectious diseases outpatient clinic as part of the “REtrieval And cure of Chronic Hepatitis C” (REACH)-project were included in this study through convenience sampling. Face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted and a qualitative analysis based on the grounded theory was applied. Results A basic socio- psychological process named “maintaining the achieved balance” was uncovered in patients with HCV who were LFU. This “achieved balance” is the result of a transformative process following the initial HCV diagnosis. It is a steadfast stance in which participants keep HCV out of sight and in the margin of their lives in order to reestablish an optimal state of well-being. The balancing perspective is subsequently defended by repeated evasive behavioral patterns to avoid confrontation with the disease. Conclusion The balancing perspective gives insight into why individuals with HCV were not retained in care but also why they remained LFU thereafter. Physicians should realize that this mindset can be persistent and repeated efforts may be needed to finally trace and retrieve these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3015850203,"There is a growing body of evidence positioning targeted provider-initiated testing and counselling (tPITC, also known as index case testing) as a promising HIV case-finding and linkage strategy among children and adolescents. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of this strategy is limited by low HIV testing uptake and case detection rates. Despite this fact, there is very little literature on factors associated with HIV testing uptake, HIV seropositivity and ART-enrolment in tPITC implementation among African children. This study aims to bridge this information gap and contribute in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of tPITC among children and adolescents in Cameroon and beyond.In three ART clinics where tPITC was previously inexistent, we introduced the routine implementation of this strategy by inviting parents living with HIV/AIDS in care to have their biological children (6 weeks-19 years) HIV-tested. Children of consenting parents were HIV-tested; those testing positive were enrolled on ART. Parental and child-level characteristics associated with HIV testing uptake, seropositivity and ART-enrollment were assessed using bivariate and multivariate regression analysis at 5% significance level.We enrolled 1,236 parents, through whom 1,990 children/adolescents were recruited for HIV testing. Among enrolled parents, 46.2% (571/1,236) had at least one child tested, and 6.8% (39/571) of these parents had at least one HIV-positive child. Among enrolled children/adolescents, 56.7% (1,129/1,990) tested for HIV and 3.5% (40/1129) tested HIV-positive. Parental predictors of HIV testing uptake among children/adolescents were sex, occupation and duration on ART: female [aOR = 1.6 (1.1-2.5)], office workers/students [aOR = 2.0 (1.2-3.3)], and parents with ART duration > 5 years [aOR = 2.0 (1.3-2.9)] had significantly higher odds to test a child than male, farmers/traders, and parents with ART duration < 5 years respectively. The only child-level predictor of testing uptake was age: children < 18 months [aOR = 5(2-10)] had significantly higher odds to test for HIV than adolescents > 15 years. Parents of children identified as HIV-positive were more likely to be female, aged 40-60 years, farmers/traders, widows/divorcees and not on ART. Children found HIV-positive and who were ART-enrolled were more likely to be female and aged 5-9 years. However, none of the above-mentioned associations was statistically significant.Parents who were male, farmers/traders, and on ART for ≤ 5 years were less likely to test their children for HIV. Also, adolescents 10-19 years old were less likely to be tested. Therefore, these groups should be targeted with intensive counseling and follow-up to facilitate optimal testing uptake. No association was found between parental or child-level characteristics and HIV seropositivity among tested children. This finding prompts for further research to investigate approaches to better identify and target HIV testing to children/adolescents with the highest likelihood of HIV seropositivity.Reg: CinicalTrials.gov # NCT03024762."
https://openalex.org/W3016198489,"Due to the assumption that the VMD technique is essentially a set of adaptive Wiener filter banks and its performance depends to a large extent on the preset parameter K (the number of decomposition). A new method named resonance-based sparse adaptive variational mode decomposition (RSAVMD) is proposed for the decomposition of planetary gearbox vibration signals. Tunable Q-Factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) and morphological component analysis (MCA) are introduced to decompose the original signal into high and low resonance components. High resonance components containing planetary gearbox signals are screened for analysis. At the same time, Quality factor is used to select the number of Variational mode decomposition (VMD) adaptively. This method was applied in fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox. Compared with VMD, RASVMD could extract fault characteristic frequency of planetary gearbox accurately, but VMD lost part of fault information, showing the superiority of RSAVMD. Simultaneously, the selection method of VMD decomposition number in literature was cited, and it was found that the decomposition number selected by the method in this paper was more accurate."
https://openalex.org/W3015526340,"Population assessments conducted at reproductive sites of migratory species necessitate understanding the foraging-area origins of breeding individuals. Without this information, efforts to contextualize changes in breeding populations and develop effective management strategies are compromised. We used stable isotope analysis of tissue samples collected from loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at seven sites in the Northern Recovery Unit (NRU) of the eastern United States (North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia) to assign females to three separate foraging areas in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). We found that the majority of the females at NRU nesting sites (84.4%) use more northern foraging areas in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, while fewer females use more proximate foraging areas in the South Atlantic Bight (13.4%) and more southerly foraging areas in the Subtropical Northwest Atlantic (2.2%). We did not find significant latitudinal or temporal trends in the proportions of NRU females originating from different foraging areas. Combining these findings with previous data from stable isotope and satellite tracking studies across NWA nesting sites showed that variation in the proportion of adult loggerheads originating from different foraging areas is primarily related differences between recovery units: individuals in the NRU primarily use the Mid-Atlantic Bight foraging area, while individuals from the three Florida recovery units primarily use the Subtropical Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Gulf of Mexico foraging areas. Because each foraging area is associated with its own distinct ecological characteristics, environmental fluctuations and anthropogenic threats that affect the abundance and productivity of individuals at nesting sites, this information is critical for accurately evaluating population trends and developing effective region-specific management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3016004232,"Research article abstracts often convince readers that the article is worth reading. Therefore, they rely not only on the quality of arguments or novelty of findings to persuade readers but also linguistic markers in the form of metadiscourse to assert a position on an issue, increase readability of a text, engage readers, and avoid objection to the writer's interpretations, thereby enhancing the credibility of the text. Given that research article abstracts are often published online and their newsworthiness would affect whether they would be ultimately read, Altmetric.com, which emerged in 2010, can help quantify the popularity of research article abstracts by counting views on social media and other platforms such as news and policy documents. Yet a study on how metadiscoursal devices are used to persuade readers, and how they are correlated with Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) provided by Altmetric.com, merits attention. In our study, we examined 241 abstracts from 50 top journals in 12 disciplines with the highest AAS from 2014-2018 and performed a quantitative analysis of the interactive and interactional metadiscourse markers exhibited in the abstracts. Overall, we found a positive correlation between the use of metadiscourse and AAS. Furthermore, we noticed that each discipline used distinct metadiscourse markers in abstracts with high AAS, which contributed to its respective discipline-specific conventions. It has been previously shown that the use of an array of interactive and interactional metadiscourse renders the abstract more worthy of attention. Being knowledgeable of rhetorical choices in relation to metadiscoursal devices will enable writers to construct more persuasive abstracts by making informed judgments about the appropriate use of metadiscourse to draw the attention of readers in their respective disciplines."

This study aimed to clarify the neural influence of autobiographical memory related to the parent-child relationship on psychological health in adulthood. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment using a childhood memory recollection task, in which they appraised the emotion a parent would have provided in a given situation. Whole-brain univariate and psychophysiological interaction analyses were performed. Neuroimaging results indicated notable involvement of the caudal anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus in autobiographical memory related to the parent-child relationship, and their activities were closely associated with the level of depression and self-esteem, respectively. The functional connectivity results indicated increased connectivity between the caudal anterior cingulate cortex and fusiform gyrus for the father-positive condition compared to the mother-positive condition and there was a positive correlation between the strength of connectivity between the two regions and the anxiety level. Our findings suggest the processing of negative affect and the personalness of autobiographical memories are distinctly engaged depending on the parent in question and the situational valence. The present study illuminates the impact of autobiographical memory processes on various dimensions of psychological health."
https://openalex.org/W3015679467,"Accurate visual tracking is a challenging issue in computer vision. Correlation filter (CF) based methods are sought in visual tracking based on their efficiency and high performance. Nonetheless, CF-based trackers are sensitive to partial occlusion, which may reduce their overall performance and even lead to failure in tracking challenge. In this paper, we presented a very powerful tracker based on the kernelized correlation filter tracker (KCF). Firstly, we employ an intelligent multi-part tracking algorithm to improve the overall capability of correlation filter based tracker, especially in partial-occlusion challenges. Secondly, to cope with the problem of scale variation, we employ an effective scale adaptive scheme, which divided the target into four patches and computed the scale factor by finding the maximum response position of each patch via kernelized correlation filter. With this method, the scale computation was transformed into locating the centers of the patches. Thirdly, because the small deviation of the central function value will bring the problem of location ambiguity. To solve this problem, the new Gaussian kernel functions are introduced in this paper. Experiments on the default 51 video sequences in Visual Tracker Benchmark demonstrate that our proposed tracker provides significant improvement compared with the state-of-art trackers."

Methods We used secondary data for the IEQ scores of Canadian patients with acute WAD. In Japan, we collected data from 85 consecutively enrolled patients with acute WAD, and their treatment terms were collected; these referred to the number of days between the date of injury and the closure date of the insurance claim and the number of treatment visits. Before treatment, the Numeric Rating Scale, Neck Disability Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, IEQ, and Euro Quality of Life five-dimensional questionnaire were administered. The variables were subjected to multivariate analysis with each treatment term. Results The IEQ scores were higher in Japan than in Canada. Through multiple regression analysis, IEQ scores were independently correlated with treatment terms. The optimal cutoff point of the IEQ scores for a prolonged treatment term was 21 and 22 points, respectively. Conclusions The IEQ scores were associated with treatment terms in patients with acute WAD in Japan."

Here, we analyze the range of dynamics of this hinge dimer with the aim of proposing new applications for the DNA-encodable peptide and establishing guidelines for the computational analysis of other disulfide hinges. A recent structural analysis based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ion mobility spectrometry revealed an averaged conformation in the hinge region which motivated us to investigate the dynamic behavior using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation, metadynamics and free energy surface analysis to characterize the conformational space available to the hinge. Principal component analysis uncovered two slow modes of the peptide, namely, the opening and closing motion and twisting of the two β-hairpins assembling the hinge. Applying a collective variable (CV) that mimics the first dominating mode, led to a major expansion of the conformational space. The description of the dynamics could be achieved by analysis of the opening angle and the twisting of the β-hairpins and, thus, offers a methodology that can also be transferred to other derivatives. It has been demonstrated that the hinge peptide's lowest energy conformation consists of a large opening angle and strong twist but is separated by small energy barriers and can, thus, adopt a closed and untwisted structure. With the aim of proposing further applications for the hinge peptide, we simulated its behavior in the sterically congested environment of a four-helix bundle. Preliminary investigations show that one helix is pushed out and a three-helix bundle forms. The insights gained into the dynamics of the tetra-disulfide peptide and analytical guidelines developed in this study may contribute to the understanding of the structure and function of more complex hinge-type proteins, such as the IgG antibody family."
https://openalex.org/W3015402578,"The aim of this study was to investigate if the treatment outcomes of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in patients with advanced-stage skin head and neck melanoma (HNM) differs from outcomes in patients with non-HNM.A retrospective cohort study of patients with unresectable AJCC stage III and stage IV, who received CPI between 2010 and 2017.Overall, 122 unresectable AJCC stage III and metastatic stage IV melanoma adult patients were treated with CPI during the study period (consecutive patients). The HNM group of patients was comparable with limbs and trunk melanoma group except different distant metastatic (M1a/b/c/d) pattern (p = 0.025).Comparison of overall survival and clinical response to CPI in patients with advanced-stage skin melanoma of the head and neck with non-HNM.We analyzed 38 patients with melanoma arising in the head and neck skin regions, 33 with melanoma of limbs and 51 with trunk melanoma. Most of the head and neck patients were men (89.5%), the average age of melanoma diagnosis was 61.4±16.7 years (range 16.4-85.6). More than a third of HNM group of patients (36.8%) were 70 years and older. Overall response rate (ORR) to CPI was 50% (CR 31.6% and PR 18.4%) in the head and neck study group of patients, compared to an ORR of 36.3% and 23.5% in melanoma of the limbs and of the trunk, respectively (p = 0.03). The median overall survival of HNM group of patients was 60.2±6.3 months, CI 95% [47.7-72.7], 63% were alive at 30 months, reaching a plateau. Whereas, the median survival time of limbs and trunk melanoma were 51.2 and 53.4 months, which did not reach significance.Response rate to CPI is significantly improved in patients with melanoma of the head and neck and they have a trend towards improved, long standing, overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W3016211365,"A common evolutionary trend in highly selfing plants is the evolution of the “selfing syndrome”, in which traits associated with pollinator attraction are lost or greatly reduced. Limited information is available on whether these trait reductions are favored by natural selection or result from reduced purifying selection coupled with genetic drift. This study attempted to distinguish between these two possibilities for the evolutionary loss of floral pigmentation in the highly selfing species Ipomoea lacunosa. This study also tested the hypothesis that loss of floral pigmentation is caused by downregulation or loss of function in a tissue-specific anthocyanin transcription factor, as has been found in other plants. F2 individuals of a cross between white and pigmented individuals revealed segregation at two epistatically acting loci: one affecting pigmentation in both corolla throat and limbs (Anl1) and one affecting limb pigmentation (Anl2). Individuals that are homozygous for the “white” allele at Anl1 have white throats and limbs regardless of genotype at Anl2. In individuals with pigmented throats, homozygosity of the “white” allele at Anl2 produces white limbs. Flower color variation at Anl1 cosegregates with an R2R3-Myb anthocyanin transcription factor, which is down-regulated in white-flowers but not in pigmented flowers. Differential expression of the two alleles of this gene indicates that down regulation is caused by a cis-regulatory change. Finally, allele-frequency differences at Anl1 were substantially and significantly greater than differences in allele frequencies at four microsatellite loci. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that the identified R2R3-Myb gene corresponds to Anl1 and that evolutionary loss of pigmentation in I. lacunosa was caused by selection. They are also consistent with previous studies demonstrating that loss of floral pigmentation is usually caused by down-regulation or functional inactivation of an R2R3-Myb gene."
https://openalex.org/W3015439762,"While prediction errors have been established to instigate learning through model adaptation, recent studies have stressed the role of model-compliant events in predictive processing. Specifically, probabilistic information at critical points in time (so-called checkpoints) has been suggested to be sampled in order to evaluate the internal model, particularly in uncertain contexts. This way, initial model-based expectations are iteratively reaffirmed under uncertainty, even in the absence of prediction errors. Using electroencephalography (EEG), the present study aimed to investigate the interplay of such global uncertainty information and local adjustment cues prompting on-line adjustments of expectations. Within a stream of single digits, participants were to detect ordered sequences (i.e., 3-4-5-6-7) that had a regular length of five digits and were occasionally extended to seven digits. Over time, these extensions were either rare (low irreducible uncertainty) or frequent (high uncertainty) and could be unexpected or indicated by incidental colour cues. Accounting for cue information, an N400 component was revealed as the correlate of locally unexpected (vs expected) outcomes, reflecting effortful integration of incongruous information. As for model-compliant information, multivariate pattern decoding within the P3b time frame demonstrated effective exploitation of local (adjustment cues vs non-informative analogues) and global information (high vs low uncertainty regular endings) sampled from probabilistic events. Finally, superior fit of a global model (disregarding local adjustments) compared to a local model (including local adjustments) in a representational similarity analysis underscored the precedence of global reference frames in hierarchical predictive processing. Overall, results suggest that just like error-induced model adaptation, model evaluation is not limited to either local or global information. Following the hierarchical organisation of predictive processing, model evaluation too can occur at several levels of the processing hierarchy."
