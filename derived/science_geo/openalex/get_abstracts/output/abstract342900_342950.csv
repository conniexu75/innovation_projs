https://openalex.org/W2074071059,"A method for confining electrons to artificial structures at the nanometer lengthscale is presented. Surface state electrons on a copper(111) surface were confined to closed structures (corrals) defined by barriers built from iron adatoms. The barriers were assembled by individually positioning iron adatoms with the tip of a 4-kelvin scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A circular corral of radius 71.3 A was constructed in this way out of 48 iron adatoms. Tunneling spectroscopy performed inside of the corral revealed a series of discrete resonances, providing evidence for size quantization. STM images show that the corral's interior local density of states is dominated by the eigenstate density expected for an electron trapped in a round two-dimensional box."

Although the components of the fruitcase are present in maize, their development is disrupted so that the kernels are not encased as in teosinte but exposed on the ear. The change from encased to exposed kernels represents a key step in maize evolution. The locus that largely controls this morphological difference between maize and teosinte, teosinte glume architecture 1, is described and genetically mapped."
https://openalex.org/W2025357842,"A strong heliospheric radio emission event has been detected by Voyagers 1 and 2 in the frequency range of 2 to 3 kilohertz. This event started in July 1992 and is believed to have been generated at or near the heliopause by an interplanetary shock that originated during a period of intense solar activity in late May and early June 1991. This shock produced large plasma disturbances and decreases in cosmic ray intensity at Earth, Pioneers 10 and 11, and Voyagers 1 and 2. The average propagation speed estimated from these effects is 600 to 800 kilometers per second. After correction for the expected decrease in the shock speed in the outer heliosphere, the distance to the heliopause is estimated to be between 116 and 177 astronomical units."
https://openalex.org/W1981410988,"Of the processes for converting natural gas into a more useful chemical feedstock, the oxidative coupling of methane to form ethane and ethylene (C2) has perhaps been the most intensively investigated in recent years, but it has proved extremely difficult to obtain C2 yields in excess of 20 to 25%. Methane oxidative coupling was carried out in a separative chemical reactor that simulated a countercurrent chromatographic moving-bed. This reaction gives 65% methane conversion, 80% C2 selectivity, and a C2 yield slightly better than 50% with Sm2O3 catalyst at ∼1000 K."
https://openalex.org/W2029838360,"When the production of cloud condensation nuclei in the stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer is low enough, droplet collisions can reduce concentrations of cloud droplet numbers to extremely low values. At low droplet concentrations a cloud layer can become so optically thin that cloud-top radiative cooling cannot drive vertical mixing. Under these conditions, model simulations indicate that the stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer collapses to a shallow fog layer. Through this mechanism, marine stratiform clouds may limit their own lifetimes."
https://openalex.org/W2095214632,"A method for calculating light scattering by irregular randomly oriented particles yields results that are in good agreement with experimental data. The method is based on the assumption that surface waves are present in scattering by spherical particles, but they are absent in scattering by irregular particles."
https://openalex.org/W2057848329,"The orientational capabilities of caged migratory indigo buntings were studied under differing magnetic field conditions. When tested in a situation allowing minimal exposure to visual cues but in the presence of the normal geomagnetic field, the birds demonstrated a significant orientation in the appropriate migratory direction (to the north). When the horizontal component of the magnetic field was deflected clockwise 120 degrees by activation of Helmholtz coils surrounding the cage, the orientation of the buntings shifted accordingly (clockwise to geographic east-southeast). These results suggest that indigo buntings are not only able to detect the geomagnetic field, but also can use this information in the finalization of their migratory direction."
https://openalex.org/W2063722368,"X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of Fe2+ in Fe2SiO4 liquid at 1575 kelvin and 10-4 gigapascal (1 bar) shows that the Fe2+ -O bond length is 1.98 ± 0.02 angstroms compared with ≈2.22 angstroms in crystalline Fe2SiO4 (fayalite) at the melting point (1478 kelvin), which indicates a decrease in average Fe2+ coordination number from six in fayalite to four in the liquid. Anharmonicity in the liquid was accounted for using a data analysis procedure. This reduction in coordination number is similar to that observed on the melting of certain ionic salts. These results are used to develop a model of the medium-range structural environment of Fe2+ in olivine-composition melts, which helps explain some of the properties of Fe2SiO4 liquid, including density, viscosity, and the partitioning of iron and nickel between silicate melts and crystalline olivines. Some of the implications of this model for silicate melts in the Earth's crust and mantle are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2069491975,Hooked epidermal appendages (trichomes) on leaves of field bean cultivars effectively capture nymph and adult leafhoppers. Frequency of capture and capture mortality are highly correlated with trichome density. Hooked trichomes inserted at angles less than 30 degrees are ineffective in capture.
https://openalex.org/W2044873789,Three species of coastal Namib Desert tenebrionid beetles (Lepidochora) build trenches on desert sand dunes. Trenches are constructed perpendicular to fog winds and concentrate moisture during fogs. The beetles return along the ridges of the trenches extracting water from them. The water content of a population of these beetles increased by 13.9 percent during one fog.
https://openalex.org/W2076219641,"Observations made with the x-ray satellite ROSAT (Roentgen Satellite) have produced the first spatially resolved x-ray image of a corona around a star like our sun. The star is the secondary in the eclipsing binary system alpha Coronae Borealis (CrB), which consists of one star of spectral type A0V and one of type G5V. The x-ray light curve of alpha CrB shows a total x-ray eclipse during secondary optical minimum, with the G star behind the A star. The totality of the eclipse demonstrates that the A-type component in alpha CrB is x-ray dark and that the x-ray flux arises exclusively from the later-type companion. The x-ray eclipse ingress and egress are highly asymmetric compared with the optical eclipse, indicating a highly asymmetric x-ray intensity distribution on the surface of the G star. From a detailed modeling of the ingress and egress of the x-ray light curve, an eclipse map of the G star was constructed by a method based on an optimization by simulated annealing."

https://openalex.org/W2085682261,"In several places in Southern California bituminous sediments of the Monterey Formation-siliceous shales, phosphatic rocks, dolomites, and arkoses-were affected during the Pleistocene and as late as the l9th century by spontaneous subsurface combustion of organic matter, during which temperatures up to 1600 degrees C were reached. This oxidative heating (combustion metamorphism) affected rock complexes over areas of tens of square kilometers that tend to occur in clusters. As a result of these processes, the rocks recrystallized and partially melted to form pseudomagmas which intruded the country rocks. The chemical compositions of these melts differ from those of igneous magmas. Acid and intermediate siliceous melts as well as phosphatic melts have formed. These two types are generally immiscible. The following high-temperature minerals were determined: alpha- and beta-cristobalite, quartz, calcic plagioclase, diopsidic pyroxene, wollastonite, cordierite, graphite, fluorapatite, and fluorite; at lower temperature pyrite, gypsum, aragonite, calcite, jarosite, and hexahydrite crystallized."

R D and testing programs budgets have been reduced and personnel number about half that of 1986. Some scientists will take early retirement, some will move to other projects, and some will continue to do nuclear weapons design without testing."

https://openalex.org/W2077803751,"Deep in the dense cores of collapsed stars even atoms don't survive. The force of gravity crushes them into particle mushes weighing megatons per teaspoon. But even these alien forms of matter don't hold a candle to another possible end product of a collapsing star: something physicists justifiably call strange matter. This strangeness comes from an exotic particle not associated with ordinary matter: the strange quark. It belongs to a six-member quark family, along with up, down, charm, top, and bottom, each of which carries a different combination of charge and mass. The only ones that make up matter as we know it are up and down quarks, but in theory, matter could form out of strange quarks as well. In nature, it would turn up most probably in interiors of collapsed stars. Scientists originally imagined strange matter as a sort of disorganized mixed bag of strange quarks, but this summer a group proposed that the quarks could form a sort of mutant atomic nucleus that could conceivably grow to the size of a star. For the moment this is speculation, but it may not be theoretical musing for long. Physicists are preparing to try making strange matter here onmore » Earth, in experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and Switzerland's CERN, next summer.« less"
