https://openalex.org/W2137372170,"Mangrove species are uniquely adapted to tropical and subtropical coasts, and although relatively low in number of species, mangrove forests provide at least US $1.6 billion each year in ecosystem services and support coastal livelihoods worldwide. Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16%) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40% of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced."
https://openalex.org/W2157535100,"The prospect of finding epigenetic risk factors for complex diseases would be greatly enhanced if DNA from existing biobanks, which is generally extracted from whole blood, could be used to perform epigenetic association studies. We characterized features of DNA methylation at 16 candidate loci, 8 of which were imprinted, in DNA samples from the Netherlands Twin Register biobank. Except for unmethylated or fully methylated sites, CpG methylation varied considerably in a sample of 30 unrelated individuals. This variation remained after accounting for the cellular heterogeneity of blood. Methylation of CpG sites was correlated within loci and, for 4 imprinted loci, across chromosomes. In 34 additional individuals, we investigated the DNA methylation of 8 representative loci in 2 longitudinal blood and 2 longitudinal buccal cell samples (follow-up 11-20 and 2-8 yr, respectively). Five of 8 loci were stable over time (rho>0.75) in both tissues, indicating that prospective epigenetic studies may be possible. For 4 loci, the DNA methylation in blood (mesoderm) correlated with that in the buccal cells (ectoderm) (rho>0.75). Our data suggest that epigenetic studies on complex diseases may be feasible for a proportion of genomic loci provided that they are carefully designed."
https://openalex.org/W1976358161,"Recognition by macrophages is a key process in generating immune response against invading pathogens. Previous studies have focused on recognition of pathogens through surface receptors present on the macrophage's surface. Here, using polymeric particles of different geometries that represent the size and shape range of a variety of bacteria, the importance of target geometry in recognition was investigated. The studies reported here reveal that attachment of particles of different geometries to macrophages exhibits a strong dependence on size and shape. For all sizes and shapes studied, particles possessing the longest dimension in the range of 2–3 µm exhibited highest attachment. This also happens to be the size range of most commonly found bacteria in nature. The surface features of macrophages, in particular the membrane ruffles, might play an important role in this geometry-based target recognition by macrophages. These findings have significant implications in understanding the pathogenicity of bacteria and in designing drug delivery carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2113183122,"Sirtuinl (SIRT1) deacetylase levels are decreased in chronic inflammatory conditions and aging where oxidative stress occurs. We determined the mechanism of SIRT1 redox post-translational modifications leading to its degradation. Human lung epithelial cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (150–250 µM), aldehyde-acrolein (10–30 µM), and cigarette smoke extract (CSE;0.1–1.5%) in the presence of intracellular glutathione-modulating agents at 1–24 h, and oxidative post-translational modifications were assayed in cells, as well as in lungs of mice lacking and overexpressing glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx1), and wild-type (WT) mice in response to cigarette smoke (CS). CSE and aldehydes dose and time dependently decreased SIRT1 protein levels, with EC50 of 1% for CSE and 30 µM for acrolein at 6 h, and >80% inhibition at 24 h with CSE, which was regulated by modulation of intracellular thiol status of the cells. CS decreased the lung levels of SIRT1 in WT mice, which was enhanced by deficiency of Glrx1 and prevented by overexpression of Glrx1. Oxidants, aldehydes, and CS induced carbonyl modifications on SIRT1 on cysteine residues concomitant with decreased SIRT1 activity. Proteomics studies revealed alkylation of cysteine residue on SIRT1. Our data suggest that oxidants/aldehydes covalently modify SIRT1, decreasing enzymatic activity and marking the protein for proteasomal degradation, which has implications in inflammatory conditions.—Caito, S., Rajendrasozhan, S., Cook, S., Chung, S., Yao, H., Friedman, A.

https://openalex.org/W1989663044,"Sex differences in methylation status have been observed in specific gene-disease studies and healthy methylation variation studies, but little work has been done to study the impact of sex on methylation at the genome wide locus-to-locus level or to determine methods for accounting for sex in genomic association studies. In this study we investigate the genomic sex effect on saliva DNA methylation of 197 subjects (54 females) using 20,493 CpG sites. Three methods, two-sample T-test, principle component analysis and independent component analysis, all successfully identify sex influences. The results show that sex not only influences the methylation of genes in the X chromosome but also in autosomes. 580 autosomal sites show strong differences between males and females. They are found to be highly involved in eight functional groups, including DNA transcription, RNA splicing, membrane, etc. Equally important is that we identify some methylation sites associated with not only sex, but also other phenotypes (age, smoking and drinking level, and cancer). Verification was done through an independent blood cell DNA methylation data (1298 CpG sites from a cancer panel array). The same genomic site-specific influence pattern and potential confounding effects with cancer were observed. The overlapping rate of identified sex affected genes between saliva and blood cell is 81% for X chromosome, and 8% for autosomes. Therefore, correction for sex is necessary. We propose a simple correction method based on independent component analysis, which is a data driven method and accommodates sample differences. Comparison before and after the correction suggests that the method is able to effectively remove the potentially confounding effects of sex, and leave other phenotypes untouched. As such, our method is able to disentangle the sex influence on a genome wide level, and paves the way to achieve more accurate association analyses in genome wide methylation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2018901651,"Recently, metagenomic studies have identified viable Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant virus, in the stool of healthy subjects. However, its source and role as pathogen have not been determined.21 commercialized food products containing peppers, 357 stool samples from 304 adults and 208 stool samples from 137 children were tested for PMMoV using real-time PCR, sequencing, and electron microscopy. Anti-PMMoV IgM antibody testing was concurrently performed. A case-control study tested the association of biological and clinical symptoms with the presence of PMMoV in the stool. Twelve (57%) food products were positive for PMMoV RNA sequencing. Stool samples from twenty-two (7.2%) adults and one child (0.7%) were positive for PMMoV by real-time PCR. Positive cases were significantly more likely to have been sampled in Dermatology Units (p<10(-6)), to be seropositive for anti-PMMoV IgM antibodies (p = 0.026) and to be patients who exhibited fever, abdominal pains, and pruritus (p = 0.045, 0.038 and 0.046, respectively).Our study identified a local source of PMMoV and linked the presence of PMMoV RNA in stool with a specific immune response and clinical symptoms. Although clinical symptoms may be imputable to another cofactor, including spicy food, our data suggest the possibility of a direct or indirect pathogenic role of plant viruses in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2002185586,"Uniform sampling from graphical realizations of a given degree sequence is a fundamental component in simulation-based measurements of network observables, with applications ranging from epidemics, through social networks to Internet modeling. Existing graph sampling methods are either link-swap based (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) or stub-matching based (the Configuration Model). Both types are ill-controlled, with typically unknown mixing times for link-swap methods and uncontrolled rejections for the Configuration Model. Here we propose an efficient, polynomial time algorithm that generates statistically independent graph samples with a given, arbitrary, degree sequence. The algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or, alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections. Using a central limit theorem-based reasoning, we argue, that for large N, and for degree sequences admitting many realizations, the sample weights are expected to have a lognormal distribution. As examples, we apply our algorithm to generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and from binomial distributions."
https://openalex.org/W1984169555,"The presence of micronuclei in mammalian cells is related to several mutagenetic stresses. In order to understand how micronuclei emerge, behave in cells, and affect cell fate, we performed extensive time-lapse microscopy of HeLa H2B-GFP cells in the presence of hydroxyurea at low concentration. Micronuclei formed after mitosis from lagging chromatids or chromatin bridges between anaphase chromosomes and were stably maintained in the cells for up to one cell cycle. Nuclear buds also formed from chromatin bridges or during interphase. If the micronuclei-bearing cells entered mitosis, they either produced daughter cells without micronuclei or, more frequently, produced cells with additional micronuclei. Low concentrations of hydroxyurea efficiently induced multipolar mitosis, which generated lagging chromatids or chromatin bridges, and also generated multinuclear cells that were tightly linked to apoptosis. We found that the presence of micronuclei is related to apoptosis but not to multipolar mitosis. Furthermore, the structural heterogeneity among micronuclei, with respect to chromatin condensation or the presence of lamin B, derived from the mechanism of micronuclei formation. Our study reinforces the notion that micronucleation has important implications in the genomic plasticity of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2103102045,"Cells use redox signaling to adapt to oxidative stress. For instance, certain transcription factors exist in a latent state that may be disrupted by oxidative modifications that activate their transcription potential. We hypothesized that DNA-binding sites (response elements) for redox-sensitive transcription factors may also exist in a latent state, maintained by co-repressor complexes containing class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, and that HDAC inactivation by oxidative stress may antagonize deacetylase activity and unmask electrophile-response elements, thus activating transcription. Electrophiles suitable to test this hypothesis include reactive carbonyl species, often derived from peroxidation of arachidonic acid. We report that α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, e.g. the cyclopentenone prostaglandin, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), alkylate (carbonylate), a subset of class I HDACs including HDAC1, -2, and -3, but not HDAC8. Covalent modification at two conserved cysteine residues, corresponding to Cys261 and Cys273 in HDAC1, coincided with attenuation of histone deacetylase activity, changes in histone H3 and H4 acetylation patterns, derepression of a LEF1·β-catenin model system, and transcription of HDAC-repressed genes, e.g. heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Gadd45, and HSP70. Identification of particular class I HDACs as components of the redox/electrophile-responsive proteome offers a basis for understanding how cells stratify their responses to varying degrees of pathophysiological oxidative stress associated with inflammation, cancer, and metabolic syndrome.

Identification of particular class I HDACs as components of the redox/electrophile-responsive proteome offers a basis for understanding how cells stratify their responses to varying degrees of pathophysiological oxidative stress associated with inflammation, cancer, and metabolic syndrome. Cellular oxidative stress can vary widely in severity and scope. Consequently, redox signaling must accommodate physiological demands from respiration, metabolism, host defense, cell replication, and aging plus demands from pathological oxidative stress encountered during inflammation, malignancy, reperfusion injury, and metabolic syndrome. Stimulus-response coupling in these different situations must be properly stratified; otherwise, maladaptation can have grave outcomes. An insufficient response to oxidative stress can lead to cell death, which typifies many neurodegenerative diseases. An excessive response to oxidative stress can lead to hypertrophy, hyperplasia, or neoplasia (1Medzhitov R. Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). Phenotypic adaptation to oxidative stress derives, in part, from the expression of genes to protect cells from damage, to repair damage, and to bolster their survival. This involves cellular proteins collectively termed the redox/electrophile-responsive proteome (2Stamatakis K. Pérez-Sala D. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1091: 548-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Oh J.Y. Giles N. Landar A. Darley-Usmar V. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These proteins vary widely in cellular localization and functionality, but all have cysteine residues with distinctively nucleophilic thiols (pKa ≤ 5), which are readily oxidized to sulfenic/sulfinic acids by reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesRCSreactive carbonyl speciesPGprostaglandin15d-PGJ215-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ215d-PGJ2-B15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2-biotinHDAChistone deacetylase4HNE4-hydroxy-2-nonenalSTFSuperTOPflash®TSAtrichostatin AWTwild typeFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineLEFlymphoid enhancer factorTCFT-cell factor. or readily alkylated by reactive carbonyl species (RCS) (4Suzuki M.

Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). RCS originate from either non-enzymatic or enzymatic peroxidation of lipids (especially arachidonic acid), which generates α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (enals) (e.g. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), crotonaldehyde, acrolein) and α,β-unsaturated ketones (enone) (e.g. cyclopentenone prostaglandins). Post-translational covalent modification of cysteinyl thiols by RCS has been termed “carbonylation” (6Grimsrud P.A. Xie H. Griffin T.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol.

Overall, we have a rudimentary understanding of how ROS and RCS integrate the actions of membrane and cytosolic proteins to govern redox-responsive transcription. By contrast, we know very little about the actions of RCS on nuclear proteins and processes beyond the investigations of Narumiya et al. (13Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar, 14Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fujiwara M. Fukushima M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 506-511PubMed Google Scholar, 15Narumiya S. Fukushima M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 500-505PubMed Google Scholar), who first reported that cyclopentenone prostaglandins concentrated within the nucleus of cells via irreversible binding to unidentified nuclear and chromatin-associated proteins. The findings by Narumiya et al. (13Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar, 14Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fujiwara M. Fukushima M. J.

Ther. 1986; 239: 500-505PubMed Google Scholar) and the biological importance of proper stimulus-response coupling in cells exposed to oxidative stress prompted our hypothesis that regulation of redox-responsive transcription factors might coincide with redox regulation of proteins that alter chromatin dynamics. Prominent among these are histone deacetylases, which limit access to response elements on DNA within heterochromatin, thereby repressing gene expression. Mammalian class I HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8 are homologous to yeast RPD3 (16Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), reside in the nucleus, and may be incorporated into multiprotein gene repression complexes and co-repressor complexes such as mSin3a (17Hassig C.A.

Repression and derepression of the lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) family of transcriptional activators/inhibitors by the recruitment of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) typify this process (22Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar, 23Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We report that RCS covalently modified a subset of class I HDACs including HDAC1, -2, and -3 as well as the yeast homologue RPD3, but not HDAC8. Covalent modification of two conserved cysteines, Cys261 and Cys273 in HDAC1, occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner that led to attenuation of histone deacetylase, changes in histone H3 and H4 acetylation patterns, derepression of LEF1·β-catenin transactivation, and activation of RCS-sensitive genes repressed by HDACs. Our results imply that HDAC1, -2, and -3 isoenzymes are components of a redox/electrophile-responsive proteome that governs redox signaling in eukaryotes. Our data also suggest a mechanism by which cells might stratify their responses and adapt to varying intensities of oxidative stress and may explain, in part, how maladaptation can influence the etiology of cancer, atherosclerosis, or other chronic diseases. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins including biotinylated derivatives, 4HNE, and HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). NeutrAvidin agarose resin was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Primary antibodies for HDAC1 (H3284), HDAC2 (H3159), HDAC8 (H8038), and FLAG-M2 (F3165) as well as the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate were all from Sigma. Anti-HDAC3 (ab47237) was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-acetyl-histone H3K14 (06-911), anti-Myc tag (05-724), and anti-acetyl-histone H4 (06-598) were all from Millipore (Billerica, MA).

Mammalian cell lysis buffer for biotin capture by NeutrAvidin pulldown as well as for histone acetylation assays contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, and 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and 1% Triton X-100. Yeast lysis buffer contains 12% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Reporter lysis buffer and luciferase assay system were from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein concentration from cell lysates was measured via Bradford analysis using the Bio-Rad protein assay solution (500-0006). All mammalian cell lines were propagated in medium containing penicillin and streptomycin and 2 mml-glutamine. SuperTOPflash® (STF) and STF3a (HEK293) cell lines were maintained in advanced Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and 2% FCS (HyClone); A549 cells were grown in F-12 medium with 10% FCS; HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI with 10% FCS; and HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FCS. Yeast cells were a gift from Dr. David Stillman, University of Utah (strain DY6092), grown in YP medium containing 2% glucose and at 30 °C. Adherent mammalian cell lines were grown to ∼90% confluency in 35-mm plates containing 1–2% serum. Cells were treated with biotinylated prostaglandins for the times and concentrations indicated. Following treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and harvested in 140 μl of lysis buffer. Cells are completely lysed with one freeze/thaw cycle, and cellular debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g. Between 100 and 200 μg of total protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of total volume of PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.4% Tween 20 and 40 μl of NeutrAvidin bead slurry to sequester biotinylated (protein·prostaglandin-biotin) proteins. Following incubation, beads were pelleted and washed four times with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.4% Tween 20. Proteins were released from beads by boiling in 25 μl of 1.5× Laemmli buffer containing 3.75% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min and assayed by Western immunoblot for individual HDACs. Histone acetylation was analyzed by Western blotting of 10 μg of total protein from whole cell lysates, separated on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells harboring stably inserted RPD3-Myc (strain DY6092) were treated with 15d-PGJ2-B at A600 of ∼0.30–0.35 in 10 ml of medium at 30 °C for the time indicated. Yeast were pelleted and lysed using 0.7-mm zirconia beads (Biospec Products, Inc.) in lysis buffer. RPD3-Myc·15d-PGJ2-B conjugates were precipitated from lysates with NeutrAvidin beads as above and assayed by immunoblot for Myc tag. Total histone H4 acetylation was assayed by separating 15 μg of total protein from whole cell lysates on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels followed by immunoblotting. MAD·LEF and MAD(Pro)·LEF chimeras, from Dr. Don Ayer, University of Utah School of Medicine, were prepared by cloning the first 105 bp of MAD upstream and in frame of full-length LEF1 (isoform 1) using EcoRI in expression vector pcDNA3.1. The MAD(Pro)·LEF mutant was prepared by mutating t35c (Leu12 to Pro12) and g46c (Ala16 to Pro16). We generated the Cys to Ser mutants of HDAC1-FLAG (from Eric Verdin, University of California San Francisco) via site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following forward primers and their reverse complement primers: C261S, 5′-CGGTGGTCTTACAGAGTGGCTCAGACTCC-3′; C273S, 5′-TATCTGGGGATCGGTTAGGTAGCTTCAATCTAACTATC-3′. We prepared 3H-acetylated histone substrate from RKO cells as described previously (24Sun J.M. Spencer V.A. Chen H.Y. Li L. Davie J.R. Methods. 2003; 31: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Radio-labeled histones (∼500 dpm/μg) were purified by acid extraction and dialysis (25Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and lyophilized before use. Inhibition of HDAC activity was measured by treating recombinant HDAC3·N-CoR1 (5 ng/μl) in 60 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mg/ml BSA) with vehicle, HDAC inhibitors TSA, sodium butyrate, or 15d-PGJ2-B and 4HNE for 15 min followed by the addition of 3H-acetylated histone substrate (15,000 dpm/reaction dissolved in distilled H2O) and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 10 μl of 10 n HCl/2.5 n acetic acid at 4 °C. Samples were extracted with 600 μl of ethyl acetate by vortexing for 10 s and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Released [3H]acetate was counted by adding 500 μl of the organic fraction to scintillation fluid. HDAC activity is measured as (counts (from test sample) (dpm) − counts (from vehicle control)(dpm))/((time (h)/volume of sample (ml)). STF cells grown to ∼60–70% confluency in 35-mm wells were treated with vehicle or 15d-PGJ2 (0–30 μm) in 2% FCS for 18 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cell debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g, and 20 μg of total protein was used in a luciferase assay system (Promega). Vehicle signal was normalized to a value of 1 luciferase count per second. STF3a cells (Dr. David Virshup, Duke NUS Graduate Medical School) were used as described (26McCulloch M.W. Coombs G.S. Banerjee N. Bugni T.S. Cannon K.M. Harper M.K. Veltri C.A. Virshup D.M. Ireland C.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2009; 17: 2189-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). STF3a cells (6 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 35-mm wells and grown overnight in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium. MAD·LEF and MAD(Pro)·LEF chimeras were transfected (2 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000) according to manufacturer's directions. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with vehicle, TSA (100 nm), butyrate (150 μm), 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm), Δ12-PGJ2 (10 μm), or 4HNE (10 μm) for 18 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, pH 7.4, and lysed in 125 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cell debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g, and 20 μg of total protein was used to measure luciferase activity (i.e. expression). Results, mean ± S.E. (n = 3–4) were normalized to a value of 100% in cells transfected with MAD(Pro)·LEF. A549 cells were grown to ∼70% confluency in 35-mm wells in antibiotic-free F-12 medium. HDAC1WT and HDAC1C261S/C273S plasmids were transfected (4 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000), and medium was changed to 10% FCS after 6 h according to the manufacturer's directions. After 24 h, medium was changed to 1% FCS, and cells were treated with either vehicle or 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm). After 1 h, FCS was added to the cells to 10%, and the cells were incubated for 23 h before harvesting. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's directions followed by on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer, and 2.5 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) with oligo(dT)18 primers. The cDNA (1 μl) was used directly for quantitative PCR using SYBR Green master mix (Roche Applied Science) and the following primer pairs: HO-1, 5′-GTCTTCGCCCCTGTCTACTTC-3′, 5′-CTGGGCAATCTTTTTGAGCAC-3′; Gadd45, 5′-GAGAGCAGAAGACCGAAAGGA-3′, 5′-CACAACACCACGTTATCGGG-3′; HSP70, 5′-GCATCGAGACTATCGCTAATGAG-3′, 5′-TGCAAGGTTAGATTTTTCTGCCT-3′; GAPDH, 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCG-3′, 5′-GGGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATA-3′; β-actin, 5′-TTCCTGGGCATGGAGTC-3′, 5′-CAGGTCTTTGCGGATGTC-3′. To investigate how RCS influence gene regulation via interaction with chromatin-associated proteins, we first tested whether HDACs are alkylated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins. PGD2 dehydrates spontaneously to form J-series enone and dienone prostaglandins (27Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1D), which can react with nucleophilic cysteinyl thiolates (28Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) found in transcription factors, e.g. NFκB (29Cernuda-Morollón E. Pineda-Molina E. Cañada F.J. Pérez-Sala D. J. Biol.

Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar). Hypothetically, any HDAC enzymes with redox-sensitive cysteinyl thiols should be prone to alkylation (carbonylation) by enones and enals. To test this hypothesis, we treated HEK293 cells with biotin analogs of 15d-PGJ2-B. The biotin epitope in PGJ congeners facilitates the isolation and identification of any cellular proteins they might alkylate (3Oh J.Y. Giles N. Landar A. Darley-Usmar V. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Wagner T.M. Mullally J.E. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol.

Immunoblot analysis showed that 5 μm 15d-PGJ2-B alkylated (carbonylated) cellular HDAC1, -2, and -3, but not -8. Formation of an HDAC·15d-PGJ2-B covalent adduct was detectable within 15 min; half-maximal by 30 min; and durable for longer than 180 min (Fig. 1, A and B, and data not shown). Alkylation of intracellular HDACs appears to prefer HDAC2 > HDAC1 > HDAC3; however, alkylation of HDAC8 was not detectable up to 6 h. We also tested the capability of PGD2-biotin, the precursor of 15d-PGJ2-B, in labeling cellular HDAC1. Similar to 15d-PGJ2-B, PGD2-biotin also accumulated HDAC1·PG-biotin adducts (supplemental Fig. 2), but ∼4-fold more slowly (supplemental Fig. 2). This kinetic difference derives from rate-limiting processes, such as dehydration of PGD2-biotin, which yields 15d-PGJ2-B as a terminal metabolite, and temperature-dependent transport of PGJ metabolites into the nucleus (14Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fujiwara M. Fukushima M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 506-511PubMed Google Scholar). PGD2, a prominent eicosanoid from mast cells (31Roberts 2nd, L.J. Sweetman B.J. Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and other hematopoietic cells, helps resolve acute inflammation via mechanisms that involve its transformation into PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2 (32Rajakariar R. Hilliard M. Lawrence T. Trivedi S. Colville-Nash P. Bellingan G. Fitzgerald D. Yaqoob M.M. Gilroy D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20979-20984Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Further investigations suggest that: 1) HDACs react with 15d-PGJ2-B (a bifunctional dienone) better than PGA1-biotin (a mono-functional enone), consistent with precedents (33Uchida K. Shibata T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Gayarre J. Stamatakis K. Renedo M. Pérez-Sala D. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5803-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1A); and 2) that a Michael adduct forms between an HDAC cysteinyl thiol and the electrophilic β-carbon of cyclopentenone PGs (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). Mammalian class I HDACs and yeast RPD3 have conserved Cys residues. Thus, some other members of this family, besides HDAC1, might be alkylated (carbonylated) by reactive carbonyl species. We found that 15d-PGJ2-B also alkylated RPD3, a class I HDAC homolog in S. cerevisiae (see Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. 1D). Alkylation of RPD3 and HDAC1, -2, and -3 was concentration-dependent from 1 to 10 μm 15d-PGJ2-B (see Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. 1D). Covalent modification of HDAC1, -2, and -3, but not HDAC8, occurred uniformly in several cell lines, e.g. HCT116, MCF7, A549, HL-60, and HEK293. Differential alkylation (carbonylation) of some, but not every class I HDAC, implies that their covalent modification is not indiscriminate and may involve particular, conserved cysteinyl thiol residues. Our data (Fig. 1) argue against the cysteine residues corresponding to Cys151 of HDAC1 because these catalytic cysteines are shared by all class I HDACs, including HDAC8. Protein sequence alignment revealed two other cysteine residues in HDAC1, -2, and -3 and RPD3 that we considered candidates for modification (Fig. 2A). These correspond to Cys261 and Cys273 residues of HDAC1, which appear to be surface-accessible, according to homology models (35Wang D.F. Helquist P. Wiech N.L. Wiest O. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6936-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Notably, HDAC8, which was not susceptible to alkylation by 15d-PGJ2-B, has a Leu substituted for Cys at one conserved position and a displaced Cys with a different flanking residue at the other conserved position. The motif surrounding Cys273 of HDAC1 shares appreciable homology with motifs surrounding Cys residues alkylated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins in other proteins, such as the T-loops of the IκB kinase β and LKB1 Ser/Thr kinases, h-Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and the p50 and p65 subunits of NFκB. To determine whether any of these cysteine residues reacted with 15d-PGJ2-B, we used site-directed mutagenesis of an HDAC1-FLAG construct to make Cys → Ser mutants, C261S and C273S. Plasmids expressing these HDAC1-FLAG mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells, which were subsequently treated with 5 μm 15d-PGJ2-B. When compared with the wild type HDAC1-FLAG, each of these single-mutant HDAC1-FLAG proteins formed ∼70% less covalent adduct with 15d-PGJ2-B (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). Each showed comparable alkylation, consistent with reaction at Cys261 and Cys273. An HDAC1-FLAG double-mutant, C261S/C273S, showed ∼95% less alkylation by 5 μm 15d-PGJ2-B (Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus lane 1), supporting the conclusion that both Cys261 and Cys273 are susceptible to alkylation (carbonylation) by α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. A corresponding set of Cys → Ala mutants gave similar results. There was a low but detectable formation of 15d-PGJ2-B adduct with the C261S/C273S HDAC1 double mutant, ∼5%, implying that other sites may be alkylated to a minor degree. To better understand the functional consequences of HDAC alkylation by RCS, we tested in vitro deacetylase activity of HDAC3·N-CoR1 treated with 4HNE, an enal that can be generated by oxidative stress (36Schneider C. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15539-15543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and 15d-PGJ2-B. Inhibition of the HDAC3·N-CoR1 complex by these RCS was concentration-dependent and intermediate in potency, relative to TSA and butyrate. Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) required 10 nm TSA, 13 μm 15d-PGJ2-B, 98 μm 4HNE, and 140 μm butyrate (Fig. 3). Maximal inhibition of HDAC3·N-CoR1 by 15d-PGJ2-B and 4HNE is 50 and 70%, respectively. The lack of complete inhibition upon alkylation suggests that inhibition of deacetylase activity is not likely the major consequence of HDAC alkylation yet implies that its modifiable thiolate residues are near the catalytic site or that they are allosterically linked to the catalytic site. Class I HDACs in co-repressor complexes play a major role in transcriptional silencing (18Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 37Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that alkylation and inhibition of HDACs by 15d-PGJ2 would antagonize their co-repressor function in HEK293 cells harboring an STF luciferase reporter with seven LEF/TCF-binding sites (38Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J. Cell. 2004; 116: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). LEF1 recruits HDAC1 as a co-repressor of transcription in this system. Others have reported that inhibition of HDAC1 by TSA relieves LEF1-mediated repression and converts it to a transcriptional activator (23Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). If 15d-PGJ2-B or other RCS inhibited HDAC1 in an analogous experiment, LEF1 would be similarly activated, leading to enhanced luciferase expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, luciferase expression rose 20–80-fold as a function of 15d-PGJ2 concentration in HEK293 cells stably expressing an STF reporter construct (Fig. 4A). To determine whether 15d-PGJ2, and related RCS, act independently of other, upstream WNT signaling events, we also used STF3a cells, a cell line that stably expresses both the STF luciferase reporter gene and the wnt3a gene. In these cells, constitutively secreted WNT3a binds to FRZL, its cognate receptor, leading to nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and transactivation of the STF luciferase reporter gene (26McCulloch M.W. Coombs G.S. Banerjee N. Bugni T.S. Cannon K.M. Harper M.K. Veltri C.A. Virshup D.M. Ireland C.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2009; 17: 2189-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In conjunction, we used plasmids expressing chimeric MAD·LEF1 genes. The MAD component of the chimera associates with mSin3a in a multiprotein complex that recruits HDAC1 as a co-repressor (Fig. 4C) (18Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E.

https://openalex.org/W2018246047,"Background Massively parallel sequencing systems continue to improve on data output, while leaving labor-intensive library preparations a potential bottleneck. Efforts are currently under way to relieve the crucial and time-consuming work to prepare DNA for high-throughput sequencing. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate an automated parallel library preparation protocol using generic carboxylic acid-coated superparamagnetic beads and polyethylene glycol precipitation as a reproducible and flexible method for DNA fragment length separation. With this approach the library preparation for DNA sequencing can easily be adjusted to a desired fragment length. The automated protocol, here demonstrated using the GS FLX Titanium instrument, was compared to the standard manual library preparation, showing higher yield, throughput and great reproducibility. In addition, 12 libraries were prepared and uniquely tagged in parallel, and the distribution of sequence reads between these indexed samples could be improved using quantitative PCR-assisted pooling. Conclusions/Significance We present a novel automated procedure that makes it possible to prepare 36 indexed libraries per person and day, which can be increased to up to 96 libraries processed simultaneously. The yield, speed and robust performance of the protocol constitute a substantial improvement to present manual methods, without the need of extensive equipment investments. The described procedure enables a considerable efficiency increase for small to midsize sequencing centers."

We examined the relationship between external reviewers' recommendations and the editorial outcome of manuscripts undergoing external peer-review at the Journal of General Internal Medicine (JGIM).We examined reviewer recommendations and editors' decisions at JGIM between 2004 and 2008. For manuscripts undergoing peer review, we calculated chance-corrected agreement among reviewers on recommendations to reject versus accept or revise. Using mixed effects logistic regression models, we estimated intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) at the reviewer and manuscript level. Finally, we examined the probability of rejection in relation to reviewer agreement and disagreement. The 2264 manuscripts sent for external review during the study period received 5881 reviews provided by 2916 reviewers; 28% of reviews recommended rejection. Chance corrected agreement (kappa statistic) on rejection among reviewers was 0.11 (p<.01). In mixed effects models adjusting for study year and manuscript type, the reviewer-level ICC was 0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.29) and the manuscript-level ICC was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.12-0.22). The editors' overall rejection rate was 48%: 88% when all reviewers for a manuscript agreed on rejection (7% of manuscripts) and 20% when all reviewers agreed that the manuscript should not be rejected (48% of manuscripts) (p<0.01).Reviewers at JGIM agreed on recommendations to reject vs. accept/revise at levels barely beyond chance, yet editors placed considerable weight on reviewers' recommendations. Efforts are needed to improve the reliability of the peer-review process while helping editors understand the limitations of reviewers' recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2078356850,"Background Regulation of intracellular trafficking is a central issue in cell biology. The forces acting on intracellular vesicles (endosomes) can be assessed in living cells by using a combination of active and passive microrheology. Methodology/Principal Findings This dual approach is based on endosome labeling with magnetic nanoparticles. The resulting magnetic endosomes act both as probes that can be manipulated with external magnetic fields to infer the viscoelastic modulus of their surrounding microenvironment, and as biological vehicles that are trafficked along the microtubule network by means of forces generated by molecular motors. The intracellular viscoelastic modulus exhibits power law dependence with frequency, which is microtubule and actin-dependent. The mean square displacements of endosomes do not follow the predictions of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which offers evidence for active force generation. Microtubule disruption brings the intracellular medium closer to thermal equilibrium: active forces acting on the endosomes depend on microtubule-associated motors. The power spectra of these active forces, deduced through the use of a generalized Langevin equation, show a power law decrease with frequency and reveal an actin-dependent persistence of the force with time. Experimental spectra have been reproduced by a simple model consisting in a series of force steps power-law distributed in time. This model enlightens the role of the cytoskeleton dependent force exerted on endosomes to perform intracellular trafficking. Conclusions/Significance In this work, the influence of cytoskeleton components and molecular motors on intracellular viscoelasticity and transport is addressed. The use of an original probe, the magnetic endosome, allows retrieving the power spectrum of active forces on these organelles thanks to interrelated active and passive measures. Finally a computational model gives estimates of the force itself and hence of the number of the motors pulling on endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2122484354,"The single transmembrane domain serine/threonine kinase activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) has been proposed to bind key regulators of skeletal muscle mass development, including the ligands GDF-8 (myostatin) and GDF-11 (BMP-11). Here we provide a detailed kinetic characterization of ActRIIB binding to several low and high affinity ligands using a soluble activin receptor type IIB-Fc chimera (ActRIIB.Fc). We show that both GDF-8 and GDF-11 bind the extracellular domain of ActRIIB with affinities comparable with those of activin A, a known high affinity ActRIIB ligand, whereas BMP-2 and BMP-7 affinities for ActRIIB are at least 100-fold lower. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that ActRIIB binds GDF-11 and activin A in different ways such as, for example, substitutions in ActRIIB Leu79 effectively abolish ActRIIB binding to activin A yet not to GDF-11. Native ActRIIB has four isoforms that differ in the length of the C-terminal portion of their extracellular domains. We demonstrate that the C terminus of the ActRIIB extracellular domain is crucial for maintaining biological activity of the ActRIIB.Fc receptor chimera.

TGF-β superfamily members (ligands) form covalently and non-covalently linked homo- and heterodimers that bind two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors at the same time. Both receptor types consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane span, and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain. Formation of the hexameric receptor-ligand complex causes the constitutively active type II receptor kinase to phosphorylate type I receptor. Thus, activated type I receptors phosphorylate Smad proteins, which subsequently translocate into the nucleus and control expression of different genes (2Shi Y. Massagué J.

The ActRIIB receptor is of particular interest because it binds multiple ligands from the activin, GDF, and BMP subgroups.ActRIIB extracellular domain (ECD) sequence is exceptionally conserved, with only one amino acid difference between mice and humans and ∼90% identity between species as divergent as chickens and humans. Although ActRIIB-deficient mice develop to term, most animals (∼70%) die shortly after birth (4Lee S.J. Reed L.A. Davies M.V. Girgenrath S. Goad M.E. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Barker C.

Disruption of ActRIIB expression leads to cardiac and kidney malformation, defects in axial patterning, and disturbance of left-right asymmetry in mice (7Oh S.P. Li E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1812-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Four different isoforms of ActRIIB were found in mice and humans (ActRIIB1, ActRIIB2, ActRIIB3, and ActRIIB4). The ECDs of ActRIIB1 and ActRIIB2 contain an insertion in the C-terminal portion of the ECD that is absent in isoforms ActRIIB3 and ActRIIB4. The biological significance of the different isoforms remains unclear. The ActRIIB2 isoform is most predominant in humans. It was previously suggested that the longer isoforms are the most potent. For example, the longer isoforms ActRIIB1 and ActRIIB2 have been shown to have a 3–4-fold higher affinity for activin A than the shorter isoforms ActRIIB3 and ActRIIB4 (8Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Activin A, one of the most abundant proteins of the TGF-β/BMP family, is thought to be a negative regulator of bone formation and other tissues (9Pearsall R.S. Canalis E. Cornwall-Brady M.

Thus, recruitment of BMPs or activins leads to activation of different Smad signaling events. For example, activin binding to ActRIIB leads to activation of the Smad2/3 pathway, whereas binding to BMP-2 results in activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway (14Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D.

Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), and naturally occurring mutations in the Gdf-8 gene show increased muscle mass in cattle (16McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12457-12461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a targeted mutation in the Gdf-8 gene have about twice the normal muscle mass as a result of a combination of muscle fiber hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Similar inactivating mutations have been shown to cause increased muscle mass in other species, including cattle (16McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Blocking GDF-8 activity may therefore be effective for treatment of various muscle-wasting diseases. Indeed, loss of GDF-8 function has been shown to have beneficial effects in degenerative muscle and metabolic disease models (22Bogdanovich S. Krag T.O. Barton E.R. Morris L.D. Whittemore L.A.

GDF-11 is highly related to GDF-8 in the mature region of the protein and is also expressed in skeletal muscle (25McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 26Gamer L.W. Wolfman N.M. Celeste A.J. Hattersley G. Hewick R. Rosen V. Dev.

Moreover, there is compelling biochemical and genetic evidence suggesting that GDF-11 signals through the same type II receptors as GDF-8. Co-immunoprecipitation studies carried out with Xenopus embryo have shown that, similar to GDF-8, GDF-11 is capable of binding to ActRIIA and ActRIIB, and, as in the case of GDF-8, GDF-11 appears to bind more strongly to ActRIIB than to ActRIIA (28Oh S.P. Yeo C.Y. Lee Y. Schrewe H. Whitman M. Li E. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2749-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, the phenotype of GDF-11 knock-out mice (25McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) is remarkably similar to that of mice deficient in activin type II receptor (7Oh S.P. Li E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1812-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 29Song J. Oh S.P. Schrewe H. Nomura M. Lei H. Okano M. Gridley T. Li E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).In this paper, we performed a systematic analysis of several deletions in the C-terminal region of ActRIIB.Fc ECD and examined the effect of such truncations on the biological activity of the receptor. To answer key questions concerning specificity of signaling, we determined the binding affinities of different ligands to ActRIIB and assessed various residues on the interface and in the ligand binding pocket of ActRIIB ECD. We further investigated the contribution of glycosylation and isoform differences on the biological activity with GDF-11 and activin A. Finally, we identified a point mutation in ActRIIB that abrogates binding of the receptor to activin A without appreciably affecting its interaction with GDF-8 or GDF-11.DISCUSSIONActRIIB has been proposed to be the major type II receptor for GDF-11 and GDF-8 signaling. ActRIIB has also been shown to bind additional ligands with varying affinities (e.g. high affinity for activin A and low affinity for BMP-2 and BMP-7) (30Weber D. Kotzsch A. Nickel J. Harth S. Seher A. Mueller U. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of ActRIIB selectivity, we performed a detailed kinetic analysis of GDF-11, activin A, BMP-2, and BMP-7 binding to the soluble ECD of ActRIIB and variants thereof fused to human Fc (hFc). These constructs produced a stable receptor dimer that could be expressed readily in COS cells and purified to homogeneity in two simple steps. This protein is glycosylated and thus closely represents the natural form of the extracellularly accessible portion of ActRIIB.Previous studies have determined affinities of ActRIIB for different ligands (30Weber D. Kotzsch A. Nickel J. Harth S. Seher A. Mueller U. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53126-53135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, these studies did not result in any consensus because data varied greatly, depending on the assay design, experimental conditions, source of ligands and receptors, etc. To determine the binding parameters of different ligands and ActRIIB, we used SPR. The use of a human Fc as part of the ActRIIB fusion protein has allowed us to use a capture format, where receptors were captured on the chip with covalently immobilized anti-hFc IgG. Our approach has an advantage over the direct coupling approach, where molecules of receptor or ligand are chemically cross-linked to the surface in random orientation, because our approach creates a homogeneous population of receptors that have the same orientation on the chip surface. Our results indicate that we produced a functional ActRIIB molecule, as measured by its ability to bind the high affinity ligand activin A as well as the low affinity ligands BMP-7 and BMP-2 with expected relative affinities, and in addition validate our observations of high affinity (picomolar magnitude) binding of ActRIIB.Fc to GDF-8 and GDF-11 (i.e. comparable with ActRIIB.Fc binding to activin A). Thus, ActRIIB.Fc is a highly specific receptor for GDF-8/GDF-11 as well as activin A.The affinity of ActRIIB for activin A has been determined previously. For example, the affinity of membrane-bound ActRIIB was reported as 100–380 pm (8Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 35Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Receptor. 1993; 3: 173-181PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of mouse ActRIIB ECD for activin A determined by SPR with receptor or activin A being covalently coupled on the Biacore chip varied between 0.244 and 6.87 nm (33Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 485-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our data show that full-length ECD of ActRIIB fused to Fc is capable of binding activin A with low picomolar affinity. Conjoining ActRIIB ECD with Fc does not affect ligand binding, as was shown previously by del Re et al. (34del Re E. Sidis Y. Fabrizio D.A. Lin H.Y. Schneyer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53126-53135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previously reported binding affinities of ActRIIB to activin A possibly underestimate the actual binding affinities because measurements were made between ligands and isolated ECD. Receptors function in situ as membrane-bound dimers whose orientations are thus restricted. Therefore, affinities for activin A and GDF-11 reported here are more likely to represent physiological values.Glycosylation can play a significant role in receptor ligand recognition by members of the TGF-β receptor family. N-Glycosylation of BMP-6 is crucial for recognition by activin receptor type I, as shown by total diminishment of BMP-6 signaling through this receptor upon removal of the carbohydrate moiety (36Saremba S. Nickel J. Seher A. Kotzsch A. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In another report, unglycosylated TGFβRII-ECD showed a 1000-fold lower affinity compared with the intact cell surface receptor (37Goetschy J.F. Letourneur O. Cerletti N. Horisberger M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ActRIIB.Fc used in our study is glycosylated at two N-glycosylation sites in the receptor portion and at one N-glycosylation site in the Fc region. Commercial preparations of ActRIIB available from R&D Systems produced in insect and mammalian cells are described as having a 10-fold difference in activity, suggesting that differences in glycosylation might affect the biological activity of ActRIIB. We show here that enzymatic deglycosylation of ActRIIB.Fc with PNGase F, O-glycanase, and sialidase A does not affect binding of the receptor to either GDF-11 or activin A.The effect of ActRIIB C-terminal deletions on the binding affinity of the fusion protein for activin A and GDF-11 is of interest because it has been shown that in mice alternative splicing of mouse ActRIIB mRNA gives rise to four different isoforms (ActRIIB1, ActRIIB2, ActRIIB3, and ActRIIB4). The ECDs of isoforms ActRIIB1 and ActRIIB2 contain a three-proline cluster surrounded by five flanking amino acids in the C-terminal portion of the ECD, a feature that is absent in isoforms ActRIIB3 and ActRIIB4. Interestingly, ActRIIB2 is the predominant isoform in mice. Although the biological relevance of these isoforms remains unclear, in mice, the ActRIIB1 and ActRIIB2 isoforms were suggested to bind activin A with higher affinity than ActRIIB3 and ActRIIB4 variants, indicating that alternative splicing in the C terminus of the ECD can have a significant effect on ligand binding (8Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The structure of the ECD of mouse ActRIIB lacking the 14 C-terminal amino acids purified from yeast has been solved (38Greenwald J. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using analytical centrifugation, it was concluded that the 14 C-terminal residues are not required for complex formation with activin. However, no information about the effect of the C-terminal portion for the kinetics of interactions was provided. In a study of the highly homologous ActRII protein (mouse), Greenwald et al. (39Greenwald J. Le V. Corrigan A. Fischer W. Komives E. Vale W. Choe S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16711-16718Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) concluded that the C-terminal portion of the receptor does not affect binding to activin A. In this investigation, we demonstrate that deletion of 15 C-terminal residues of ECD (i.e. elimination of the proline cluster) dramatically reduces binding of both GDF-11 and activin A to the receptor and also has a significant effect on biological activity. Although a chief function of the C-terminal portion is tethering the ECD to the cell membrane, it cannot be ruled out that these residues may also directly impact the binding interaction. Consistent with the findings of Attisano et al. (8Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), even deletion of as few as 2 or 3 residues from the C terminus of the ECD caused a measurable decrease in the potency of the ActRIIB.Fc protein as an inhibitor of GDF-11 and activin A.Analysis of the ligand binding interface from the ActRIIB-activin A crystal structure has identified roles for the hydrophobic residues Trp78 and Phe101 and the ionic/polar residues Lys74 and Glu39 of ActRIIB in binding to both activin A and GDF-11. These findings largely corroborate those of other investigators concerning the key role played by respective residues at receptor-ligand interfaces within the TGF-β superfamily. In addition, however, we also show that Leu79 plays an important role in activin A binding, which is very sensitive to amino acid substitution of this residue, whereas GDF-11 binding is considerably less so. The unique group of amino acid residues in GDF-8 and GDF-11 that are in close proximity to Leu79 of ActRIIB may help distinguish their role and the dynamics of their signaling mechanisms within the TGF-β superfamily of ligands. This finding also demonstrates that the ligand specificity of soluble forms of ActRIIB can readily be modified to potentially help understand and distinguish the relative physiological effects of its native ligands. Assessment of cell-based assays wherein the signaling via endogenous receptors is replaced by full-length (i.e. membrane-bound) versions of these modified forms of ActRIIB as a means to further confirm our in vitro findings is the subject of ongoing studies.The ActRIIB-activin structure identifies three residues in activin A (Pro88, Asp104, and Ser90) that are in close proximity with Leu79 of ActRIIB (Fig. 4, B and C). The Pro88 and Ser90 residues are conserved to a high degree within the TGF-β superfamily, although residues such as alanine, threonine, glycine, and valine also are represented. Notably, only GDF-8, GDF-11, and inhibin have an asparagine in the sequence location corresponding to Ser90 of activin A. GDF-8 and GDF-11 also have a lysine at the site corresponding to Asp104 of activin A (Fig. 4D). We hypothesize that the lysyl residue at this site may have more flexibility to accommodate the removal of the hydrophobic Leu79 of ActRIIB, and/or the aliphatic component of the lysine may provide additional stability to the bound versus unbound ligand states that compensates for the loss of the hydrophobic Leu79 contribution from the receptor (see Fig. 4, C and E, for the bound (31Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) versus unbound (40Harrington A.E. Morris-Triggs S.A. Ruotolo B.T. Robinson C.V. Ohnuma S. Hyvönen M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) conformations of activin A). The Asn83 residue of GDF-11 also may play a role because BMP-7, which has the corresponding lysine of GDF-11 but retains the serine similar to activin A, exhibits intermediate affinity for the ActRIIB(L79D).Fc variant.There are a few potential salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between ActRIIB and activin A that surround the hydrophobic center of the interface. Thus, Lys55 is involved in hydrogen bonding with Glu111 of activin A, and Asp80 contacts Arg87 of activin A. Our finding that the K55A mutation had only a relatively minor effect on activin A or GDF-11 binding as judged by SPR and cell-based assays is consistent with a previously reported finding (32Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that mutation of the corresponding residue in the ActRIIA receptor did not drastically affect receptor binding to activin A.Asp80 was identified as a key residue contributing to binding to activin A through both ionic and polar interactions with Arg87 of activin A (31Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although mutation of the corresponding aspartyl residue in the ActRIIA receptor had a marginal effect on activin A binding (32Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is somewhat surprising that our mutations eliminated binding to both activin A and GDF-11 because GDF-11 has a serine at the position corresponding to the arginine in activin A. We tentatively ascribe the loss of binding to a defect in protein folding.A residue with amphiphilic properties, Lys74, is involved in hydrophobic contacts across the interface and intramolecular ionic/polar contact with Glu39. As expected, the ActRIIB(E39K).Fc variant failed to bind either activin A or GDF-11, which is attributable to loss of stable orientation required for ligand binding.The primary sequence of ActRIIB ECD is highly conserved. Thus, human ActRIIB ECD shares 99% sequence identity with mouse, rat, and bovine ActRIIB and 78% sequence identity with Xenopus ActRIIB. Nevertheless, there exists a report of a natural allelic variation of arginine or alanine at residue 64 (41Hildén K. Tuuri T. Erämaa M. Ritvos O. Blood. 1994; 83: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that both R64A and R64N mutations have a devastating effect on the biological activity of the receptor as well as on its binding to GDF-11 but that maintaining positive charge with either arginine (native protein) or lysine (introduced mutation) at this position does not significantly affect the activity. These observations raise questions concerning the frequency and sustainability of an Ala64 allele in the human population.In summary, in this investigation using soluble ActRIIB.Fc chimeras, we have demonstrated that both GDF-8 and GDF-11 bind the extracellular domain of ActRIIB with high affinities comparable with those of activin A, whereas the affinities of BMP-2 and BMP-7 for ActRIIB are lower by orders of magnitude. The binding of ActRIIB to GDF-11 and activin A are distinguishable by substitutions in ActRIIB Leu79 that effectively abolish ActRIIB binding to activin A but not to GDF-11. We also have demonstrated that the C terminus of the ActRIIB extracellular domain is required for maintaining biological activity of the ActRIIB.Fc receptor chimera. In addition, we show that glycosylation of ActRIIB.Fc is not required for binding to activin A or GDF-11. These findings reveal binding specificity and activity determinants of the ActRIIB receptor that help explain specificity in the activation of distinct signaling pathways.

TGF-β superfamily members (ligands) form covalently and non-covalently linked homo- and heterodimers that bind two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors at the same time. Both receptor types consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane span, and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain. Formation of the hexameric receptor-ligand complex causes the constitutively active type II receptor kinase to phosphorylate type I receptor. Thus, activated type I receptors phosphorylate Smad proteins, which subsequently translocate into the nucleus and control expression of different genes (2Shi Y. Massagué J.

The ActRIIB receptor is of particular interest because it binds multiple ligands from the activin, GDF, and BMP subgroups.ActRIIB extracellular domain (ECD) sequence is exceptionally conserved, with only one amino acid difference between mice and humans and ∼90% identity between species as divergent as chickens and humans. Although ActRIIB-deficient mice develop to term, most animals (∼70%) die shortly after birth (4Lee S.J. Reed L.A. Davies M.V. Girgenrath S. Goad M.E. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Barker C.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18117-18122Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Disruption of ActRIIB expression leads to cardiac and kidney malformation, defects in axial patterning, and disturbance of left-right asymmetry in mice (7Oh S.P. Li E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1812-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Four different isoforms of ActRIIB were found in mice and humans (ActRIIB1, ActRIIB2, ActRIIB3, and ActRIIB4). The ECDs of ActRIIB1 and ActRIIB2 contain an insertion in the C-terminal portion of the ECD that is absent in isoforms ActRIIB3 and ActRIIB4. The biological significance of the different isoforms remains unclear. The ActRIIB2 isoform is most predominant in humans. It was previously suggested that the longer isoforms are the most potent. For example, the longer isoforms ActRIIB1 and ActRIIB2 have been shown to have a 3–4-fold higher affinity for activin A than the shorter isoforms ActRIIB3 and ActRIIB4 (8Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).ActRIIB binds to a diverse group of TGF-β family members, including activin A, BMP-2, BMP-7, GDF-8 (growth and differentiation factor 8 or myostatin), and GDF-11. Activin A, one of the most abundant proteins of the TGF-β/BMP family, is thought to be a negative regulator of bone formation and other tissues (9Pearsall R.S. Canalis E. Cornwall-Brady M. Underwood K.W. Haigis B. Ucran J. Kumar R. Pobre E. Grinberg A. Werner E.D. Glatt V. Stadmeyer L. Smith D. Seehra J. Bouxsein M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7082-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); BMP-2 has been associated with ectopic bone formation and periarticular ossification (10Reddi A.H. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1998; 355: S66-S72Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); BMP-7 has been associated with bone homeostasis (11ten Dijke P. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2006; 22: S7-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and kidney development (12Patel S.R. Dressler G.R. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 512-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); and GDF-8 and GDF-11 are associated with negative regulation of skeletal muscle mass (13Wolfman N.M. McPherron A.C. Pappano W.N. Davies M.V. Song K. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Zhao L. Sebald S.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15842-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Moreover, activins and BMPs are known also to use different signaling pathways. Thus, recruitment of BMPs or activins leads to activation of different Smad signaling events. For example, activin binding to ActRIIB leads to activation of the Smad2/3 pathway, whereas binding to BMP-2 results in activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway (14Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).GDF-8 (myostatin) and the closely related GDF-11 are essential for proper regulation of skeletal muscle growth. For example, mice lacking GDF-8 show a dramatic increase in skeletal muscle mass (15McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), and naturally occurring mutations in the Gdf-8 gene show increased muscle mass in cattle (16McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl.

Mice carrying a targeted mutation in the Gdf-8 gene have about twice the normal muscle mass as a result of a combination of muscle fiber hyperplasia and hypertrophy.

Blocking GDF-8 activity may therefore be effective for treatment of various muscle-wasting diseases. Indeed, loss of GDF-8 function has been shown to have beneficial effects in degenerative muscle and metabolic disease models (22Bogdanovich S. Krag T.O. Barton E.R. Morris L.D. Whittemore L.A.

GDF-11 is highly related to GDF-8 in the mature region of the protein and is also expressed in skeletal muscle (25McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nat.

Moreover, there is compelling biochemical and genetic evidence suggesting that GDF-11 signals through the same type II receptors as GDF-8. Co-immunoprecipitation studies carried out with Xenopus embryo have shown that, similar to GDF-8, GDF-11 is capable of binding to ActRIIA and ActRIIB, and, as in the case of GDF-8, GDF-11 appears to bind more strongly to ActRIIB than to ActRIIA (28Oh S.P.

To answer key questions concerning specificity of signaling, we determined the binding affinities of different ligands to ActRIIB and assessed various residues on the interface and in the ligand binding pocket of ActRIIB ECD. We further investigated the contribution of glycosylation and isoform differences on the biological activity with GDF-11 and activin A. Finally, we identified a point mutation in ActRIIB that abrogates binding of the receptor to activin A without appreciably affecting its interaction with GDF-8 or GDF-11."
https://openalex.org/W2151038951,"New targets for RNA interference (RNAi)-based cancer therapy are constantly emerging from the increasing knowledge on key molecular pathways that are paramount for carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, in vivo delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) remains a crucial challenge for therapeutic success. siRNAs on their own are not taken up by most mammalian cells in a way that preserves their activity. Moreover, when applied in vivo, siRNA-based approaches are all limited by poor penetration into the target tissue and low silencing efficiency. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed novel polymerized polyglycerol-based dendrimer core shell structures to deliver siRNA to tumors in vivo. These cationic dendrimers can strongly improve the stability of the siRNA, its intracellular trafficking, its silencing efficacy, and its accumulation in the tumor environment owing to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Here, we show that our dendritic nanocarriers exhibited low cytotoxicity and high efficacy in delivering active siRNA into cells. With use of human glioblastoma and murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines as model systems, these siRNA-dendrimer polyplexes silenced the luciferase gene, ectopically overexpressed in these cells. Importantly, significant gene silencing was accomplished in vivo within 24 h of treatment with our luciferase siRNA-nanocarrier polyplexes, as measured by noninvasive intravital bioluminescence imaging. Moreover, our siRNA-nanocarriers show very low levels of toxicity as no significant weight loss was observed after intravenous administration of the polyplexes. We show a proof of concept for siRNA delivery in vivo using a luciferase-based model. We predict that in vivo silencing of important cell growth and angiogenesis regulator genes in a selective manner will justify this approach as a successful anticancer therapy.—Ofek, P., Fischer, W., Calderón, M., Haag, R., Satchi-Fainaro, R.

https://openalex.org/W1993147984,"The nasopharynx is the main ecological niche of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Although colonization of the nares is asymptomatic, nasal carriage is a known risk factor for endogenous staphylococcal infection. We quantified S. aureus mRNA levels in nose swabs of persistent carriers to gain insight into the regulatory adaptation of the bacterium to the nasal environment. We could elucidate a general response of the pathogen to the surrounding milieu independent of the strain background or the human host. Colonizing bacteria preferentially express molecules necessary for tissue adherence or immune-evasion whereas toxins are down regulated. From the analysis of regulatory loci we found evidence for a predominate role of the essential two-component system WalKR of S. aureus. The results suggest that during persistent colonization the bacteria are metabolically active with a high cell surface turnover. The increased understanding of bacterial factors that maintain the colonization state can open new therapeutic options to control nasal carriage and subsequent infections."
https://openalex.org/W2011047279,"Background Insect odorant receptors (ORs) are heteromers comprised of highly variable odorant-binding subunits associated with one conserved co-receptor. They are potential molecular targets for the development of novel mosquito attractants and repellents. ORs have been identified in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. However, they are still unknown in the Southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, which transmits pathogens that cause human diseases throughout the world, including West Nile Virus in the United States. Methodology We have employed a combination of bioinformatics, molecular cloning and electrophysiology approaches to identify and characterize the response profile of an OR in Cx. quinquefasciatus. First, we have unveiled a large multigenic family of one-hundred-fifty-eight putative ORs in this species, including a subgroup of conserved ORs in three mosquito species. Using the Xenopus oocytes expression system, we have determined the response profile of CquiOR2, an antennae-specific OR, which shares high identity with putative orthologs in Anopheles gambiae (AgamOR2) and Aedes aegypti (AaegOR2). Conclusion We show that CquiOR2 is highly sensitive to indole, an oviposition attractant for Cx. quinquefasciatus. The response profile of CquiOR2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes resembles that of an olfactory receptor neuron housed in the antennal short blunt-tipped sensilla (A2) of Cx. quinquefasciatus, which are natural detectors for oviposition attractants. This first Culex OR de-orphanized is, therefore, a potential molecular target for screening oviposition attractants."

Cataloguing these target genes will provide useful insights into the disease etiology and may provide an opportunity to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. High resolution genome wide copy number and matching expression data from 68 primary epithelial ovarian carcinomas of various histotypes was integrated to identify genes in regions of most frequent amplification with the strongest correlation with expression and copy number. Regions on chromosomes 3, 7, 8, and 20 were most frequently increased in copy number (>40% of samples). Within these regions, 703/1370 (51%) unique gene expression probesets were differentially expressed when samples with gain were compared to samples without gain. 30% of these differentially expressed probesets also showed a strong positive correlation (r≥0.6) between expression and copy number. We also identified 21 regions of high amplitude copy number gain, in which 32 known protein coding genes showed a strong positive correlation between expression and copy number. Overall, our data validates previously known ovarian cancer genes, such as ERBB2, and also identified novel potential drivers such as MYNN, PUF60 and TPX2."
https://openalex.org/W2005542172,"Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 are associated with an increased risk of HIV infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common STI, but little is know about its role in HIV transmission. The objective of this study was to determine whether cervico-vaginal HPV infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition in women independent of other common STIs. Methods and Findings This prospective cohort study followed 2040 HIV-negative Zimbabwean women (average age 27 years, range 18–49 years) for a median of 21 months. Participants were tested quarterly for 29 HPV types (with L1 PCR primers) and HIV (antibody testing on blood samples with DNA or RNA PCR confirmation). HIV incidence was 2.7 per 100 woman-years. Baseline HPV prevalence was 24.5%, and the most prevalent HPV types were 58 (5.0%), 16 (4.7%), 70 (2.4%), and 18 (2.3%). In separate regression models adjusting for baseline variables (including age, high risk partner, positive test for STIs, positive HSV-2 serology and condom use), HIV acquisition was associated with having baseline prevalent infection with HPV 58 (aHR 2.13; 95% CI 1.09–4.15) or HPV 70 (aHR 2.68; 95% CI 1.08–6.66). In separate regression models adjusting for both baseline variables and time-dependent variables (including HSV-2 status, incident STIs, new sexual partner and condom use), HIV acquisition was associated with concurrent infection with any non-oncogenic HPV type (aHR 1.70; 95% CI 1.02–2.85), any oncogenic HPV type (aHR 1.96; 95% CI 1.16–3.30), HPV 31 (aHR 4.25; 95% CI 1.81–9.97) or HPV 70 (aHR 3.30; 95% CI 1.50–7.20). Detection of any oncogenic HPV type within the previous 6 months was an independent predictor of HIV acquisition, regardless of whether HPV status at the HIV acquisition visit was included (aHR 1.95; 95% CI 1.19–3.21) or excluded (aHR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02–2.85) from the analysis. Conclusions/Significance Cervico-vaginal HPV infection was associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition in women, and specific HPV types were implicated in this association. The observational nature of our study precludes establishment of causation between HPV infection and HIV acquisition. However, given the high prevalence of HPV infection in women, further investigation of the role of HPV in HIV transmission is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2066388620,"A transthoracic infection involving a low dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been used to establish a new model of infection in minipigs. The 20-week monitoring period showed a marked Th1 response and poor humoral response for the whole infection. A detailed histopathological analysis was performed after slicing the formalin-fixed whole lungs of each animal. All lesions were recorded and classified according to their microscopic aspect, their relationship with the intralobular connective network and their degree of maturity in order to obtain a dissemination ratio (DR) between recent and old lesions. CFU counts and evolution of the DR with time showed that the proposed model correlated with a contained infection, decreasing from week 9 onwards. These findings suggest that the infection induces an initial Th1 response, which is followed by local fibrosis and encapsulation of the granulomas, thereby decreasing the onset of new lesions. Two therapeutic strategies were applied in order to understand how they could influence the model. Thus, chemotherapy with isoniazid alone helped to decrease the total number of lesions, despite the increase in DR after week 9, with similar kinetics to those of the control group, whereas addition of a therapeutic M. tuberculosis fragment-based vaccine after chemotherapy increased the Th1 and humoral responses, as well as the number of lesions, but decreased the DR. By providing a local pulmonary structure similar to that in humans, the mini-pig model highlights new aspects that could be key to a better understanding tuberculosis infection control in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2081372975,"Background The pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, as well as the formation of intraneuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the substantia nigra. Accumulations of nitrated α-synuclein are demonstrated in the signature inclusions of Parkinson's disease. However, whether the nitration of α-synuclein is relevant to the pathogenesis of PD is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, effect of nitrated α-synuclein to dopaminergic (DA) neurons was determined by delivering nitrated recombinant TAT-α-synuclein intracellular. We provide evidence to show that the nitrated α-synuclein was toxic to cultured dopaminergic SHSY-5Y neurons and primary mesencephalic DA neurons to a much greater degree than unnitrated α-synuclein. Moreover, we show that administration of nitrated α-synuclein to the substantia nigra pars compacta of rats caused severe reductions in the number of DA neurons therein, and led to the down-regulation of D2R in the striatum in vivo. Furthermore, when administered to the substantia nigra of rats, nitrated α-synuclein caused PD-like motor dysfunctions, such as reduced locomotion and motor asymmetry, however unmodified α-synuclein had significantly less severe behavioral effects. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide evidence that α-synuclein, principally in its nitrated form, induce DA neuron death and may be a major factor in the etiology of PD."

The objective of the study was to identify predictors of default among new smear positive TB patients registered for treatment to suggest possible interventions to set right the problems to sustain and enhance the programme performance. Methodology & Principal Findings Twenty districts selected from six states were assigned to six strata formed, considering the geographic, socio-cultural and demographic setup of the area. New smear positive patients registered for treatment in two consecutive quarters during III quarter 2004 to III quarter 2005 formed the retrospective study cohort. Case control analysis was done including defaulted patients as “cases” and equal number of age and sex matched patients completing treatment as “controls”. The presence and degree of association between default and determinant factors was computed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Data collection was through patient interviews using pre-tested semi structured questionnaire and review of treatment related records. Information on a wide range of socio demographic and patient related factors was obtained. Among the 687 defaulted and equal numbers of patients in completed group, 389 and 540 patients respectively were satisfactorily interviewed. In the logistic regression analysis, factors independently associated with default were alcoholism [AOR-1.72 (1.23–2.44)], illiteracy [AOR-1.40 (1.03–1.92)], having other commitments during treatment [AOR-3.22 (1.1–9.09)], inadequate knowledge of TB [AOR-1.88(1.35–2.63)], poor patient provider interaction [AOR-1.72(1.23–2.44)], lack of support from health staff [AOR-1.93(1.41–2.64)], having instances of missed doses [AOR-2.56(1.82–3.57)], side effects to anti TB drugs [AOR-2.55 (1.87–3.47)] and dissatisfaction with services provided [AOR-1.73 (1.14–2.6)]. Conclusion Majority of risk factors for default were treatment and provider oriented and rectifiable with appropriate interventions, which would help in sustaining the good programme performance."
https://openalex.org/W2123890532,"Cutaneous malignant melanoma remains a therapeutic challenge, and patients with advanced disease have limited survival. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been successfully used to treat many malignancies, and it may show promise as an antimelanoma modality. However, high melanin levels in melanomas can adversely affect PDT effectiveness. Herein the extent of melanin contribution to melanoma resistance to PDT was investigated in a set of melanoma cell lines that markedly differ in the levels of pigmentation; 3 new bacteriochlorins successfully overcame the resistance. Cell killing studies determined that bacteriochlorins are superior at (LD(50) approximately 0.1 microM) when compared with controls such as the FDA-approved Photofrin (LD(50) approximately 10 microM) and clinically tested LuTex (LD(50) approximately 1 microM). The melanin content affects PDT effectiveness, but the degree of reduction is significantly lower for bacteriochlorins than for Photofrin. Microscopy reveals that the least effective bacteriochlorin localizes predominantly in lysosomes, while the most effective one preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. Interestingly all bacteriochlorins accumulate in melanosomes, and subsequent illumination leads to melanosomal damage shown by electron microscopy. Fluorescent probes show that the most effective bacteriochlorin produces significantly higher levels of hydroxyl radicals, and this is consistent with the redox properties suggested by molecular-orbital calculations. The best in vitro performing bacteriochlorin was tested in vivo in a mouse melanoma model using spectrally resolved fluorescence imaging and provided significant survival advantage with 20% of cures (P<0.01)."
https://openalex.org/W2052098002,"Background Novel therapeutics are urgently needed to control tuberculosis (TB). Thioridazine (THZ) is a candidate for the therapy of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant TB. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the impact of THZ on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by analyzing gene expression profiles after treatment at the minimal inhibitory (1x MIC) or highly inhibitory (4x MIC) concentrations between 1–6 hours. THZ modulated the expression of genes encoding membrane proteins, efflux pumps, oxido-reductases and enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and aerobic respiration. The Rv3160c-Rv3161c operon, a multi-drug transporter and the Rv3614c/3615c/3616c regulon, were highly induced in response to THZ. A significantly high number of Mtb genes co-expressed with σB (the σB regulon) was turned on by THZ treatment. σB has recently been shown to protect Mtb from envelope-damage. We hypothesized that THZ damages the Mtb cell-envelope, turning on the expression of the σB regulon. Consistent with this hypothesis, we present electron-microscopy data which shows that THZ modulates cell-envelope integrity. Moreover, the Mtb mutants in σH and σE, two alternate stress response sigma factors that induce the expression of σB, exhibited higher sensitivity to THZ, indicating that the presence and expression of σB allows Mtb to resist the impact of THZ. Conditional induction of σB levels increased the survival of Mtb in the presence of THZ. Conclusions/Significance THZ targets different pathways and can thus be used as a multi-target inhibitor itself as well as provide strategies for multi-target drug development for combination chemotherapy. Our results show that the Mtb sigma factor network comprising of σH, σE and σB plays a crucial role in protecting the pathogen against cell-envelope damage."

Cytochrome P450s: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These enzymes are found throughout nature, with 57 P450s encoded in the human genome (2Nelson D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). P450s typically catalyze monooxygenation reactions (Fig. 1) and are also capable of reduction, ring expansion, dealkylation, aromatization, and other reactions based on the same high valent iron chemistry (3Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar).An unusual feature of some P450s is the ability to catalyze sequential reactions. These multistep processes are characteristic of some of the P450s involved in steroid metabolism (P450s 11A1, 11B2, 17A1, 19A1, and 51A1), although sequential reactions with non-steroid substrates have also been characterized (e.g. P450s 1A2 (4Sohl C.D.

Pregnenolone and aldosterone are generated from P450 11A1 and 11B2 reactions, respectively, in three-step processes. P450 17A1 exhibits both steroid 7α-hydroxylation and lyase activities in a two-step reaction. P450 51A1 is a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes a three-step C-demethylation of the substrate lanosterol. Although pre-steady-state analyses of P450 11B2 (7Imai T.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2800-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been reported, to our knowledge no global fits (i.e. using several types of data to generate a kinetic mechanism of turnover) are available.P450 19A1 is responsible for the conversion of androgens (andro, testosterone, and 16α-hydroxytestosterone) to estrogens (estrone, 17β-estradiol, and estriol, respectively) in a sequential, three-step reaction (Scheme 1). This conversion, first identified in 1959 (9Ryan K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 268-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), requires three molecules each of NADPH and O2 and proceeds through two relatively stable intermediates, the 19-hydroxy and 19-aldehyde compounds, before the final aromatization step. There has been considerable debate over the chemistry of the third step, and two mechanisms are currently favored. In the first model, the ferric peroxide form of the P450 (FeOO−, Fig. 1) attacks the aldehyde, followed by heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond and the transfer of the 1β proton of the steroid to the heme to generate a ferrous hydroxy intermediate, with the loss of formic acid (10Akhtar M. Calder M.R. Corina D.L. Wright J.N. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Cole P.A. Robinson C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8130-8137Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In a second postulated mechanism, a non-enzymatic conversion of the 19=O andro intermediate to a gem-diol (or direct hydroxylation of the alcohol intermediate to form the gem-diol) is followed by an aromatization catalyzed by the “Compound I” form of P450 (formally FeO3+), which removes a hydrogen at the 1β position on the steroid (12Hackett J.C. Brueggemeier R.W. Hadad C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5224-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Following a transfer of an electron from the steroid A ring to the iron, the ferric hydroxy intermediate (FeOH3+) removes a hydrogen from the gem-diol, facilitating the loss of this carbon as formic acid (12Hackett J.C. Brueggemeier R.W. Hadad C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5224-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Controversy exists regarding the processive or distributive characteristic of the sequential steps catalyzed by P450 19A1, as summarized by Bednarski and Nelson (13Bednarski P.J. Nelson S.D. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Steady-state time-course reactions of the turnover of andro by microsomes suggested linear formation of estrone sequentially from the two intermediates that freely dissociate (14Thompson Jr., E.A.

Biochem. 1974; 48: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the third step proceeds at a different active site than the first two oxidations, which would perhaps support intermediate dissociation (16Fishman J. Goto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4466-4471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies with inhibitors that mimic both the 19-OH andro and 19=O andro intermediates suggest P450 19A1 is processive (17Hollander N. Endocrinology. 1962; 71: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and indicate that only one active site exists (13Bednarski P.J. Nelson S.D. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although there is now agreement that catalysis occurs at one active site and must proceed through the 19-OH andro and 19=O andro intermediates (18Simpson E.R. Clyne C. Rubin G. Boon W.C. Robertson K. Britt K. Speed C. Jones M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether these intermediates dissociate over the course of the reaction.A crystal structure of P450 19A1 (bound to andro) has recently been solved, revealing a relatively small active site that is well suited to accommodate andro and arguing against the existence of multiple active sites (19Ghosh D. Griswold J. Erman M. Pangborn W. Nature. 2009; 457: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). P450 19A1 has wide tissue distribution (including placenta, ovaries, testes, and adipose tissue), and expression is associated with estrogen-dependent breast cancer (∼75% of diagnoses) (20Johnston S.R. Dowsett M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Aromatase inhibitors, available since the 1970s, have been successful in treating post-menopausal women with this type of cancer (21Altundag K. Ibrahim N.K. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although much of the focus has been on characterizing the kinetics of P450 19A1 in the context of aromatase inhibitors, fewer studies have probed native substrates. Although many steady-state parameters for the conversion of andro to estrone have been published (22Kellis Jr., J.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4413-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gartner C.A. Thompson S.J. Rettie A.E. Nelson S.D. Protein Expr.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2398-2400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), similar steady-state studies on the intermediates are limited (22Kellis Jr., J.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4413-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, to our knowledge, no transient-state kinetic studies are available that determine the individual rate constants of the three-step sequential reaction catalyzed by P450 19A1.One of the greatest obstacles in the study of P450 19A1 has been heterologous expression and purification. Almost all kinetic and structural work (19Ghosh D. Griswold J. Erman M. Pangborn W. Nature. 2009; 457: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 23Gartner C.A. Thompson S.J. Rettie A.E.

Biochem. 1988; 103: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) has utilized P450 19A1 purified from human placenta, which requires access to tissue and precludes mutagenesis approaches. Heterologous expression has been primarily limited to baculovirus-infected insect cells (24Amarneh B. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: R1-R5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Sigle R.O. Titus M.A. Harada N. Nelson S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although P450 19A1 expression in Escherichia coli has been reported (25Kagawa N. Hori H. Waterman M.R. Yoshioka S. Steroids. 2004; 69: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Zhang F. Zhou D. Kao Y.C. Ye J. Chen S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).We describe a reasonably straightforward and robust protocol for the heterologous expression and purification of P450 19A1 in E. coli. Using global fitting of a variety of both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic data, we developed a minimal kinetic model of P450 19A1 turnover, which includes individual rate constants for the three-step reaction and indicates a distributive mechanism.DISCUSSIONP450 19A1, which converts androgens to estrogens, is a member of the class of P450s capable of catalyzing sequential reactions. Many of these multistep enzymes are involved in steroid processing, i.e. P450s 11A1, 11B2, 17A1, and 51A1, as well as 19A1. The reported kinetic studies of three-step reactions catalyzed by P450 19A1 are limited to a small collection of steady-state parameters associated with the turnover of andro and testosterone plus a multitude of studies examining aromatase inhibitors, which have proved to be therapeutically effective for some breast cancers. We used both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic techniques to characterize the binding of the substrate, intermediates, and product, revealing low micromolar binding that occurred in a two-step process. Over the course of the reaction, the intermediates freely dissociated. Globally fitting a progress curve generated under single turnover conditions, as well as many other data, yielded a kinetic model with individual rate constants for each step of catalysis.We report heterologous P450 19A1 expression of 400–500 nm in E. coli and purification that requires only one chromatography step. Most other methods involve purification of P450 19A1 from placenta, which prohibits mutagenesis experiments and requires access to human tissues. Further, these purification protocols require the use of two (51Yoshida N. Osawa Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), three (22Kellis Jr., J.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4413-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gartner C.A. Thompson S.J. Rettie A.E. Nelson S.D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), or four (52Tan L. Muto N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) columns, decreasing the overall yield, and some utilize non-ionic detergents, which can be difficult to remove (53Hosea N.A. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The specific content (6.3 nmol of P450/mg of protein, Table 1) was lower than expected for a pure P450 holoenzyme, i.e. ∼20 nmol of P450/mg for a 50-kDa protein. Because SDS-PAGE analysis indicated >95% purity (Fig. 2B), we presume that the deviation from the theoretical value resulted from a contribution of apo-P450 19A1 to the measured concentration. P450 19A1 was sensitive to exposure to the nickel-NTA resin, and although the chromatography step was abbreviated, the absorbance spectrum of the purified protein at 420 nm (demonstrating a loss of heme) suggested some apo-protein formation (Table 1).Two other purification strategies required the use of either andro (22Kellis Jr., J.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4413-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or αNF (23Gartner C.A. Thompson S.J. Rettie A.E. Nelson S.D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to stabilize the P450 during purification. Although the Fe2+·CO versus Fe2+ difference spectra improved upon the addition of αNF during solubilization and chromatography steps, we were unable to remove αNF from the preparation despite extensive column washing, adding a second column for further washing, and using additional dialysis steps. Because andro has a Kd nearly as low as αNF (0.13 versus 0.09 μm, respectively), it is likely that similar problems plague purification strategies that utilize andro. Limiting exposure to the nickel-NTA resin generated Fe2+·CO versus Fe2+ difference spectra of as high quality as those recorded with αNF-containing preparations (minimum A420 in the Fe2+·CO versus Fe2+ difference spectra) and, importantly, did not complicate kinetics by having an inhibitor or substrate present.Another protocol for expression and purification of P450 19A1 in E. coli involved the removal of a larger portion of the N terminus, produced slightly lower levels of expression (350–400 nm), and required three columns and the presence of andro (25Kagawa N. Hori H. Waterman M.R. Yoshioka S. Steroids. 2004; 69: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although Zhang et al. (30Zhang F. Zhou D. Kao Y.C. Ye J. Chen S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) used only a single column for purification, the native sequence was more highly modified in that histidine tags were present at both the N and C-termini, and expression levels were not reported.One steady-state time-course assay involving aromatization of andro (by placental microsomes) showed accumulation of both intermediates before the formation of estrone (14Thompson Jr., E.A. Siiteri P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5364-5372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but another study extended this time course to show subsequent loss of the intermediates (15Braselton Jr., W.E. Engel L.L. Orr J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The presence of both intermediates, the lag of formation of estrone, and the subsequent loss of the intermediates was taken as evidence that each step of the sequential reaction was required and that the intermediates were free to dissociate. Conversely, the high specific radioactivity of estrone and low specific radioactivity of 19-OH andro after incubation of radiolabeled andro and non-labeled 19-OH andro (with placental microsomes) suggested little dissociation of the intermediates (17Hollander N. Endocrinology. 1962; 71: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, this type of assay does not directly probe dissociation of both intermediates, unlike pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 8). The amount of 19A1 present was not defined (microsomal fractions were used), which could prove problematic. If substrate concentrations approximate the concentration of P450 19A1, conditions would be similar to those in our single turnover experiment, and a 5-min incubation would be too long for this type of assay. In our time-course experiment (Fig. 9) this relatively late time point would show more radioactive estrone than radioactive 19-OH andro, as indicated in the study by Hollander (17Hollander N. Endocrinology. 1962; 71: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but this observation should not be used to infer processivity. Our more direct assay of measuring dissociation using pulse-chase experiments (with defined concentrations), which shows dissociation of both intermediates, is considered more reliable.Characterization of P450 19A1 as being more distributive than processive contrasts with similar studies on sequential reactions catalyzed by P450s 2A6 (processive conversion of nitrosamines to aldehydes and then carboxylic acids (5Chowdhury G. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8031-8044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) and 2E1 (processive conversion of ethanol to acetic acid through acetaldehyde (6Bell-Parikh L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23833-23840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). Intuitively one might expect a reaction course with a physiological substrate to be more processive, but this is not necessarily the case. Why these P450s show such differences in the ability of the intermediates to freely exchange remains unknown and is the object of further investigation.Distinction between the ferric peroxide and the Compound I mechanisms (see above) was not addressed in this work. Because the former mechanism (10Akhtar M. Calder M.R. Corina D.L. Wright J.N. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Cole P.A. Robinson C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8130-8137Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) dictates that the ferric peroxide intermediate attacks the 19=O andro intermediate rather than the 19-gem-diol compound, it is possible that buildup of the 19-gem-diol might occur (if dehydration is slow). However, no unidentified peaks in the radiochromatogram were observed to indicate a distinct 19-gem-diol compound in the single turnover studies. The sensitivity of the assay may have prevented observation of the 19-gem-diol (the specific activity of the [4-14C]-andro was very low), because 19=O andro levels were just above the limit of detection. It is also possible that the rate of non-enzymatic conversion might favor the 19=O andro compound, preventing buildup of the 19-gem-diol. Another possibility is that the 19-gem-diol is immediately attacked by Compound I, as in the case of the second proposed mechanism (12Hackett J.C. Brueggemeier R.W. Hadad C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5224-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the enzymatically non-preferred conformation, the 19=O andro, accumulates (as seen in Fig. 9). Further experiments are necessary to distinguish between these two models.Steady-state titrations (Fig. 4) showed low micromolar dissociation constants for all four ligands. The highest affinity was seen for andro (0.13 μm), a value that is still much higher than the circulating concentration of andro (∼9 nm in men (54Tomaszewski M. Charchar F.J. Maric C. Kuzniewicz R. Gola M. Grzeszczak W. Samani N.J. Zukowska-Szczechowska E. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 203: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Titrations with testosterone (data not shown) indicated a Kd value of 1.5 μm, which is considerably higher than that of andro, although circulating levels of testosterone are also higher (∼19 nm in men (54Tomaszewski M. Charchar F.J. Maric C. Kuzniewicz R. Gola M. Grzeszczak W. Samani N.J. Zukowska-Szczechowska E. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 203: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Pre-steady-state binding of andro, 19-OH andro, and 19=O andro to P450 19A1 was a two-step process. Thus multistep binding to P450s is not limited to xenobiotics (i.e. P450s 1A2 and 3A4) (4Sohl C.D. Isin E.M. Eoff R.L. Marsch G.A. Stec D.F. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7293-7308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 55Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), because this was also seen with an endobiotic in a P450 with a small active site (19Ghosh D. Griswold J. Erman M. Pangborn W. Nature. 2009; 457: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).To generate a minimum kinetic model to describe P450 19A1 turnover, multiple types of data were fit globally using both Kintek Explorer® (Fig. 9) and Dynafit software (supplemental Fig. S6). The greatest challenge of global fitting was constraining the individual rate constants to fit the steady-state turnover data (Fig. 7). For the steady-state 19-OH andro to estrone conversion data, all of the rate constants from the EB ⇆ E + B step (Table 3) through the final step (estrone release) were used. The resulting fit (supplemental Figs. S6A and S6B) describes the turnover of 19-OH andro relatively well. Similarly, 19=O to estrone turnover data were fit using rate constants from the EC ⇆ E + C step (Table 3) through estrone release. Although the initial rate is slightly faster than observed experimentally, these steady-state data were also fit well (supplemental Figs. S6C and S6D).There are some weaknesses in this kinetic model. Although concentrations of the two intermediates were well described by the model of the single turnover experiment, a lag phase in the formation of estrone was overemphasized, and the rate of andro loss was slow (Fig. 9). Laws of mass balance dictate that 2 μm estrone should be formed as indicated by the model, because levels of andro, 19-OH andro, and 19=O andro fall to zero, and no further reaction with estrone could be identified. However, slow conversion of estrone to 2-hydroxyestrone by P450 19A1 has been reported (56Fishman J. Dixon D. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1683-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 57Shimizu Y. Yarborough C. Osawa Y. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 58Osawa Y. Higashiyama T. Shimizu Y. Yarborough C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and it is possible that some estrone 2-hydroxylation occurred, albeit at undetectable levels in these assays. It is unlikely that significant intermediate decomposition occurred during the course of the single turnover experiment, because no additional peaks (14C) were identified to indicate novel compounds (resulting from decomposition). Additional “conformational change” steps could be added following binding each of the ligands, or at other steps of the catalytic cycles, which may improve the overall fit, but have no experimental basis. The convention of global kinetic simulation is to develop the best possible minimal mechanism that can fit several types of experimental data, without adding additional steps unless necessary and justified (49Johnson K.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analysis using substrate with higher specific radioactivity might reveal contributions from other products (of andro, the intermediates, or estrone), although we have used the highest specific radioactivity 14C-labeled andro available. The use of tritium-labeled materials has the disadvantages of potential loss of labels resulting from exchange or isotope effects (depending on the site of labeling).These rate constants (Table 3) could not be used to fit the steady-state andro to estrone conversion (Fig. 7A) using Dynafit software, and Kd values for 19-OH andro and estrone were under predicted. In the case of estrone, the Kd problem may be solved by the addition of an ED ⇆ DE rearrangement step prior to estrone dissociation, as seen in the cases of the other ligands, but stopped-flow spectroscopy data would need to support this approach.In summary, we report the first kinetic mechanism for P450 19A1 resulting from the global fitting of Kd values, pre-steady-state ligand binding experiments, iron-reduction rates, steady-state turnover experiments, pulse-chase assays, and a single turnover time course. The P450 19A1 mechanism, which includes rate constants for each of the three steps in the sequential, three-step reaction, may be useful for modeling other sequential P450s and may aid in the characterization of aromatase inhibitors.

Cytochrome P450s: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These enzymes are found throughout nature, with 57 P450s encoded in the human genome (2Nelson D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). P450s typically catalyze monooxygenation reactions (Fig. 1) and are also capable of reduction, ring expansion, dealkylation, aromatization, and other reactions based on the same high valent iron chemistry (3Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar).An unusual feature of some P450s is the ability to catalyze sequential reactions. These multistep processes are characteristic of some of the P450s involved in steroid metabolism (P450s 11A1, 11B2, 17A1, 19A1, and 51A1), although sequential reactions with non-steroid substrates have also been characterized (e.g. P450s 1A2 (4Sohl C.D.

https://openalex.org/W2087255986,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, requires iron for virulence and can obtain this nutrient via the acquisition of heme, an abundant source of iron in the human body. A surplus of either iron or heme can lead to oxidative stress; thus, the Fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein blocks expression of genes required for iron and heme uptake in iron-replete environments. Fur also represses expression of two nearly identical genes encoding the 116- and 114-nucleotide (nt) long PrrF1 and PrrF2 RNAs, respectively. While other Pseudomonads encode for the two PrrF RNAs at separate genomic loci, PrrF1 and PrrF2 are encoded in tandem in all sequenced strains of P. aeruginosa. In this report we characterize a third longer transcript encoded by the prrF locus, PrrH, which is repressed by heme as well as iron. We mapped the PrrH RNA in PA01 using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and northern analysis, demonstrating the PrrH RNA is 325 nt in length. Accordingly, transcription of PrrH initiates at the 5′ end of prrF1, proceeds through the prrF1 terminator and prrF1-prrF2 intergenic sequence (95 nt), and terminates at the 3′ end of the prrF2 gene. We also present evidence that repression of PrrH by heme causes increased expression of previously identified PrrF-regulated genes, as well as newly identified iron- and heme-activated genes. Thus, the PrrH RNA appears to impart a novel heme regulatory mechanism to P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2071205030,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members are initially synthesized as type II transmembrane proteins, but some of these proteins are substrates for proteolytic enzymes that generate soluble cytokines with biological activity. TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis), a member of the TNF family, is a multifunctional cytokine that acts via binding to a cell surface receptor named Fn14 (fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14). Studies conducted to date indicate that TWEAK-producing cells can co-express both membrane-anchored and soluble TWEAK isoforms, but there is little information on TWEAK proteolytic processing. Also, it is presently unclear whether membrane-anchored TWEAK, like soluble TWEAK, is biologically active. Here we show that full-length human TWEAK is processed intracellularly by the serine protease furin and identify TWEAK amino acid residues 90-93 as the predominant furin recognition site. In addition, we report that full-length, membrane-anchored TWEAK can bind the Fn14 receptor on neighboring cells and activate the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Thus, TWEAK can act in a juxtacrine manner to initiate cellular responses, and this property may be important for TWEAK function during physiological wound repair and disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2017598664,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered a subset of the bulk tumor responsible for initiating and maintaining the disease. Several surface cellular markers have been recently used to identify CSCs. Among those is CD133, which is expressed by hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as embryonic stem cells and various cancers. We have recently isolated and cultured CD133 positive [CD133+] cells from various cancer cell lines using a NASA developed Hydrodynamic Focusing Bioreactor (HFB) (Celdyne, Houston, TX). For comparison, another bioreactor, the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) manufactured by Synthecon (Houston, TX) was used. Both the HFB and the RCCS bioreactors simulate aspects of hypogravity. In our study, the HFB increased CD133+ cell growth from various cell lines compared to the RCCS vessel and to normal gravity control. We observed a +15-fold proliferation of the CD133+ cellular fraction with cancer cells that were cultured for 7-days at optimized conditions. The RCCS vessel instead yielded a (-)4.8-fold decrease in the CD133+cellular fraction respect to the HFB after 7-days of culture. Interestingly, we also found that the hypogravity environment of the HFB greatly sensitized the CD133+ cancer cells, which are normally resistant to chemo treatment, to become susceptible to various chemotherapeutic agents, paving the way to less toxic and more effective chemotherapeutic treatment in patients. To be able to test the efficacy of cytotoxic agents in vitro prior to their use in clinical setting on cancer cells as well as on cancer stem cells may pave the way to more effective chemotherapeutic strategies in patients. This could be an important advancement in the therapeutic options of oncologic patients, allowing for more targeted and personalized chemotherapy regimens as well as for higher response rates."
https://openalex.org/W2026292458,"We analyzed the association between 53 genes related to DNA repair and p53-mediated damage response and serous ovarian cancer risk using case-control data from the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS), a population-based, case-control study.The analysis was restricted to 364 invasive serous ovarian cancer cases and 761 controls of white, non-Hispanic race. Statistical analysis was two staged: a screen using marginal Bayes factors (BFs) for 484 SNPs and a modeling stage in which we calculated multivariate adjusted posterior probabilities of association for 77 SNPs that passed the screen. These probabilities were conditional on subject age at diagnosis/interview, batch, a DNA quality metric and genotypes of other SNPs and allowed for uncertainty in the genetic parameterizations of the SNPs and number of associated SNPs. Six SNPs had Bayes factors greater than 10 in favor of an association with invasive serous ovarian cancer. These included rs5762746 (median OR(odds ratio)(per allele) = 0.66; 95% credible interval (CI) = 0.44-1.00) and rs6005835 (median OR(per allele) = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.53-0.91) in CHEK2, rs2078486 (median OR(per allele) = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.21-2.25) and rs12951053 (median OR(per allele) = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.20-2.26) in TP53, rs411697 (median OR (rare homozygote) = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.35 - 0.79) in BACH1 and rs10131 (median OR( rare homozygote) = not estimable) in LIG4. The six most highly associated SNPs are either predicted to be functionally significant or are in LD with such a variant. The variants in TP53 were confirmed to be associated in a large follow-up study.Based on our findings, further follow-up of the DNA repair and response pathways in a larger dataset is warranted to confirm these results."

In the present study, we determined that CPA4 is secreted from cells as a soluble proenzyme (pro-CPA4) that can be activated by endoproteases, such as trypsin. Three complementary approaches were used to study the substrate specificity of CPA4; kinetic analysis was performed using a new series of chromogenic substrates and some biologically relevant peptides, the cleavage of synthetic peptides was tested individually, and the cleavage of a mixture of >100 mouse brain peptides was examined using a quantitative peptidomics mass spectrometry-based approach. CPA4 was able to cleave hydrophobic C-terminal residues with a preference for Phe, Leu, Ile, Met, Tyr, and Val. However, not all peptides with C-terminal hydrophobic residues were cleaved, indicating the importance of additional residues within the peptide. Aliphatic, aromatic, and basic residues in the P1 position have a positive influence on the cleavage specificity. In contrast, acidic residues, Pro, and Gly have a negative influence in the P1 position. Some of the peptides identified as CPA4 substrates (such as neurotensin, granins, and opioid peptides) have been previously shown to function in cell proliferation and differentiation, potentially explaining the link between CPA4 and cancer aggressiveness. Taken together, these studies suggest that CPA4 functions in neuropeptide processing and regulation in the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2127005688,"Hyperglycemia is acknowledged as an independent risk factor for developing diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. At present, most therapeutic approaches are targeted at a tight glycemic control in diabetic patients, although this fails to prevent macrovascular complications of the disease. Indeed, it remains highly controversial whether or not the mere elevation of extracellular D-glucose can directly promote vascular inflammation, which favors early pro-atherosclerotic events.In the present work, increasing extracellular D-glucose from 5.5 to 22 mmol/L was neither sufficient to induce intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression, analyzed by flow cytometry, nor to promote leukocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro, measured by flow chamber assays. Interestingly, the elevation of D-glucose levels potentiated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion induced by a pro-inflammatory stimulus, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta (5 ng/mL). In HUVEC, high D-glucose augmented the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) elicited by IL-1beta, measured by Western blot and electromobility shift assay (EMSA), respectively, but had no effect by itself. Both ERK 1/2 and NF-kappaB were necessary for VCAM-1 expression, but not for ICAM-1 expression. In vivo, leukocyte trafficking was evaluated in the rat mesenteric microcirculation by intravital microscopy. In accordance with the in vitro data, the acute intraperitoneal injection of D-glucose increased leukocyte rolling flux, adhesion and migration, but only when IL-1beta was co-administered.These results indicate that the elevation of extracellular D-glucose levels is not sufficient to promote vascular inflammation, and they highlight the pivotal role of a pro-inflammatory environment in diabetes, as a critical factor conditioning the early pro-atherosclerotic actions of hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2032452532,"Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by a diverse group of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their ability to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, CDTs are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. Despite the widespread distribution of CDTs among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. Here we demonstrate that CDTs from Haemophilus ducreyi, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in CDT binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. The absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four CDTs tested. Surprisingly, fucosylated N-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in CDT-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the CDTs tested. Finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in CDT binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of CDTs tested.

Thus, it is not surprising that cdt genes are found in a diverse group of Gram-negative pathogens that colonize different niches within the host. Although a growing body of evidence supports the importance of CDTs in bacterial virulence and host-pathogen interactions (6Smith J.L. Bayles D.O. Crit. Rev.

CDTs are AB2 toxins, consisting of a hetero-trimeric complex of three proteins (CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC) at a 1:1:1 molar ratio (5Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends.

The current model is that CdtA and CdtC are the binding “B” moieties that collaborate to facilitate binding and entry of the catalytic “A” subunit, CdtB, into mammalian cells. CdtB shares a common tertiary structure with DNase I and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatase enzymes and displays both activities in cell-free systems (9Elwell C. Chao K. Patel K.

It is not currently known which activity is of greater importance, and this may depend on the specific toxin and/or the host target cell type (12Shenker B.J. Dlakic M. Walker L.P. Besack D. Jaffe E.

CdtB enzymatic activity induces cell cycle arrest predominantly at the G2/M transition, resulting in cellular distension and ultimately cell death (5Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends.

Pathog. 2005; 1: e28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The identification of ricin-like lectin domains in CdtA and CdtC from structural and biochemical data first suggested that these subunits may interact with carbohydrates on the cell surface (13Nesić D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Hu X. Nesic D. Stebbins C.E.

Consistent with this hypothesis, CDT produced by Escherichia coli (Ec-CDT) was reported to require N-linked glycoproteins for binding and subsequent intoxication of HeLa cells (23McSweeney L.A. Dreyfus L.A. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ec-CDT bound fucose in vitro, and fucose-specific lectins blocked Ec-CDT-mediated cell cycle arrest, presumably by preventing binding of toxin to its receptor. These findings suggested that fucose might serve as a binding determinant for Ec-CDT. Similarly, host glycans were reported to support Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa-CDT) intoxication. Specifically, Aa-CDT bound three glycosphingolipids, GM1, GM2, and GM3, and intoxication of human monocytic U937 cells was blocked by preincubation of toxin with liposomes that contained GM3 (24Mise K. Akifusa S. Watarai S. Ansai T. Nishihara T. Takehara T. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the CdtA subunit of Aa-CDT bound to the glycoprotein thyroglobulin (19Cao L. Volgina A. Huang C.M. Korostoff J. DiRienzo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1303-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of this binding is unknown, because mutants that failed to bind thyroglobulin retained near wild-type activity in intoxication assays. In addition to a proposed role for host glycans in CDT binding, Aa-CdtC was recently demonstrated to possess a functional cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif important for binding of toxin to cholesterol-rich microdomains (28Boesze-Battaglia K. Brown A. Walker L. Besack D. Zekavat A. Wrenn S. Krummenacher C. Shenker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10650-10658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how CdtC binding to cholesterol relates to the previously proposed roles for glycolipids or glycoproteins. Further, it is not known whether CDTs from other bacteria possess a functional CRAC motif important for cellular binding and intoxication. To determine if CDTs from various pathogens utilize similar host factors for intoxication, we set out to determine the role of several classes of cell surface biomolecules (i.e. glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and others) in intoxication by four CDTs. We chose to investigate two highly conserved CDTs, Aa-CDT and Haemophilus ducreyi CDT (Hd-CDT), which share 91.9% and 93.5% amino acid identity in their CdtA and CdtC subunits, respectively (5Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends. Microbiol. 1999; 7: 292-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In addition, we chose two CDTs, Ec-CDT and Campylobacter jejuni CDT (Cj-CDT), whose amino acid sequences are divergent (<30% amino acid identity between each other or with Aa/Hd-CDT). These four toxins were selected based on their relative sequence divergence as well as the host niche occupied by the respective CDT-producing pathogen. Specifically, CDTs from two enteric pathogens (E. coli and C. jejuni), an oral pathogen (A. actinomycetemcomitans), and a pathogen responsible for a sexually transmitted disease (H. ducreyi), were investigated. Our results reveal differences in the ability of each of these four CDTs to intoxicate host cells depending on the presence or absence of specific cell surface biomolecules. Furthermore, glycans previously implicated in CDT-host interactions were not required for intoxication by any of the toxins tested. Therefore, we propose that individual CDTs utilize distinct host factors to efficiently intoxicate target cells.

Lec13 and ldlD.Lec1 cells were cultured for 2 days prior to intoxication in F-12 containing 10% FBS dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). HeLa, NIH/3T3, Balb/3T3, and Raw 264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and PSG. IC-21 and OT-1 cells were cultivated in RPMI and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS and PSG. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cloning and expression of CDTs was based on the method previously described (13Nesić D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans (Y4) and E. coli (S5) were obtained from ATCC and C. jejuni (81–176) from Patricia Guerry (Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD). Genomic DNA was purified from mid-log-phase cultures using the Wizard DNA Purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Genomic DNA of H. ducreyi (35000HP) was obtained from ATCC. cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC genes (Aa GI: 3786340, Hd GI: 2102681, Ec GI: 2218088, and Cj GI: 15791399) were PCR-amplified using primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of each gene (Table 1). These primers were engineered such that 5′ NdeI and 3′ BamHI restriction sites (underlined in Table 1) were incorporated into the amplicon. Each PCR product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified amplicons and pET15b vector were digested with NdeI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) to generate directional annealing sites. Digested vector and amplicons were ligated and electroporated into E. coli DH5α. The integrity of each gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) strains transformed with cdt expression plasmids were grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB+amp) at 37 °C with continuous aeration. Starter cultures were diluted 1:400 into fresh LB+amp and grown until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4–0.6 at which point expression of Cdt was induced by addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fisher). Cultures were grown for an additional 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of PBS (8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 0.2 g of KH2PO4, and 1.15 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O in 1 liter) containing 8 m urea and disrupted by sonication (six 30-s cycles at 23 kHz and 30 watts) using Model 100 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher). Cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing proteins were incubated with 3 ml of Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The resin was washed with buffer A (8 m urea, 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and eluted with buffer A plus 100 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were quantified using the Bradford Protein Assay and purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stored in elution buffer at −20 °C. At time of use, proteins were diluted to 100 μg/ml with buffer A and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) using 6–8 kDa MWCO membranes (Spectrum Laboratories). Two final buffer changes were conducted in 3-liter volumes of PBS containing 5% glycerol and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol.TABLE 1Primer sequences for PCR amplification of CDTPrimerDirectionPrimer sequence (5′ → 3′)Aa-CdtAForwardGGAGTTCCATATGAGTGACTATTCTCAGCCTGAa-CdtAReverseCGGGATCCTTAATTAACCGCTGTTGCAa-CdtBForwardGGAGTTCCATATGAACTTGAGTGATTTCAAAGTAGCAa-CdtBReverseCGGGATCCTTAGCGATCATGAACAAAACTAACAGGAa-CdtCForwardGGAGTTCCATATGGAATCAAATCCTGATCCGAa-CdtCReverseCGGGATCCTTAGCTACCCTGATTTCTCCHd-CdtAForwardGGAGTTCCATATGAATGACTATTCTCAACCTGAATCTCHd-CdtAReverseCGGGATCCTTAATTAACCGCTGTTGCHd-CdtBForwardGGAGTTCCATATGAACTTGAGTGACTTCAAAGTAGHd-CdtBReverseCGGGATCCTTAGCGATCACGAACAAAACTAACAGHd-CdtCForwardGGAGTTCCATATGGAATCAAATCCTGATCCGACHd-CdtCReverseCGGGATCCTTAGCTACCCTGATTTCTTCEc-CdtAForwardGGAGTTCCATATGCATCTTGACCCCAAAGEc-CdtAReverseCGGGATCCTCATTGTTCGCCTCCTGEc-CdtBForwardGGAGTTCCATATGGATTTAACTGATTTTCGCGTTGEc-CdtBReverseCGGGATCCTTATCGTCTGGAAACGEc-CdtCForwardGGAGTTCCATATGGTCAATAATCAGATAGATGAGTTAGEc-CdtCReverseCGGGATCCTTAAATAACAGGAGATTCTGTATTTAATGCj-CdtAForwardGGAGTTCCATATGTGTTCTTCTAAATTTGAAAATGTAAATCCCj-CdtAReverseCGGGATCCTCATCGTACCTCTCCCj-CdtBForwardGGAGTTCCATATGAATTTAGAAAATTTTAATGTTGGCACTTGGCj-CdtBReverseCGGGATCCCTAAAATTTTCTAAAATTTACTGGAAAATGATCTGAAACCj-CdtCForwardGGAGTTCCATATGACTCCTACTGGAGATTTGAAAGATTTTACCCj-CdtCReverseCGGGATCCTTATTCTAAAGGGGTAGCAGC Open table in a new tab Mammalian cells were trypsinized, counted, and allowed to adhere overnight in 6- or 384-well plates. The following day, medium was removed and toxin-containing medium was added for 10 min or 24 h as indicated in the figure legends. The concentration of toxin was selected to illustrate the presence or absence of a genetic or pharmacological effect on intoxication and differed depending on cell line and/or conditions used (Aa-CDT, 2–200 nm; Hd-CDT, 0.1–75 nm; Ec-CDT, 5–900 nm; and Cj-CDT, 50–1500 nm). Twenty-four hours after toxin addition, cells were analyzed for phosphorylation of histone 2AX (H2AX) or cell cycle arrest as described below. All results presented are representative of three or more independent experiments. Cells were intoxicated for 24 h in clear bottom 384-well plates then fixed with 2% formaldehyde, quenched with 100 mm glycine, and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol. The cells were subsequently blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-H2AX antibody (Cell Signal Technologies) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Cytometric acquisition was performed on four 20× scan fields using an iCys laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte) equipped with argon and violet diode lasers. Cytometric data analysis was conducted with iCys version 3.4 software (CompuCyte). CHO glycosylation mutants and unmutagenized parental strains were intoxicated in 6-well plates for either 10 min or 24 h, then washed with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS, Cellgro), detached with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), washed again with DPBS, and permeabilized with 60% ethanol for 30 min on ice. After washing again, cells were stained with a 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) solution containing 1 mg/ml sodium citrate, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and 20 μg/ml RNase-A. The fluorescence was quantified for 104 cells using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest acquisition software (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry data were subsequently analyzed using FloJo analysis software (Tree Star). Cell surface glycan presentation was measured using the FITC-conjugated lectins (EY Laboratories) concanavalin A, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin, Lens culinaris agglutinin, Maclura pomifera agglutinin, Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin, Pisum sativum agglutinin, Ulex europus agglutinin (UEA), and wheat germ agglutinin. Cells were detached as described above, mixed with an equal volume of complete media containing FBS, washed with DPBS, and resuspended in DPBS containing the manufacturer-recommended concentration of FITC-labeled lectin at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed with DPBS three times and resuspended in DPBS containing 1% formaldehyde (EMD Chemicals). Fluorescence was quantified as described above. To inhibit N-linked glycosylation, CHO-K1 cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 days prior to intoxication. For cholesterol loading of CHO cells, 15 mg of cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) was solubilized by dissolving 15 mg in 0.4 ml of methanol:chloroform (2:1), then adding dropwise into 20 ml of PBS containing 0.37 g of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich) and stirred for 2 h at 80 °C. The solution was dried in a rotary-evaporator and resuspended in 6 ml of F-12 media (2.5 mg/ml cholesterol final). Cells were washed in serum-free F-12 media, incubated in solubilized cholesterol for 1 h, and washed in complete F-12 media three times. Following tunicamycin treatment, cholesterol loading, or both, the cells were intoxicated for 10 min, followed by a 24-h incubation, and analyzed for cell cycle arrest as described above. Cholesterol was quantified by the use of Amplex Red reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were washed three times in PBS and detached using 1 mm EDTA in PBS. After centrifugation, cells were lysed by resuspension in 100 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm cholic acid, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Lysates were added to an equal volume of the working Amplex Red assay buffer (prepared according to manufacturer's instructions). Fluorescence was measured with a Flexstation II microplate reader (Molecular Devices) using excitation at 560 nm and detection at 590 nm. Cholesterol levels were determined by comparing fluorescence values to a standard curve and normalizing to protein content as determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Fucosyltransferase 1 (Fut1) cDNA was PCR-amplified from pCDM7 (33Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The amplicon was digested with XhoI and EcoRI (engineered restriction sites are underlined in primer sequences), gel-purified, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) into the retroviral vector pMSCVpuro (Clontech). A similar subcloning strategy was undertaken for Fut2–9. Plasmid DNA was purified and transfected into human 293 cells along with murine leukemia virus gag/pol and vesicular stomatitis virus G-spike protein expression plasmids as previously described (34Bradley K.A.

Forty-eight hours later, resulting retroviral particles were harvested, filter-sterilized, diluted 1:1 in fresh media with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich), and used to transduce cells in a 6-well plate. Cells were incubated with viral particles overnight. After 48 h, transduced cells were selected in medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. To deplete glycosylated sphingolipids, CHO-K1 cells were cultured in the presence of 5 μm 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 days then intoxicated for 24 h. Cell lines deficient in serine-palmitoyl transferase (LY-B) and the complimented counterpart LY-B/cLCB1 were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank. These cells were cultured in F-12 media containing PSG, 10 μm sodium oleate, 1× nutridoma (Roche Applied Science), and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 days prior to intoxication. CDTs are able to intoxicate a wide variety of cell types derived from multiple species and progenitor tissues, indicating that each individual CDT utilizes receptor(s) and entry processes that are conserved among different hosts and target cells (5Pickett C.L. Whitehouse C.A. Trends. Microbiol. 1999; 7: 292-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To test whether host factors required for intoxication are shared between different CDTs, we set out to quantify the level of sensitivity to Ec-, Hd-, Aa-, and Cj-CDTs in a series of diverse cell lines. We intoxicated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and HeLa cells, which represent epithelial cells commonly used for CDT studies, as well as T-cells (OT-1) and macrophage-like cells (RAW 264.7 and IC-21), which are proposed to be important targets for CDTs in vivo (35Shenker B.J. Hoffmaster R.H. McKay T.L. Demuth D.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, we intoxicated 3T3 fibroblasts and Y-1 adrenal cells, which were reported to be resistant to Ec-, Hd-, and Cj-CDTs (16Johnson W.M. Lior H. Microb.

Phosphorylation of the histone protein H2AX is a characteristic of double-stranded DNA breaks and has been used to monitor CDT intoxication (39Li L. Sharipo A. Chaves-Olarte E. Masucci M.G. Levitsky V. Thelestam M. Frisan T. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, CDT intoxication was assayed by immunofluorescence staining for phosphorylated H2AX (phospho-H2AX) followed by laser scanning cytometry. As predicted, 3T3 fibroblasts derived from NIH or BALB/c mice, as well as Y-1 cells, were highly resistant to Ec- and Hd-CDT intoxication (Fig. 2). This result was not due to an altered DNA damage response, because all cell lines tested induced phospho-H2AX in response to UV light-mediated DNA damage (data not shown). Consistent with its high sequence similarity with Hd-CDT, Aa-CDT was also ineffective at inducing H2AX phosphorylation in 3T3 or Y-1 cells (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Surprisingly, Cj-CDT efficiently intoxicated all three of these cell lines (Fig. 2), demonstrating for the first time that CDTs derived from different bacteria display variable target cell tropism. These data combined with the fact that the CdtB subunits from these four CDTs display similar enzymatic activities in vitro 7A. Gargi, B. Powers, and S. R. Blanke, data not shown. support a model whereby Cj-CDT utilizes a receptor and/or entry pathway that is distinct from the three other toxins (Aa-, Hd-, and Ec-CDTs). Further, Ec-CDT efficiently intoxicated CHO-K1 cells but displayed low to undetectable activity on all other cell types. This result was opposite the pattern seen with Cj-CDT, which efficiently intoxicated all cell types except CHO-K1 (Fig. 2). Although Aa- and Hd-CDTs were poorly active against 3T3 and Y-1 cells, these two toxins were more active than Ec- or Cj-CDTs on CHO-K1 and HeLa cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Aa- and Hd-CDT utilize a common set of host factors for intoxication that are distinct from those utilized by either Ec-CDT or Cj-CDT. Further, Ec-CDT appears to inter"
https://openalex.org/W2036098891,"A proteomic study was conducted to investigate physiological factors affecting feeding behaviour by larvae of the insect, Plutella xylostella, on herbivore-susceptible and herbivore-resistant Arabidopsis thaliana. The leaves of 162 recombinant inbred lines (Rils) were screened to detect genotypes upon which Plutella larvae fed least (P. xylostella-resistant) or most (P. xylostella-susceptible). 2D-PAGE revealed significant differences in the proteomes between the identified resistant and susceptible Rils. The proteomic results, together with detection of increased production of hydrogen peroxide in resistant Rils, suggest a correlation between P. xylostella resistance and the production of increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular H2O2, and that this was expressed prior to herbivory. Many of the proteins that were more abundant in the Plutella-resistant Rils are known in other biological systems to be involved in limiting ROS damage. Such proteins included carbonic anhydrases, malate dehydrogenases, glutathione S-transferases, isocitrate dehydrogenase-like protein (R1), and lipoamide dehydrogenase. In addition, patterns of germin-like protein 3 isoforms could also be indicative of higher levels of reactive oxygen species in the resistant Rils. Consistent with the occurrence of greater oxidative stress in the resistant Rils is the observation of greater abundance in susceptible Rils of polypeptides of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex, which are known to be damaged under oxidative stress. The combined results suggest that enhanced production of ROS may be a major pre-existing mechanism of Plutella resistance in Arabidopsis, but definitive corroboration of this requires much further work."
https://openalex.org/W2006003520,"Background A central tenet of structural biology is that related proteins of common function share structural similarity. This has key practical consequences for the derivation and analysis of protein structures, and is exploited by the process of “molecular sieving” whereby a common core is progressively distilled from a comparison of two or more protein structures. This paper reports a novel web server for “sieving” of protein structures, based on the multiple structural alignment program MUSTANG. Methodology/Principal Findings “Sieved” models are generated from MUSTANG-generated multiple alignment and superpositions by iteratively filtering out noisy residue-residue correspondences, until the resultant correspondences in the models are optimally “superposable” under a threshold of RMSD. This residue-level sieving is also accompanied by iterative elimination of the poorly fitting structures from the input ensemble. Therefore, by varying the thresholds of RMSD and the cardinality of the ensemble, multiple sieved models are generated for a given multiple alignment and superposition from MUSTANG. To aid the identification of structurally conserved regions of functional importance in an ensemble of protein structures, Lesk-Hubbard graphs are generated, plotting the number of residue correspondences in a superposition as a function of its corresponding RMSD. The conserved “core” (or typically active site) shows a linear trend, which becomes exponential as divergent parts of the structure are included into the superposition. Conclusions The application addresses two fundamental problems in structural biology: First, the identification of common substructures among structurally related proteins—an important problem in characterization and prediction of function; second, generation of sieved models with demonstrated uses in protein crystallographic structure determination using the technique of Molecular Replacement."

https://openalex.org/W1966946965,"Background Falciparum Malaria, an infectious disease caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is among the leading causes of death and morbidity attributable to infectious diseases worldwide. In Gabon, Central Africa, one out of four inpatients have severe malarial anemia (SMA), a life-threatening complication if left untreated. Emerging drug resistant parasites might aggravate the situation. This case control study investigates biomarkers of enhanced hemolysis in hospitalized children with either SMA or mild malaria (MM). Methods and Findings Ninety-one children were included, thereof 39 SMA patients. Strict inclusion criteria were chosen to exclude other causes of anemia. At diagnosis, erythrophagocytosis (a direct marker for extravascular hemolysis, EVH) was enhanced in SMA compared to MM patients (5.0 arbitrary units (AU) (interquartile range (IR): 2.2–9.6) vs. 2.1 AU (IR: 1.3–3.9), p<0.01). Furthermore, indirect markers for EVH, (i.e. serum neopterin levels, spleen size enlargement and monocyte pigment) were significantly increased in SMA patients. Markers for erythrocyte ageing, such as CD35 (complement receptor 1), CD55 (decay acceleration factor) and phosphatidylserine exposure (annexin-V-binding) were investigated by flow cytometry. In SMA patients, levels of CD35 and CD55 on the red blood cell surface were decreased and erythrocyte removal markers were increased when compared to MM or reconvalescent patients. Additionally, intravascular hemolysis (IVH) was quantified using several indirect markers (LDH, α-HBDH, haptoglobin and hemopexin), which all showed elevated IVH in SMA. The presence of both IVH and EVH predicted the need for blood transfusion during antimalarial treatment (odds ratio 61.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.9–427). Interestingly, this subpopulation is characterized by a significantly lowered reticulocyte production index (RPI, p<0.05). Conclusions Our results show the multifactorial pathophysiology of SMA, whereby EVH and IVH play a particularly important role. We propose a model where removal of infected and non-infected erythrocytes of all ages (including reticulocytes) by EVH and IVH is a main mechanism of SMA. Further studies are underway to investigate the mechanism and extent of reticulocyte removal to identify possible interventions to reduce the risk of SMA development."
https://openalex.org/W2099180070,"Background Cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in Escherichia coli includes numerous mechanisms involving pH-dependent catabolism and ion fluxes. An important contributor is transmembrane K+ flux, but the actual basis of K+ compensation for pH stress remains unclear. Osmoprotection could mediate the pH protection afforded by K+ and other osmolytes. Methods and Principal Findings The cytoplasmic pH of E. coli K-12 strains was measured by GFPmut3 fluorimetry. The wild-type strain Frag1 was exposed to rapid external acidification by HCl addition. Recovery of cytoplasmic pH was enhanced equally by supplementation with NaCl, KCl, proline, or sucrose. A triple mutant strain TK2420 defective for the Kdp, Trk and Kup K+ uptake systems requires exogenous K+ for steady-state pH homeostasis and for recovery from sudden acid shift. The K+ requirement however was partly compensated by supplementation with NaCl, choline chloride, proline, or sucrose. Thus, the K+ requirement was mediated in part by osmolarity, possibly by relieving osmotic stress which interacts with pH stress. The rapid addition of KCl to strain TK2420 suspended at external pH 5.6 caused a transient decrease in cytoplasmic pH, followed by slow recovery to an elevated steady-state pH. In the presence of 150 mM KCl, however, rapid addition of another 150 mM KCl caused a transient increase in cytoplasmic pH. These transient effects may arise from secondary K+ fluxes occurring through other transport processes in the TK2420 strain. Conclusions Diverse osmolytes including NaCl, KCl, proline, or sucrose contribute to cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in E. coli, and increase the recovery from rapid acid shift. Osmolytes other than K+ restore partial pH homeostasis in a strain deleted for K+ transport."

It is activated downstream of the MEK/ERKs cascade by mitogenic stimuli such as EGF or TPA. Here, we show that RSK2 is activated by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and directly phosphorylates IkappaBalpha at Ser-32, leading to IkappaBalpha degradation. The phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha promotes the activation and translocation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) subunits p65 and p50 to the nucleus. The net result is an increased NF-kappaB activity, which serves as a mechanism for RSK2 blockade of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and enhanced cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W2049038897,"NF-kappaB family members play a pivotal role in many cellular and organismal functions, including the cell cycle. As an activator of cyclin D1 and p21(Waf1) genes, NF-kappaB has been regarded as a critical modulator of cell cycle. To study the involvement of NF-kappaB in G(1)/S phase regulation, the levels of selected transcriptional regulators were monitored following overexpression of NF-kappaB or its physiological induction by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Cyclin E gene was identified as a major transcriptional target of NF-kappaB. Recruitment of NF-kappaB to the cyclin E promoter was correlated with the transrepression of cyclin E gene. Ligation-mediated PCR and micrococcal nuclease-Southern assays suggested the nucleosomal nature of this region while chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the exchange of cofactors following tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment or release from serum starvation. There was a progressive reduction in cyclin E transcription along with the accumulation of catalytically inactive cyclin E-cdk2 complexes and arrest of cells in G(1)/S-phase. Thus, our study clearly establishes NF-kappaB as a negative regulator of cell cycle through transcriptional repression of cyclin E."

Several studies have shown that the formation of condensed chromatin is highly regulated during development, suggesting that SU(VAR)3-9's activity is regulated as well. However, no mechanism by which this may be achieved has been reported so far. As we and others had shown previously that the N-terminus of SU(VAR)3-9 plays an important role for its activity, we purified interaction partners from Drosophila embryo nuclear extract using as bait a GST fusion protein containing the SU(VAR)3-9 N-terminus. Among several other proteins known to bind Su(VAR)3-9 we isolated the chromosomal kinase JIL-1 as a strong interactor. We show that SU(VAR)3-9 is a substrate for JIL-1 in vitro as well as in vivo and map the site of phosphorylation. These findings may provide a molecular explanation for the observed genetic interaction between SU(VAR)3-9 and JIL-1."
https://openalex.org/W1994396304,"Steller sea lions experienced a dramatic population collapse of more than 80% in the late 1970s through the 1990s across their western range in Alaska. One of several competing hypotheses about the cause holds that reduced female reproductive rates (natality) substantively contributed to the decline and continue to limit recovery in the Gulf of Alaska despite the fact that there have been very few attempts to directly measure natality in this species. We conducted a longitudinal study of natality among individual Steller sea lions (n = 151) at a rookery and nearby haulouts in Kenai Fjords, Gulf of Alaska during 2003-2009. Multi-state models were built and tested in Program MARK to estimate survival, resighting, and state transition probabilities dependent on whether or not a female gave birth in the previous year. The models that most closely fit the data suggested that females which gave birth had a higher probability of surviving and giving birth in the following year compared to females that did not give birth, indicating some females are more fit than others. Natality, estimated at 69%, was similar to natality for Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska prior to their decline (67%) and much greater than the published estimate for the 2000s (43%) which was hypothesized from an inferential population dynamic model. Reasons for the disparity are discussed, and could be resolved by additional longitudinal estimates of natality at this and other rookeries over changing ocean climate regimes. Such estimates would provide an appropriate assessment of a key parameter of population dynamics in this endangered species which has heretofore been lacking. Without support for depressed natality as the explanation for a lack of recovery of Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska, alternative hypotheses must be more seriously considered."
https://openalex.org/W1997653708,"Perturbation of lipid metabolism, especially of cholesterol homeostasis, can be catastrophic to mammalian brain, as it has the highest level of cholesterol in the body. This notion is best illustrated by the severe progressive neurodegeneration in Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease, one of the lysosomal storage diseases, caused by mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. In this study, we found that growth cone collapse induced by genetic or pharmacological disruption of cholesterol egress from late endosomes/lysosomes was directly related to a decrease in axonal and growth cone levels of the phosphorylated form of the tumor suppressor factor p53. Cholesterol perturbation-induced growth cone collapse and decrease in phosphorylated p53 were reduced by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and murine double minute (Mdm2) E3 ligase. Growth cone collapse induced by genetic (npc1−/−) or pharmacological modification of cholesterol metabolism was Rho kinase (ROCK)-dependent and associated with increased RhoA protein synthesis; both processes were significantly reduced by P38 MAPK or Mdm2 inhibition. Finally, in vivo ROCK inhibition significantly increased phosphorylated p53 levels and neurofilaments in axons, and axonal bundle size in npc1−/− mice. These results indicate that NPC-related and cholesterol perturbation-induced axonal pathology is associated with an abnormal signaling pathway consisting in p38 MAPK activation leading to Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation, followed by ROCK activation. These results also suggest new targets for pharmacological treatment of NPC disease and other diseases associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism."

In addition, P-gp plays a role in normal physiological processes, however our understanding of these P-gp functions remains limited. In this study we investigated the effects of the P-gp inhibitor GF120918 in Toxoplasma gondii, a model apicomplexan parasite and an important human pathogen. We found that GF120918 treatment severely inhibited parasite invasion and replication. Further analyses of the molecular mechanisms involved revealed that the P-gp inhibitor modulated parasite motility, microneme secretion and egress from the host cell, all cellular processes known to depend on Ca2+ signaling in the parasite. In support of a potential role of P-gp in Ca2+-mediated processes, immunoelectron and fluorescence microscopy showed that T. gondii P-gp was localized in acidocalcisomes, the major Ca2+ storage in the parasite, at the plasma membrane, and in the intravacuolar tubular network. In addition, metabolic labeling of extracellular parasites revealed that inhibition or down-regulation of T. gondii P-gp resulted in aberrant lipid synthesis. These results suggest a crucial role of T. gondii P-gp in essential processes of the parasite biology and further validate the potential of P-gp activity as a target for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2006541103,"Tumor development, growth, and metastasis depend on the provision of an adequate vascular supply. This can be due to regulated angiogenesis, recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitors, and/or vascular transdifferentiation. Our previous studies showed that retinoic acid (RA) treatment converts a subset of breast cancer cells into cells with significant endothelial genotypic and phenotypic elements including marked induction of VE-cadherin, which was responsible for some but not all morphological changes. The present study demonstrates that of the endothelial-related genes induced by RA treatment, only a few were affected by knockdown of VE-cadherin, ruling it out as a regulator of the RA-induced endothelial genotypic switch. In contrast, knockdown of the RA-induced gene COUP-TFII prevented the formation of networks in Matrigel but had no effect on VE-cadherin induction or cell fusion. Two pan-kinase inhibitors markedly blocked RA-induced VE-cadherin expression and cell fusion. However, RA treatment resulted in a marked and broad reduction in tyrosine kinase activity. Several genes in the TGFbeta signaling pathway were induced by RA, and specific inhibition of the TGFbeta type I receptor blocked both RA-induced VE-cadherin expression and cell fusion. Together these data indicate a role for the TGFbeta pathway and COUP-TFII in mediating the endothelial transdifferentiating properties of RA."
https://openalex.org/W2005409790,"Wound healing is a complex process involving intrinsic dermal and epidermal cells, and infiltrating macrophages and leukocytes. Excessive oxidative stress and associated inflammatory processes can impair wound healing, and antioxidants have been reported to improve wound healing in animal models and human subjects. Uric acid (UA) is an efficient free radical scavenger, but has a very low solubility and poor tissue penetrability. We recently developed novel UA analogs with increased solubility and excellent free radical-scavenging properties and demonstrated their ability to protect neural cells against oxidative damage. Here we show that the uric acid analog (6, 8 dithio-UA, but not equimolar concentrations of UA or 1, 7 dimethyl-UA) modified the behaviors of cultured vascular endothelial cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts in ways consistent with enhancement of the wound healing functions of all three cell types. We further show that 6, 8 dithio-UA significantly accelerates the wound healing process when applied topically (once daily) to full-thickness wounds in mice. Levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase were increased in wound tissue from mice treated with 6, 8 dithio-UA compared to vehicle-treated mice, suggesting that the UA analog enhances endogenous cellular antioxidant defenses. These results support an adverse role for oxidative stress in wound healing and tissue repair, and provide a rationale for the development of UA analogs in the treatment of wounds and for modulation of angiogenesis in other pathological conditions."

In this study, we further explore the relationship between the subunits Not4p and Bur2p. Methodology/Principal Findings First, we investigated the presence of post-translational modifications on the Ccr4-Not complex. Using mass spectrometry analyses we identified several SP/TP phosphorylation sites on its Not4p, Not1p and Caf1p subunits. Secondly, the influence of Not4p phosphorylation on global H3K4 tri-methylation status was examined by immunoblotting. This histone mark is severely diminished in the absence of Not4p or of Bur2p, but did not require the five identified Not4p phosphorylation sites. Thirdly, we found that Not4p phosphorylation is not affected by the kinase-defective bur1-23 mutant. Finally, phenotypic analyses of the Not4p phosphomutant (not4S/T5A) and bur2Δ strains showed overlapping sensitivities to drugs that abolish cellular stress responses. The double-mutant not4S/T5A and bur2Δ strain even revealed enhanced phenotypes, indicating that phosphorylation of Not4p and BUR2 are active in parallel pathways for drug tolerance. Conclusions Not4p is a phospho-protein with five identified phosphorylation sites that are likely targets of a cyclin-dependent kinase(s) other than the Bur1/2p complex. Not4p phosphorylation on the five Not4 S/T sites is not required for global H3K4 tri-methylation. In contrast, Not4p phosphorylation is involved in tolerance to cellular stresses and acts in pathways parallel to BUR2 to affect stress responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."

For instance, type I interferons (IFN)s have been demonstrated to exacerbate the course of Chlamydial lung infections in mice.Here we show that Chlamydia pneumoniae induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)s dependent on recognition by nucleotide-sensing Toll-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors, localized in endosomes and the cytoplasm, respectively. The ISG response was induced with a delayed kinetics, compared to virus infections, and was dependent on bacterial replication and the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS).Activation of the IFN response during C. pneumoniae infection is mediated by intracellular nucleotide-sensing PRRs, which operate through a mechanism dependent on the bacterial T3SS. Strategies to inhibit the chlamydial T3SS may be used to limit the detrimental effects of the type I IFN system in the host response to Chlamydia infection."
https://openalex.org/W2087810045,"Symmetry detection is an interesting probe of pattern processing because it requires the matching of novel patterns without the benefit of prior recognition. However, there is evidence that prior knowledge of the axis location plays an important role in symmetry detection. We investigated how the prior information about the symmetry axis affects symmetry detection under noise-masking conditions. The target stimuli were random-dot displays structured to be symmetric about vertical, horizontal, or diagonal axes and viewed through eight apertures (1.2 degrees diameter) evenly distributed around a 6 degrees diameter circle. The information about axis orientation was manipulated by (1) cueing of axis orientation before the trial and (2) varying axis salience by including or excluding the axis region within the noise apertures. The percentage of correct detection of the symmetry was measured at for a range of both target and masking noise densities. The threshold vs. noise density function was flat at low noise density and increased with a slope of 0.75-0.8 beyond a critical density. Axis cueing reduced the target threshold 2-4 fold at all noise densities while axis salience had an effect only at high noise density. Our results are inconsistent with an ideal observer or signal-to-noise account of symmetry detection but can be explained by a multiple-channel model is which the response in each channel is the ratio between the nonlinear transform of the responses of sets of early symmetry detectors and the sum of external and intrinsic sources of noise."
https://openalex.org/W2032606924,"Background The crystallographic determination of protein structures can be computationally demanding and for difficult cases can benefit from user-friendly interfaces to high-performance computing resources. Molecular replacement (MR) is a popular protein crystallographic technique that exploits the structural similarity between proteins that share some sequence similarity. But the need to trial permutations of search models, space group symmetries and other parameters makes MR time- and labour-intensive. However, MR calculations are embarrassingly parallel and thus ideally suited to distributed computing. In order to address this problem we have developed MrGrid, web-based software that allows multiple MR calculations to be executed across a grid of networked computers, allowing high-throughput MR. Methodology/Principal Findings MrGrid is a portable web based application written in Java/JSP and Ruby, and taking advantage of Apple Xgrid technology. Designed to interface with a user defined Xgrid resource the package manages the distribution of multiple MR runs to the available nodes on the Xgrid. We evaluated MrGrid using 10 different protein test cases on a network of 13 computers, and achieved an average speed up factor of 5.69. Conclusions MrGrid enables the user to retrieve and manage the results of tens to hundreds of MR calculations quickly and via a single web interface, as well as broadening the range of strategies that can be attempted. This high-throughput approach allows parameter sweeps to be performed in parallel, improving the chances of MR success."
