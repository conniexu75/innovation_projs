https://openalex.org/W2010530988,"The western United States is experiencing a severe multiyear drought that is unprecedented in some hydroclimatic records. Using gridded drought reconstructions that cover most of the western United States over the past 1200 years, we show that this drought pales in comparison to an earlier period of elevated aridity and epic drought in AD 900 to 1300, an interval broadly consistent with the Medieval Warm Period. If elevated aridity in the western United States is a natural response to climate warming, then any trend toward warmer temperatures in the future could lead to a serious long-term increase in aridity over western North America."

Phosphorylation induced by multiple stress-activated kinases has been proposed to be essential for p53 stabilization, interaction with transcriptional co-activators, and activation of p53 target genes. However, genetic studies suggest that stress-activated phosphorylation may not be essential for p53 activation. We therefore investigated the role of p53 phosphorylation on six key serine residues (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392) for p53 activation using nutlin-3, a recently developed small molecule MDM2 antagonist. We show here that nutlin does not induce the phosphorylation of p53. Comparison of the activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide in HCT116 and RKO cells revealed no difference in their sequence-specific DNA binding and ability to transactivate p53 target genes and to induce p53-dependent apoptosis. We conclude that p53 phosphorylation on six major serine sites is not required for activation of p53 target genes or biological responses in vivo.

We conclude that p53 phosphorylation on six major serine sites is not required for activation of p53 target genes or biological responses in vivo. The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that coordinates a complex network of cellular proteins evolved to protect cells from malignant transformation (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5744) Google Scholar). In response to diverse stress factors, p53 induces the expression of different subsets of genes leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, or senescence. In cells that are not under stress, p53 activation could suppress their growth or induce apoptosis were it not for the tight regulation elicited by MDM2 (3Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The MDM2 gene expression is regulated in part by a p53-responsive promoter. In turn, MDM2 protein binds the p53 N-terminal transactivation domain and negatively regulates tumor suppressor function by compromising transcriptional regulation. Additionally, as MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and itself, MDM2 controls p53 half-life via ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This negative feedback control mechanism assures that both p53 and MDM2 proteins are kept at very low levels in proliferating cells (4Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar).In response to stress, the p53-MDM2 interaction must be disrupted to enable p53 to associate with factors needed for activation of its target genes. Stress-induced p53 activation involves post-translational modification of p53 on multiple sites by phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5744) Google Scholar, 5Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and modifications to MDM2 that can enhance MDM2 autoubiquitination and degradation (6Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). With regard to p53 modifications, phosphorylation has been studied most intensively and has been proposed to play a critical role in the stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor. These studies have been greatly facilitated by the availability of antibodies that recognize p53 modified on specific phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues (for review, see Ref. 7Apella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Multiple serine (6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37, 46, 315, 371, 376, 378, and 392) and three threonine residues (18, 55, and 81) have been reported to undergo phosphorylation in response to diverse stresses. Multiple serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in the upstream signaling leading to p53 phosphorylation (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, Chk2, CK1, p38, CDK2, PKC, JNK), but the precise mechanism of this signaling and its regulation are not well understood (8Jimenez G.S. Khan S.H. Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7656-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Residues from the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain of p53 (Ser20 and Thr18) have been shown to play a critical role in the interaction between the two proteins and their stress-induced phosphorylation decreases substantially the affinity between p53 and MDM2 when analyzed in vitro using peptide substrates (10Sakaguchi K.

Biol. 2002; 323: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These and other studies (7Apella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 13Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7666-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of p53 is a key mechanism responsible for activation of the tumor suppressor in response to cellular stress.In addition to its proposed role in abrogation of p53-MDM2 binding and stabilization of the protein, p53 phosphorylation has also been implicated in regulation of its activity. However, this aspect of p53 phosphorylation is still poorly understood and controversial. Transcriptional activity of p53 is of principal importance for its function as a tumor suppressor. It has been suggested that phosphorylation at specific residues can affect the transcriptional activity of p53 and/or its selectivity toward different subset of genes thus determining the specific type of cellular response to stress (5Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 8Jimenez G.S. Khan S.H. Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7656-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activity of p53 as a transcription factor may be influenced by several factors: (a) ability to form active tetramers, (b) sequence-specific DNA binding, and (c) interaction with other components of the transcriptional machinery. It has been reported that Ser315 and Ser392 phosphorylation may regulate the oligomerization of p53 and thus its sequence-specific DNA binding (14Wang Y. Prives C.

Ser15 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance the interaction of p53 with transcriptional co-activators CBP and PCAF (10Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A.

Stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser46 has been implicated in the activation of p53-dependent apoptotic response (20D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M.

Recently, prolyl isomerase Pin1 has been reported to bind p53 and enhance its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. This binding is dependent on DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 (22Zheng H. You H. Zhou X.Z. Murray S.A. Uchida T. Wulf G. Gu L. Tang X. Lu K.P. Xiao Z.X. Nature. 2002; 419: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Zacchi P. Gostissa M. Uchida T. Salvagno C. Avolio F. Volinia S. Ronai Z. Blandino G. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Nature. 2002; 419: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that p53 phosphorylation may play an important role not only in stabilization of p53 but also in modulation of its transcriptional activity. On the other hand, experiments in which almost all phosphorylation sites in p53 have been mutated demonstrated that transiently expressed phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 do not differ significantly in their stability or ability to transactivate reporter genes in p53-null cells (24Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies using mouse mutants with substitutions of Ser15 or Ser20 suggest that these residues are not essential for p53 activation (25Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Chao C. Hergenhahn M. Kaeser M.D. Wu Z. Saito S. Iggo R. Hollstein M. Appella E. Xu Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Recently, we reported the identification of the first potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction, the nutlins (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). These compounds bind MDM2 in the p53 binding pocket with high selectivity and can release p53 from negative control leading to effective stabilization of p53 and activation of the p53 pathway in vitro and in vivo. Nutlins are non-genotoxic and activate p53 by preventing it from binding to MDM2 (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). They do not bind to p53 protein and do not interfere with its activities. Treatment of cultured cells with MDM2 antagonists cause accumulation of p53 protein that is free of phosphorylation on Ser15 (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). Therefore, nutlins may represent valuable molecular tools for studying the role of p53 phosphorylation in its natural cellular context. Here, we show that p53 induced by the MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3, is not phosphorylated on six key serine residues. Despite the lack of detectable phosphorylation, nutlin-induced p53 showed equal or better sequence-specific DNA binding, ability to transactivate p53 target genes, and p53-dependent apoptotic activity than phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide. Our results provide further support to the notion that separating MDM2 from p53 is an important step in p53 activation, but phosphorylation is not required for execution of p53 biological functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Drug Treatment—HCT116 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and RKO cells were a gift from Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center). Both cell lines have been derived from human colon cancer and possess wild-type p53. Cells were grown in the recommended media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Media and serum were purchased from Invitrogen. For drug treatment, 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 10 ml of growth medium 24 h prior to treatment. They were incubated with doxorubicin or etoposide (Sigma, 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO) at various concentrations for 24 h. Control cells were treated with an equivalent amount of Me2SO. RKO-R cells were generated by continuous passage of RKO cells in media containing increasing concentrations of nutlin-3 (0.5–10 μm) over a 90-day period. The resistant cell population was maintained in the presence of 10 μm nutlin-3. p53 gene status was determined by the GeneChip p53 assay (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described previously (29Ahrendt S.A. Halachmi S. Chow J.T. Wu L. Halachmi N. Yang S.C. Wehage S. Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7382-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 350 mm NaCL, 1 mm MgCL, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cell pellets were sonicated briefly and cell debris sedimented by brief centrifugation (15,000 rpm) at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and protein content was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For Western analysis, 10 μg of total protein was loaded onto 4–12% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) using primary antibodies specific for human p53 (SC-263, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-p53 (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, Ser392; catalog number 9919, Cell Signaling, Beverly MA), p21 (OP64, Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA), MDM2 (SC-965, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody from sheep (NA931V; Amersham Biosciences) and anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey F(ab′)2 fragment (NA9340V; Amersham Biosciences).p53-DNA Binding Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—TransAM™ p53 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was used following manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates from treated cells were diluted to 2 μg/ml total protein with lysis buffer and applied to plates containing immobilized oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus binding site (5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′). After 1-h incubation at room temperature, plates were washed and incubated with diluted p53 antibody (1:1000) for another hour. Diluted anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000) was then added to previously washed plates and developing solution was added and incubated for 8 min to allow color development. The reaction was stopped and absorbance read at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm.Quantitative PCR—Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (104 cells/well) 24 h prior to treatment. They were lysed and total RNA extracted using the ABI 6700 robotic work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Aliquots containing 5 μg of total RNA were converted to cDNA using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantity of the p53, p21, and MDM2 transcripts was determined by TaqMan using gene-specific primer/probe sets and 18 S RNA as a normalization control. The sequence of the primers and probes was as follows: p53 (forward, CTG-GGA-CGG-AAC-AGC-TTT-GA; reverse, CCT-TTC-TTG-CGG-AGA-TTC-TCT-TC; probe, CTG-TGC-GCC-GGT-CTC-TCC-CAG-TA), P21 (forward, CTGAGA-CTC-TCA-GGG-TCG-AA; reverse, CGG-CGT-TTG-GAG-TGG-TAG-AA; probe, TTG-GCT-CAC-TGC-AAG-CTC-GCC-CTT), MDM2 (forward, GCT-GGA-GTC-CAG-TGG-GTG-AT; reverse, GAT-GAC-TGT-AGG-CCA-AGC-TAA-TTG; probe, TGG-CTC-ACT-GCA-AGC-TCTGCC-CT), MIC-1 1The abbreviation used is: MIC-1, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1. (macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1) (forward, CCATGG-TGC-TCA-TTC-AAA-AGA-C; reverse, GGA-AGG-ACC-AGG-ACT-GCT-CAT; probe, TGA-CTT-GTT-AGC-CAA-AGACTG-CCACTG-CA).Apoptosis Assays—Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (5 × 104 cells/well) 24 h prior to drug treatment and incubated with the drug for additional 48 h. No treatment controls were established in parallel for each cell line. Culture medium that may contain detached cells was collected and attached cells were trypsinized. Cells were combined with corresponding medium and collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Annexin V-positive cells were quantified using Guava Nexin™ kit and the Guava personal cell Analyzer (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA.) as recommended by the manufacturer.RESULTSMDM2 Antagonists Stabilize p53 and Activate p53 Target Genes—Recently, we developed a class of potent and selective inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). These compounds, called nutlins, bind MDM2 at the p53 pocket with high specificity and can displace p53 from its complex with its negative regulator. Treatment of cells encoding wild-type p53 with nutlins leads to p53 stabilization, accumulation, and activation of the p53 pathway. As nutlins activate p53 by preventing its physical interaction with MDM2, they should not alter the post-translational modification status of p53. Consequently, they represent valuable molecular probes to study the contributions of post-translational modifications to p53 function.Using the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3, we aimed at studying the functional activity of unmodified p53 compared with the activity of p53 modified in response to treating cells with the genotoxic drugs etoposide and doxorubicin. We chose the colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and RKO as they possess wild-type p53 and respond to genotoxic stress by p53 stabilization and activation of the p53 pathway (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). To find the optimal treatment condition, we incubated exponentially growing cells with a range of concentrations of etoposide, doxorubicin, and the active enantiomer of nutlin-3 (nutlin-3a) for 24 h. These ranges included the IC50 and IC90 values previously determined by a proliferation/viability assay (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). Western analysis of the cell lysates from both cells lines revealed a dose-dependent accumulation of p53 and its target gene products MDM2 and p21Waf1/CIP1 (Fig. 1). The observed decrease in the MDM2 and p21 level at the high doxorubicin concentrations is most likely due to protein degradation in cells undergoing apoptosis. This experiment showed that nutlin-3a treatment of HCT116 and RKO cells activates p53 comparably with the genotoxic drugs etoposide and doxorubicin.p53 Induced by MDM2 Antagonists Is Not Modified on Key Phosphorylation Sites—We previously showed that nutlin-1 does not cause p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, a site typically modified in response to genotoxic stress (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the notion that MDM2 antagonists are non-genotoxic and should not activate the damage-responsive kinases that trigger p53 phosphorylation. However, it is conceivable that other nutlins could possess off-target activities that generate DNA damage or activate stress-related kinases to induce p53 modification. We therefore determined whether nutlin-3a induced p53 phosphorylation on six key serine residues (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392) using phosphoserine-specific antibodies. The inactive enantiomer nutlin-3b, which has a 150-fold lower affinity to MDM2 in vitro, was used as a negative control (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar).Western analysis showed a comparable accumulation of p53 in both HCT116 and RKO cells treated with etoposide, doxorubicin, and nutlin-3a, but no accumulation was observed with nutlin-3b. Doxorubicin treatment induced the phosphorylation of all examined serine residues of p53 (Fig. 2). Etoposide showed a strong phosphorylation signal on Ser6, Ser15, and Ser20 in both cell lines and Ser46 in RKO cells and weaker but detectable phosphorylation on Ser37 and Ser392. In contrast, phosphorylation of all p53 serines was undetectable in the lysates from both cell lines incubated with nutlin-3a and nutlin-3b. This result confirmed and extended the previous observation made with nutlin-1 that MDM2 antagonists do not induce stress-related modifications previously correlated with p53 activation. Therefore, nutlin-activated p53 provides an opportunity for studying the functional contributions of phosphorylation to p53 function in living cells.Fig. 2Stabilization of p53 by MDM2 antagonists does not involve phosphorylation of key serine residues. Exponentially growing HCT116 and RKO cells were incubated with etoposide (10 μm), doxorubicin (1 μm), nutlin-3a (10 μm), or nutlin-3b (10 μm) for 24 h, and the levels of total p53 and p53 phosphorylated on specific serine residues were analyzed by Western blotting. Actin was used as a normalization control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNA Binding Activity of p53 Does Not Depend on Its Phosphorylation Status—p53 transcriptional activity is of paramount importance for its function as a tumor suppressor. We therefore evaluated the ability of p53 to bind its DNA recognition sequences as an indication of the transcriptional activation potential of the transcription factor. We used the TransAM™ p53 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures the relative amount of p53 in cell lysates that can bind to a 20-mer oliginucleotide containing a p53 consensus binding site. HCT116 and RKO cells were incubated with a range of concentrations of etoposide, doxorubicin, and nutlin-3a for 24 h, and DNA-bound p53 was assayed in the cell lysates (Fig. 3). In agreement with the Western analyses (Fig. 1), the levels of DNA-bound p53 increased in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines treated with all three drugs. The 14–17-fold elevation of p53 in RKO cells was more dramatic, while HCT116 cells showed a more moderate (5–6-fold) increase that reflects the higher basal level of p53 in these cells. The level of p53 induced by nutlin-3a was higher than the level induced by either etoposide or doxorubicin in HCT116 cells and comparable with that induced by these drugs (14-fold versus 16–17-fold) in RKO cells. These data suggest that the lack of detectable phosphorylation on six major phosphorylation sites does not affect the ability of p53 to bind effectively its DNA response elements.Fig. 3Binding of p53 to its consensus DNA sequence is not affected by its phosphorylation status in vivo. HCT116 and RKO cells were incubated with doxorubicin, etoposide, and nutlins-3a for 24 h, and the level of p53 protein present in the cell lysates that can bind to its consensus recognition sequence was determined by the TransAM™ p53 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and calculated as fold increase relative to the control samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transcriptional Activity of p53 Is Not Affected by Its Phosphorylation Status—We next compared the transcriptional activities of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 after treatment of HCT116 and RKO cells with increasing concentrations of etoposide, doxorubicin, nutlin-3a, and nutlin-3b for 24 h. We measured the expression of three p53 target genes (p21Waf1, mdm2, and mic-1) by quantitative real-time PCR. These genes contain p53 recognition sequences in their promoter regions, strongly depend on p53 for transcriptional regulation, and represent diverse functions of the p53 pathway: p21Waf1/CIP1 encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a key role in the p53-mediated cell cycle arrest (30el-Deiry W.S.

Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 1023-1029PubMed Google Scholar).Dose-dependent accumulation of p53 in drug-treated cells elicited a dose-dependent activation of all three genes in both cell lines (Fig. 4A). The relative increase in gene expression was different in each cell line, probably reflecting differences in the basal level of expression. p21 was most highly elevated in HCT116, while MIC-1 showed the strongest induction in RKO cells. To compare the transcriptional activity of p53 between drug-treated cells the highest level of induction within the concentration range was plotted for each drug and cell line (Fig. 4B). The level of gene induction by nutlin-3a (10–12-fold) was the highest for all three genes in HCT116 cells and for p21 and MDM2 in RKO cells. Only the expression of the MIC-1 gene was slightly higher in doxorubicin-treated RKO cells (Fig. 4B). The inactive enantiomer (nutlin-3b) did not show significant transcriptional activation of any of the genes in either cell line, confirming that the activation of p53 target genes by nutlin-3a is due to inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction (28Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.

Exponentially growing HCT116 and RKO cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of doxorubicin (Dox), etoposide (Etopo), nutlin-3a, and nutlin-3b for 24 h, and the relative expression of three p53-regulated genes (p21, mdm2, and mic-1) was determined by quantitative PCR. They were plotted as a relative increase in gene activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of p53 target genes was measured after 24 h of drug treatment to reach a steady-state level of p53 and to avoid possible differences in the timing of p53 induction. However, one could argue that p53 phosphorylation accelerates p53 activation by both antagonizing MDM2 interaction and enabling recruitment of co-activators. On the other hand, if the critical step in p53 activation involves preventing MDM2 binding, then nutlin-3a may provide a more direct and rapid route to activation, since kinase activation, p53 modification, and damage-induced degradation of MDM2 (6Stommel J.M.

Here, we identify a heme protein sensor (SONO) that displays femtomolar affinity for NO. The crystal structure of the SONO heme domain reveals a previously undescribed fold and a strategically placed tyrosine residue that modulates heme-nitrosyl coordination. Furthermore, the domain architecture of a SONO ortholog cloned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii indicates that NO signaling through cyclic guanosine monophosphate arose before the origin of multicellular eukaryotes. Our findings have broad implications for understanding bacterial responses to NO, as well as for the activation of mammalian NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase."

This key agreement between the phase of the observed polarization spectrum and that predicted on the basis of the total intensity spectrum provides support for the standard model of cosmology, in which dark matter and dark energy are the dominant constituents, the geometry is close to flat, and primordial density fluctuations are predominantly adiabatic with a matter power spectrum commensurate with inflationary cosmological models."
https://openalex.org/W2140271230,"Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) expression is increased in inflammatory diseases. We demonstrated previously that inhibitors of TGase 2 reduce nitric oxide (NO) generation in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated microglial cell line. However, the precise mechanism by which TGase 2 promotes inflammation remains unclear. We found that TGase 2 activates the transcriptional activator nuclear factor (NF)-κB and thereby enhances LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase. TGase 2 activates NF-κB via a novel pathway. Rather than stimulating phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory subunit α of NF-κB (I-κBα), TGase2 induces its polymerization. This polymerization results in dissociation of NF-κB and its translocation to the nucleus, where it is capable of up-regulating a host of inflammatory genes, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Indeed, TGase inhibitors prevent depletion of monomeric I-κBα in the cytosol of cells overexpressing TGase 2. In an LPS-induced rat brain injury model, TGase inhibitors significantly reduced TNF-α synthesis. The findings are consistent with a model in which LPS-induced NF-κB activation is the result of phosphorylation of I-κBα by I-κB kinase as well as I-κBα polymerization by TGase 2.

Chung S-I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nϵ-(γ-l-Glutamyl)-l-lysine cross-linking stabilizes intra- and extracellular proteins as macromolecular assemblies that are used for a variety of essential physiological purposes, such as barrier function in epithelia, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix formation (2Aeschlimann D. Thomazy V. Connect. Tissue Res. 2000; 41: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). TGase 2 is normally expressed at low levels in many different tissues and inappropriately activated in a variety of pathological conditions (3Kim S-Y. Jeitner T.M. Steinert P.M. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the role TGase 2 specifically plays in disease etiology is unclear. Autoimmune diseases are strongly associated with aberrant activation of macrophage and T cells, which cause serious inflammation. Abnormal increase of TGase 2 expression in autoimmune inflammatory myopathies and celiac disease has been reported (4Choi Y-C. Park G.-T. Steinert P.M. Kim S.-Y J. Biol.

Hayashi R. Ogawa K. Ando M. Yamauchi M. Nagata Y.J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 53-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the inappropriate expression and/or presentation of TGase 2 to T cells might contribute to these diseases in genetically predisposed individuals. Activation of glia, a process termed reactive gliosis, has been observed during the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. A hallmark of brain inflammation is the activation of microglia cells that produce neurotoxic factors such as nitric oxide (NO) (17Minagar A. Shapshak P. Fujimura R. Ownby R. Heyes M. Eisdorfer C. J. Neurol. Sci. 2002; 202: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and TNF-α (18Catania A. Lipton J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Synthesis and release of these factors constitute a part of the innate immunity that enables the host to destroy invading pathogens. However, excessive production and accumulation of NO seems to contribute neurodegeneration (19Liu B. Gao H.M. Wang J.Y. Jeohn G.H. Cooper C.L. Hong J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 962: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). TGase 2 expression in rat brain astrocytes is induced by glutamate (20Campisi A. Caccamo D. Raciti G. Cannavo G. Macaione V. Curro M. Macaione S. Vanella A. Ientile R. Brain Res. 2003; 978: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or by the inflammation-associated cytokines such as interleukin-1β and TNF-α (21Monsonego A. Shani Y. Friedmann I. Paas Y. Eizenberg O. Schwartz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3724-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis in a monkey model of neuro-AIDS has recently revealed that TGase 2 expression is specifically increased in the infected brain (22Roberts E.S. Zandonatti M.A. Watry D.D.

Immunohistochemical staining in the infected brain shows clear increase of TGase 2 in the cells with astrocytic morphology. Multiple factors must contribute to the activation of TGase 2 in oxidative stress and in the elevation of intracellular calcium. This suggests that induced-TGase 2 in the activated astroglial cells may participate in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (23Junn E. Ronchetti R.D. Quezado M.M. Kim S-Y. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inflammatory markers also occur in Parkinson's disease (27McGeer P.L. Yasojima K. McGeer E.G. Adv. Neurol. 2001; 86: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar), Alzheimer's disease (28Eikelenboom P. Bate C.

Ownby R. Heyes M. Eisdorfer C. J. Neurol. Sci. 2002; 202: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the recombinant peptide R2, which had dual inhibitory effects on purified TGase 2 and soluble phospholipase A2, reversed the inflammation of allergic conjunctivitis to ragweed in a guinea pig model (29Sohn J. Kim T-I. Yoon Y.-H. Kim J.Y. Kim S.-Y J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recombinant peptides were constructed with the sequences from pro-elafin (for inhibition of TGase 2), and antiflammins (for inhibition of soluble phospholipase A2). It is interesting that we found that the only pro-elafin sequence, E2 (a part of elafin, a TGase inhibitor), itself also has dramatic anti-inflammatory effects (29Sohn J. Kim T-I. Yoon Y.-H. Kim J.Y. Kim S.-Y J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that TGase activity may play a key role in macrophage activation resulting from inflammatory stress. We observed recently that TGase 2 expression is increased by LPS treatment in BV-2 microglia, and NO release is dramatically reduced by TGase inhibitors (30Park K-C. Chung K.-C. Kim Y.-S. Lee J. Joh T.H. Kim S.-Y Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During the LPS-induced microglia activation, TGase activity is increased about 5-fold in microglia after 24-h exposure to LPS in a time-dependent manner (30Park K-C. Chung K.-C. Kim Y.-S. Lee J. Joh T.H. Kim S.-Y Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The increase of NO synthesis is correlated with increase of TGase 2 expression. Furthermore, we observed that transient transfection of TGase 2 in BV-2 microglia increases NF-κB activity (30Park K-C. Chung K.-C. Kim Y.-S. Lee J. Joh T.H. Kim S.-Y Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggests that TGase 2 may aggravate inflammation by activating the NF-κB cascade in microglia. To test this hypothesis, we determined the identity of the major in vivo target of TGase 2 in the NF-κB cascade. We also tested whether TGase inhibition might be effective at reducing NF-κB activation in the LPS-induced rat brain injury model. Microglia Activation by LPS—The immortalized murine BV-2 cell line exhibits phenotypic and functional properties of reactive microglial cells (31Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The cells are grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. To achieve BV-2 activation, cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml; Sigma) for 24 h (32Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V.

Proteins were extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors from BV-2 harvest for TGase activity assay after LPS treatment for 24 h with or without inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, 0, 50, and 100 μmNG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) (Sigma). Nitrite Measurements—Accumulated nitrite was measured in the cell supernatant after LPS treatment for 24 h by the Griess reaction (33Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10728) Google Scholar). In brief, 200-μl aliquots of cell supernatant from each well are mixed with 100 μl of Griess reagent [1% sulfanilamide (Fluka), 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (Fluka), and 2.5% H3PO4] in a 96-well microtiter plate, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm using a plate reader. Semiquantitative RT-PCR of Mouse TGase 2 and iNOS with Competitive Standard Mimics—Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed by using competitive mimic templates (internal amount control) (34Bouaboula M. Legoux P. Pessegue B. Delpech B. Dumont X. Piechaczyk M. Casellas P. Shire D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21830-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare total RNA for RT-PCR, the cells were lysed by adding TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of total RNA were reverse-transcribed at 42 °C using the first strand synthesis kit (Promega) with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and PCR was performed for the transcripts of iNOS and TGase 2 using specific primer sets. All PCRs contained the following in a volume of 20 μl: 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 0.2 μm concentration of each upstream and downstream primer, 0.5 units of Taq polymerase, and variable amounts of templates as required. The mimic templates of TGase 2 and iNOS were constructed by PCR to retain each target PCR primer. The mimics of mouse TGase 2 and mouse iNOS were made from 2014–2338 and 1451–2043 bp, respectively. The products of RT-PCR were: 526 bp for target TGase 2, 345 bp for mimic TGase 2, 593 bp for target iNOS, and 417 bp for mimic iNOS. The PCR primer sequences were; mouse TGase 2 sense strand (5′-CCA AGC AAA ACC GCA AAC TG-3′), mouse TGase 2 antisense strand (5′-TGA TGG CTC TCC TCT TAC CCT TTC-3′); mouse iNOS sense strand (5′-ACT ACC AGA TCG AGC CCT GGA AC-3′), and mouse iNOS antisense strand (5′-GCA AGC TGA GAG GCT CCC AGG-3′). Stable Transfection of TGase 2—The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y used for stable transfection studies was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium (50:50) supplemented with 10%-heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin as described previously. To avoid clonal variation, we adopted the Flp-In™ System (35O'Gorman S. Fox D.T. Wahl G.M. Science. 1991; 251: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen, Co). We used SH-SY5Y/FRT cells carrying empty vector as a control and SH-SY5Y/TG cells expressing full-length human TGase 2 in pcDNA5/FRT vector. After selection, there was no increase of cell death signs in SH-SY5Y/TG cells by the criteria of normal cell growth, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride staining, caspase activity, and annexin V staining (data not shown). This is in accordance with the previous report that TGase 2-transfected neuroblastoma cells do not show increased apoptosis unless they are subjected to oxidative stress (36Milakovic T. Tucholski J. McCoy E. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8715-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Piacentini M. Farrace M.G. Piredda L. Matarrese P. Ciccosanti F.

To test whether the effect of TGase 2 on cellular targets can be reversed, we employed the tetracycline induced expression system using the EcR 293 cell line (Flp-In T-Rex-293; Invitrogen). After introduction of full-length human TGase 2 using pcDNA5/FRT into EcR 293 cells and selection with hygromycin, TGase 2 was induced by 1 μg/ml of tetracycline treatment for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. IKK Inhibitor Treatment—To test whether TGase 2-induced NF-κB activation is IKK-dependent, the IKK-2 inhibitor SC-514 (Calbiochem) was employed (74Kishore N. Sommers C. Mathialagan S. Guzova J. Yao M. Hauser S. Huynh K. Bonar S. Mielke C. Albee L. Weier R. Graneto M. Hanau C. Perry T. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32861-32871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As a positive control, BV-2 was activated with LPS with or without SC-514. BV-2 cells were pre-treated with or without 10 μm SC-514 for 1 h before 30-min LPS induction. SH-SY5Y and SH-SY5Y/TG cells were also treated with or without 10 μm SC-514 for 1 h. Cells were harvested and the cytosolic fraction was collected for Western blotting analysis. Transglutminase Activity Assay—A modified TGase assay method was used to determine the enzymatic activity by measurement of the incorporation of [1,4-14C]putrescine into succinylated casein (4Choi Y-C. Park G.-T. Steinert P.M. Kim S.-Y J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 88703-88710Google Scholar, 38Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—The cytosolic fraction of samples was prepared using the nuclear extract kit (Sigma). Samples were applied to the wells of 10–20% gradient SDS gels using Tricine buffer (Invitrogen) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed as established previously (4Choi Y-C. Park G.-T. Steinert P.M. Kim S.-Y J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 88703-88710Google Scholar). Antibodies to NF-κB p65, I-κBα, phospho-IκB-α (Ser32), I-κB kinase β (IKK-β), phospho-IKKα (ser180)/IKKβ(Ser181), and NF-κB activating kinase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to NIK, IKKα, and α-topoisomerase I were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to LDH (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ), ubiquitin (Sigma) and TGase 2 (clone CUB 7402; NeoMarkers, Union City, CA) were obtained as indicated. The concentration of primary and secondary antibodies were 5 and 0.1 μg/ml, respectively. The blot was then developed by enhanced chemi-luminescence (Pierce, Milwaukee, WI). To determine the purity of extracted cytosol and nuclear fractions, we employed anti-LDH for the cytosolic fraction and anti-α-topoisomerase for the nuclear fraction. In Vitro Cross-linking Experiments—To obtain I-κBα, the full-length human I-κBα was cloned into pET-30 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen) by PCR using full-length I-κBα cDNA (pCMV-IκBα; BD Biosciences), expressed and purified using a HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's manual. Purified human recombinant NF-κB (p52) protein was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Purified I-κBα (2 μm) or NF-κB (p52) (2 μm) was incubated with or without 0.001 units of guinea pig liver TGase 2 for 30 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2. After incubation, the sample was analyzed by Western blotting for I-κBα and by Coomassie protein staining for NF-κB (p52). Binding Efficiency of Free and Polymerized I-κBα to NF-κB—The full-length I-κBα was prepared as described above. The full-length human NF-κB(p65) was obtained from Active Motif Co. Incubation of 2 μm I-κBα with TGase 2 (0.001 units) for 30 min at 37 °C shows complete polymerization of I-κBα (Fig. 3C). To test the binding efficiency of free or polymerized I-κBα to NF-κB(p65), various concentrations of I-κBα (0.25–2.0 μm) were incubated with or without TGase 2 (0.001 units) for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA. NF-κB (2 μm) was added to the I-κBα mixture for 1 h at RT. For immunoprecipitation, the mixture was gently mixed with 5 μg of NF-κB(p65) antibody for 1 h at RT, and a protein A/G-agarose-conjugated slurry (Pierce) was added for 1 h at RT. The precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, boiled in the loading buffer, and loaded onto 10–20% gradient Tricine-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and Western blotting was performed against I-κBα Transient Transfection of TGase 2—Experiments involving transient expression of TGase 2 were conducted using cDNAs encoding for full-length human TGase 2 cloned in the pSG5 vector (Stratagene) (23Junn E. Ronchetti R.D. Quezado M.M. Kim S-Y. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The transient transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method. When mouse BV-2 cells reached 80% confluence in 6-well tissue culture dishes, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh culture medium. The plasmids (1 μg) were prepared in the presence of 25 μmol of calcium in 100 μl of medium. The same amount of 2× HEPES-buffered saline was prepared. The plasmid and calcium mix were added slowly to the 2× HEPES-buffered saline buffer, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was gently vortexed and added drop-wise to the culture medium. NF-κB Activity Assay—We measured NF-κB activity using the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter system 3 (pNFκB-SEAP; BD Biosciences Clontech). The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium at 12 h after transient transfection. The medium was collected for SEAP assay after 24 h and the cells were harvested for β-galactosidase assay. The vehicle vector pSG5 (Stratagene) was used as a control. Cells treated with pGAL plasmid (1 μg) were co-transfected with expression vectors to normalize expression to β-galactosidase activity (39Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SEAP assay was performed according to the supplier's instructiosn (BD Biosciences Clontech). Values are the means of three determinations (S.D. < 10%). Measurement of NF-κB Activation by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts of BV-2 microglia and SH-SY5Y were prepared from non-transfected control, vehicle control (pSG5; Stratagene), and TGase 2 transfected (pSG5/TG) cells using a nuclear extract kit (Sigma). A double-stranded consensus oligonucleotide for NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) was end-labeled with [32P]ATP. Binding reactions containing equal amounts of nuclear extract protein (6 μg) and 10 fmol (∼10,000 cpm; Cherenkov counting) of oligonucleotide were performed for 30 min in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly dI-dC). Total reaction volumes were held at 20 μl. Reaction products were separated in 6% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by a bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). Effect of TGase Inhibitors on Reduced I-kBα in SH-SY5Y/TG Cells— Cystamine is known to inhibit TGase activity by blocking access of the glutamine residue in substrate proteins to the TGase active site (23Junn E.

Iodoacetamide (Sigma) is also known to inhibit TGase as a strong competitive irreversible inhibitor.

Nature. 1988; 335: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of R2 and E2 as TGase 2 inhibitors was previously demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (29Sohn J. Kim T-I. Yoon Y.-H. Kim J.Y. Kim S.-Y J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of TGase inhibitors on I-κBα reduction, different inhibitors were added to the SH-SY5Y/TG culture for 30 min. Thereafter, the cytosolic fraction was obtained by using the nuclear extract kit (Sigma) for Western blotting analysis of I-κBα. Effect of TGase Inhibitors in Vivo on LPS-induced Rat Brain Injury— Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Samtako, Osan, Korea) weighing 190–220 g were used for the experimental model of intraperitoneal LPS injection described previously (47Quan N. Whiteside M. Kim L. Herkenham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10985-10990Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All experimental procedures were approved by the Seoul National University Care of Experimental Animals Committee. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (2.5 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% saline or 0.9% sterile saline. To determine the effect of TGase inhibitors, animals were intraperitoneally injected with R2 peptide (25 μm), E2 peptide (25 μm), and dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) once at 30 min before and once at the time of the LPS injection. Rats were killed 1 h after the LPS injection. Dexamethasone injection was employed as a positive control. Immunohistochemistry—At 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS or saline, rats were deeply anesthetized with 1% ketamine (30 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (4 mg/kg). Brains were perfused through the heart with saline containing 0.5% sodium nitrite and 10 units/ml heparin followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (0.1 m, pH 7.2). Brains were removed and postfixed, rinsed in PBS, and cryo-protected in sucrose. Sections were prepared on a sliding microtome (40 μm) at the level of subfornical organ (47Quan N. Whiteside M. Kim L. Herkenham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10985-10990Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of TGase 2 was performed with a monoclonal antibody to TGase 2 (TG-100; NeoMarkers).

Several ASICs are expressed in sensory neurons, where they play a role in responses to nociceptive, taste, and mechanical stimuli; others are expressed in central neurons, where they participate in synaptic plasticity and some forms of learning. Stomatin is an integral membrane protein found in lipid/protein-rich microdomains, and it is believed to regulate the function of ion channels and transporters. In Caenorhabditis elegans, stomatin homologs interact with DEG/ENaC channels, which together are necessary for normal mechanosensation in the worm. Therefore, we asked whether stomatin interacts with and modulates the function of ASICs. We found that stomatin co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with ASIC proteins in heterologous cells. Moreover, stomatin altered the function of ASIC channels. Stomatin potently reduced acid-evoked currents generated by ASIC3 without changing steady state protein levels or the amount of ASIC3 expressed at the cell surface. In contrast, stomatin accelerated the desensitization rate of ASIC2 and heteromeric ASICs, whereas current amplitude was unaffected. These data suggest that stomatin binds to and alters the gating of ASICs. Our findings indicate that modulation of DEG/ENaC channels by stomatin-like proteins is evolutionarily conserved and may have important implications for mammalian nociception and mechanosensation.

Two members in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, MEC-4 and MEC-10, are required for normal touch sensation (24Driscoll M. Chalfie M.

Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Additional mec genes that encode intracellular or extracellular proteins are also necessary for touch sensation in the worm. Genetic and direct interaction studies suggest a model of mechanotransduction whereby these accessory proteins function to link MEC-4 and MEC-10 channels to the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix; deformation of these components by mechanical stimuli is thought to open the channel (28Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Chalfie M. Biol. Bull. 1997; 192: 125Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One of these accessory proteins in C. elegans, MEC-2, is an integral membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic NH2 terminus, a hydrophobic midportion that forms a hairpin turn within the cell membrane, and a longer cytoplasmic COOH terminus (30Huang M. Gu G. Ferguson E.L. Chalfie M. Nature. 1995; 378: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). mec-2 mutations abolish touch sensation in the worm (31Chalfie M. Au M.

Biol. 1981; 82: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and genetic studies suggest that it interacts with the channel subunits (MEC-4 and MEC-10) and cytoplasmic microtubules (MEC-7 and MEC-12), forming a link between the channel and the underlying cytoskeleton (30Huang M.

Heterologous expression studies confirmed that MEC-2 interacts with MEC-4 and MEC-10 and found that MEC-2 potentiates current (27Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M.

In a rare autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia called stomatocytosis, stomatin is absent in red blood cells, which have increased cationic leak current and swell and lyse prematurely (34Lande W.M.

Similar to MEC-2, stomatin interacts with the cytoskeleton in red blood cells (38Stewart G.W. Hepworth-Jones B.E. Keen J.N. Dash B.C. Argent A.C. Casimir C.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). Stomatin has also been shown to bind to the glucose transporter GLUT-1 and decrease the rate of glucose uptake (42Zhang J.Z. Abbud W. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1277-C1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, stomatin is also expressed in sensory neurons (43Mannsfeldt A.G. Carroll P. Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. Mol.

Lints R. Stewart G. Drummond H. Dodt G. Driscoll M. von During M. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 299: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that stomatin modulates the activity of ASICs. cDNA Constructs—Mouse (m) ASIC1a (ASICα), ASIC2a (BNC1a), and ASIC3 (DRASIC), were cloned as described (45Askwith C.C.

Anti-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) antibody (13-1) was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Heterologous Expression of cDNA—For co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies, COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation using 107 cells and 20 μg of plasmid DNA. mASIC1a, -2a, or -3 (10 μg) was transfected alone or with m-stomatin-FLAG or empty vector (10 μg). COS-7 cells were maintained in culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were studied 24 to 72 h after transfection. For electrophysiological experiments, cDNAs were expressed using 6 μg/1.5 ml cationic lipid (TransFast; Promega) in CHO cells grown in 35-mm dishes. mASIC subunits were expressed alone or with m/h-stomatin at the described concentrations. DsRed was co-transfected to keep the total amount of cDNA constant. cDNA for green fluorescent protein (0.33 μg/0.4 ml) was also expressed to facilitate detection of transfected cells by epifluorescence. We have found that >90% of green cells and <5% of non-green cells have an acid-activated current. Cells were cultured in F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and were studied 48–72 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—24 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were solubilized using a glass/Teflon motor-driven homogenizer in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing the protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

Proteins were extracted from the beads with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 20 min at 60 °C and separated on SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h. The immunoblots were incubated with anti-ASIC1 6.4, anti-ASIC2 5.3, anti-ASIC3 3.2, or anti-FLAG (1:1000) antibodies for 2 h. The blots were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-labeled protein A (1:10,000) and washed five times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells were grown on collagen-coated slides for 72 h following electroporation. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, and blocked with SuperBlock (Pierce). Cells were incubated with anti-ASIC1 6.4 (1:1000), anti-ASIC2 5.3 (1: 1000), anti-ASIC3 3.2 (1:1000), and/or anti-FLAG antibodies (1:300) followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (1:1400) and/or goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:1400) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Staining was visualized using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—48 h following transfection by electroporation, COS-7 cells were washed with cold PBS three times on ice, labeled with 0.25 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) in PBS for 20 min on ice, washed twice with TBS, and lysed as described above. Labeled cell surface proteins were isolated by incubating 500 μg of cell lysate with immobilized neutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. In parallel, ASIC3 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of the same cell lysate by incubation with anti-ASIC3 3.2 antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose as described above. The bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer for 20 min at 60 °C, run on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-ASIC2a or anti-ASIC3 antibodies as described above. Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp recordings (at -70 mV) from CHO cells were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and acquired and analyzed with Pulse/Pulsefit 8.30 (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) and Igor Pro 4.04 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) software. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 2 or 0.2 kHz. Series resistance was compensated by at least 50%. Capacitive currents were compensated for and recorded for normalization of peak current amplitudes (reported as current densities). Micropipettes (2–5 megaohms) were filled with an internal solution containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm HEPES, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, with KOH. External solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm MES. pH was adjusted with tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and osmolarity was adjusted with tetramethylammonium chloride. Extracellular solutions were changed within 20 ms using a computer-driven solenoid valve system (17Benson C.J. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Acidic pH solutions were applied to cells from a resting pH of 7.4. Data are means ± S.E. Kinetics of desensitization were fit with a single exponential equation, and time constants (τ) were reported. Statistical differences were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test. h-stomatin cDNA was used for the electrophysiological co-expression experiments with ASIC3. However, m-stomatin co-expressed at 0.0625 μg of cDNA/1 μg of ASIC3 cDNA (1:8 ratio) caused identical inhibition of the current (data not shown). Thus, m-stomatin was used for the other co-expression experiments. Stomatin Interacts with ASICs—We tested whether stomatin associates with ASICs using two strategies. First, we asked whether ASICs and stomatin co-immunoprecipitate. ASIC1a, ASIC2a, or ASIC3 was co-expressed with stomatin (containing a FLAG epitope on the carboxyl terminus) in COS-7 cells. When stomatin was immunoprecipitated, all three ASICs were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). However, we did not detect ASIC protein when expressed without stomatin. Thus, stomatin co-immunoprecipitates with each of the ASIC subunits. Second, we tested whether stomatin and ASIC proteins colocalize by examining their immunostaining patterns. When transfected alone, stomatin localized in a punctate pattern around the nucleus and at the cell membrane (Fig. 2A) in agreement with previous studies (43Mannsfeldt A.G. Carroll P. Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 48Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 expressed alone showed a predominantly reticular pattern of staining. Co-expressing stomatin with individual ASIC proteins altered its cellular localization so it co-localized with the ASICs, showing a less punctate and more reticular pattern of staining (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, stomatin did not change its expression pattern or co-localize when co-expressed with the unrelated ion channel CFTR. Together, the co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization results suggest that stomatin associates with all three ASIC subunits. Stomatin Modulates ASIC Current—The association of ASIC proteins with stomatin suggested that stomatin might alter ASIC channel function. To test this, we measured acid-evoked currents in CHO cells co-expressing stomatin with ASIC1a, ASIC2a, or ASIC3. When co-expressed with ASIC3, stomatin potently decreased current amplitude (Fig. 3, A and B). A 1:0.125 expression ratio (1 μg of ASIC3:0.125 μg of stomatin cDNA) eliminated the current, which was tested by applying pH 5 and 4 solutions. At a 1:0.0625 ratio (1 μg of ASIC3:0.0625 μg of stomatin), most cells produced small currents with properties that were otherwise similar to those from ASIC3 expressed alone. ASIC3 currents desensitized rapidly in the continued presence of acidic solution (see current returning to base line in Fig. 3A). This rate was unchanged by co-expression with stomatin at a 1:0.0625 ratio (Fig. 3C), and sensitivity to pH activation was not altered (Fig. 3D). However, given this low stomatin to ASIC3 cDNA expression ratio (1:16), these residual currents may reflect ASIC3 channels not bound to stomatin. As a negative control, we tested protein interacting with C kinase-1 (PICK1), a PDZ protein that binds to ASIC1a and ASIC2a but not ASIC3 (47Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 49Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At a 1:1 cDNA ratio, PICK1 had no effect on ASIC3 current amplitude (Fig. 3B). Thus, the data indicate that stomatin potently inhibits the ASIC3 acid-evoked current. Stomatin had a different effect upon ASIC2a. When co-expressed at a 1:1 cDNA ratio, stomatin did not decrease current amplitude; in fact, there was an insignificant trend toward increased current amplitude (Fig. 4, A and B). However, stomatin increased the rate of ASIC2a desensitization, which decreased the time constant (Fig. 4, A and C). Stomatin had little effect on pH sensitivity (Fig. 4D). In contrast to ASIC2a and ASIC3, stomatin did not alter the ASIC1a current. At a 1:1 or 1:10 cDNA ratio (ASIC1a:stomatin), stomatin did not change current amplitude (Fig. 5, A and B), desensitization kinetics (Fig. 5C), or pH sensitivity (Fig. 5D). Thus, although stomatin interacted with each of the ASIC subunits, it had differential effects on ASIC channel function, depending on the subunit composition. ASIC subunits can function as homomultimers or they can heteromultimerize with one another (5Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Therefore, we asked whether stomatin alters currents generated by channels composed of more than one ASIC subunit. Because stomatin produced the most dramatic effect on ASIC3, we focused on combinations that included this subunit. The fast desensitization kinetics (Fig. 6, A and C) confirm that co-expression of ASIC subunits resulted in the formation of heteromultimeric channels because heteromeric channels desensitize at a faster rate than homomeric channels (46Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 53Askwith C.C. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11006-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). When we co-expressed ASIC3 with ASIC1a or ASIC2a, stomatin did not alter current amplitude (Fig. 6, A and B) or pH sensitivity (Fig. 6D). However, stomatin produced small but significant increases in the desensitization rates of both heteromultimeric channels (Fig. 6C). Stomatin Does Not Alter ASIC Cell Surface Expression— Stomatin could decrease ASIC3 current amplitude by altering its expression at the cell surface or altering its gating. To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantitated ASIC3 expressed at the cell surface by biotinylating cell surface proteins. Following biotinylation, we precipitated proteins with avidin and detected ASIC3 by Western blot analysis. Stomatin did not alter the amount of biotinylated ASIC3, indicating that stomatin did not change ASIC3 surface expression (Fig. 7). Moreover, stomatin co-expression did not alter the total amount of ASIC3 protein (Fig. 1). These results suggest that stomatin reduced ASIC3 current by altering its gating rather than its expression at the cell surface. The data indicate that stomatin binds to ASIC1a, -2a, and -3 subunits. Moreover, stomatin altered the function of specific ASIC channels. However, the functional effects of stomatin were strikingly different depending on the subunit. Stomatin had the most prominent effect on ASIC3, potently reducing acid-evoked current. In contrast, stomatin did not significantly decrease current amplitude generated by other ASIC channels; rather, it accelerated the rate of desensitization of ASIC2a homomeric channels as well as ASIC1a+3 and ASIC2a+3 heteromeric channels. Although stomatin interacted with ASIC1a protein, it did not alter ASIC1 current. Thus, binding alone is not sufficient to alter function. Our data provide important clues for understanding how stomatin modulates the function of ASICs. Stomatin reduced ASIC3 current but did not alter ASIC3 protein level or surface expression. Thus, the data suggest that stomatin inhibits ASIC3 by altering its gating. Also consistent with this mechanism, stomatin increased the desensitization rate of ASIC2a homomeric channels and ASIC1a+3 and ASIC2a+3 heteromeric channels. Thus, stomatin is an accessory subunit that interacts with ASIC channels at the cell surface to modulate gating. What is the mechanism whereby stomatin alters ASIC gating? The capacity of stomatin to bind to ASICs and accelerate channel desensitization is reminiscent of the role of accessory β subunits to facilitate inactivation of voltage-gated channels (55Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 61-93Google Scholar). In a similar manner, stomatin may function as an accessory subunit that directly modulates gating. Alternatively, stomatin could alter ASIC gating indirectly through the interaction of other proteins. Stomatin is highly expressed in mammalian lipid rafts (detergent-resistant, cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-rich regions of the membrane), which are important for sequestering proteins into complexes and localizing signal transduction processes (41Snyers L. Thines-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar, 56Nebl T. Pestonjamasp K.N. Leszyk J.D. Crowley J.L. Oh S.W. Luna E.J. J. Biol.

Recent experiments in C. elegans demonstrate that the stomatin-related proteins UNC-1 and UNC-24, along with the DEG/ENaC subunit UNC-8, are located in lipid rafts. Moreover, genetic disruption of UNC-1 abolished UNC-8 expression in lipid rafts (58Sedensky M.M. Siefker J.M. Koh J.Y. Miller D.M. II I Morgan P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C468-C474Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stomatin might localize ASICs to specific membrane microdomains to facilitate interactions with other regulatory and signaling proteins. ASIC activity can be modulated by several endogenous ligands and signaling molecules (45Askwith C.C. Cheng C. Ikuma M. Benson C. Price M.P. Welsh M.J.

However, less is understood regarding intracellular proteins that directly bind to and affect ASIC function. Yeast two-hybrid screening recently identified two proteins that interact with ASICs. In contrast to stomatin, both proteins potentiate ASIC currents. PICK1 interacts with ASIC1 and ASIC2 (47Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem.

Channel-interacting PDZ domain-containing protein (CIPP) binds to the COOH terminus of ASIC3 and increases current (65Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol.

Earlier studies suggested that ASICs might share a conserved function with their homologs in C. elegans, the degenerins. Mutations of the genes encoding DEG channel subunits MEC-4 and MEC-10 disrupt light touch in specialized mechanosensory neurons (24Driscoll M. Chalfie M.

Similarly, targeted deletion of ASIC2 and ASIC3 genes produced altered single fiber sensory nerve responses to cutaneous mechanical stimuli in mice (14Price M.P. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C.

Our data identifies another conserved feature; both DEG and ASIC channels are modulated by stomatin-related proteins. Similar to our data, the stomatin homolog MEC-2 co-immunoprecipitated with DEG channels, modulated current, and did not alter channel surface expression when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes (27Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting that MEC-2 and stomatin produced opposite effects on current. MEC-2 (and to a lesser extent stomatin) increased constitutive current generated by DEG channels (27Goodman M.B. Ernstrom G.G. Chelur D.S. O'Hagan R. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas stomatin inhibited ASIC3 such that H+ no longer activated the channel. Given the purported role of DEG channels and MEC-2 in mechanosensation in C. elegans, it is intriguing to speculate that the interaction of stomatin with ASIC3 changes the channel from a pH sensor to a mechanosensor. Modulation of ASICs has important implications. As H+-gated channels, they are poised to sense acidosis associated with such painful conditions as inflammation, ischemia, or malignancy; thus modulation of ASICs by stomatin might be an important means to regulate nociception. ASICs also function in sensation of mechanical stimuli. Thus, stomatin might play an important role in mammalian mechanosensation, analogous to the purported role of their homologs in C. elegans.

Such responses are essential for acclimation to a new osmotic environment. To identify factors involved in the perception and transduction of signals caused by hyperosmotic stress, we examined the response of Synechocystis sp.

We screened knockout libraries of histidine kinases (Hiks) and response regulators (Rres) in Synechocystis by DNA microarray and slot-blot hybridization analyses, and we identified several two-component systems, which we designated Hik-Rre systems, namely, Hik33-Rre31, Hik34-Rre1, and Hik10-Rre3, as well as Hik16-Hik41-Rre17, as the transducers of hyperosmotic stress. We also identified Hik2-Rre1 as a putative additional two-component system. Each individual two-component system regulated the transcription of a specific group of genes that were responsive to hyperosmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1990318022,"Furin is an endoprotease of the family of mammalian proprotein convertases and is involved in the activation of a large variety of regulatory proteins by cleavage at basic motifs. A large number of substrates have been attributed to furin on the basis of in vitro and ex vivo data. However, no physiological substrates have been confirmed directly in a mammalian model system, and early embryonic lethality of a furin knock-out mouse model has precluded in vivo verification of most candidate substrates. Here, we report the generation and characterization of an interferon inducible Mx-Cre/loxP furin knock-out mouse model. Induction resulted in near-complete ablation of the floxed fur exon in liver.In sharp contrast with the general furin knock-out mouse model, no obvious adverse effects were observed in the transgenic mice after induction. Histological analysis of the liver did not reveal any overt deviations from normal morphology. Analysis of candidate substrates in liver revealed complete redundancy for the processing of the insulin receptor. Variable degrees of redundancy were observed for the processing of albumin, α5 integrin, lipoprotein receptor-related protein, vitronectin and α1-microglobulin/bikunin. None of the tested substrates displayed a complete block of processing. The absence of a severe phenotype raises the possibility of using furin as a local therapeutic target in the treatment of pathologies like cancer and viral infections, although the observed redundancy may require combination therapy or the development of a more broad spectrum convertase inhibitor. Furin is an endoprotease of the family of mammalian proprotein convertases and is involved in the activation of a large variety of regulatory proteins by cleavage at basic motifs. A large number of substrates have been attributed to furin on the basis of in vitro and ex vivo data. However, no physiological substrates have been confirmed directly in a mammalian model system, and early embryonic lethality of a furin knock-out mouse model has precluded in vivo verification of most candidate substrates. Here, we report the generation and characterization of an interferon inducible Mx-Cre/loxP furin knock-out mouse model. Induction resulted in near-complete ablation of the floxed fur exon in liver. In sharp contrast with the general furin knock-out mouse model, no obvious adverse effects were observed in the transgenic mice after induction. Histological analysis of the liver did not reveal any overt deviations from normal morphology. Analysis of candidate substrates in liver revealed complete redundancy for the processing of the insulin receptor. Variable degrees of redundancy were observed for the processing of albumin, α5 integrin, lipoprotein receptor-related protein, vitronectin and α1-microglobulin/bikunin. None of the tested substrates displayed a complete block of processing. The absence of a severe phenotype raises the possibility of using furin as a local therapeutic target in the treatment of pathologies like cancer and viral infections, although the observed redundancy may require combination therapy or the development of a more broad spectrum convertase inhibitor. A large number of secretory proteins, including neuropeptides, peptide hormones, growth and differentiation factors, enzymes, adhesion molecules, receptors, and plasma proteins are activated by endoproteolytic cleavage at basic amino acid motifs by proprotein convertases (PCs). 1The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; ES, embryonic stem; pI-pC, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PACAP, propituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; GAPDH, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene.1The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; ES, embryonic stem; pI-pC, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PACAP, propituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; GAPDH, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. PCs are a family of seven closely related subtilisin-like serine proteases (furin, PC1 (also known as PC3), PC2, PC4, PC5 (also known as PC6), PACE4 and LPC (also known as PC7 and PC8)) (1Thomas G.

Prat A. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), with different, albeit partially overlapping, expression patterns and subcellular localization. Since the former seven PCs have similar specificities (basic amino acid motifs) it is impossible to predict physiological enzyme-substrate pairs, and most attempts at identification have relied on in vitro studies. However, co-overexpression studies of substrates with a PC are prone to false positive results, due to non-physiologically high enzyme levels, often in a heterologous cellular context. Direct evidence for enzyme-substrate pairs in vivo has been obtained from knock-out mouse models and human patients (recently reviewed in Ref. 5Taylor N.A. Van De Ven W.J. Creemers J.W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Most informative have been the knock-out mouse models for PC1, PC2, and PC4, which have a restricted expression pattern. Inactivation of PC1 and PC2, which are restricted to neuroendocrine tissues, causes multiple endocrine peptide-processing defects that result in severe but viable phenotypes (6Zhu X. Zhou A. Dey A. Norrbom C. Carroll R. Zhang C. Laurent V. Lindberg I. Ugleholdt R. Holst J.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10293-10298Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 7Furuta M.

The differences between PC1 deficiency in mouse and humans are striking, the former is characterized by dwarfism, the latter by obesity (8Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.L.

O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1550-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Inactivation of germ cell-specific PC4 results in reduced fertility, at least in part due to blocked processing of propituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) (10Li M. Mbikay M. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3723-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mbikay M. Tadros H. Ishida N. Lerner C.P. De Lamirande E. Chen A. El-Alfy M. Clermont Y. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Gagnon C. Simpson E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6842-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies have indicated that some substrates can be cleaved only by one PC, whereas other substrates are cleaved by multiple PCs. Depending on the co-expression of other PCs, redundancy may be cell type-specific. The knock-out mouse model of the ubiquitously expressed convertase LPC has no reported phenotype suggesting complete redundancy (12Villeneuve P. Feliciangeli S. Croissandeau G. Seidah N.G. Mbikay M. Kitabgi P. Beaudet A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Of course, it is possible that a more specialized function of LPC has resulted in a phenotype too subtle to detect by standard analysis. The null phenotypes of the other broadly expressed enzymes furin, PACE4 and PC6, feature early embryonic lethality, indicating vital, non-redundant functions of these enzymes at early developmental stages (5Taylor N.A. Van De Ven W.J. Creemers J.W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Constam D.B. Robertson E.J.

Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4863-4876PubMed Google Scholar). However, direct analysis of potential substrates involved in embryogenesis is difficult because of their low expression levels. Only BMP-4 cleavage has been examined directly and was shown to occur normally even in furin/PACE4 double knock-out embryos (15Beck S. Le Good J.A. Guzman M. Ben Haim N. Roy K. Beermann F. Constam D.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence was given for other substrates such as Nodal. The embryonic lethality precludes the analysis of many substrates expressed only in adult life or well differentiated tissues. This study describes the first conditional knock-out mouse model available for PCs. The inducible nature of the model has allowed us to investigate adult mice. We have focused on processing of substrates in liver for three reasons. First of all, the inducible knock-out system used here results in near-complete inactivation of the fur gene in liver but is less efficient in other tissues. Second, this biosynthetically very active organ produces a variety of potential substrates. Finally, the expression of high levels of furin in the presence of other PCs such as PACE4, PC6, and LPC provides an excellent opportunity to study whether specific enzyme-substrate relations exist in the presence of an extensive processing back-up potential. Derivation of furflox/flox Mice—The same 6-kb NotI fragment comprising exon 1A to intron 6 murine fur sequences as used for the construction of a targeting vector for the general fur knock-out mouse (14Roebroek A.J. Umans L. Pauli I.G. Robertson E.J. van Leuven F. Van de Ven W.J. Constam D.B. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4863-4876PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the construction of a floxed targeting vector to generate a conditional fur knock-out mouse. A 2-kb BamHI fragment encoding the hygromycin B phophotransferase (hygB) gene, fused to the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and flanked by loxP sites, was cloned into a BamHI site upstream of exon 2. A third loxP site was introduced in a BamHI site downstream of exon 2 (Fig. 1A). The introduced loxP sites consisted out of a central 34-bp loxP recognition sequence flanked by additional sequences, which were used to generate, by means of PCR, fragments with suitable restriction enzyme recognition sites at their ends. The total size of each loxP site insertion was 92 bp. The NotI insert of the targeting construct was excised and electroporated into E14 embryonic stem cells (16Doetschman T. Gregg R.G. Maeda N. Hooper M.L. Melton D.W. Thompson S. Smithies O. Nature. 1987; 330: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blot analysis. PCR amplification was used to confirm the presence of the third loxP in the recombinants. To remove the HygB selection marker cassette flanked by loxP sites from the floxed fur allele in vitro, Cre recombinase was transiently expressed in the ES cell line after electroporation of the pGK-CreNLSbpA plasmid (kindly provided by W. Müller, University of Cologne). To obtain ES cell lines with the desired deletion of the HygB selection marker cassette resulting from partial recombination by Cre recombinase (Fig. 1B), the protocol as described by Torres and Kühn (17Torres R.M. Kühn R. Laboratory Protocols for Conditional Gene Targeting. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar) was applied. Correct, partial Cre recombination was confirmed by PCR amplification, and these ES cell clones were injected into C57Bl6/J blastocysts using standard procedures. The resulting chimeras were mated with C57Bl6/J mice. Southern blotting and PCR analysis of tail DNA samples were used to confirm transmission of the furflox allele to the offspring. Heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to obtain homozygous furflox mice. Breeding with Cre Recombinase Transgenic Mice—To obtain in vivo inactivation of the furflox allele by Cre recombinase homozygous furflox/flox mice were crossed with two Cre transgenic mice. The pGK-Cre transgene mouse is a general deleter strain, which shows an early and uniform Cre expression (18Lallemand Y. Luria V. Haffner-Krausz R. Lonai P. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In the Mx-Cre mouse (strain Mx-Cre31a), Cre expression can be transiently induced by application of interferon (interferon-α or interferon-β) or synthetic double-stranded RNA (e.g. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pI-pC), an interferon inducer) (19Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). To induce expression of Cre in mice with the inducible Mx-Cre allele, 250 μg of pI-pC (ICN Pharmaceuticals; solution of 1 mg/ml in water) was injected five times intraperitoneally at 2-day intervals. Two days later (10 days after the first injection), the animals were analyzed. Probes and PCR Analysis for Genotyping of ES Cell Lines and Mice— For Southern blot analysis, both fur genomic and cDNA probes were used (Fig. 1A). cDNA probe 1 is a 0.6-kbp KpnI subfragment of the fur cDNA described previously (20Creemers J.W. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) corresponding to exon 1A (only 3′ part) and exons 2-4 (nucleotides 176-761). cDNA probe 2 was obtained by PCR amplification of nucleotides 970-1231 corresponding to exons 7 and 8 sequences. Genomic probe 3 encompasses a 0.5-kbp BamHI-KpnI fragment located immediately downstream of the BamHI site used to introduce the third loxP site, and encoding intron sequences and exon 3 and exon 4. The HygB probe, a 529-bp fragment of the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, was generated by PCR amplification using primers 5′-CAGCGAGAGCCTGACCTATTGC-3′ and 5′-CGATCCT-GCAAGCTCCGGATG-3′. For genotyping of the fur gene by PCR, four primers were used: P1 (5′-GCTGTATTTATTCCGGAGAC-3′), P2 (5′-GTAGTTAGGAGCA-CATACTG-3′), P3 (5′-ATGCTCAAGGCCAGAAGATC-3′), and P4 (5′-AATCTGTTCCCTGCTGAGGA-3′). Primers P1 and P2 are localized upstream and downstream respectively, of the BamHI site used to insert the HygB cassette flanked by loxP sites. This pair gives an amplimer size of 219 or 311 bp, depending on the presence of the loxP site. Primers P3 and P4 are localized upstream and downstream, respectively, of the BamHI site used to insert the third loxP site. This pair gives an amplimer size of 390 or 482 bp, depending on the presence of the loxP site. Combination of primer P1 and P4 gives fragments of 1442 and 1258 bp on the furflox and furwt allele, respectively. After deletion by Cre recombinase, this primer set gives a fragment of 322 bp on the inactivated furΔflox allele. For analysis of transmission of the Cre transgenes to the offspring, two additional primer pairs were used. Primer pair 5′-CCGGGCTGC-CACGACCAA-3′ and 5′-GGCGCGGCAACACCATTTTT-3′ amplified an internal Cre fragment of 445 bp. Primer pair 5′-GCGGAGCCAGCACTATTTA-3′ and 5′-CCGGCAT-CAACGTTTTCTTTT-3′ amplified a fragment of ∼450 bp corresponding to Mx-promoter sequences up to sequences in the Cre coding region. Northern Blot Analysis and Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue from induced wildtype and transgenic mice. For Northern blot analysis 15 μg of RNA was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized according to standard procedures as described (20Creemers J.W. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For fur an exon 2-specific cDNA probe of 380 bp was used and a 2.8-kb cDNA probe spanning the entire coding sequence was also used. In addition, a 1.7-kb cDNA probe for PACE4, a 3-kb PC5 cDNA probe (containing the sequences common in PC5A and PC5B), a 2.5-kb LPC cDNA probe, and a 350-bp actin probe were used. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR. cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription PCR (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using the qPCR core kit (Eurogentec) and was carried out using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Probes and primers for fur and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene), the reference gene, were designed by Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). The probes were labeled on the 5′-end by 6-carboxyfluorescein and the 3′-end by 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. The following primers were used: fur exon 2 forward primer, 5′-CAGAAGCATGGCTTCC-ACAAC-3′; fur exon 3 reverse primer, 5′-TGTCACTGCTCTGTGCCA-GAA-3′; fur exon 2-3 probe, 5′-TGGGCCAGATCTTCGGTGACTATTA-CCA-3′; GAPDH forward primer, 5′-ATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCT-3′; GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-CAGGCGGCACGTCAGAT-3′; GAPDH probe, 5′-CCCCCAATGTGTCCGTCGTG-3′. The relative gene expression was quantified using the comparative threshold cycle method (Applied Biosystems). Histology—For histological analysis, liver tissues from both induced and non-induced wild type and transgenic mice were processed in parallel to provide appropriate controls also for the induction procedure itself. Liver tissue was immersion-fixed in either modified Bouin's solution (the original fixative diluted 1:4 in 0.1 m Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) or a variant of Karnovsky's fixative (10% neutral buffered formaline (Prosan/Microm) with 1% glutaraldehyde (AGAR Scientific). The tissues were embedded in Paraplast Plus or postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Araldite (AGAR Scientific), respectively, following standard protocols. Paraffin blocks were serially sectioned at 7 μm on a rotary microtome (SLEE, Mainz, Germany) and sections further processed for alternating routine stains (hematoxylin and eosine) and immunohistochemistry. Tissues embedded in Araldite were cut on a LEICA Ultracut UCT at 1 μm and serial sections were stained with either toluidine blue or paraphenylene diamine. For immunohistology and lectin histochemistry, paraffin sections were dewaxed in Clear-Riite (Prosan/Microm), rehydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and after blocking incubated with antibodies F4/80 (mouse macrophages), CD45 (mouse leukocytes), and biotin-tagged lectins RCA-1 (endothelia and activated macrophages) and PNA (endothelia). Furthermore, Dolichus biflorus lectin was employed to visualize bile canaliculi and intrahepatic bile ducts. Detection of bound reagents was performed by using horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibodies and 3-tagged streptavidin for the biotinylated lectins, respectively, followed by tyramide-bound fluorescein isothiocyanate (TSA renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Blotting—Processing of candidate substrates was analyzed by Western blotting. Postnuclear supernatant of liver tissue was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to obtain soluble and membrane fractions. SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing were performed as described previously (21Creemers J.W. Ines Dominguez D. Plets E. Serneels L. Taylor N.A. Multhaup G. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4211-4217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); equal amounts of protein from liver extracts from mice of the indicated genotype were loaded. Immunodetection of the insulin receptor was performed by a combination of immunoprecipitation using rabbit antibody CO-10 followed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody CT-1 as described (22Bailyes E.M. Nave B.T. Soos M.A. Orr S.R. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Both antibodies were kindly provided by Ken Siddle (Cambridge, UK). Anti-α1-microglobulin antibody was a generous gift of Cecilia Falkenberg (Lund, Sweden). Anti-α5 integrin antibody was purchased from Chemicon, anti-mouse albumin was from Biotrend, and anti-vitronectin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) antibody, directed against the C terminus of the LRP precursor and the β-subunit, has been described before (23Umans L. Serneels L. Lorent K. Dewachter I. Tesseur I. Moechars D. Van Leuven F. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Derivation of ES Cells with a FURflox Allele—The targeting construct for the generation of a floxed fur (furflox) allele, enabling conditional inactivation, contained the hygromycin B phophotransferase (HygB) gene, flanked by loxP sites, and was cloned upstream of exon 2 (Fig. 1A). A third loxP site was introduced downstream of exon 2. Deletion of exon 2 sequences, encoding the translation initiation site, the signal peptide, and part of the prodomain of furin, was expected to inactivate the fur gene. Following electroporation into E14 ES cells individual drug-resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blotting using external cDNA probe 2 (corresponding to exons 7 and 8). Of 180 drug-resistant colonies analyzed, 24 clones appeared to result from homologous recombination. PCR analysis showed that in 6 out of 24 clones, recombination at the 3′-end of the construct had occurred downstream of the third loxP site. Southern blot analysis of these six clones confirmed that the targeting had indeed occurred correctly (data not shown). Since the presence of the floxed drug-resistance gene in intron 1 (furflox+HygB allele, Fig. 1, A and B) could have some deleterious effect on the expression of the floxed fur gene, this cassette was removed in vitro by partial loxP recombination. To achieve this, a Cre recombinase plasmid was transiently expressed in one of the ES cell lines. To obtain ES cell lines in which Cre recombination resulted in only partial deletion, the protocol as described (17Torres R.M. Kühn R. Laboratory Protocols for Conditional Gene Targeting. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar) was applied. After choosing 100 individual clones and splitting into two pools, one of the pools was analyzed for HygB sensitivity. Out of 40 clones, which had regained HygB sensitivity, three showed the proper partial deletion of the HygB cassette (furflox allele), whereas the others resulted from complete deletion (furΔflox allele) (Fig. 1B). Fig. 2A shows a Southern blot analysis confirming the partial or complete deletion, which was further substantiated by PCR (data not shown). Generation of furflox/flox Mice and Conversion of the Floxed fur Allele (furflox) into a fur Null Allele (furΔflox) by Cre Recombinase—All three furflox ES cell lines gave rise to germ line transmission after mating of chimeras with C57Bl/6J mice. Heterozygous (C57Bl/6J × 129) F1 offspring were intercrossed, and viable offspring were genotyped by PCR. Of a progeny of 94 pups, 24 (26%) were wild type (furwt/wt), 43 (46%) were heterozygotes (furflox/wt), and 27 (29%) were homozygous for the floxed allele (furflox/flox). The homozygous furflox/flox mice were, as expected, normal, viable, and fertile. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm the genotyping results as obtained by PCR analysis (Fig. 2B). Northern blot analysis of liver samples of littermates revealed similar fur mRNA expression levels for all three genotypes (data not shown). To demonstrate that the floxed fur allele (furflox) could be converted into a fur null allele (furΔflox) via inactivation by Cre recombinase in vivo, homozygous furflox/flox mice were crossed with a general deleter pGK-Cre transgenic mouse (18Lallemand Y. Luria V. Haffner-Krausz R. Lonai P. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). All heterozygote furflox/wt offspring carrying the pGK-Cre transgene showed the expected general deletion of fur exon 2 sequences as monitored by PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). These heterozygotes (furΔflox/wt) were intercrossed and viable offspring was genotyped by PCR. Only heterozygote (furΔflox/wt) (42 pups, 65%) and wild type (furwt/wt) (23 pups, 35%) offspring was identified. This ratio of about 2 to 1 is in accordance with the expectation, that the furΔflox/flox genotype is embryonically lethal like the general fur knock-out mouse (14Roebroek A.J. Umans L. Pauli I.G. Robertson E.J. van Leuven F. Van de Ven W.J. Constam D.B. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4863-4876PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that these mice carried zero, one, or two copies of the pGK-Cre allele, as both the parental mice carried one copy of the pGK-Cre allele. However, since the null allele (furΔflox) is germ line-transmitted, it is independent of continued expression of Cre recombinase. To exclude any interference of the presence of the pGK-Cre transgene, these heterozygotes (furΔflox/wt) were crossed with wild type C57Bl/6J mice. Heterozygotes (furΔflox/wt) without the pGK-Cre transgene were identified by PCR analysis and intercrossed. Again no viable homozygous furΔflox/Δflox mice were born. To determine the timing of the developmental arrest, embryos from heterozygous intercross matings were analyzed macroscopically and genotyped by PCR. As described in detail for the classical fur knock-out embryos (14Roebroek A.J. Umans L. Pauli I.G. Robertson E.J. van Leuven F. Van de Ven W.J. Constam D.B. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4863-4876PubMed Google Scholar), no homozygous furΔflox/Δflox mutant embryos were recovered from 11.5 days postcoitus onwards, although at this stage some deciduas contained remnants of resorbed tissue. At 9.5 and 10.5 days postcoitus about 25% of the embryos analyzed were homozygous furΔflox/Δflox mutant. Macroscopically these mutant embryos showed a similar phenotype as the classical fur knock-out embryos: defects in ventral closure and axial rotation (data not shown). The furΔflox allele (deletion of exon 2 sequences) and the classical fur knock-out allele (targeted disruption of exon 4 sequences by a selection marker gene) can both be considered genuine fur null alleles. Conditional Inactivation of the furflox Allele in the Liver—To inactivate the furflox allele conditionally, the furflox/flox mice were crossed with Mx-Cre transgenic mice. In this transgenic line, Cre expression can be induced by pI-pC. This has been shown to result in complete deletion of reporter genes in liver; near-complete deletion in spleen; partial deletion in duodenum, heart, lung, uterus, thymus, and kidney; and inefficient deletion in muscle, tail, and brain (19Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Offspring heterozygous for the floxed fur allele and the Mx-Cre transgene were subsequently intercrossed to obtain homozygous furflox/flox mice carrying in addition one or two Mx-Cre alleles. After induction, Cre recombination of the floxed fur allele was analyzed in the liver and in brain tissue. In brain very little recombination could be detected, whereas near-complete inactivation of the floxed fur allele was observed in liver, consistent with previous results obtained with Mx-Cre mice (8 and 100%, respectively (19Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar)). However, besides the inactivated furΔflox allele and the non-recombined furflox allele, a third kind of fur allele could be detected, albeit at very low amounts. Analysis with an exon 2 specific probe revealed that this third fur allele had arisen from integration of the excised fragment into the other allele in the same cell (data not shown). Obviously, as long as the excised circular DNA fragment remains present, it can participate in a second Cre recombination event. To avoid this problem of reintegration resulting in a third kind of fur allele with unknown impact, a different crossing scheme was designed. The Mx-Cre allele was crossed into mice heterozygous for the furΔflox allele obtained initially by crossing with a pGK-Cre transgene (see above). Subsequently, mice heterozygous for both the furΔflox allele and the Mx-Cre transgene were crossed with homozygous furflox/flox mice (Fig. 3). Since one of the fur alleles is already inactivated, reintegration will just restore one of the two inactivated alleles into a furflox allele with a zero net effect. The resulting offspring was used to inactivate the furflox allele conditionally in the liver. As shown in Fig. 4, in furΔflox/flox and furΔflox/wt mice, heterozygous for the Mx-Cre allele, the furflox allele was recombined into a furΔflox allele in the liver with high efficiency, whereas in brain hardly any Cre recombination could be detected. From these analyses it can be concluded that in furΔflox/flox mice, heterozygous for the Mx-Cre allele, the fur gene can be efficiently inactivated in liver upon induction of Cre expression. This was further substantiated by Northern blot analysis and quantitative PCR using RNA isolated after pI-pC induction from livers from furΔflox/flox mice, heterozygous for the Mx-Cre allele (Fig. 5 and Table I). This results demonstrated that ∼1% of normal levels of wild type fur mRNA was still present. The residual presence of the furflox allele points toward the presence"
https://openalex.org/W2062692422,"Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies have emerged as important therapeutic agents for selected malignancies. One mechanism by which antibodies can exert cytotoxic effects is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In an effort to increase the efficiency of ADCC at tumor sites, we have focused on the construction of bispecific antibodies specific for the tumor antigen HER2/neu and the FcγRIII-activating receptor (CD16) found on NK cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and neutrophils. Here, we describe the production of bispecific minibodies in two distinct binding formats. The parent minibody was constructed such that the IgG1 CH3 constant domain serves as the oligomerization domain and is attached to an anti-CD16 and an anti-HER2/ neu single-chain Fv via 19- and 29-amino acid linkers, respectively. This molecule can be expressed in mammalian cells from a dicistronic vector and has been purified using sequential affinity purification techniques. Analysis by surface plasmon resonance shows that the bispecific minibody can bind to HER2/neu and CD16, both individually and simultaneously. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies show that the minibody can induce significant tumor cell lysis at a concentration as low as 20 nm. A trimeric, bispecific minibody (TriBi) that binds dimerically to HER2/neu and monomerically to CD16 induces equivalent cytotoxicity at lower antibody concentrations than either the parent minibody or the corresponding single-chain dimer. Both minibody constructs are stable in mouse and human serum for up to 72 h at 37 °C. These minibodies have the potential to target solid tumors and promote tumor lysis by natural killer cells and mononuclear phagocytes. Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies have emerged as important therapeutic agents for selected malignancies. One mechanism by which antibodies can exert cytotoxic effects is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In an effort to increase the efficiency of ADCC at tumor sites, we have focused on the construction of bispecific antibodies specific for the tumor antigen HER2/neu and the FcγRIII-activating receptor (CD16) found on NK cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and neutrophils. Here, we describe the production of bispecific minibodies in two distinct binding formats. The parent minibody was constructed such that the IgG1 CH3 constant domain serves as the oligomerization domain and is attached to an anti-CD16 and an anti-HER2/ neu single-chain Fv via 19- and 29-amino acid linkers, respectively.

Both minibody constructs are stable in mouse and human serum for up to 72 h at 37 °C. These minibodies have the potential to target solid tumors and promote tumor lysis by natural killer cells and mononuclear phagocytes. Antibodies have emerged as important components of effective therapies for an increasing number of human malignancies. Unconjugated antibodies directed against the B-cell idio-type (1Miller R.A.

One anti-CD20 antibody has become a widely used, Food and Drug Administration-approved agent with potential applications to other malignancies as well. Radioimmunoconjugates have also been constructed for imaging as well as therapy. Two agents that recognize CD20 have been shown to exhibit significant anti-tumor activity (5Witzig T.E. Gordon L.I.

An anti-CD52 antibody that efficiently mediates complement fixation has been approved for use in chemotherapy-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (7Lundin J. Kimby E. Bjorkholm M. Broliden P.A.

In addition, an immunoconjugate consisting of an anti-CD33 antibody and calicheamicin has been approved for use in refractory acute myeloid leukemia (8Sievers E.L. Appelbaum F.R. Spielberger R.T.

Immunotoxins consisting of recombinant antibody fragments and catalytic toxins demonstrate anti-tumor activity as well (9Kreitman R.J. Wilson W.H. Bergeron K. Raggio M. Stetler-Stevenson M.

Other examples of antibodies that have shown therapeutic promise or have already been approved for use as therapeutic agents include an unconjugated anti-HER2/neu antibody that is widely used alone and in combination with chemotherapy agents in breast cancer (10Cobleigh M.A. Vogel C.L.

Antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor exhibit activity in advanced colorectal cancer (13Robert F. Ezekiel M.P. Spencer S.A. Meredith R.F.

Furthermore, antibodies that inhibit T-cell activation by blocking the function of the CTLA-4 co-receptor on T-cells exhibit pre-clinical promise (15Oegen J.G. Kuhns M.S. Allison J.P. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and are undergoing clinical evaluation. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 1The abbreviations used are: ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; BsAb, bispecific antibody; ECD, extracellular domain; E/T, effector cell to target cell (ratio); scFv, single-chain Fv; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TriBi, trimeric bispecific minibody. occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on tumor cells and the antibody Fc domains engage Fc receptors on immune effector cells (16Steplewski Z. Lubeck M.D. Koprowski H. Science. 1983; 221: 865-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several families of Fc receptors have been identified, and specific cell populations characteristically express defined Fc receptors (17Heijnen I.A. van de Winkel J.G. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, polymorphonuclear leukocytes commonly express human FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), and the B (lipid-anchored) isoform of FcγRIII (CD16). In contrast, human natural killer cells express only the A (transmembrane) isoform of CD16. This structure facilitates the recruitment of adaptor proteins and the activation of natural killer cells by antibody engagement of CD16 (18Sulica A. Morel P. Metes D. Herberman R.B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 371-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Many anti-tumor antibodies have been shown to mediate in vitro ADCC. Clynes et al. evaluated the importance of Fc receptor interactions by examining the anti-tumor activities of clinically effective monoclonal antibodies against human tumor xenografts in either wild-type mice or murine FcγRII/III knock-out mice (19Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). Anti-tumor activity was diminished in the Fcγ receptor knock-out mice and was preserved when only the inhibitory Fcγ receptor isoform was deleted. These data support the concept that Fc receptor interactions underlie anti-tumor efficacy in mice and suggest that such interactions may be important for the anti-tumor activity of selected antibodies in the clinic (19Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). The effector cell populations required for these effects have not been defined but are presumed to include mononuclear phagocytes and/or natural killer cells. Manipulations of Fc domain structure can customize antibody clearance and the interaction of Fc domains with cellular Fc receptors (20Shields R.L. Namenuk A.K. Hong K. Meng Y.G. Rae J. Briggs J.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Recently, polymorphisms in human FcγRIII have been associated with varying probabilities of clinical response to Rituximab (23Cartron G. Dacheux L. Salles G. Solal-Celigny P. Bardos P. Colombat P. Watier H. Blood. 2002; 99: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). These considerations support efforts to developed antibodies with improved capacity to promote anti-tumor cellular cytotoxicity. One such approach has been to develop bispecific antibodies (BsAbs). In the nearly 20 years following the pioneering work of David Segal and colleagues (34Titus J.A. Perez P. Kaubisch A. Garrido M.A. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3153-3158PubMed Google Scholar), numerous BsAb targeting tumor antigens and effector cell trigger molecules have been developed and shown to redirect cellular cytotoxicity. For example, BsAbs can target tumor antigens and human effector cell trigger molecules on T-cells via CD3/TcR (24Segal D.M. Wunderlich J.R. Cancer Investig. 1988; 6: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Lanzavecchia A. Scheidegger D. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BsAbs directed against FcγRI (27Shen L. Guyre P.M. Anderson C.L. Fanger M.W. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3378-3382PubMed Google Scholar) trigger tumor cytotoxicity by neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. BsAbs targeting FcγRIII (28Garcia de Palazzo I. Gercel-Taylor C. Kitson J.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6832-6839PubMed Google Scholar) promote tumor lysis by macrophages and NK cells, while BsAbs targeting CD44 (31Sconocchia G. Titus J.A. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5473-5481PubMed Google Scholar) promote tumor cytotoxicity by NK cells alone. Typically, BsAbs promote in vitro cytotoxicity at low concentrations and have been shown to cause either growth delays or tumor regressions in appropriate animal models (32Weiner L.M. Holmes M. Adams G.P. LaCreta F. Watts P. De Palazzo I.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiner G.J. Kostelny S.A. Hillstrom J.R. Cole M.S. Link B.K. Wang S.L. Tso J.Y. J.

Renner C. Sahin U. Schmits R. Wolf J. Kapp U. Diel V. Pfreundschuh M. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These properties have led to the testing of several BsAbs in human clinical trials. Several trials have been conducted with chemically linked dimers targeting CD64 and either HER2/neu or the epidermal growth factor receptor, either alone or in conjunction with leukocyte activators such as γ-interferon, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (36Valone F.H. Kaufman P.A. Guyre P.M. Lewis L.D. Memoli V. Deo Y. Graziano R. Fisher J.L. Meyer L. Mrozek-Orlowski M. J. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 13: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37Goldstein J.

These approaches thus far have yielded minimal clinical anti-tumor activity. We developed and conducted clinical trials of the 2B1 bispecific monoclonal IgG antibody that targets epitopes on the extracellular domains of HER2/neu and CD16, respectively (41Weiner L.M. Clark J.I. Davey M. Li W.S. Garcia de Palazzo I. Ring D.B. Alpaugh R.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4586-4593PubMed Google Scholar). Therapy with this antibody led to occasional clinical responses and induced the development of host anti-HER2/neu antibodies and T-cell responses directed against both the extracellular and intracellular domains of HER2/neu. This phenomenon of Fc receptor-targeted immunization is best explained by bispecific antibody promotion of tumor lysis, with subsequent antigen presentation (42Clark J.I. Alpaugh R.K. von Mehren M. Schultz J. Gralow J.R. Cheever M.A. Ring D.B. Weiner L.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1997; 44: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Treatment with 2B1 was associated with dose-limiting toxicities including thrombocytopenia, cytokine-release syndrome, and profound, transient leukopenia induced by the binding of the antibody to multiple Fc receptors through its anti-CD16 and Fc domains. Accordingly, the antibody cross-linked neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes, leading to cytokine release (41Weiner L.M. Clark J.I. Davey M. Li W.S. Garcia de Palazzo I. Ring D.B. Alpaugh R.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4586-4593PubMed Google Scholar, 43Weiner L.M. Alpaugh R.K. Amoroso A.R. Adams G.P. Ring D.B. Barth M.W. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1996; 42: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To address this problem we created recombinant single-chain Fv-based bispecific antibodies that bind to tumor antigens with high affinity (44Schier R. Marks J.D. Wolf E.J. Apell G. Wong C. McCartney J.E. Bookman M.A. Huston J.S. Houston L.L. Weiner L.M. Adams G.P. Immunotechnology. 1995; 1: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 45Schier R. Bye J. Apell G. McCall A. Adams G.P. Malmqvist M. Weiner L.M. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 46Schier R. McCall A. Adams G.P. Marshall K.W. Merritt H. Yim M. Crawford R.S. Weiner L.M. Marks C. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and to CD16 with a lower affinity. These single-chain Fv dimers contain no Fc domains and do not activate leukocytes in the absence of tumor engagement (47McCall A.M. Adams G.P. Amoroso A.R. Nielsen U.B. Zhang L. Horak E. Simmons H. Schier R. Marks J.D. Weiner L.M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of binding affinity for HER2/neu on the capacity to promote tumor cytotoxicity, we subsequently prepared single-chain Fv bispecific dimers with varying binding affinity for HER2/neu and found that higher affinity binding to the tumor antigen corresponds to a greater potential to induce cytotoxicity (48McCall A.M. Shahied L. Amoroso A.R. Horak E.M. Simmons H.H. Nielson U. Adams G.P. Schier R. Marks J.D. Weiner L.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6112-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Knowing that higher affinity for tumor antigen improves bispecific antibody-promoted cytotoxicity, we sought to determine whether increased valence would have similar effects. To accomplish this, we constructed bispecific minibodies that bind monovalently and divalently to HER2/neu and monovalently to CD16. The minibody format was chosen to increase the span of the bispecific molecule so that it approximates more closely the functional binding site of an IgG molecule. We found that these binding formats are more efficient mediators of antibody-promoted cellular cytotoxicity and offer advantages over bispecific single-chain Fv molecules. Bispecific Minibody—The genes for the anti-HER2/neu and the anti-CD16 scFvs were each cloned into the pBudCE4 dicistronic vector (Invitrogen) adjacent to the CH3 gene (kindly provided to us by IDEC) and separated by a short linker (19 and 29 amino acids, respectively). Cloning of the Ig κ-chain signal sequence (Invitrogen) at the 5′-end of each sequence allowed for secretion of the molecule into the culture media. Mutations were made in each of the CH3 domains to create the “knobs-into-holes” configuration (49Ridgway J.B. Presta L.G. Carter P. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In the anti-HER2/neu strand the smaller CH3 Thr-26 residue was mutated to a larger tyrosine residue by using PCR primers to change the threonine codon, ACC, to the tyrosine codon TAC. In contrast, in the anti-CD16 strand the reverse was performed in that the larger CH3 Tyr-67 molecule was converted to a smaller threonine residue by mutating the tyrosine codon, TAC, to the threonine codon, ACC, using PCR primers. Two cysteine residues were added at the 3′-end of each CH3 domain to allow for disulfide bond formation, which stabilized the minibody construct. Sequences corresponding to a V5 epitope as well as a His6 tag were cloned at the 3′-end of the anti-HER2/neu binding arm, whereas the anti-CD16 binding arm contains a Myc epitope as well as a His6 tag at its 3′-end. A FLAG epitope was also cloned at the 5′-end of the anti-HER2/neu scFv. The pBudCE4-bispecific minibody vector was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and stably transfected into HEK 293 cells. Zeocin was used for the selection of positive HEK 293 cell clones. Cells supernatants were collected, centrifuged, and filtered prior to loading onto a 5-ml His-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific proteins were removed from the column by first washing with phosphate buffer containing 10 mm imidazole followed by a second phosphate buffer wash containing 50 mm imidazole. Minibody proteins were then batch eluted using a 500 mm imidazole phosphate buffer. Fractions containing the proteins were combined and dialyzed into PBS. Proteins were subsequently loaded onto an anti-FLAG column (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for further purification of the bispecific species. Nonspecifically bound proteins were washed away with PBS, and the minibody was batch eluted in 4× 1-ml fractions using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8. After visualization on an SDS-PAGE gel, fractions containing the bispecific minibody were combined and dialyzed into PBS. The protein was finally purified over an anti-Myc column (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ) using the same methods employed for purification over the anti-FLAG column. Fractions containing the purified bispecific minibody were combined and dialyzed into PBS. Concentration measurement was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Trimeric Bispecific Minibody (TriBi)—The trimeric bispecific minibody was cloned similarly to the bispecific minibody. An additional anti-HER2/neu scFv was cloned 3′ to the CH3 domain of the pre-existing anti-HER2/neu binding arm. The second anti-HER2/neu scFv was separated from the carboxyl-terminal end of the CH3 domain by a 24-amino acid linker. A FLAG epitope was cloned at the 5′-end, and a V5 epitope was cloned at the 3′-end of the anti-HER2/neu binding arm similarly to the bispecific minibody. However, unlike the parent molecule, the His6 tag was removed from this binding arm to simplify purification of the molecule. The TriBi molecule was expressed and purified as described for the bispecific minibody. However, because of the removal of the histidine tag from one of the binding arms, the anti-Myc column was not required for its purification. CD16 ECD—The CD16A (CD16) extracellular domain was subcloned from the retroviral vector pBMN-IRES-EGFP (a kind gift of Dr. Sei-ich Yusa and Dr. Kerry Campbell, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) (50Yusa S. Catina T.L. Campbell K.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5047-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and into the pSec Tag2/Hygro A mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Corp). This plasmid contained an Ig κ-chain leader sequence located 5′ to the CD16 cDNA as a means to induce secretion of the expressed CD16 ECD protein into the cell supernatant. The sequences for both a Myc epitope and a His6 tag were located 3′ to the CD16 ECD gene. The pSec Tag2/Hygro A-CD16 vector was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and stably transfected into HEK 293 cells. Hygromycin was used for the selection of positive HEK 293 cell clones. Cell supernatants were collected, centrifuged, and filtered prior to loading onto a 5-ml His-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences) for protein purification. Purified protein was visualized on an SDS-PAGE gel. Fractions containing the protein were combined and dialyzed into PBS. Bispecific Minibody—The binding kinetics of the bispecific minibody binding to the ECDs of both CD16 and HER2/neu were determined by surface plasmon resonance using the Biacore 1000 biosensor system (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) (51Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander R. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). The bispecific minibody was dialyzed into 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and immobilized on a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore Inc.) by amine coupling (kit supplied by the manufacturer). Unreacted moieties on the chip surface were blocked with ethanolamine. The minibody was applied to a CM5 sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 4 min, resulting in the immobilization of 343 response units on one flow cell (used for the HER2/neu binding experiment) and 180 response units on another flow cell (used for the CD16 binding experiment). Both the HER2/neu and the CD16 ECDs were dialyzed into PBS and then diluted into concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 320 nm. Binding affinities were analyzed by the continuous flow of the analytes across the appropriate occupied flow cell at a rate of 50 μl/min for 30 min. Each sample also was passed over a control flow cell that had been activated but contained no antigen. The control binding curves were subtracted from the corresponding test curves. As a second control, PBS was passed over the test flow cell. This control curve also was subtracted from the test curves to correct for buffer effects. Following the analysis of each sample, the CM5 sensor chip was regenerated by passing 4 m MgCl2, followed by 50 mm triethylamine at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Kinetic analysis was performed for each antigen to determine the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rates as well as the equilibrium constants (KA and KD). A two-step binding assay was performed to determine whether the bispecific minibody could bind to both of its targets simultaneously. In this experiment the minibody was passed over a CM5 sensor chip containing a high density of the HER2/neu ECD. Once binding was observed, the CD16 ECD was passed over the same (unwashed) flow cell, and a change in response was recorded. As a negative control, an unrelated protein was passed over the HER2/neu-minibody complex, and any change in response was recorded. TriBi Minibody—The TriBi molecule was dialyzed into 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and coated onto a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore Inc.). Unreacted moieties on the chip surfaces were blocked with ethanolamine. The TriBi was applied to a CM5 sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 4 min, resulting in the immobilization of 334 response units of material. This flow cell was used for both the HER2/neu and the CD16 binding assays, which were performed as described above for the bispecific minibody. To determine that the TriBi minibody possessed bispecific functionality, a two-step binding assay was performed as described above for the bispecific minibody. Two hundred nanograms of each minibody construct were incubated in both 100% human and 100% mouse serum at 37 °C for up to 72 h. Samples were removed for analysis at 5 min, 6 h, 24 h, and 72 h following the start of incubation. SDS loading dye was added to each sample and frozen until the entire study was completed. Samples were resolved on a 9% polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions and subsequently visualized by anti-histidine Western analysis. To determine whether minibody constructs remained functional in human serum, both minibody constructs were incubated in 10% serum at 37 °C for 24 h. As a control, a second set of serum-exposed samples was frozen immediately in SDS loading dye to represent a zero time point. Both minibodies were then tested for their capability to retain functional binding using surface plasmon resonance on the Biacore 1000 instrument. The HER2/neu ECD was coated onto the surface of a research grade CM5 sensor chip at a high density. Each of the minibody constructs was passed over the flow cell containing the immobilized HER2/neu ECD at a flow rate of 15 μl/min, and a change in response was monitored. Ten percent serum alone was also passed over the chip as a negative control. These studies were performed as described previously (29Weiner L.M. Holmes M. Richeson A. Godwin A. Adams G.P.

Briefly, human CD16-transduced NK-92 cells (a kind gift of Dr. Kerry Campbell, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA and of the ZelleRx Corporation (Chicago, IL)) served as the effector cells (E) for this assay. The cells were cultured in α-minimal Eagle's medium, 12.5% fetal bovine serum, 12.5% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.2 mm inositol, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02 mm folic acid. Cells were restimulated with fresh medium containing human interleukin-2 1 day prior to the assay. SK-OV-3 target cells (T) were labeled with Na51CrO4 (100 μCi/106 targets; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 37 °C in supplemented RPMI 1640. The 51Cr-labeled SK-OV-3 target cells were washed twice and resuspended at the desired concentration. Ten thousand cells were added to individual wells of 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) containing hNK-92 cells and/or antibody in supplemented RPMI 1640. Effector cells were added to yield E/T ratios of 25:1, 10:1, and 5:1 in the presence or absence of various concentrations of antibody. Each well contained a total volume of 200 μl, and all assays were performed in triplicate. The plates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min, incubated for 4 h in a 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator at 37 °C, and then centrifuged again at 300 × g for 3 min. One hundred microliters of supernatant were removed from each well for counting on a Packard Instruments Cobra Quantum, Series 5002 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cytotoxicity was estimated by measuring the quantity of label released into culture supernatants using the formula shown in Equation 1, % Lysis=100×Experimental release(cpm)−Spontaneous release(cpm)Total counts(cpm)/2−Spontaneous release(cpm)(Eq. 1) where the experimental release was defined as counts per minute (cpm) released by target cells in the presence of effector cells and/or antibody and the spontaneous release was defined as cpm released by target cells alone.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the counterregulation of PGI2/TxA2 signaling are unclear. We examined the interaction of the receptors for PGI2 (IP) and TxA2 (TPα). IP-induced cAMP and TP-induced inositol phosphate generation were unaltered when the receptors were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells (IP/TPα-HEK). TP-cAMP generation, in response to TP agonists or a TP-dependent isoprostane, iPE2III, was evident in IP/TPα-HEK and in aortic smooth muscle cells, but not in cells expressing either receptor alone, or in IP-deficient aortic smooth muscle cells. Augmentation of TP-induced cAMP generation, with the IP agonist cicaprost, was ablated in IP-deficient cells and was independent of direct IP signaling. IP/TPα heterodimers were formed constitutively when the receptors were co-expressed, with no overt changes in ligand binding to the individual receptor sites. However, despite inefficient binding of iPE2III to either the IP or TPα, expressed alone or in combination, robust cAMP generation was evident in IP/TPα-HEK, suggesting the formation of an alternative receptor site. Thus, IP/TPα dimerization was coincident with TP-cAMP generation, promoting a “PGI2-like” cellular response to TP activation. This represents a previously unknown mechanism by which IP may limit the cellular effects of TP.

Pharmacol. 1998; 345: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), demonstrates antithrombotic and anti-platelet actions in vivo (5Cheng Y. Austin S.C. Rocca B. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. Grosser T. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Science. 2002; 296: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In contrast, TxA2 is a potent vasoconstrictor (6Dorn II, G.W. Sens D. Chaikhouni A. Mais D. Halushka P.V. Circ. Res. 1987; 60: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), stimulates platelet aggregation (7FitzGerald G.A. Am. J.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that PGI2 modulates cardiovascular homeostasis and disease gained support from the association of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, which depresses PGI2 levels without affecting platelet TxA2 biosynthesis, with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in humans, compared with a nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor naproxen (VIGOR trial) (9Bombardier C. Laine L. Reicin A. Shapiro D. Burgos-Vargas R. Davis B. Day R. Ferraz M.B. Hawkey C.J. Hochberg M.C. Kvien T.K. Schnitzer T.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1520-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Recent work, using mice genetically deficient in the receptors for PGI2 (the IP) or TxA2 (the TP), demonstrated that the proliferative and platelet response to vascular injury was TP-mediated and was limited specifically by PGI2 (5Cheng Y. Austin S.C. Rocca B. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. Grosser T. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Science. 2002; 296: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In addition, delivery of PGI2 synthase in vivo prevents proliferation and migration of SMC, key features of restenosis and atherosclerosis (10Harada M. Toki Y. Numaguchi Y. Osanai H. Ito T.

Okumura K. Hayakawa T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas the antioxidant and antiplatelet actions of PGI2 delayed atherogenesis and may underlie the protection from cardiovascular disease afforded by female gender (12Egan K.M. Lowson J.A. Fries S. Koller B. Rader D.J. Smyth E.M. Fitzgerald G.A. Science. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Maintenance of the PGI2/TxA2 balance appears to be a critical regulator of vascular disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the counterregulation of PGI2/TxA2 signaling have not been fully elucidated.A single gene encoding a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) has been reported for both mediators (13Nusing R.M.

Usui T. Itoh H. Yoshimasa T. Narumiya S. Nakao K. Genomics. 1995; 27: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although in contrast to IP, where splice variants have not been described, two variants of TP, termed TPα and TPβ, have been identified (15Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IP is coupled to at least two signaling systems, namely the generation of intracellular cAMP and activation of PLC (16Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Both TPα and TPβ are coupled to PLC, whereas the former may activate and the latter may inhibit AC activity (16Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence for reciprocal regulation between IP and TP. TPα, but not TPβ, is a target for IP-mediated, PKA-dependent phosphorylation, resulting in TPα desensitization (17Walsh M.T. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20412-20423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similarly, U46619-mediated activation of TP enhances IP-mediated cAMP generation in human platelets (18Murray R. Shipp E. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21670-21675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where only TPα is expressed (19Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The interaction between IP and TP may not, however, be limited to events occurring secondary to activation of their respective second messenger systems. GPCRs have long been considered to exist and function as independent monomeric units. However, GPCRs from both closely related and distinct subfamilies are capable of interacting physically with one another to form heterodimers (20Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Breitwieser G.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Far from being a benign association, GPCR heterodimerization can substantially modify receptor function (20Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Breitwieser G.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Signaling may change as a result of altered agonist affinity for the receptors, altered affinity of the receptors for their respective G proteins or signaling via alternate pathways (21Breitwieser G.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of the δ- and κ-opioid receptors, for example, creates a “new” receptor binding site that has a reduced affinity for individual δ- or κ-selective ligands but that can ligate cooperatively selective agonists to induce synergistic functional responses (22Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar).Heterodimers of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor and the bradykinin B2 receptor demonstrate increased activation of AT1-coupled G proteins in response to angiotensin II, a phenomenon that may underlie preeclamptic hypertension (23AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Massiery A. Quitterer U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Thus, two opposing vascular mediators, angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, and bradykinin, a vasodilator, can alter the action of the other via a direct interaction of their receptors (23AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Massiery A. Quitterer U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether the interaction between two similarly opposing vascular mediators, PGI2 and TxA2, is also mediated via receptor interaction. We demonstrate that coexpression of IP and TPα, either endogenously or in an overexpression cell model, facilitated TP-mediated cAMP generation. The absence of the IP, in SMCs cultured from IP knockout (IPKO) mice or in HEK 293 cells, rendered the TP largely inactive with regard to AC activity. This interaction between IP and TPα is not dependent on IP-cAMP signaling, but is coincident with the formation of an IP/TPα heterodimer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay kit, enhanced chemiluminescence kits, protein G-Sepharose, and all radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture reagents, G418, and Albumax were obtained from Invitrogen. Complete protease inhibitor tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. IBOP, SQ 29548, iPE2III, and iPF2αIII were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). H89 was obtained from Calbiochem. Isobutylmethylxanthine and deoxycholic acid were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-HA and anti-Myc were obtained from Covance (Richmond, CA). NuPAGE gels and buffers were purchased from Invitrogen. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Cicaprost was obtained from Schering AG under agreement.Epitope Tagging of hIP and hTP—The 9-amino acid hemagglutinin epitope (HA; YPYDVPDYA) or 10-amino acid Myc epitope (EQKLI-SEEDL) was inserted between the N-terminal initiator methionine and the second amino acid of the hTPα or hIP to generate HAhIP, MychIP, or HAhTPα. Generation of HAhIP was as described previously (24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To generate HAhTPα and MychIP, 5′-oligonucleotides that contained 3 miscellaneous bases, 6 bases encoding a HindIII site, the 3 miscellaneous bases immediately 5′ of the initiator methionine, 3 bases encoding a methionine, the epitope tag coding sequence, and 21 bases encoding amino acids 2–8 were generated. 3′-Oligonucleotides were complementary to the receptor coding sequence downstream of a unique restriction site (an EcoN47 site for hIP or a NotI site for hTPα). Using the hTPα or hIP cDNAs as templates, polymerase chain reactions were carried out to generate the 5′-HAhTP and 5′-MychIP fragments. The resulting products were cloned into PCR 2.1 (Qiagen, CA) and, following verification of the sequence, were excised using HindIII/NotI or HindIII/ EcoN47, as appropriate. Using the same enzymes, the 3′ fragment in pcDNA 3.1 (or pcDNA3.1 Hygro for MychIP) was generated, and the two receptor pieces were ligated to each other. The integrity of the splice site was verified by sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Human aortic SMC (hAMSC, Biowhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD) were cultured in smooth muscle cell basal medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5%), human recombinant epidermal growth factor (hEGF; 0.5 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), human recombinant fibroblast growth factor (hFGF; 2 ng/ml) plus gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin-B (50 ng/ml). hASMC of passages 5–9 were used in experiments. Smooth muscle cells were isolated from WT or IPKO mouse aortic explants and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 Ham's medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. mASMC of passages 3–6 were used in experiments. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air.For stable transfections, HEK 293 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected the following day with 10 μgofDNA by liposome-mediated transfer (DOTAP), as described previously (25Smyth E.M. Li W.H. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23258-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Kallal L. Benovic J.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of G418 (0.5–1.5 mg/ml) and/or hygromycin (50–75 μg/ml).Western Blotting—Membranes or whole cell lysates were resolved (30 μg/lane) on NuPAGE (Invitrogen) 10% gels. HA-tagged or Myc-tagged receptors were visualized with anti-HA or anti-Myc (1:1000 dilution) in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.6), containing 1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), for 1 h at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution; Jackson Immunology), after first blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Membrane Preparation and Radioligand Binding—Membranes were prepared from confluent 100-mm dishes as described previously (24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding studies were carried out using membrane proteins (10 μg/reaction) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (TP binding) containing 10 mm MnCl (IP binding). Radioligand displacement experiments were initiated by the addition of [3H]iloprost (4 nm) or [3H]SQ 29548 (40 nm), whereas saturation binding experiments utilized increasing concentrations of [3H]SQ 29548 (0–200 nm). Reactions were allowed to continue for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% bovine serum albumin), followed by immediate filtration through GF/C filters that had been thoroughly soaked in the same ice-cold buffer. Following one wash with ice-cold wash buffer, radioactivity associated with the filters was quantified by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled iloprost or SQ 29548, respectively. Saturation binding data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 to calculate Kd and Bmax and to compare one- and two-site curve-fitting models (partial F-test).cAMP Measurements—Cells were grown to confluence in 12- or 6-well plates. hASMC and mASMC were pretreated overnight with 3 μm indomethacin to inhibit endogenous eicosanoid generation, followed by the addition of medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.01 m) 30 min prior to agonist treatment. Cells were treated, and reactions were terminated by aspiration. cAMP was extracted with ice-cold 65% ethanol for 30 min. Samples were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay, as described previously (24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Inositol Phosphate Production—Inositol phosphate production was assessed, as described previously (24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol. Thirty minutes prior to stimulation, cells were treated with 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. After stimulation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by aspiration. Total inositol phosphates were extracted with formic acid for 30 min at room temperature and neutralized using 5 m ammonia. Total inositol phosphates were recovered by anion exchange using Dowex 1-X8 AG anion exchange resin.Co-immunoprecipitation—All immunoprecipitation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. HEK 293 cells stably expressing hTPα or hIP or both were treated with 3 mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) for 30 min and lysed in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were precleared by a 1-h rotation with 100 μl of 10% (w/v) protein G-Sepharose to each tube. Anti-Myc- or anti-HA-protein G-Sepharose was prepared by adding 9 μg of anti-Myc ascites per lysate to 10% protein G-Sepharose followed by a 1-h rotation. MychIP or HAhTPα was immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates by adding 150 μl of anti-Myc- or anti-HA-protein G-Sepharose to each lysate and rotating for 16 h. Protein G was precipitated at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, washed three times with Buffer A, and resuspended in 10 μl of sample buffer (Nupage). Immunoblotting for HA or Myc was carried out as described above, using the appropriate biotinylated antibody (1:500) followed by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin.RESULTSGeneration of HEK 293 Cell Lines Expressing HA-hTPα or Coexpressing Both HA-hTPα and MychIP—We have described previously the generation of a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing HA-tagged hIP (hIP-HEK; see Ref. 24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell lines stably expressing HAhTPα (TPα-HEK), or coexpressing both MychIP and HAhTPα (IP/TPα-HEK), were generated in the present study in order to examine the effect of IP/TPα coexpression on TPα signaling.Lysates from each cell line were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody to establish that the receptors were being appropriately expressed. HAhTPα was observed as a broad complex of between 48 and 64 kDa in lysates derived from TPα-HEK or IP/TPα-HEK cells (Fig. 1). MychIP was observed as a 44–60-kDa complex in IP/TPα-HEK cell lysates (Fig. 1). This corresponds to the molecular weight of HAhIP previously observed in hIP-HEK cells (24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The broad molecular weight range of both hIP and hTPα is a result of receptor glycosylation (19Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or IP/TPα-HEK with the prostacyclin analogue cicaprost for 5 min induced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP (EC50 = 0.05 ± 0.02 nm, n = 4; Fig. 2) and inositol phosphate production (EC50 = 97.1 ± 33.3 nm, n = 4; Fig. 2), indicating that co-expression of hTPα did not alter hIP-mediated activation of two signaling systems when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells (24Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TPα-HEK with the specific TP-agonist U46619 resulted in increased inositol phosphate production (EC50 = 174.4 ± 65.2 nm, n = 3; Fig. 3), which was not altered significantly by co-expression of hIP (EC50 = 231.7 ± 40.8 nm, n = 3; Fig. 3). Much evidence supports ligation of the TP by isoprostanes, free radical-catalyzed products of arachidonic acid. Indeed, two TP-dependent isoprostanes (27Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), iPE2III (Fig. 3), and iPF2αIII (data not shown) stimulated inositol phosphate generation in TPα-HEK and IP/TPα-HEK, albeit with significantly higher EC50 values (3.56 ± 1.12 and 4.43 ± 0.63 μm, respectively) compared with U46619. Thus, similar to other studies, the addition of HA or Myc tags to the N terminus of IP and TP did not alter the expression or signal transduction properties of the receptor. Furthermore, co-expression of the receptors did not alter their discrete signal transduction properties.Fig. 2IP-mediated signaling in cells coexpressing MychIP and HAhTPα.

Pretreatment with the TP antagonist SQ 29548 partially reduced signaling by the TP agonists (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, iPE2III, but not iPF2αIII, also initiated an increase in cAMP in IP/TPα-HEK cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the TP agonists, the activity of iPE2III was insensitive to SQ 29548 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that this event was TP-independent. However, signaling was not observed in the absence of hTPα, demonstrating that inhibition with SQ 29548 is not sufficient to determine TP dependence (Figs. 4A and 5). Generation of cAMP in response to treatment of IP/TPα-HEK with IBOP, U46619, or iPE2III proved concentration-dependent, and only minor cAMP increments were observed at the highest concentration of TP agonist in cells expressing TPα alone (Fig. 5). These results indicate that cAMP formation in response to TP activation by TP agonists or iPE2III is dependent on the presence of both TPα and IP. We examined the biological relevance of this relationship in a cell model that endogenously expresses both IP and TP. cAMP production in response to IBOP or iPE2III was quantified in aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from humans or WT mice. Increased cAMP levels were observed in hASMC or WT mASMC following a 10-min treatment with IBOP or iPE2III (Fig. 6). SQ 29548 was partially effective against IBOP and ineffective against iPE2III (Fig. 6, E and F), in agreement with the HEK 293 cell data (Fig. 4B). IBOP or iPE2III treatment of ASMC isolated from IPKO mice resulted in minimal cAMP generation (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, the absence of the IP in ASMC cultured from IPKO mice or in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5) uncoupled the TP from activation of AC.Fig. 4Effect of coexpression of IP and TPα on TPα-induced cAMP generation. A, TPα-HEK (light gray bar), IP/TPα-HEK (open bar), or hIP-HEK cells (dark gray bar) or a mixed culture of TPα-HEK and IP-HEK cells (closed bar) were treated with a 100 nm concentration of the TP agonists U46619 and IBOP or the isoprostanes iPE2III and iPF2αIII for 10 min, and cAMP was quantified as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as the mean -fold over basal cAMP ± S.E. from 5–8 experiments each performed in duplicate.

We studied the role of Cyr61 in endometrial tumorigenesis. Levels of Cyr61 were decreased in endometrial tumors compared with normal endometrium. Knockdown of Cyr61 expression by RNA interference in a well differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line (Ishikawa) stimulated its cellular growth. Conversely, overexpression of the protein in the undifferentiated AN3CA endometrial cancer cell line decreased their growth concurrently with increased apoptosis in liquid culture. These same cells had decreased clonogenic capacity and a nearly complete loss of tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, partially purified Cyr61 suppressed growth of endometrial cancer cells. The increased apoptosis in these endometrial cancer cells with forced overexpression of Cyr61 was associated with elevated expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bad, and TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated ligand). Cyr61-induced caspase-3 activation and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. In summary, endometrial cancer cells have decreased expression of Cyr61 compared with normal endometrium, and this lowered expression may provide the transformed cells a growth advantage over their normal counterpart.

Each member of this family shares several modules that have homology to other proteins: IGFBP (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein), VWC (von Willebrand type C domain), TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1), and CT (cystine knot). The CCN family of proteins has been implicated in diverse biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumorigenesis (5Planque N. Perbal B.

It can behave as a novel ligand for integrins and, thus, is involved in the integrin signaling pathway (9Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Expression of the Cyr61 protein can be regulated by estrogen, and it is often highly expressed in human breast cancers (11Sampath D. Winneker R.C. Zhang Z.

The high levels of expression of Cyr61 are associated with a more advanced stage of breast cancer (13Xie D. Nakachi K. Wang H. Elashoff R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8917-8923PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Cyr61 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells substantially increased their ability to form large tumors when grown in nude mice (12Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K.

Paradoxically, Cyr61 functions as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancers by up-regulation of p53 and p21 and decreased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (14Tong X. Xie D. O'Kelly J.

Levels of Cyr61 are decreased in prostate cancers compared with the neighboring epithelium of the normal prostate; and Cyr61 probably plays a role in aberrant cell-cell interaction between the epithelial and stromal cells in prostate carcinoma (16Pilarsky C.P.

Using cDNA expression arrays and immunohistochemistry, Cyr61 was found to be down-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma compared with normal thyroid samples (17Wasenius V.M. Hemmer S. Kettunen E. Knuutila S. Franssila K. Joensuu H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 68-75PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of Cyr61 expression were detected in uterine smooth muscle cells, while leiomyomas expressed significantly lower protein levels (18Sampath D. Zhu Y. Winneker R.C. Zhang Z. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy. Development of these cancers arises from a series of genetic alterations that transform the normal endometrium through the stages of hyperplasia, dysplasia, and finally overt carcinoma. In this study, we found that expression levels of Cyr61 were decreased in endometrial tumors and cancer cell lines compared with the normal endometrium. Forced expression of Cyr61 in undifferentiated AN3CA endometrial cancer cells inhibited cellular growth both in liquid culture and in clonogenic assays, decreased tumor forming potential in nude mice, and promoted endometrial cancer cell apoptosis associated with elevated levels of Bax, Bad, and TRAIL. Also, addition of partially purified Cyr61 to endometrial cancer cells inhibited their growth, increased caspase-3 activity and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. On the other hand, suppression of endogenous Cyr61 mRNA in the well-differentiated Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells increased their cell numbers. In summary, decreased expression of Cyr61 in transformed endometrial cells may represent a mechanism to provide these cells with a growth advantage over their normal counterpart. RNA Analysis by Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) from a series of endometrial cancer cell lines as well as matched endometrial cancers and normal endometrium from the same patients after their informed consent. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan reagents (PE Biosystems) as described previously (12Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W. Gornbein J. Koeffler H.P. J.

For normalization, β-actin probe was used. The sequence for the β-actin probe was 5′-CTCGCTGTCCACCTTCCAGCAGAT, the β-actin-specific primers were 5′-GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC and 5′-ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC. Cell Culture and Transfection—Endometrial cancer cell lines AN3CA, HEC1A, HEC1B, KLE, and RL95–2 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Ishikawa was kindly provided by Dr. Bruce A. Lessey, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and HEC59 by Dr. Timothy J. Kinsella, Case Western Reserve University. AN3CA, Ishikawa, HEC59, HEC1A, and HEC1B were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium with 2 mm l-glutamine and Earle's BSS adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Ishikawa and KLE were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium. RL95-2 was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium with 10 mm HEPES and 2.0 g/liter sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 0.005 mg/ml insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum. MDA-MB-231, H460, COS-1, and Rat1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cyr61 cDNA was previously cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector in our laboratory (12Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W. Gornbein J. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and either 5 μg of Cyr61 expression vector or empty vector pcDNA3.1 were used in cell transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were replated in 600 μg/ml of G418 and isolated stable clones were selected for assay after 2 weeks. One G418-resistant clone selected from empty vector pcDNA3.1 transfection was designated as AN3CA-neo. Several G418-resistant stable clones after Cyr61 transfection were screened for Cyr61 expression with real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Only the two clones with the most prominent Cyr61 expression are shown and used for this study. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared from cells harvested by lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Anti-Cyr61 polyclonal rabbit antisera were prepared in this laboratory (12Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W. Gornbein J. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Antibodies to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Proliferation and Colony Formation Assay—For cell growth analysis, cells (3 × 103 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for various durations. Cell numbers were measured by MTT assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). For colony formation, equal number of transfected cells were seeded in 24-well plastic plates and cultured under G418 selection (600 μg/ml). After 2 weeks, the colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 50% methanol and photographed with an inverted phase contrast microscope. Tumorigenicity Analysis—AN3CA-neo and AN3CA-Cyr61#1 cells (1 × 107 cells) were subcutaneously injected on different sides of the same mouse. A total of 5 nude mice were used for this study. Size of the ten tumors was measured every week for 4 weeks; and euthanasia was performed at week 4. The tumors were dissected and measured. RNA Interference—Hairpin-expressing clones were made using primers designed by using the Web-based siRNA hairpin engine at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (katahdin.cshl.org:9331/RNAi/). A 17-nucleotide homology with a U6 promoter was placed at the 3′-end of the primer, a Pol III termination codon was incorporated at the 5′-end, the center encompasses the stem and loop structure. For mapping convenience, the loop includes a HindIII site. For PCR reaction, a SP6 promoter was used as the second primer and a cloned U6 promoter, pCGU6, as template. The reaction was set up using Hot Master Taq, with 0.3 mm dNTPs, 3 nm oligonucleotides, and 10 ng template in the buffer provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen). After the reaction, the resulting 600-base pair fragment with the U6 promoter and the hairpin, was cloned into pCR2.1 using a TOPO TA cloning kit and confirmed by DNA sequencing. One mutant fragment, which lacks the hairpin sequence producing a non-functional RNA interference (RNAi), was used as control RNAi. Ishikawa cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 and either Cyr61 RNAi or control RNAi, and stable clones were selected with G418 (600 μg/ml). One stable clone from the “empty” vector containing only the neo gene, was designated Ishikawa-neo. Several stable clones from Cyr61 RNAi transfection were screened for Cyr61 protein knockdown by Western blot analysis. The sequence for Cyr61 RNAi was 5′-GGCACCATCAATACACGTACACTGATGCTCAAGCTTCAACATCAGTGCACTGTATTGATGGCGC and the sequence for the control RNAi was GGCACCATCAATACACGTACACTGATGCTCAAGCTTCAGCACATGTATTGAGGCGC. Conditioned Media Preparation—Cyr61-pcDNA3.1- or pcDNA3.1-transfected cells were grown to around 80% confluency and replaced with serum-free medium for another 48 h. The conditioned medium were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was aliquot and stored at –80 °C. Heparin-agarose beads (Sigma) were prewashed, equilibrated with serum-free medium, and incubated with conditioned medium at 4 °C overnight to remove Cyr61 from the conditioned medium. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analyses—Cells were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 50% ice-cold methanol for 30 min. The distribution of the cells in G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle phases was determined by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide. Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I (BD PharMingen) was used to identify the apoptotic and viable cells following the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of early apoptotic (FITC-positive and PI-negative) cells was calculated from the data originated from flow cytometry. Reporter Assay—Cells were plated at a subconfluent density and co-transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid and the appropriate expression vectors. TOPFLASH construct contains 4 copies of TCF binding sites upstream of thymidine kinase minimal promoter in front of luciferase cDNA (Upstate Biotechnologies). Negative control FOPFLASH contains mutated TCF binding sites. 50 ng of Renilla luciferase pRL-TK were co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM were used for transfections following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection, and the reporter activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Ishikawa cells were incubated with conditioned medium for 24 or 48 h, and caspase-3 activity was measured using Caspase-Glo3/7 Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Basically, cells were lysed and incubated with proluminescent substrate containing the caspase-3 recognition site DEVD. The resulting cleavage of the substrate by caspase-3 generates luminescent signal, which then is detected by a luminometer. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by using JC-1 (Molecular Probes) fluorescent dye. JC-1 aggregates in mitochondrial and emits at a wavelength of 590 nm; upon depolarization of the membrane, JC-1 forms monomer and emits at 530 nm. The normalized JC-1 is the ratio between the fluorescence at 590 nm and 530 nm and normalized to a starting value of 1. Cyr61 Expression Was Down-regulated in Endometrial Tumors Compared with Matched Normal Tissues—The expression of CCN genes (Cyr61, CTGF, NOV, WISP1, WISP2, and WISP3) in endometrial tissues was assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. In a collection of randomly selected 8 pairs of matched samples from patients, statistically significant differences were found in the expression of Cyr61, NOV, and WISP2 (Fig. 1A, p ≤ 0.05). Elevated levels of NOV and WISP2 were expressed in endometrial tumors, whereas Cyr61 expression was down-regulated. The expression of Cyr61 was quantified further in endometrial cancer cell lines and paired tissue samples. Human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 was used as a positive control, which we previously have shown, had high levels of Cyr61 expression (12Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W. Gornbein J. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In 7 of the 8 paired tissue samples, the expression of Cyr61 was higher in the normal endometrial tissue compared with the matched tumors (Fig. 1B, p = 0.012, Student's t test, one-tail, two-sample assuming unequal variances). In a series of endometrial cancer cell lines, the level of Cyr61 varied (Fig. 1B). The lowest Cyr61 expression was found in AN3CA cells, an undifferentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1B). Compared with the AN3CA cells, a well-differentiated endometrial cell line Ishikawa showed higher expression of Cyr61 (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of Cyr61 in AN3CA Endometrial Cancer Cells Suppressed Colony Formation, Cell Growth in Liquid Culture, and Tumor Growth in Nude Mice—Since Cyr61 transcripts were expressed at a higher level in the normal endometrium compared with matched tumors, we hypothesized that Cyr61 may be important in the regulation of cell growth of normal endometrium. AN3CA cells, which endogenously expressed low levels of Cyr61, were transiently transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3.1) and formed numerous colonies, while the number of colonies were dramatically reduced when these cells were transiently transfected with Cyr61-pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, AN3CA cells were stably transfected with either a Cyr61 expression vector (Cyr61-pcDNA3.1) or an empty vector pcDNA3.1. Several G418-resistant clones were isolated from Cyr61-pcDNA3.1 transfection and screened for Cyr61 expression levels by both real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The protein levels of two stable clones overexpresssing Cyr61 (AN3CA-Cyr61#1 and #2) are shown in Fig. 2B; and these two clones were used for further study. The effect of Cyr61 expression on cell growth in vitro was evaluated by MTT assay. Compared with AN3CA-neo control cells, the 2 stable clones (AN3CA-Cyr61#1 and #2) showed significant reduction in cell numbers (p = 0.011, Fig. 2C). Next, the effect of Cyr61 on tumor formation in vivo was examined. Cyr61-overexpressing cells (AN3CA-Cyr61#1) and vector control cells (AN3CA-neo) were injected on opposite flanks of nude mice, and tumor growth was monitored weekly. After 4 weeks, the tumors were removed and measured. In all five mice injected with tumor cells, the Cyr61-overexpressing cells (AN3CA-Cyr61#1) developed markedly smaller tumors than the control endometrial cancer cells (AN3CA-neo) in the nude mice (p = 0.0088, one-tail Student's t test, Fig. 2D). Cell Growth Was Increased after Cyr61 Gene Silencing in Ishikawa Cells—To determine if endogenous Cyr61 plays a role in cell growth, we used a U6 promoter-driven RNAi method to silence the Cyr61 gene in the Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, which constitutively express easily detectable amounts of endogenous Cyr61. These cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 and either a Cyr61-specific RNAi or a control RNAi expression vector. Stable clones were selected with G418 and were screened for Cyr61 protein knockdown. Western blotting showed that a dramatic decrease in Cyr61 protein expression occurred in 2 clones from Cyr61-specific RNAi (Ishikawa-i1 and -i2) compared with those transfected with vector only (Ishikawa-neo) or 2 control RNAi clones (Ishikawa-Δ1 and -Δ2) (Fig. 3A). MTT assays were used to evaluate the effect of Cyr61 knockdown on cell growth. The two Cyr61-knockdown sublines (Ishikawa-i1 and -i2) exhibited an increased cell number compared with the control cell lines (Ishikawa-neo, -Δ1, and -Δ2) (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of Endometrial Cancer Cell Growth by Cyr61-conditioned Medium—To elucidate directly the effect of Cyr61 on endometrial cancer cell growth, we used the conditioned medium collected from AN3CA-Cyr61#1-transfected cells in the MTT assay. The presence of Cyr61 in the conditioned medium was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The conditioned medium collected from the Cyr61pcDNA3.1-transfected cells had inhibitory effects on the growth of Ishikawa cells after 2 days of incubation, compared with that from pcDNA3.1 empty vector (V)-transfected cells (Fig. 4C). Cyr61 binds heparin and heparin affinity chromatography has been used in Cyr61 purification (19Muramatsu Y. Tsujie M. Kohda Y. Pham B. Perantoni A.O. Zhao H. Jo S.K. Yuen P.S. Craig L. Hu X. Star R.A. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1601-1610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We used heparin agarose beads to deplete Cyr61 from the conditioned medium (Fig. 4B), which resulted in the loss of the growth inhibitory activity (Fig. 4C). Cyr61 Inhibits Growth of Endometrial Cancer Cells at Least in Part by Promoting Apoptosis—To explore the mechanism of growth suppression in Cyr61-overexpressing cells (AN3CA-Cyr61#1 and #2), cell cycle analysis was performed. The number of cells in S-phase was 45 and 42% for the AN3CA-neo and AN3CA-Cyr61#1 cells, respectively. In contrast, expression of Cyr61 caused a remarkable increase (from 7 to 28%) in the subdiploid DNA (sub-G0/G1) content in AN3CA-Cyr61#1 suggesting an increased cell death (Fig. 5A). Apoptosis was also assessed by annexin V-FITC staining to detect phosphatidyl-serine on the cell surface in conjunction with propidium iodide staining. As shown in Fig. 5B, Cyr61-expressing cells (AN3CA-Cyr61#1) showed an increase in annexin V-positive and PI-negative cells (26%) when compared with AN3CA-neo control cells (6%) indicating increased cell death via apoptosis. These results indicated the anti-growth activity of Cyr61 was associated at least in part with induction of cellular apoptosis. Given that the relative expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins is important in the regulation of apoptosis (20Lea R.G. Riley S.C. Antipatis C. Hannah L. Ashworth C.J. Clark D.A. Critchley H.O. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 42: 100-109PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of several pro- and anti-apoptopic proteins were examined. Compared with control AN3CA-neo cells, a slight decrease in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was observed, and no significant change in either Bcl-xL or the inactive phosphorylated Bad, was found in the Cyr61-overexpressing cells (AN3CA-Cyr61#1 and #2, Fig. 5C). In contrast, the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad were prominently increased in the AN3CA-Cyr61#1 and #2 cells (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the expression of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was significantly increased in the AN3CA-Cyr61 cells compared with AN3CA-neo control cells as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5D). Since we observed increased levels of Bax in endometrial cancer cells overexpressing Cyr61, we next examined the downstream targets of the Bax-mediated apoptosis pathway. We first measured the caspase-3 activity in endometrial cancer cells treated with Cyr61-conditioned medium. A substantial increase of caspase-3 activity occurred in the Ishikawa cells treated with Cyr61-conditioned medium compared with control (V) medium-treated cells (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we examined the mitochondrial potential in these cells. We found that Cyr61-conditioned medium treated cells exhibited a time-dependent decrease in their mitochondrial potential, while control (V)-conditioned medium-treated cells had a minimal drop in potential (Fig. 6B). During apoptosis, c-myc has been reported to enhance activation of Bax (21Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We examined expression of c-myc in our stably transfected endometrial cancer cells. Levels were increased in Cyr61-overexpressing cells, AN3CA-Cyr61#1; conversely, expression was decreased in the Cyr61-knockdown, Ishikawa-i1 cells (Fig. 7A). c-myc is a known target gene of LEF/TCF transactivation. Therefore, we investigated the ability of Cyr61 to enhance TCF-dependent transcriptional activity as measured by reporter assays. TOPFLASH was co-transfected with either Cyr61-pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 empty vector in AN3CA cells. Stimulation of TCF reporter activity was found only in AN3CA cells co-transfected with the Cyr61 expression vector (Fig. 7B). No activity was observed in the negative control FOPFLASH reporter transfected with the same Cyr61 expression vector. Cyr61 is involved in a wide range of biological activities including angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (5Planque N. Perbal B.

Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of Cyr61 are associated with a more advanced stage of breast cancer, and its overexpression in normal human breast cells promotes their cell proliferation and tumor formation in immunodeficient mice (13Xie D.

Cells from glioblastoma multiforme expressed higher levels of Cyr61; and these brain tumors with high levels of Cyr61 had a worse prognosis than those with lower levels of Cyr61 (24Xie D. Yin D.

Paradoxically, Cyr61 acts as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancers and is associated with enhanced expression of p53 and p21 and decreased levels of cdk2 kinase activity (14Tong X. Xie D.

UVA is the major portion of UV radiation in sunlight and is considered to be a human carcinogen. In this study, we have investigated the delayed and sustained activation of ERK MAPK by UVA exposure. In parallel, a delayed Ras activation with a similar time course was observed after UVA exposure. The activated Ras was found to be localized in endomembranes such as the Golgi apparatus instead of plasma membranes. Expression of dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) abolished ERK activation by UVA. The presence of AG1478, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor, had no effect on ERK or Ras activation, indicating that EGFR kinase activity is not involved in ERK activation by UVA. In contrast, protein kinase C (PKC) depletion by chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment nearly abolished UVA-induced ERK and Ras activation. The presence of the Ca2+-dependent-PKC inhibitor Gö6976 had a similar effect. These findings suggest that ERK activation by UVA is mediated by PKC in a Ras-dependent pathway. In addition, a gradual increase in intracellular calcium level after UVA exposure was detected by flow cytometry. The presence of the PLC inhibitor U73122 or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) blocked both ERK and Ras activation, suggesting that both PLC and calcium are required for ERK activation. Our findings demonstrated that, different from UVC and UVB, UVA-induced delayed and sustained ERK activation is EGFR kinase activity-independent, but PLC/calcium/PKC-mediated. The delayed and sustained ERK activation provides a survival signal to human HaCaT keratinocytes, which may serve as an important mechanism for cell transformation and potential skin carcinogenesis in vivo caused by UVA exposure.

(315–400 nm) is the major component (about 95%) of the ultraviolet (UV) part of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface. Recently UVA has been listed as a reasonably anticipated human carcinogen. Cells damaged by UVA normally undergo apoptosis; failed apoptosis plays an important role in tumor development. Indeed, cell survival can be promoted by active suppression of apoptosis via survival signals, thus allowing potential malignant transformation. The molecular mechanisms of cell survival after UVA exposure due to escape from apoptosis are not fully understood. An important suppressive regulator of apoptosis is extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), one member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (MAPK). In many cells, activation of the ERK1/2 pathway suppresses apoptosis induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli (1Holmstrom T.H. Schmitz I. Soderstrom T.S. Poukkula M. Johnson V.L. Chow S.C.

Sustained activation of the ERK pathway has been shown to protect cells from photodynamic therapy-induced phototoxicity (6Tong Z. Singh G. Rainbow A.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5528-5535PubMed Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade that plays a critical role in gene expression, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis through the activation of intracellular substrates, including transcription factors such as Elk-1 (7Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal proteins (8Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Its role in apoptosis has made ERK1/2 a priority for research related to many human diseases such as cancer. In many human tumors, oncogenic Ras resulting from a mutation in Ras persistently activates the ERK1 and ERK2 pathways, which contributes to the increased proliferative rate of tumor cells (8Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar) and resistance to therapeutic treatment. For this reason, inhibitors of the ERK pathways are entering clinical trials as potential anticancer agents. ERK1/2 is activated by multiple extracellular stimuli, including growth factors and phorbol esters. The mechanisms of activation by various stimuli may differ, in part to control the strength and duration of the ERK response. The best characterized is the growth factor receptor pathway (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine on the C-terminal tail of the EGF receptor, resulting in a phosphotyrosine-dependent association of Shc and/or Grb2 with the receptor. Membrane translocation of the Grb2-SOS complex stimulates Ras-GDP to -GTP exchange, in turn stimulating the Ras, MEK, and the ERK series. Another class of ERK activators is the protein kinase C (PKC) family of protein Ser/Thr kinase stimulated by the phorbol ester tumor promoter TPA. PKC stimulation activates ERK through several pathways, including Ras-dependent and -independent mechanisms, that are not well understood (10Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In the present report we have demonstrated that UVA induces ERK activation in a delayed and sustained pattern. We found that ERK activation by UVA was mediated by PKC in a Ras-dependent pathway that required phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium but not the EGF receptor kinase activity. The delayed and sustained ERK activation provides a survival signal allowing human HaCaT keratinocytes to escape from apoptosis. Plasmids—Raf1-RBD-GFP was generated by PCR amplification of the human Raf1 RBD domain (amino acids 51–131) using primers flanking with HindIII and KpnI cleavage sites at each end (primers 5′-AAGCTTCCCTTCTAAGACAAGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GGTACCGCAGGAAATCTACTTGAAG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into PCR2.1 (Invitrogen). After digestion with HindIII and KpnI, the cDNA fragment was subcloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). Dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) was a kind gift from Dr. John O'Bryan (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). EGFR-KI (EGFR-kinase inactive) was generously provided by Dr. Sally Parsons (University of Virginia). Cell Culture and Transfection—HaCaT (obtained from Prof. N. Fusenig, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) and A431 and COS-7 (ATCC) cells were maintained in a monolayer culture in 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 31 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells to be examined by Western blotting were seeded at 4–8 × 105 cells per plate (60 mm) and transfected the next day. Transfections were performed with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). UVA Treatment—The medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with sterile PBS (calcium/magnesium-free). UVA exposure was performed with fluorescent lamps (Houvalite F20T12BL-HO PUVA, National Biological Corp., Twinsburg, OH) with the dish lid on. In selected experiments, cells were preincubated with inhibitors at 37 °C prior to irradiation. Inhibitors used were as follows: AG1478, Gö6976, and U73122 from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); PD98059 from Promega (Madison, WI); and BAPTA-AM from Molecular Probe. Cell Fractionation—Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted using a TransFactor Extraction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed and disrupted followed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was taken as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was further disrupted followed by centrifugation at 20,000 at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was taken as the nuclear fraction. For membrane proteins, the cell pellet was disrupted by sonication in homogenation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and Phosphatase mixture (Sigma) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and sonicated in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation, the supernatant was taken as the membrane fraction. Western Blotting—After treatments, cells were harvested and lysed with M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Calbiochem) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBST (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) followed by incubation with primary antibody and secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Determination of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Briefly, HaCaT cells were irradiated and fixed followed by staining with propidium iodide. The DNA content was determined by flow cytometry and the sub-G1 portion was considered to be the apoptotic cell population. Determination of Activation of ERK and Caspase by Flow Cytometry—Briefly, HaCaT cells were irradiated and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. After permeabilization with 90% methanol, cells were double stained with anti-phospho-ERK Alexa Fluor 488 (Cell Signaling) and anti-active caspase-3-PE (BD Biosciences) antibodies. The activations of ERK and caspase-3 in cells were determined by flow cytometry. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes containing a glass coverslip-covered 15-mm cutout (MatTek, Ashland, MA) for live cell microscopy measurement. The next day cells were transfected with Raf1-RBD using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). 3 h after exposure to UVA, localization of green fluorescence in cells were monitored using a Zeiss 510Meta confocal microscope. For the costaining with Golgi marker, Golgin 97, cells were fixed and permeabilized followed by staining with Golgin 97 and then Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse antibody. Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear counterstaining. ERK Activity Assay—ERK (p44/p42) activity was determined by using a p44/p42 MAP Kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, control or treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of total protein was incubated with immobilized phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the pellet was resuspended and incubated with Elk-1 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were used for Western blotting as described above, and anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody was used to detect the activity of ERK. Ras Activity Assay—Ras activity was determined by using a Ras Activation Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed, and cell lysate was incubated with Raf-1 RBD-agarose for 45 min at 4 °C. After washing, the agarose pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting followed by probing with anti-Ras antibody. Determination of Intracellular Calcium Level by Flow Cytometry— The intracellular calcium level was determined using Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining followed by flow cytometry (11Princen K. Hatse S. Vermeire K. De Clercq E. Schols D. Cytometry. 2003; 51A: 35-45Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were irradiated with UVA and then loaded with Fluo-4 (3 μm) at different times after exposure for 30 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing, cells were trypsinized and washed with cold PBS (calcium/magnesium-free) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then resuspended, and the changes in green fluorescence were detected by flow cytometry (FACSort, BD Biosciences) as an indicator of calcium mobilization. UVA-induced Delayed and Sustained ERK1/2 Activation—To determine the UVA effect on ERK1/2 activation, HaCaT cells were irradiated with 24 J/cm2 UVA and then incubated for varying times after exposure. Western blotting showed that there was no phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in either control cells or irradiated cells within 1 h after UVA exposure. In contrast, a marked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed 3 h after exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was maintained at a slightly increased level up to 15 h after UVA exposure and still observed at 24 and 48 h after UVA irradiation (data not shown). When cells were irradiated with different doses of UVA (4–32 J/cm2), a weak phosphorylation of ERK was seen at 12 J/cm2 and increased phosphorylation detected up to 32 J/cm2 at 6 h after UVA exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). These data demonstrate that ERK is phosphorylated by UVA exposure in a time- and dose-dependent pattern. Clearly phosphorylation of ERK by UVA is delayed and sustained after exposure. To determine whether the phosphorylation of ERK can be translated into the activation of ERK, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK antibody for assays of the activity of the ERK immunocomplex with Elk-1 as a substrate. In control cells, there was no ERK activity detected in the form of Elk-1 phosphorylation, whereas UVA (24 J/cm2) irradiation induced dramatic ERK kinase activity 3 h after exposure. This demonstrates that ERK is activated by UVA (Fig. 1, C and D). Similar delayed and sustained phosphorylation of ERK after UVA exposure was detected in human A431 keratinocytes as well as monkey COS-7 kidney cells (Fig. 1E). In A431 cells, ERK phosphorylation increased at 1 h in a sustained manner up to 6 h after UVA exposure. In COS-7 cells, an increase in ERK phosphorylation was detected at 3 h in a sustained manner up to 6 h after UVA exposure. These data indicate that the delayed and sustained ERK activation by UVA is not cell type-specific. Previous studies have reported that UVC induced rapid but transient activation of ERK (12Kitagawa D. Tanemura S. Ohata S. Shimizu N. Seo J. Nishitai G. Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) in A431 cells. To determine whether the distinct pattern of ERK activation by UVA from UVC is due to the different types of UV, we irradiated both HaCaT cells and A431 cells with UVC, the shorter wavelength portion of UV radiation, and also with UVB, the region that falls between UVA and UVC (Fig. 1F). Upon UVC exposure, activation of ERK was detected at 15 min after exposure, whereas it decreased at 1 h and later, suggesting that UVC induced a rapid but transient activation of ERK, consistent with the previous report (12Kitagawa D. Tanemura S. Ohata S. Shimizu N. Seo J. Nishitai G. Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Kishimoto H. Wada T. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In comparison, UVB induced activation of ERK at 15 min after exposure, and the activation was sustained up to 6 h. These results demonstrate that the distinct pattern of ERK activation is caused by different types of UV exposure. ERK Activation by UVA Provided an Anti-apoptotic Signal—We have shown that UVA induces apoptosis and caspase activation in human keratinocytes (13He Y.Y. Huang J.L. Ramirez D.C. Chignell C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8058-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine UVA-induced apoptosis at time points parallel to the ERK activation, we performed the same experiments as shown in Fig. 1 (A and B) except that activation of caspase-3 was determined by immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 2A, activation of caspase-3 followed a pattern similar to ERK activation, i.e. in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The activation of caspase-3 was detected at 3 h after UVA (24 J/cm2) exposure, and was maintained at a slightly increased level for up to 15 h. A slight activation of caspase-3 was observed after 12 J/cm2, and increased activation was seen with a higher dose but not in a linear pattern. These findings imply that activation of ERK is concurrent with caspase-3 activation, a marker for the apoptotic process. To quantify the apoptotic cells, we irradiated cells with UVA (0, 12, and 24 J/cm2) and the sub-G1 cell population was determined by flow cytometry. Control cells showed little apoptosis. UVA (12/cm2) induced 12% apoptotic cell death, whereas 24 J/cm2 UVA caused about 40% apoptosis (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the concurrent activation of ERK and caspase-3 observed in Figs. 1A and 2A is in the same or different cell populations, we double stained the cells with phospho-ERK-Alexa Fluor488 and active caspase-3-PE antibodies. UVA induced activation of both ERK and caspase-3 at 6 h after UVA (Fig. 2C, upper two panels). When the level of ERK activation in caspase-3-inactive cells was compared with that in caspase-3-active cells, higher activation of ERK (3.1-fold of the control) was observed in cells without caspase-3 activation after UVA exposure, as compared with cells with caspase-3 activation (1.2-fold of the control) (Fig. 2C, lower two panels). In addition, we also extracted protein from attached (surviving) and floating (apoptotic) cells 24 h after UVA exposure (Fig. 2D). In attached cells, no activation of caspase-3 was observed, whereas in floating cells the majority of caspase-3 was activated. UVA-induced activation of ERK was detected in surviving cells, whereas no ERK phosphorylation was observed in floating apoptotic cells, which confirmed the observation from flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). To reveal the role of ERK activation by UVA in apoptosis of human keratinocytes, the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (10 and 20 μm) was used to prevent ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 2D, inhibition of ERK activation enhanced apoptosis induced by UVA (12 J/cm2). This indicates that ERK activation serves as a survival signal to prevent apoptosis from proceeding after UVA exposure. Ras Is Activated upon UVA Radiation—Ras is known to be upstream of ERK activation in the pathway following EGF binding to the EGFR (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras is activated in human keratinocytes after UVA radiation, we determined Ras activity at different times after UVA radiation. After UVA exposure, there was no immediate Ras activation (Fig. 3A) either at 15 min or 1 h. However, at 3 and 6 h after UVA radiation, a dramatic increase in Ras activity was detected, indicating a delayed and sustained Ras activation similar to the ERK activation (Fig. 1). In addition, the activation of Ras was dependent on UVA doses. 12 J/cm2 induced a slight increase in Ras activity, whereas 24 and 32 J/cm2 resulted in much higher Ras activation (Fig. 3B). Recent studies have used green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused to the Ras-binding domain of Raf1 (GFP-RBD) as a spatial probe to show that Ras is activated on and transmits signals from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus as well as the plasma membrane (14Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We used GFP-RBD to determine whether Ras is activated in the ER/Golgi and/or the plasma membrane after UVA exposure. In control HaCaT cells, GFP-RBD was homogenously localized in the cytosol and nucleoplasm, without accumulating on any membrane structure (Fig. 3C). This pattern is similar to that of GFP expression. When HaCaT cells were irradiated with UVA, we observed a dramatic recruitment of GFP-RBD to a juxtanuclear structure 3 h after UVA exposure (Fig. 3C). Juxtanuclear GFP-RBD was colocalized with Golgi marker Golgin 97 (Fig. 3D), indicating that the perinuclear structure to which GFP-RBD is recruited is the Golgi. No increased recruitment of GFP-RBD to the Golgi was observed either 15 min or 1 h after UVA exposure (data not shown), which is consistent with the results of Ras activity determined by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, little GFP-RBD recruitment to the plasma membrane was observed. Thus, Ras is activated in response to UVA radiation mainly in the endomembranes such as the Golgi region. To determine whether the delayed ERK activation is mediated by the Ras pathway, we transfected COS-7 cells with dominant negative Ras (N17Ras). UVA exposure induced increased activation of ERK at 6 h. However, expression of N17Ras completely abolished the increase in ERK activation induced by UVA exposure (Fig. 3E). These data indicate that ERK activation by UVA is Ras-dependent. Activation of ERK Is Localized in Both the Nuclear and Membrane Fractions—To determine the location of activated ERK, HaCaT cells were irradiated with UVA. At 3 h after exposure, cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane fractions were separated and ERK phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting. No cytosolic activation of ERK was observed, whereas dramatic ERK activation was detected in nuclear and membrane fractions (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the membrane fraction includes the plasma membrane and endomembranes, including the ER and Golgi membrane fractions. EGF Receptor Kinase Activity Is Not Required for UVA-induced ERK Activation—The EGF receptor (EGFR) is the best-characterized pathway that can lead to ERK activation upon EGF binding. To determine whether EGFR is required for ERK activation upon UVA exposure, cells were pretreated with AG1478, a specific EGFR kinase inhibitor, and then irradiated with UVA. Without the inhibitor, an increase in EGFR phosphorylation was observed 3 h after UVA irradiation, whereas the presence of AG1478 abolished EGFR phosphorylation even at the basal level (Fig. 5A). Without AG1478, ERK was activated at 3 h after exposure; however, the presence of AG1478 failed to diminish ERK activation. In comparison, AG1478 abolished ERK activation upon EGF treatment (Fig. 5A). Expression of kinase-inactive EGFR (EGFR-KI) had no effect on UVA-induced ERK activation (Fig. 5B), consistent with the effect of AG1478. Similarly, UVA-induced Ras activation was not affected by the presence of AG1478 (Fig. 5C). In comparison, the presence of AG1478 abolished ERK activation upon UVB or UVC exposure (Fig. 5D), indicating that UVB/UVC-induced ERK activation is EGFR-dependent. These data suggest that, different from UVC and UVB, UVA-induced ERK activation does not require EGFR kinase activity. PKC Is Required for UVA-induced ERK Activation—Protein kinase C (PKC) is a well known serine/threonine kinase, consisting of three groups, conventional (α, β, β2, and γ, which respond to both TPA and Ca2+ signals), novel (δ, ϵ, η, and θ, which respond to TPA but not Ca2+ signals), and atypical PKC (ξ and ι/λ, which respond to neither TPA nor Ca2+ signals) (16Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). PKC is known to be an ERK1/2 activator upon TPA stimulation. HaCaT cells contain PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCι/λ (data not shown). To determine whether UVA induced-ERK activation is mediated by PKC, we depleted PKC by chronic exposure of HaCaT cells to TPA (600 nm) for 18 h. As shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), UVA radiation of untreated cells induced dramatic activation of ERK. However, when PKC was depleted, UVA-induced ERK activation was nearly abolished. A similar pattern was observed with ERK activity determined by Elk phosphorylation and with Ras activation. When we determined the levels of PKC isoforms with or without TPA chronic treatment in HaCaT cells by Western blotting, PKCα and PKCδ were completely depleted and PKCϵ was only partially depleted, whereas PKCι and PKCλ were not affected by TPA chronic treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). This implies that PKCα, PKCδ, and/or PKCϵ, the TPA-responsive isoforms, mediate ERK activation after UVA radiation. To further identify whether one or more of these three PKC isoforms is involved in the observed ERK activation, HaCaT cells were treated with Gö6976, a selective inhibitor for Ca2+-dependent PKC (i.e. conventional PKC), after UVA exposure. The presence of Gö6976 nearly abolished ERK phosphorylation induced by UVA (Fig. 6, E and F). These findings demonstrate that PKCα, responsive to both TPA depletion and Ca2+ signals, is required for UVA-induced ERK activation in HaCaT keratinocytes. PLC and Calcium Are Required in UVA-induced ERK Activation—Phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme in regulating the activation of PKC by generating diacylglycerol and inducing calcium mobilization from intracellular stores (17Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 18Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F.

Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar), thereby regulating the activation of ERK. When cells were pretreated with the specific PLC inhibitor U73122 (5 and 10 μm), the activation of ERK after UVA radiation was nearly abolished (Fig. 7, A and B). An enhanced activation of caspase-3 was observed in the presence of U73122. These data indicate that PLC is required for UVA-induced ERK activation and that blocking ERK activation sensitized cells to UVA-induced apoptosis. When cells were irradiated with UVA, the calcium level was elevated ∼3-fold as compared with a control sample at 3 h after exposure, as determined by flow cytometry following fluo-4 staining (Fig. 7C). The mobilization of calcium is a sustained process rather than a transient one. A gradual increase in intracellular calcium level was observed starting at 30 min up to 3 h after UVA exposure, whereas no significant change in calcium was seen in the dark (Fig. 7D), suggesting that UVA radiation caused a gradual calcium mobilization after UVA exposure. When cells were pretre"
https://openalex.org/W2083241637,"Expression of the intracellular tyrosine kinase BRK/Sik is epithelial-specific and regulated during differentiation. Only a few substrates have been identified for BRK/Sik, including the KH domain containing RNA-binding protein Sam68 and the novel adaptor protein BKS. Although the physiological role of Sam68 is unknown, it has been shown to regulate mRNA transport, pre-mRNA splicing, and polyadenylation. Here we demonstrate that the Sam68-like mammalian proteins SLM-1 and SLM-2 but not the related KH domain containing heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K are novel substrates of BRK/Sik. The expression of active BRK/Sik results in increased SLM-1 and SLM-2 phosphorylation and increased retention of BRK/Sik within the nucleus. The phosphorylation of SLM-1 and SLM-2 has functional relevance and leads to inhibition of their RNA-binding abilities. We show that SLM-1, SLM-2, and BRK/Sik have restricted patterns of expression unlike the ubiquitously expressed Sam68. Moreover, BRK/Sik, SLM-1, and Sam68 transcripts were coexpressed in the mouse gastrointestinal tract and skin, suggesting that SLM-1 and Sam68 could be physiologically relevant BRK/Sik targets in vivo. The ability of BRK/Sik to negatively regulate the RNA-binding activities of the KH domain RNA binding proteins SLM-1 and Sam68 may have an impact on the posttranscriptional regulation of epithelial cell gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2086296564,"Mounting evidence indicates that cigarette smoking not only promotes tumorigenesis but also may increase the spread of cancer cells in the body. However, the intracellular mechanism(s) by which cigarette smoking promotes metastasis of human lung cancer remains enigmatic. Nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is an important component in cigarette smoke and is formed by nitrosation of nicotine. μ- and m-calpain (calpain I and calpain II) are major members of the calpain family, which are ubiquitously expressed in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Our findings indicated that NNK potently induces phosphorylation of both μ- and m-calpain in association with their activation and increased migration as well as invasion of lung cancer cells. Treatment of cells with PD98059 blocked phosphorylation of m- and μ-calpain and resulted in suppression of NNK-induced cell migration and invasion. p44 MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and p42 MAPK/ERK2 were activated by NNK, co-localized with μ- and m-calpain in cytoplasm, and directly phosphorylated μ- and m-calpain in vitro. These findings suggest a role for the ERK1/2 kinases as NNK-activated physiological calpain kinases. Specific knock-down of μ- and/or m-calpain expression by RNA interference blocked NNK-stimulated migration and invasion, suggesting that μ- and m-calpain may act as required targets in a NNK-induced metastatic signaling pathway. Furthermore, NNK promotes secretion of active μ- and m-calpain from lung cancer cells through vesicles, which may have the potential to cleave substrates in the extracellular matrix. Thus, NNK-induced cell migration and invasion may occur, at least in part, through a novel mechanism involving phosphorylation of calpains that leads to their activation and secretion, which may contribute to metastasis and/or progression of lung cancer.

Lung carcinoma metastasizes with a great frequency and often at an early stage, whereas primary growth is still small and asymptomatic (1Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, there have been no studies to determine whether cigarette smoke constituents, for example, NNK, can directly enhance migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells by influencing signal transduction mechanisms. Migration and invasion of cells appear to be a result of a complex interplay between the numerous protein families participating in this process (3Heino J. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Kahari V.M. Cell Invasion. Medical Intelligence Unit 33. Landes Bioscience, Eurekah, Austin, TX2002: 1-117Google Scholar). Mechanisms of cell movement are important not only in the basic cellular and developmental process but also in the pathogenesis of various diseases (3Heino J. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Kahari V.M. Cell Invasion. Medical Intelligence Unit 33. Landes Bioscience, Eurekah, Austin, TX2002: 1-117Google Scholar). Tumor invasion is a complex process that involves cellular migration and interaction with the microenvironment at an ectopic site (4Mamoune A. Luo J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4632-4640PubMed Google Scholar). Cell migration is a rate-limiting step in this process (5Wells A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 31-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extravasating and metastatic cells have been observed to display active motility during these actions (6Wyckoff J.B. Jones J.G. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2504-2511PubMed Google Scholar, 7Condeelis J.S. Wyckoff J. Segall J.E. Eur. J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2528-2532PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer cells initiate invasion by adhering along the blood vessel wall. Proteolytic enzymes, such as metalloproteases or cysteine proteases (i.e. calpains), dissolve tiny holes in the sheath-like covering (basement membrane) surrounding the blood vessels to allow cancer cells to invade (9Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson G.R. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar, 10Repesh L.A. Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar). Once the tumor cells enter the stroma, they can easily gain access to lymphatic and blood vessels for further dissemination (11Gomez D.E. Skilton G. Alonso D.F. Kazanietz M. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 1363-1370PubMed Google Scholar). Calpains are a family of 13 known intracellular cysteine proteases that share a similar catalytic structure (12Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The major caplain species are μ-calpain (calpain I) and m-calpain (calpain II), which are ubiquitously and constitutively expressed in mammalian cells. A distinguishing feature of calpain activity is its ability to confer limited cleavage of protein substrates into stable fragments rather than complete proteolytic digestion (13Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, calpain-mediated proteolysis represents a major pathway of post-translational modification that influences various aspects of cell physiology including apoptosis, cell migration, and proliferation (13Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Calpain-regulated rear detachment enabling forward locomotion is required for cell migration (13Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The rear detachment step appears to be regulated by convergent signaling from growth factors and integrin (15Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 46-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Integrin-linked focal adhesion complexes provide the main adhesive links between the cellular actin cytoskeleton and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Several studies indicate that calpains localize to integrin-associated complexes. Furthermore, many of the protein components of focal adhesions are known substrates of calpains. Calpain cleavage of focal adhesion components, focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, talin, and possibly others promotes the disassembly of these complexes, contributing to reduced cell adhesion and increased motility (16Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 7: 619-630Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Carragher N.O. Fincham V.J. Riley D. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4270-4275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Calpain inhibitor studies indicate that calpain activity is required specifically to release integrin contacts at the rear of cell to permit organized cell migration (18Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced MAPK/ERK signaling activates calpains which contribute to detachment and increased motility (19Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Glading A. Uberall. F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because NNK can potently activate ERK1/2 in human lung cancer cells (2Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), NNK may mimic growth factors (i.e. EGF) to enhance calpain activity through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway leading to increased cell migration and/or invasion. Several studies point to the importance of calpain activity during tumor development and invasion (13Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It seems that calpain activity in cells is regulated by altering the Ca2+ concentration required for its proteolytic activity (21Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). μ- and m-calpain are named for their relative requirement for calcium, with μ-calpain requiring micromolar and m-calpain requiring near millimolar concentrations of calcium (21Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 22Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the Ca2+ concentrations required for proteolytic and other activities of the calpains are much higher than the 50–300 nm Ca2+ concentrations that exist in living cells (21Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Thus, other mechanism(s) must be involved in activating calpains. Recent studies show that ERK directly phosphorylates and activates m-calpain both in vitro and in vivo, and phosphorylation of m-calpain at serine 50 is required for EGF-induced calpain activation (20Glading A. Uberall. F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation, in addition to Ca2+ binding, may be another important mechanism for activation of calpains. Because ERK1 and ERK2 function as physiologic calpain kinases (22Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and NNK potently activates these two protein kinases in human lung cancer cells (2Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Schuller H.M. Plummer H.K. II I Jull B.A. Anat. Rec. 2003; 270: 51-58Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), NNK may promote lung cancer cell migration and invasion in a mechanism involving phosphorylation of calpains. Here we tested this hypothesis. Materials—Anti-μ-calpain, m-calpain, ERK1, ERK2, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). NNK was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). PD98059, α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX), and calpeptin were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Synthetic calpain substrate t-butoxy carbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethylaminocoumarin (t-Boc-LM-CMAC) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The QCM™ chemotaxis 96-well cell migration assay kit and cell invasion assay kit were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). The μ-calpain ELISA kit was purchased from Oncogene (San Diego, CA). NCI-H69 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). m-Calpain antibody for the ELISA was purchased from ARB Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). All reagents used were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western blot Analysis—NCI-H69 cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 120 min. After treatment with agonist or inhibitor, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in detergent buffer. μ- or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated using μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C for the time indicated. Phosphorylation of μ- or m-calpain was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis with μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively, and developed by using an ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (24Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Analysis of μ- or m-Calpain Phosphorylation in Vitro—μ- or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated from lysates of NCI-H69 cells using μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. The immunoprecipitated μ- or m-calpain was resuspended in a kinase assay buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Purified, activated ERK1 or ERK2 enzyme (0.5 μg) was added and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of μ- or m-calpain was determined by autoradiography as described above. Immunofluorescent Staining—5 × 106 cells were washed with 1× PBS, plated on a glass slide, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and blocked with 10% donkey serum. Then, cells were incubated with a goat μ- or m-calpain and a rabbit ERK1 or ERK2 primary antibody for 90 min. After washing, samples were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibodies for 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken and colored with the same exposure setting for each experiment. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual red- and green-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Openlab 3.1.5 software from Improvision, Inc. (Lexington, MA). Areas of protein co-localization appear yellow. Detection of Calpain Activity in Living Cells—NCI-H69 cells were plated at 50–80% confluence in a glass chamber. The cells were treated with agonist or inhibitor in the presence of t-Boc-LM-CMAC (20 μm) for 30 min. Samples were then observed under a fluorescent microscope (excitation 329 nm, emission 409 nm) as described (19Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Glading A. Uberall. F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Quantitative μ- or m-Calpain ELISA—The μ-calpain production in culture medium was measured using a μ-Calpain ELISA Assay Kit from Oncogene. This kit is designed to detect μ-calpain in tissue extracts, plasma, and serum. It uses a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human μ-calpain large subunit immobilized on a microtiter plate to bind human μ-calpain. A highly purified native human μ-calpain was used as a standard. The m-calpain in culture medium was also analyzed by ELISA using m-calpain antibody from ARB Affinity Bioreagents. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and treated with agonist or inhibitor as indicated. After centrifugation (1200 rpm), the resulting supernatant (culture medium) was collected. μ-Calpain or m-calpain in the medium was assessed by ELISA. The absorbance of the samples was analyzed using a microplate (ELISA) reader. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Cell Migration and Invasion Assay—Cells were treated with agonist or inhibitor as indicated. Cell migration was assessed using QCM™ chemotaxis 96-well cell migration assay kit (Chemicon) following the manufacturer's instructions. This new technique does not require cell labeling, scraping, washing, or counting. The 96-well insert and homogenous fluorescence detection format allows for large scale screening and quantitative comparison of multiple samples. Migratory cells on the bottom of the insert membrane are dissociated from the membrane when incubated with cell detachment buffer. These cells are subsequently lysed and detected by the patented CyQuant GR dye. This green fluorescent dye exhibits strong enhancement of fluorescence when bound to cellular nucleic acids. Samples were read with a fluorescent plate reader (Spectra Fluor, Tecan, Inc.) using a 480/520-nm filter set. Cell invasion was assessed using the Chemicon cell invasion assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay was performed in an invasion chamber, which is a 24-well tissue plate with 12 cell culture inserts. The inserts contain an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane over which a thin layer of ECMatrix™ is dried. The ECM layer occludes the membrane pores, blocking non-invasive cells from migrating through. Invasion cells migrate through the ECM layer and cling to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane. The insert membrane with invaded cells on the bottom was placed in the wells with cell stain/dissociation solution after incubation and reincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured by microplate reader at 560 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Measurement of Calpain Activity in Culture Medium—Cells were incubated in low serum culture medium (0.1% FBS) in the presence or absence of NNK (100 pm) for 24 h. After centrifugation (1200 rpm), the resulting supernatant (culture medium) was collected and incubated with t-Boc-LM-CMAC (20 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Calpain activity was measured by fluospectrometry (Tecan Spectra Fluor) at excitation 329 nm and emission 409 nm. Vector-based Gene Silencing of μ- or m-Calpain by RNA Interference—The μ- or m-calpain DNA target sequence for siRNA design is AAACTATAACCACTAGCTCGA or AAGATGGAGAATTCTGGATGT, respectively. This was determined by using an Ambion siRNA Target Finder according to the human μ- or m-calpain cDNA sequence. The μ- or m-calpain-specific hairpin siRNA insert (sense-loop-antisense) was determined using a computerized insert design tool based on a target sequence following instructions from the Ambion web site. Then, the oligonucleotide encoding the μ- or m-calpain-specific hairpin siRNA insert was synthesized and ligated into the pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygro vector (Ambion, Austin, TX). The pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygro plasmids bearing the μ- or m-calpain hairpin siRNA insert were transfected into NCI-H69 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stable clones persistently producing μ- or m-calpain siRNA were selected using hygromycin (0.8 mg/ml). The levels of μ- or m-calpain expression were analyzed by Western blot using μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. Collection of Vesicles from Culture Medium—Media vesicles were collected according to the method of Nishihara et al. (25Nishihara H. Nakagawa Y. Ishikawa H. Ohba M. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 1 × 108 NCI-H69 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% FBS in the presence or absence of various concentrations of NNK (0.1 or 100 nm) for 24 h. After treatment, samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. To pellet the media vesicles, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter, Optima XL-80K Ultracentrifuge with an SW 28 rotor). The pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then subjected to a 10% gradient SDS-PAGE. Levels of μ- or m-calpain in the media vesicle sample were analyzed by Western blotting using μ- or m-calpain antibody, respectively. NNK Induces Phosphorylation of Both μ- and m-Calpain in Association with Increased activity—The two calpains, μ- and m-calpain, are ubiquitously distributed in most tissues and are composed of a large 80-kDa subunit (i.e. μ- or m-calpain) bound to a common small 28-kDa subunit (calpain 4) (18Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

This suggests that calpains may play an important role in regulating the development of human lung cancer. To test whether NNK can induce phosphorylation of μ-calpain or m-calpain, NCI-H69 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with NNK (100 pm) for various times. The results indicate that NNK potently stimulates phosphorylation of both endogenous μ- and m-calpain with a peak at 30 min in human SCLC NCI-H69 cells (Fig. 1B). Recent reports suggest that EGF-mediated calpain phosphorylation can activate calpain both in vitro and in vivo (20Glading A. Uberall. F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol.

To determine the role of NNK-induced calpain phosphorylation in human lung cancer cells, calpain activity in living cells was performed using t-Boc-LM-CMAC, a synthetic calpain substrate, as described (19Glading A.

Cleavage of t-Boc-LM-CMAC by active calpains can induce retention of the chloromethylaminocoumarin portion of the molecule in the cells and can result in increased fluorescence (19Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). NCI-H69 cells were treated with NNK (100 pm) in the presence of t-Boc-LM-CMAC for 30 min. Calpain activity was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Results indicate that NNK potently stimulates calpain activation (Fig. 1C). Because phosphorylation is sufficient for activation of calpain (20Glading A. Uberall. F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A.

ERK1 and ERK2 Co-localize with μ- and m-Calpain in Cytoplasm, NNK Activates ERK1 and -2, and Active ERK1 and ERK2 Directly Phosphorylate μ- and m-Calpain in Vitro—To assess a potential direct role for ERK1 and -2 as physiological calpain kinases, subcellular distribution of ERK1/2 and calpains was examined by immunofluorescent staining. A goat polyclonal antibody against human μ- or m-calpain, rabbit polyclonal ERK1 or ERK2 antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat (green) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit (red) secondary antibodies were used so that cells could be simultaneously stained without cross-reaction. As shown in Fig. 2A, μ- or m-calpain is primarily co-localized with ERK1 or ERK2 in the cytoplasm of NCI-H69 cells. It is known that MAPK/ERK signaling is required for EGF-induced m-calpain activity (19Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Glading A. Uberall. F. Keyse S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol.

Our findings reveal that NNK potently induces phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in SCLC NCI-H69 cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that ERK1 and -2 may be physiological calpain kinases. The consensus phosphorylation site for the ERK substrates is characterized by a target serine/threonine residue located immediately amino-terminal to a proline residue in a putative proline-directed phosphorylation site (27Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both μ- and m-calpain possess similarities to the phosphorylation consensus sequence Pro-X-Ser/Thr-Pro (12Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). For example, m-calpain contains: Pro-Ser-50*-Phe-Pro, Pro-Asn-Thr-381*-Phe-Trp-Met-Asn-Pro, and Pro-Ser-490*-Thr-491*-Phe-Glu-Pro (22Glading A. Bodnar R.J. Reynolds I.J. Shiraha H. Satish L. Potter D.A. Blair H.C. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2499-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To assess whether activated ERK1 and ERK2 can directly phosphorylate the endogenous calpains, μ-calpain or m-calpain was immunoprecipitated from lysates of NCI-H69 cells and incubated with purified and active ERK1 or ERK2 in a kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results show that ERK1 and ERK2 directly phosphorylate both μ-calpain and m-calpain in vitro (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that ERK1 and ERK2 may be physiological kinases for both μ- and m-calpain.

https://openalex.org/W2092514706,"Transcription of the DNA genome of vaccinia virus occurs in the cytoplasm and is temporally programmed by early, intermediate, and late stage-specific transcription factors in conjunction with a viral multisubunit RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase, capping enzyme, and three factors (VITF-1, VITF-2, and VITF-3) are sufficient for in vitro transcription of a DNA template containing an intermediate stage promoter. Vaccinia virus intermediate transcription factor (VITF)-1 and -3 are virus-encoded, whereas VITF-2 was partially purified from extracts of uninfected HeLa cells. Using purified and recombinant viral proteins, we showed that the HeLa cell factor was required for transcription of linear or nicked circular templates but not of super coiled DNA. HeLa cell polypeptides of ∼110 and 66 kDa copurified with VITF-2 activity through multiple chromatographic steps. The polypeptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry as Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein (G3BP) and p137, recently named cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1. The co-purification of the two polypeptides with transcription-complementing activity was confirmed with specific antibodies, and their association with each other was demonstrated by affinity chromatography of tagged recombinant forms. Furthermore, recombinant G3BP and p137 expressed individually or together in mammalian or bacterial cells complemented the activity of the viral RNA polymerase and transcription factors. The involvement of cellular proteins in transcription of intermediate stage genes may regulate the transition between early and late phases of vaccinia virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W2022838525,"Sequence analysis of the 330-kb double-stranded DNA genome of Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 revealed an open reading frame A674R that encodes a protein with up to 53% amino acid identity to a recently discovered new class of thymidylate synthases, called ThyX. Unlike the traditional thymidylate synthase, ThyA, that uses methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate) as both a source of the methylene group and the reductant, CH2H4folate only supplies the methylene group in ThyX-catalyzed reactions. Furthermore, ThyX only catalyzes thymidylate (dTMP) formation in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides and oxidized FAD. The distribution and transcription patterns of the a674r gene in Chlorella viruses were examined. The a674r gene was cloned, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical characterization of the P. bursaria chlorella virus-1 recombinant ThyX protein indicates that it is more efficient at converting dUMP to dTMP than previously studied ThyX enzymes, thus allowing more detailed mechanistic studies of the enzyme. The ThyX-dUMP complexes with bound FAD function as efficient NAD(P)H oxidases, indicating that dUMP binds to the enzyme prior to NAD(P)H. This oxidation activity is directly linked to FAD reduction. Our results indicate that ThyX-specific inhibitors can be designed that do not affect ThyA enzymes. Finally, a model is proposed for the early stages of ThyX catalysis.

Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PBCV-1, P. bursaria chlorella virus-1; ThyA, thymidylate synthase A; ThyX, flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase X; CH2H4folate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; p.i., post-infection; dUMP, deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate. is a large double-stranded DNA virus that replicates in certain unicellular eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae (1Van Etten J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By 4 h after infection, the DNA concentration in a virus-infected cell increases 4–10-fold because of viral DNA synthesis (2Van Etten J.L. Burbank D.E. Joshi J. Meints R.H. Virology. 1984; 134: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Viral DNA synthesis presumably requires higher concentrations of deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) than the host can supply, implying that large quantities of dNTPs need to be synthesized de novo by viral encoded proteins. Genome sequencing of PBCV-1 revealed that the virus encodes at least 13 putative enzymes involved in DNA precursor metabolism (1Van Etten J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), among them dUTP pyrophosphatase and dCMP deaminase that participate in the formation of dUMP from dUTP and dCMP, respectively. dUMP is a substrate for thymidylate synthase and is required for de novo synthesis of thymidylate (dTMP), an essential DNA precursor. Whereas PBCV-1 lacks a canonical thymidylate synthase ThyA (EC 2.1.1.45), its open reading frame A674R has a highly conserved sequence motif RHRX7S (“ThyX motif”) as well as significant overall amino acid sequence similarity to an alternative class of thymidylate synthases called ThyX (EC 2.1.1.148) (3Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ThyX proteins are found in many pathogenic bacteria and several double-stranded DNA viruses. Although numerous ThyA homologs have been analyzed from viral sources, no data are available for viral ThyX proteins. The homodimeric ThyA (4Hardy L.W. Finer-Moore J.S. Montfort W.R. Jones M.O.

Proteins. 2002; 49: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have no sequence or structural similarity, but both catalyze the methylation of dUMP to dTMP. Although both ThyA and ThyX depend on methylenetetrahydrofolate for activity, they differ markedly regarding their reductive mechanisms. CH2H4folate provides a methylene group and functions as the reductant in ThyA-catalyzed reactions (6Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In contrast, Helicobacter pylori ThyX appears to use CH2H4folate only as a one-carbon donor; ThyX proteins catalyze dTMP formation only in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides and oxidized FAD (3Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To date, direct proof for this ThyX-catalyzed redox reaction has been missing. In this work we show that the phylogenetic distribution, gene expression profile, and genetic properties of PBCV-1 A674R are consistent with its physiological role as a thymidylate synthase during viral infection. PBCV-1 ThyX is highly efficient at forming dTMP. Biochemical studies indicate that ThyX proteins with bound FAD act as NAD(P)H oxidases in the presence of bound dUMP, indicating that viral infection requires FAD from the host. This oxidation activity is directly linked to FAD reduction. As NAD(P)H- and CH2H4folate-binding sites might overlap, our data have strong implications for developing specific ThyX inhibitors and allow us to propose a model for the early stages of ThyX catalysis. Growth of Chlorella Viruses and Bacterial Strains—Production of chlorella viruses and virus DNA isolations were performed as described (7Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Burbank D.E. Kuczmarski D. Cuppels D.A. Lane L.C. Virology. 1981; 113: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Van Etten J.L. Burbank D.E. Xia Y. Meints R.H. Virology. 1983; 126: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The bacterial strains used in this study are Escherichia coli BL21 (F– ompT hsdSB (r –B m –B) gal dcm; Novagen), and the thymidine-auxotroph strain χ2913 (ΔthyA recA56). The strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) or in M9 (Difco) minimal medium (3 g/liter Na2HPO4, 1.5 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.25 g/liter NH4Cl, and 0.15 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.3% glycerol. One hundred μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were added for plasmid maintenance or protein induction, respectively. Complementation tests were performed as described previously (3Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Northern and Dot Blot Analyses—Chlorella cells (3 × 109) were collected at various times after PBCV-1 infection, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Cells were suspended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads (0.25–0.30 mm in diameter) at high speed for 5–20 min with intermittent cooling. Isolated RNA was denatured with formaldehyde, separated on 1.5% agarose gels, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Osmonics, Inc.) as described (9Graves M.V. Bernadt C.T. Cerny R. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2001; 285: 332-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RNA was hybridized with a 32P-labeled a674r probe at 65 °C in 500 mm NaPO4, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 7% SDS. The probe was 32P-labeled using a random-primer DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen). After hybridization, radioactivity bound to the membranes was detected with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). To monitor possible loading differences between samples, the relative amount of the 3.6-kb rRNA in each lane was determined by converting the photographs of stained membranes to digital images using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4C scanner and analyzing the images with ImageQuant software. Viral DNAs for the dot blots were denatured and applied to nylon membranes (Osmonics, Inc.), fixed by UV cross-linking, and hybridized with the same probe used for the Northern analyses. Molecular Genetic Techniques and Construction of Plasmids—The pVEX plasmid containing the thyX gene from PBCV-1 is a pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) derivative that contains an IPTG-inducible tac promoter, an ampicillin selection marker, and a T7 tag enhancer and carries a deletion in the glutathione S-transferase gene. The thyX gene was amplified by using PCR with primers a674rF (5′-ATGGCTAGCA-TGACTGGTTCCGCAAAGCTCATTTCCGTTACCAAG-3′) and a674rR (5′-ATCCTCGAGTTAGTGGTGATGGTGGTGGTGGACCCAATCAAG-TGCTTTTGCAATGCT-3′) and inserted as a fusion gene (T7tag-a674r6HIS) into unique NheI and XhoI sites. This construct carrying a hexahistidine tag at its carboxyl terminus was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant allele carrying an E190G substitution resulting from mutagenesis during the PCR amplification was isolated during the cloning procedure. Protein Expression and Purification—The PBCV-1 wild-type and mutant ThyX proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 at 37 °C in 800 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG to early exponential phase cultures (A600 ≈0.5) for 4 h. His-tagged proteins were purified from cell-free extracts by gravity-flow chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and eluted protein was stored at –80 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% glycerol. Protein samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and were more than 95% pure. Control experiments with noncomplementing mutants established that E. coli thymidylate synthase ThyA does not bind to the column under these conditions (10Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ThyX Activity Measurements—Tritium release assays for measuring PBCV-1 ThyX activity in vitro were performed essentially as described earlier for H. pylori ThyX protein (10Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by using enzyme concentrations of 40 μg/ml and stopping incubations after 3.5 min. Kinetic parameters were determined by using nonlinear regression software (GraphPad). Typical reactions contained 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-NADH, 2 mm β-NADPH, 60 μm FAD, 10% glycerol in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Omitting β-NADH from reaction mixtures did not have significant effect on activity. The specific activity of the [5-3H]dUMP stock (Amersham Biosciences) used in the experiments was 15 Ci/mmol. In double titration experiments, the concentrations of dUMP and CH2H4folate were varied from 3 to 100 μm and from 3 to 200 mm, respectively. When deprotonation activity was measured as a function of the FAD concentration, reactions were carried out in the presence of 500 μm CH2H4folate and 7.25 μm dUMP with added FAD concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 μm. Direct Detection of dTMP Formation—dTMP formation was quantified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (3Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The positions of the radioactive peaks were detected by an on-line radioactivity detector (β-RAM, Lablogic) using a flow cell of 1 ml (the column eluate was mixed in a 1:3 ratio with FlowLogic SafeScint scintillation liquid (Lablogic)). Peak areas were quantified using the Laura Light program (Lablogic). The reaction conditions were as described for the tritium release assay, except that 0.5 μm [6-3H]dUMP was used (specific activity 21.6 Ci/mmol). Reactions were started by adding 3 μm purified enzyme and stopped after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. Prior to HPLC analysis, nucleotides and folates were separated using a small DEAE-cellulose column (0.4 × 0.5 cm) as described previously (11Santi D.V. McHenry C.S. Perriard E.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were eluted from the DEAE-cellulose column with 2 ml of 100 mm NaOAc (pH 6.0), lyophilized, and resuspended in 20 μl of water. For dTMP separation, the nucleotides were injected into a C18 HPLC column (Beckman Instruments) equilibrated with 10 mm KPi buffer, pH 4, and separated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The produced dTMP was measured with a tritium detector (Lablogic). Oxidation of NADPH and NADH—The various reactions were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C upon addition of enzyme using a total volume of 100 μl. Reaction components are listed in Table I. Activity was monitored by decrease of absorbance at 340 nm using a CARY 50 spectrophotometer (Varian). An extinction coefficient (ϵ340) of 6400 cm–1 was used to quantify absorption changes. Note that this assay is different from the spectrophotometric assay for ThyA proteins that catalyze the oxidation of H4folate to H2folate resulting in net increase in absorption. Qualitative NAD(P)H oxidation linked to FAD reduction was measured under anaerobic conditions following a decrease in absorption at 450 nm using an SFM-300 stopped flow system (Bio-Logic) equipped with Biokine 32 software for data collection.Table IInfluence of reaction components on ThyX NAD(P)H oxidation activitySampleActivity%Control100a100% oxidation activity obtained for complete reaction mixtures (control) correspond to a kcat value of 11.25 min-1.

Open table in a new tab FAD Binding to ThyX—Fluorescence quenching of FAD due to binding to ThyX protein was used to quantify the formation of the FAD-ThyX complex. FAD was added at concentrations varying between 0 and 50 μm to ThyX (final concentration of 8 μm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Samples were excited at 450 nm with an SFM25 fluorometer (Biotek Instruments), and fluorescence emission of FAD was detected at 520 nm. Measurements were performed after sample equilibration (1 min after FAD addition). Chemicals—5′-Fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate was obtained from Sigma.

However, PBCV-1 contains open reading frame A674R (GenBank™ accession number g14916853) that is predicted to encode a 215-amino acid protein with up to 53% amino acid identity to a newly described class of flavin-dependent thymidylate synthases, called ThyX. To determine whether the thyX gene is common among the chlorella viruses, genomic DNAs from 42 Chlorella viruses isolated from diverse geographical sources, as well as the host chlorella, were hybridized to an a674r probe (Fig. 1A). DNA from 32 of the 37 viruses that infect Chlorella NC64A (NC64A viruses) hybridized strongly with the probe, whereas no hybridization occurred with DNA from five NC64A viruses, NYs-1, IL-5-2s1, MA-1D, NY-2B, and NY-2A, and the host Chlorella NC64A. Typically, the nucleotide sequences of homologs in these five NC64A viruses differ by ∼25% from PBCV-1; therefore, hybridization signals are often absent or barely detectable (e.g. see the type II DNA topoisomerase gene (12Fortune J.M. Lavrukhin O.V. Gurnon J.R. Van Etten J.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24401-24408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Weak or no hybridization occurred with DNA from five viruses, CVA-1, CAB-1, CVG-1, CVM-1, and CVR-1, that infect another chlorella, Chlorella Pbi (Pbi viruses). Usually, the nucleotide identity of homologs between the NC64A viruses and Pbi viruses is 60–65% (1Van Etten J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, lack of a674r hybridization with the Pbi viruses probably results from nucleotide differences rather than lack of a thyX gene. Indeed, results from sequencing two more chlorella viruses, virus NY-2A that fails to hybridize with the PBCV-1 probe and a Pbi virus (called MT325), provide support for this statement. Both viruses have a thyX gene. The NY-2A and MT325 gene products have 88 and 61% amino acid identity to PBCV-1 ThyX, respectively. 2J. L. Van Etten, unpublished results. RNA was extracted from Chlorella NC64A cells at various times after PBCV-1 infection and hybridized to an a674r probe to determine when the gene is transcribed during virus replication. The probe hybridized to a diffuse 800-nucleotide RNA band present in cells at 30, 45, and 60 min post-infection (p.i.) (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the RNA band, which is the appropriate size for the a674r gene, is strongest at 30 min p.i. and disappears by 60 min p.i. Because PBCV-1 DNA synthesis begins at 60–90 min p.i (2Van Etten J.L. Burbank D.E. Joshi J. Meints R.H. Virology. 1984; 134: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a674r is expressed as an early gene. The diffuse nature of the a674r transcript suggests that the RNA might have been isolated under less than ideal conditions. However, repeated RNA isolations and a674r hybridization experiments always produced the same diffuse pattern. It has been our experience that certain PBCV-1 genes produce diffuse hybridization signals (13Sun L. Gurnon J.R. Adams B.J. Graves M.V. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2000; 276: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas others do not. Stripping the a674r blot and re-probing the filter with gene probes that produce sharp RNA bands gave sharp RNA bands; thus the diffuse a674r hybridizing band is not due to contaminating RNase activity. Possible explanations for the diffuse pattern are that the a674r gene lacks a well defined transcriptional stop signal or that the a674r mRNA is rapidly degraded. These experiments establish that thyX transcription occurs early in viral infection and suggest that the availability of thymidylate might be a limiting factor for virus replication as it needs to be synthesized de novo. The wide distribution of thyX genes in the chlorella viruses supports the importance of thyX for viral replication. Nonorthologous Functional Replacement of a Cellular thyA Gene with PBCV-1 thyX—We tested whether PBCV-1 gene a674r or a mutant allele carrying an E190G substitution can functionally replace the E. coli thyA gene. By using an IPTG-inducible promoter, viral proteins were produced in E. coli strain χ2913 (ΔthyA), and their ability to functionally complement the ThyA deficiency of the host strain was scored on defined minimal growth medium in the absence and presence of 1 mm IPTG. Control experiments using the plasmid pVEX without insert resulted in no growth under both conditions (data not shown). In contrast, E. coli χ2913 transformants carrying the PBCV-1 gene a674r (wild-type gene) on a plasmid formed yellowish colonies on solid minimal medium after 2 days in the presence of IPTG, whereas cells transformed with the E190G substitution did not (Fig. 1C). This level of complementation is higher than when E. coli χ2913 is complemented with a H. pylori thyX gene; these cells form colonies after 3–4 days under similar conditions (3Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PBCV-1 gene a674r encodes a functional thymidylate synthase ThyX. The results also imply that the conserved amino acid residue Glu-190 serves an important role in ThyX catalysis. Determination of Steady-state Kinetics for “Tritium Release” Activity of PBCV-1 ThyX—The PBCV-1 wild-type and E190G mutant genes were expressed in E. coli as carboxyl-terminal oligohistidine fusion proteins. The majority of the recombinant proteins appeared in the soluble fractions of the bacterial extracts. Approximately 12 mg of purified recombinant protein was obtained per liter of cell culture. Both proteins had an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D) which agrees with their predicted molecular masses of 24.9 kDa. Identical absorption spectra were found for the two oxidized proteins, with broad maxima at 447.5 and 375 nm (data not shown) due to noncovalently bound FAD. By using PBCV-1 ThyX, we determined several kinetic parameters for steady-state ThyX catalysis, under conditions where the concentration of dUMP was kept constant, whereas the CH2H4folate concentration was varied or vice versa. These measurements were performed using tritium release assays that measure the loss of a proton from position 5 of the pyrimidine ring of dUMP. In agreement with our genetic complementation studies, the kcat value measured in vitro for the viral protein is at least 45 times higher than obtained previously for the H. pylori ThyX protein under identical conditions (10Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that PBCV-1 ThyX activity is not substantially inhibited by excess of NAD(P)H present in the reaction. The relatively low Km values measured for the different substrates under these experimental conditions indicate that excess of NAD(P)H in the reaction does not drastically affect substrate binding. Recombinant protein with the E190G substitution did not have detectable activity. Rates of dTMP formation at constant dUMP concentrations and CH2H4folate concentrations up to 200 μm (Fig. 2A) are typical for an enzyme using more than one substrate. Under the above conditions, the Km value for CH2H4folate under physiological dUMP concentrations is about 20 μm. Excess dUMP increases the apparent Km value for CH2H4folate, indicating that both substrates compete for the same active site. A different behavior was observed when dUMP (up to 100 μm) was titrated in the presence of fixed concentrations of CH2H4folate (Fig. 2B). At low concentrations of CH2H4folate, saturation of the ThyX activity was achieved with increasing dUMP concentrations. However, saturation of enzyme activity was not achieved at high concentrations of CH2H4folate, possibly suggesting conformational changes resulting in less efficient dUMP binding. At a CH2H4folate concentration that still allows saturation of the activity, the Km for dUMP is ∼15 μm. Moreover, we observed a positive cooperativity brought about by the binding of CH2H4folate (Fig. 2C), also reflecting a conformational change of PBCV-1 ThyX protein that is influenced by both dUMP and CH2H4folate. At low concentrations of dUMP the Hill constant for this reaction is ≤1 (Fig. 2D), indicating that the observed positive cooperativity is influenced by the binding of the two substrates, dUMP and CH2H4folate, to the enzyme. These data are consistent with the simultaneous presence of two substrates at the ThyX-active site, located at the interphase of three subunits of the tetramer (10Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sequential and ping-pong reaction mechanisms can be distinguished by determining reaction rates when both substrates are varied, whereas the ratio of their concentrations is kept constant. Such plots are nonlinear for a sequential mechanism and linear for a ping-pong mechanism. For example, the canonical thymidylate synthase ThyA that uses a sequential reaction mechanism (14Daron H.H. Aull J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 940-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) displays nonlinear behavior in a plot of v–1 versus [dUMP]–1 with a fixed [CH2H4folate]/[dUMP] ratio that can be fitted using a second degree polynomial (parabolic) function. As shown in Fig. 2E, by using the deprotonation assay we have obtained a similar nonlinear plot for PBCV-1 ThyX that can also be fitted with a parabolic function (with a determination coefficient of 0.99936). Moreover, double-reciprocal plots obtained using data shown in Fig. 2, A and B, display a converging set of lines (data not shown). These results establish that ThyX uses a reaction mechanism where dUMP and CH2H4folate bind at the same active site thus allowing transmethylation of dUMP to take place (15Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. Wiley-VCH, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). Quantification of Highly Efficient dTMP Forming Activity by PBCV-1 ThyX—To prove that the deprotonation activity used to measure ThyX activity in Fig. 2 is linked to dTMP formation, we monitored PBCV-1 ThyX-catalyzed dTMP formation directly by separating the radioactively tagged substrate [6-3H]dUMP and product [6-3H]TMP using HPLC directly coupled to an on-line radioactivity detector. Under these conditions where 0.5 μm dUMP was limiting activity, ThyX proteins catalyze dTMP formation with 90% yield (Fig. 3A). The elution times observed for dUMP and dTMP were 5.9 and 10.8 min, respectively. dTMP was not detected in a control reaction performed without enzyme (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the high tritium release activity used to quantify ThyX activity in Fig. 2 is directly linked to dTMP formation, a physiologically significant activity in agreement with the genetic complementation studies. FAD Bound to the Active Site of PBCV-1 ThyX Is Required for Activity—Free FAD in solution has a characteristic fluorescence emission peak at 520 nm after excitation at 450 nm. Quenching of this fluorescence can be used to quantify FAD binding to protein. Fig. 4A shows that ThyX forms a specific complex with free FAD in solution. About 25% of purified PBCV-1 ThyX protein already has FAD bound to it. The FAD binding was saturating at 24 μm, which corresponds to ∼1 FAD molecule bound per ThyX monomer (the active form is a tetramer). ThyX requires FAD for activity with a broad maximum between 40 and 80 μm (Fig. 4B). At higher FAD concentrations, activity is inhibited, presumably due to competition between FAD and substrate binding at the ThyX active site. This conclusion is supported by the observation that FAD binding to the protein diminishes when moderate excesses of dUMP and CH2H4folate are added to the reaction mixtures before adding FAD (data not shown). The ability of H. pylori ThyX to form a specific complex with FAD in similar assays is lower; this could explain why H. pylori ThyX activity is much lower than PBCV-1 ThyX activity (10Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ThyX Is an NADPH Oxidase—Previous experiments with H. pylori ThyX suggest that oxidation of NADPH is linked to the reduction of enzyme-bound FAD. Although we could not readily address this question with H. pylori ThyX, the high specific activity of the PBCV-1 ThyX protein allowed us to examine this reaction. ThyX catalyzes time-dependent absorption changes with a broad absorption maximum at 340 nm (Fig. 5A), which were absent in a control reaction without enzyme (Table I). The maximal oxidation activity we have measured in the presence of 200 μm NADPH corresponds to a kcat value of ≈11 min–1 (Fig. 5B and Table I). By using the oxidation test, the Km values for NADPH and NADH were 43 and 71 μm, respectively, suggesting that ThyX prefers NADPH as substrate. These Km values are 2 orders magnitude lower than recently reported for the Thermotoga maritima ThyX protein that binds NADPH only poorly with a Km value of 4 mm (16Agrawal N. Lesley S.A. Kuhn P. Kohen A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10295-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase activity is linked to FAD reduction which is complete in few seconds, as shown qualitatively in Fig. 5C. A unique feature of the reaction is that dUMP is required for efficient NADPH oxidation activity. The dUMP effect is specific, as NADPH oxidation occurs poorly with UMP or dTMP (see Table I). In addition, omitting CH2H4folate from the reaction mixtures increases oxidation activity by a factor of 7. The inhibition by 5′-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate does not result from its covalent binding to the enzyme (unpublished mass spectrometry analysis), but rather from competitive inhibition with a Ki value of 0.3 μm (measured in 2.5 μm CH2H4folate). Altogether these results establish that the substrate NADPH is oxidized by a pre-formed dUMP-ThyX complex and that NADPH- and folate-binding sites partially overlap. Effect of ThyA Inhibitors on PBCV-1 ThyX Activity—Four folate derivatives and three nucleotide analogs were tested for inhibitory effects against deprotonation activity of PBCV-1 ThyX. The potent ThyA inhibitors 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate, 10-methylfolate, and 8-azapurinone deoxyribonucleoside 5′-phosphate (see Table II) had no effect on PBCV-1 ThyX deprotonation activity at concentrations that inhibit ThyA activity. 10-Methyl-5,8-dideazafolate, 10-propargylfolate, 8-aminopurinone deoxyribonucleoside 5′-phosphate, and 5-FdUMP act as competitive inhibitors demonstrating different efficiencies with Ki values ranging from 12.5 to 25 μm (Table II and data not shown). Most interestingly, 8-aminopurinone deoxyribonucleoside 5′-phosphate, which has no effect on ThyA activity, 3T. I. Kalman, personal communication. inhibits ThyX activity about 50%, whereas the potent transition state inhibitor 8-azapurinone deoxyribonucleoside 5′-phosphate (17Kalman T.I. Goldman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) has no effect. The found inhibitors will be used in future experiments to further dissect the details of ThyX reaction. Identification of these inhibitors also indicates that conception of ThyX-specific inhibitors without inhibitory effect against human ThyA protein is feasible. The studies reported here provide the first evidence that the FAD-requiring thymidylate synthase ThyX is important during the replication of many chlorella viruses. Presumably, PBCV-1 replication depends on FAD provided by the host. The genetic complementation studies with E. coli also demonstrate that nonorthologous gene replacement of cellular thyA by viral thyX is possible. If analogous gene replacement events are frequent in nature, this could partially explain the sporadic phylogenetic distribution of thyX genes in bacteria (3Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our recent studies using site-directed mutagenesis and genetic and biochemical characterizations established that the H. pylori ThyX active site is located at the interphase of three subunits of the homotetramer (10Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Structural data of the oxidized T. maritima enzyme indicate that dUMP binds at this active site (18Mathews I.I. Deacon A.M. Canaves J.M. McMullan D. Lesley S.A. Agarwalla S. Kuhn P. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We proposed previously that the orientation of dUMP at the active site is influenced by conformational changes brought about by FAD reduction and/or folate binding. In agreement with these proposals, we now demonstrate that ThyX proteins possess NADPH oxidation activity that increases in the presence of dUMP (Fig. 5 and Table I). It is of note that earlier structural studies have indicated that dUMP binding induces a conformational change in the T. maritima ThyX protein that orders the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (18Mathews I.I. Deacon A.M. Canaves J.M. McMullan D. Lesley S.A. Agarwalla S. Kuhn P. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that may account for the observed increase in oxidation activity. The observation that NADPH oxidation in a time scale relevant for ThyX catalysis is linked to FAD reduction is the first direct evidence that FAD plays a redox-active role during ThyX catalysis, predicting that H4folate and not H2folate (as is the case for ThyA) is the reaction product. Altogether, our results indicate that the ThyX reaction mechanism that requires three substrates (NADPH in addition to dUMP and CH2H4folate) is more complex than the ThyA reaction that uses only two substrates. Most strikingly, dUMP influences NADPH oxidation activity of the protein; this finding suggests that the structurally stable dUMP-ThyX complex plays a pivotal role during ThyX catalysis (Fig. 6). Data shown in Table I indicate that the ordered binding of dUMP to the enzyme is required for efficient initiation of catalysis. The observation that CH2H4folate inhibits NADPH oxidation activity indicates that, after release of NADPH, CH2H4folate is the last substrate to bind at the ThyX active site. The model shown in Fig. 6 summarizes our current understanding of ThyX catalysis, thus providing a framework for a further detailed kinetic analysis of the ThyX reaction. ThyX proteins exist in many pathogenic bacteria and provide an ideal target for new antimicrobial agents (for a recent review see Ref. 19Myllykallio H. Leduc D. Filee J. Liebl U. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 220-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), thus underlining the need to identify specific ThyX inhibitors. In this respect, our observation that the CH2H4folate-binding site partially overlaps either with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD or with the binding site of dUMP is of particular interest. Our results predict that one subclass of specific ThyX mechanism-based inhibitors should prevent ThyX activity by inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidation. Oxidation tests can be performed in small volumes allowing for efficient screening of compounds. In addition, this test should be highly specific as ThyA enzymes do not use NADPH but H4folate as a reductant, and except for ThyX proteins, we are not aware of any other dUMP-dependent NAD(P)H oxidases. Consequently, our studies on PBCV-1 ThyX have unexpectedly provided a basis to identify ThyX inhibitors from focused small molecule libraries."

https://openalex.org/W2040253677,"In this study we demonstrate that the class II nuclear hormone receptor, farnesoid X-receptor (FXR), incorporates histone methyltransferase activity within the gene locus for bile salt export pump (BSEP), a well established FXR target gene that functions as an ATP-dependent canalicular bile acid transporter. This methyltransferase activity is directed specifically to arginine 17 of histone H3. We demonstrate that FXR is directly associated with co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) activity. Furthermore, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that the ligand-dependent activation of the human BSEP locus is associated with a simultaneous increase of FXR and CARM1 occupation. The increased occupation of the BSEP locus by CARM1 also corresponds with the increased deposition of Arg-17 methylation and Lys-9 acetylation of histone H3 within the FXR DNA-binding element of BSEP. Consistent with these findings, CARM1 led to increased BSEP promoter activity with an intact FXR regulatory element, whereas CARM1 failed to transactivate the BSEP promoter with a mutated FXRE. Induction of endogenous BSEP mRNA and Arg-17 methylation by FXR regulatory element ligand, CDCA, requires CARM1 activity. Therefore, histone methylation at Arg-17 by CARM1 is a downstream target of signaling through ligand-mediated activation of FXR. Our studies provide evidence that FXR directly recruits specific chromatin modifying activity of CARM1 necessary for full potentiation of the BSEP locus in vivo.

An important component in the architecture of chromatin is the dynamic alteration in the post-translational modification of nucleosomal histones (1Vermaak D. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As a result of these changes in histone modification, recent studies have confirmed the existence of a code embodied within the enzymatic post-translational conjugation of histones that provide the appropriate chromatin template for many nuclear processes that include the regulation of transcription, DNA replication, and repair (2Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Studies of nuclear hormone receptors have provided evidence for the direct interactions between the activation of nuclear hormone receptors and the remodeling of chromatin through histone modification (3Lee K.C.

Recent studies have shown FXR to have several ligands that activate FXR through the intracellular heterodimerization with the retinoid X-receptor (RXR) (5Fitzgerald M.L. Moore K.J. Freeman M.W. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the capacity of FXR function to regulate many aspects of bile acid metabolism and transport through transcriptional activation of a number of target genes (6Ananthanarayanan M.

Furthermore, less is known about the nuclear protein components associated with the FXR/RXR heterodimer as a higher order ternary complex. To begin to understand the biochemical basis of how FXR may function to direct transcription, we tested whether FXR can associate with histone methyltransferase activity in vivo. Many studies have now confirmed that histone methyltransferases can directly imprint a code onto the NH2-terminal region of the core histone with methyl groups that may elicit either an active or repressive state within the chromatin architecture (7Rice J.C.

Along with the acetylation of key residues along the NH2-terminal end of histone H3, further studies have demonstrated that an important process necessary for ligand-dependent nuclear hormone receptor activation of target genes is the mono- and dimethylation of a discrete arginine within the NH2-terminal end of histone H3 positioned at Arg-17 (10Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H. Strahl B.D. Rice R. Jelinek M.A. Aswad D.W. Allis C.D. Hager G.L. Stallcup M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1981-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model is the fact that the post-translational modification of histone H3 is important spatially and temporally to appropriately transform the conformation of chromatin structure of genes poised for transcriptional activation (11Schurter B.T.

Conjugated bile acids are excreted into bile via the bile salt export pump (BSEP, gene name Abcb11), an ATP-binding cassette transporter localized to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Recent studies (6Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol.

These studies are consistent with studies using FXR–/–mice showing decreased murine Bsep expression as well as altered bile acid, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in these animals that were aggravated by bile acid feeding (14Zollner G.

Recently, several enzymes that can catalyze either arginine or lysine methylation have been identified and partially characterized (17Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T.

Despite the ability of protein-arginine methyltransferases to direct the methylation of the NH2-terminal regions of the various core histones, it has been a recent finding that these proteins exist as components of larger complexes within the active transcriptional apparatus (19Stallcup M.R.

Of those known to target the methylation of arginine along the NH2-terminal end of histones, co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is associated with the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) in activating transcription through ligand-dependent regulation by estrogen receptors (10Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H. Strahl B.D. Rice R. Jelinek M.A. Aswad D.W. Allis C.D. Hager G.L. Stallcup M.R. Curr.

Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). CARM1 preferentially methylates histone H3 at the arginine residue at position 17 from the NH2 terminus, a modification associated with active transcription (10Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H. Strahl B.D.

It was shown that CARM1 requires arginine methyltransferase activity to coactivate estrogen receptor-mediated transcription (17Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 21Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was noted that the interplay between the specific substrate of CARM1, Arg-17, was further induced by acetylation of specific lysines residues along the NH2 terminus of histone H3 particularly, Lys-18 (22Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These results argue for the coordinated interplay between acetylation of histone H3 and methylation of arginine 17 as suggested previously (23Daujat S. Bauer U.M. Shah V. Turner B. Berger S. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2090-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the association of FXR with histone H3 methyltransferase activity in vivo. This activity is preferentially localized to the methylation of arginine 17 and potentially affects methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 in vitro. We determined that FXR is associated with CARM1, and this association is mediated through the central arginine methyltransferase domain of CARM1. To determine the consequence of the association between CARM1 and FXR, we examined cross-linked immunoprecipitates of chromatin to determine that the simultaneous occupation of the target gene BSEP by the nuclear hormone receptor FXR and the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 are enhanced upon ligand-dependent activation of FXR. Our results show that ligand-dependent activation of BSEP is associated with methylation of histone H3 at arginine 17 and acetylation of lysine 9. Plasmid DNA and Antibodies—All expression vectors for wild-type and mutant NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CARM1 were described previously (24Koh S.S. Li H. Lee Y.H. Widelitz R.B. Chuong C.M.

Antibodies against human FXR (H-130) were purchased as rabbit polyclonal antisera (catalog number sc-13063) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antiserum against GRIP-1 (SRC-2) and SRC-1 were described previously (26Hong H. Darimont B.D. Ma H. Yang L. Yamamoto K.R. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol.

Antiserum against histone H3 was purchased (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as purified rabbit polyclonal antisera. Cell Culture—Hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were provided by G. Acs (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). HepG2 cells were cultured in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum with 1× gentamycin (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified cell culture incubator. BSEP Promoter Analysis—Transfection of HepG2 cells with the human BSEP 0.2-kb wild-type and FXRE mutant promoters and co-transfection with wild-type (wt) FXR, AF2-deleted FXR, and RXR were carried out as described by us previously (6Ananthanarayanan M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). 3XFXRE-TK-Luc was constructed by cloning three copies of the FXRE from the rat Bsep promoter upstream of the TK promoter. CV-1 cells were transfected with this construct and cotransfected with wtFXR, AF2-deleted FXR, RXR, and CARM1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Addition of 100 μm CDCA and further details are included in the figure legends. All transfections were normalized by assay of β-galactosidase activity elicited by co-transfection with pCMV-βGAL. All data were analyzed by Student's t test, and a p value of ≤0.05 is considered significant. Real Time PCR—BSEP message levels were quantitated by real time PCR on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection Systems Analyzer using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR kit from Qiagen as described previously (13Plass J.R. Mol O. Heegsma J. Geuken M. Faber K.N. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) by using the following BSEP primers: forward, 5′-acatgcttgcgaggaccttta-3′; reverse, 5′-ggaggttcgtgcaccaggta-3′. 18 S levels were quantitated using the ribosomal control reagent kit from Applied Biosystems according to manufacturer's directions. CT values for each sample were normalized by subtracting the CT value for 18 S from the obtained CT values, i.e. ΔCT sample = CT experimental–CT18 S. Fold change in BSEP mRNA over untreated control (which was set to 1) was obtained by the comparative method as 2–Δ(–ΔCTSample) (Applied Biosystems, User Bulletin 2). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfection of HepG2 cells were performed on 1 × 105 cells/cm2 in 10-cm diameter dishes as described previously (6Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) with a total of 5 μg of pSG5.HA plasmid encoding wild-type or mutants of human CARM1 as described previously (27Teyssier C. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46066-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transfections or co-transfections with pSG5HA-GRIP1 were also performed similarly. All transfections were performed by cationic liposome-mediated transfection using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. All remaining steps using immunoprecipitation Western blots were described previously (28Li S. Moy L. Pittman N. Shue G. Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7803-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of immunoprecipitated cellular lysates were performed using 20% of the total immunoprecipitated material from transfected cells and were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was carried out with mouse monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope tag (CA18-A) or with an antibody against the respective antigens for FXR or GST. CARM1 Reactions—Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation in microtubes washed four times in MLB buffer and finally resuspended in MTS buffer (containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Methyltransferase assays were conducted on 3 μg of purified histone H3 (Roche Applied Science) or on GST fusions with wild-type and with mutated human histone H3 in which specific residues were mutated as indicated in the figure legend. Some of these reagents were supplied as gifts (Y. Shinkai, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, and T. Kouzarides, Cambridge University/Wellcome Trust UK Cancer Research Institute, Cambridge, UK) and are described previously (12Bauer U.M. Daujat S. Nielsen S.J. Nightingale K. Kouzarides T.

Purified and glutathione agarose-purified histone H3 proteins were incubated with individual immunoprecipitates as shown (Fig. 2) with 2 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number CFA360) in 30 μl of MTS buffer for 45 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of a protein gel loading buffer containing 6 m urea and SDS and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and fluorographed. Corresponding immunoblots indicative of the input used for each of the mutations tested were confirmed against the GST tag. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were as described previously (31Xu W. Cho H. Evans R.M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 205-223PubMed Google Scholar) but are also briefly described here. Essentially, HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cell/cm2 in 30-cm diameter plates (∼60% confluent). Cells were then transfected with the HA-tagged CARM1 expression vector. Cells were cross-linked in a solution containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction was then terminated by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.1 m. Cells were washed several times in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the resuspension into buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation followed by lysis in a nuclear lysate resuspension buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA and 1% IGEPAL (Sigma; catalog number I-3021). Nuclear lysates were sonicated, and the chromatin was collected by standard CsCl centrifugation of DNA. DNA-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against five changes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA and were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until needed. Immunoprecipitations used an equivalent amount of chromatin in each case incubated with the purified antibody. Immunoprecipitated material was collected with protein A/G-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and washed sequentially first with a low salt-immune complex wash buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and then a high salt-immune complex wash buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) using manufacturer's recommended procedures. Residual DNA was eluted by addition of 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3, and the cross-linking reactions were reversed by heating the mixture to 65 °C for 8 h. The DNA was recovered from immunoprecipitated material by proteinase K treatment at 65 °C for 1 h followed by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspension into 50 μl of nuclease-free water. DNA was recovered from a percentage of chromatin after proteinase K digestion and phenol chloroform extraction as a control. Amplification of specific regions of BSEP promoter was performed by PCR with DNA recovered from immunoprecipitations and performed using three dilutions of DNA containing 2, 1, and 0.5 μl with 34 cycles of amplification. The primers selected for PCR are as follows: Bsep site 1, (forward) 5′-tttcccaagcacactctgtgttt-3′, and (reverse) 5′-gaggaagccagaggaaataatgg-3′; Bsep site 2, (forward) 5′-ccacatgcttattt-gactcaa-3′, and (reverse) 5′-gattgctcttggaaaatccc-3′. PCRs were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet light transillumination. For quantitative real time PCR, DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of water and 2 μl used from each sample with Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR kit from Qiagen as described previously. All chromatin immunoprecipitates analyzed by real time PCR were performed at least three times, and the difference for the mean was less than ∼15%. Three microliters of PCR were extracted at 24, 34, and 40 complete cycles for visualization on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The values indicated represent specific binding efficiency (total nanograms detected with antibody and PCR minus the nanogram quantity detected with a control rabbit serum and PCR) as a fraction of total DNA input. Values represent S.D. from the mean. FXR Is Associated with H3 Histone Methyltransferase Activity in Vivo—To determine whether histone H3 methyltransferase activity is associated with FXR, we tested a number of immunoprecipitates from HepG2 cells cotransfected with expression vectors for the FXR and CARM1 cDNAs. We used a recombinant HA-tagged CARM1 as one of a number of candidate arginine methyltransferases to monitor methyltransferase activity associated with FXR. Results shown in Fig. 1 (panel A) demonstrate that the expression of FXR is accompanied with histone methyltransferase activity (shown in the last lane). Methyltransferase activity on histone H3 was confirmed by the immunoprecipitation of transfected HA-tagged CARM1 with an anti-HA and anti-CARM1 antisera. Although robust methyltransferase activity was identified and expected with anti-HA and anti-CARM1 antisera, significant levels of histone H3 methyltransferase activity were retained by anti-FXR antisera. Additionally, we tested the immunoprecipitates for GRIP1, because GRIP1 was shown previously to interact directly with CARM1 (20Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Results shown demonstrate significant histone H3 methyltransferase associated with the anti-GRIP1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1). These results suggest that histone H3 methyltransferase expression is associated with FXR. To determine the amino acid substrate position of methyltransferase activity associated with FXR, we used affinity-purified GST-tagged human histone H3 as substrate. Wild-type histone H3 and mutated H3 with mutations at specific arginine and lysine residues along the NH2-terminal axis of histone H3 were used. In these mutants, the lysines at residues 9 and 4 were replaced with arginines. Arginine at position 17 was replaced with lysine. Recombinant GST-tagged histone H3 was affinity-purified and used in an in vitro histone methyltransferase activity assay. Results indicate that a majority of histone methyltransferase activity is conferred onto the wild-type histone H3 protein with immunoprecipitated HA-tagged CARM1, Fig. 1 (panel B, 1st lane). However, significant histone H3 methyltransferase activity was retained from immunoprecipitates of nuclear lysates with an anti-FXR antiserum (Fig.1, panel B, 2nd lane). The effect of each of the mutations was compared by the intensity of the labeling of the GST-tagged histone H3 mutant by [methyl-14C]AdoMet and immunoprecipitates of FXR. The replacement of arginine 17 with a lysine failed to label as intensely with [methyl-14C]AdoMet when compared with either the wild-type or with a replacement at lysine 9. Most interestingly, the replacement of lysine 4 also caused a significant loss in the signal of labeled GST-tagged histone H3. This result suggests that FXR may also be associated with methylation directed at lysine 4. We demonstrate that the majority of the methylation of histone H3 from immunoprecipitates of nuclear lysates by anti FXR likely exists within arginine 17 and lysine 4. The Association of FXR and CARM1 within the BSEP Locus—Because of the methyltransferase activity associated with FXR, we wanted to determine whether CARM1 is directly associated with FXR in vivo. Plasmids expressing various deletions of the HA-tagged CARM1 cDNA were introduced into the HepG2 cells by transfection. Results shown in Fig. 2 (panel A, upper panel) demonstrate the association of FXR with HA-tagged full-length CARM1 from an immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Immunoblots of the anti-HA immunoprecipitates were performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-FXR antisera. To determine whether expression of the various CARM1 deletions was achieved in HepG2 cells, the total input levels of nuclear lysates from the same transfected HepG2 cells used in the immunoprecipitation reaction were immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2, panel A, lower panel). Results demonstrate that FXR is associated with the HA-tagged full-length CARM1 protein. The association of FXR with the CARM1 protein appears to extend into the region between amino acids 3 and 460, which also appear to accommodate the primary arginine methyltransferase activity of CARM1 (27Teyssier C. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46066-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Removal of the central region of CARM1 abrogates the association of CARM1 with FXR in vivo. The NH2-terminal or the COOH-terminal regions are not sufficient to establish an association with FXR. This suggests that the histone methyltransferase activity and the motif(s) for association with FXR are encoded within the central region of CARM1 (27Teyssier C. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46066-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because we had established that the association between FXR and CARM1 exists in vivo, we explored the prospect that a well characterized target gene of FXR, BSEP, may also be a target of CARM1 action. To answer this question, we used ChIP studies to verify the occupation of the human BSEP l"

It has been reported that protein kinase C plays a role in the sensitization of VR1. Protein kinase D/PKCμ is a member of the protein kinase D serine/threonine kinase family that exhibits structural, enzymological, and regulatory features distinct from those of the PKCs, with which they are related. As part of our effort to optimize conditions for evaluating VR1 pharmacology, we found that treatment of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells heterologously expressing rat VR1 (CHO/rVR1) with butyrate enhanced rVR1 expression and activity. The expression of PKCμ and PKCβ1, but not of other PKC isoforms, was also enhanced by butyrate treatment, suggesting the possibility that these two isoforms might contribute to the enhanced activity of rVR1. In support of this hypothesis, we found the following. 1) Overexpression of PKCμ enhanced the response of rVR1 to capsaicin and low pH, and expression of a dominant negative variant of PKCμ reduced the response of rVR1. 2) Reduction of endogenous PKCμ using antisense oligonucleotides decreased the response of exogenous rVR1 expressed in CHO cells as well as of endogenous rVR1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons. 3) PKCμ localized to the plasma membrane when overexpressed in CHO/rVR1 cells. 4) PKCμ directly bound to rVR1 expressed in CHO cells as well as to endogenous rVR1 in dorsal root ganglia or to an N-terminal fragment of rVR1, indicating a direct interaction between PKCμ and rVR1. 5) PKCμ directly phosphorylated rVR1 or a longer N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–118) of rVR1 but not a shorter one (amino acids 1–99). 6) Mutation of S116A in rVR1 blocked both the phosphorylation of rVR1 by PKCμ and the enhancement by PKCμ of the rVR1 response to capsaicin.

VR1 is expressed on small diameter neurons within sensory ganglia and accounts for the highly selective action of vanilloids as excitatory agents for nociceptors. In addition to vanilloids, heat and protons also influence vanilloid receptors and nociceptive pathways, and VR1 thus can be viewed as a molecular integrator of chemical and physical stimuli that elicit pain (1Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Following tissue injury, the magnitude of VR1 responses is modulated by the combined effects of protons, temperature, endogenous ligands, and signaling pathways, and this modulation of VR1 activity contributes to the sensitization of nociceptors associated with the development of allodynia and hyperalgesia (2Di Marzo V. Blumberg P.M. Szallasi A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Current evidence implicates multiple signaling pathways in the modulation of VR1. PKA reduces vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1) desensitization and directly phosphorylates VR1 (3Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau IV, R.W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). PKCα contributes to VR1 activation by pH (4Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35752-35759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and PKCϵ both directly phosphorylates VR1 and is implicated in the development of hyperalgesia (19Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Finally, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation increases the level of VR1 and maintains hyperalgesia to heat (5Ji R.R. Samad T.A. Jin S.X. Schmoll R. Woolf C.J. Neuron. 2002; 36: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). PKD/PKCμ, PKD3/PKCν, and PKD2 represent a class of diacylglycerol-responsive protein kinases related to but distinct from the PKCs. Features distinguishing the PKD/PKCμ family members from the PKCs include a catalytic domain that is distantly related to the calmodulin kinase domain while showing little similarity to the highly conserved PKC catalytic domain, the presence of a pleckstrin homology domain, the lack of a pseudosubstrate domain, and the lack of a C2 domain. In addition, the tandem C1 domains, which account for the recognition of diacylglycerol and the phorbol esters, are more widely separated than in the PKCs (6Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The regulation of PKD/PKCμ is distinct from that of the PKCs. In the case of the PKCs, binding of diacylglycerol/phorbol ester to the C1 domain induces a conformational change in the enzyme, removing the pseudosubstrate inhibitory region from the catalytic site and thereby activating the enzyme. In addition, by completing the hydrophobic surface on the C1 domain, the bound diacylglycerol/phorbol ester drives the membrane association of the PKC. The localization of the PKC, in turn, determines which of its possible substrates are accessible for phosphorylation. In the case of PKD/PKCμ, the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester has two distinct effects. First, the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester activates the PKCs, which phosphorylate PKD/PKCμ and lead to its activation. This state of activation of phosphorylated PKD is maintained during cell disruption and immunoprecipitation, whereas for PKCs, their in vitro activity remains dependent on the presence of lipid cofactors (7Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Second, by binding to the C1 domains of PKD/PKCμ, the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester drives the membrane association of the PKD/PKCμ (8Johannes F.J. Hausser A. Storz P. Truckenmuller L. Link G. Kawakami T. Pfizenmaier K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Selective protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation of unique downstream effectors are likely to form the basis of isotype-specific functions. Each PKC family member shows an optimal substrate consensus sequence. PKD/PKCμ, in particular, has substrate specificity very different from PKC isoforms. These substrates include phosphatidylinositol kinases (9Nishikawa K. Toker A. Wong K. Marignani P.A. Johannes F.J. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

As part of our effort to optimize conditions for evaluating VR1 pharmacology, we found that treatment with butyrate of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells heterologously expressing VR1 (CHO/rVR1) enhanced rVR1 expression and activity. Butyrate is known to function as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase and affects the transcription of some genes. We found that the expression of PKCμ and PKCβ1, but not other PKC isoforms, was also enhanced by butyrate treatment, raising the possibility that these two isoforms might contribute to the enhanced activity of rVR1. In support of this hypothesis, we found that PKCμ directly bound to and phosphorylated rVR1. Overexpression of PKCμ enhanced rVR1 activity, and reduced expression of PKCμ by means of antisense oligonucleotides or inhibition of its function through a dominant negative mutant of PKCμ reduced rVR1 activity. We conclude that PKCμ functions as a direct modulator of VR1. Materials—[γ-33P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, 37 GBq = 1 mCi) was obtained from ICN (Irvine, CA), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Anti-capsaicin receptor antibody was from Calbiochem. PKCμ (C-20) and PKCβ1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody was from Roche Applied Science. GST antibody was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture reagents and Lipofectamine were obtained from Invitrogen. Preparation and Subculture of Cells Stably Expressing Rat VR1— CHO cells stably transfected with rat VR1 in a pTet off regulatory system were described previously (14Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this system, expression of the rVR1 is repressed in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) but is induced upon removal of the antibiotic (14Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For radioligand binding experiments, cells were seeded in T75 cell culture flasks in the culture medium with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and Geneticin (0.25 mg/ml). After 2 days, the culture medium was changed to medium without tetracycline, and the cells were grown for an additional 48 h to induce rVR1 expression. The flasks were washed with PBS, and the cells were harvested in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. The cells were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and stored at -20 °C until assayed. For assay of 45Ca2+ uptake, cells were seeded into 24-well plates in medium with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and Geneticin (0.25 mg/ml). After 1 day, the culture medium was changed to medium without tetracycline, and the cells were grown for an additional 48 h to induce rVR1 expression. For calcium imaging, cells were grown on round glass coverslips (25 mm). DRG Neuron Isolation and Culture—2–3-Week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided by the Institute of Animal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University Health Science Center. Rats were killed by decapitation under CO2 anesthesia. The spinal columns were removed aseptically, and dorsal root ganglia from all levels were dissected out and collected in DMEM containing 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 25 mm HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Ganglia were digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) and 0.125 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then fetal bovine serum was added to terminate the digestion. The ganglia were triturated through a flame-polished Pasteur pipette to form a single cell suspension. Cells were then washed three times with DMEM and resuspended in the same medium, and the number of viable cells was determined. Cells were plated in 10 μg/ml polylysine-coated coverslips and treated with 10-5m cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) for 24 h. They were then cultured for 2 days in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 ng/ml mouse submaxillary gland 2.5S nerve growth factor (Sigma) before being used for experiments. 45Ca2+Uptake—CHO/rVR1 cells or DRG neurons were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in DMEM without serum, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μCi/well 45Ca2+, and capsaicin as indicated. To determine the heat dependence of 45Ca2+ uptake, cells were incubated for 5 min at 44 °C in the medium specified above. To determine the pH dependence of 45Ca2+ uptake, cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of Dulbecco's modified PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS) supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μCi/well 45Ca2+, and various concentrations of the different compounds, adjusted to the indicated pH with 1 m MES (Sigma). After incubation, cells were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and lysed in 400 μl/well radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) for 20 min. Aliquots of the solubilized cell extracts were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Imaging of Intracellular Calcium Levels ([Ca2+]i)—CHO/rVR1 cells or DRG neurons grown on coverslips were loaded with Fura-2/AM (10 μm) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 10 min at 37 °C and an additional 50 min at room temperature (for CHO/rVR1 cells), washed, and then incubated at room temperature for at least an additional 1 h. For imaging, the coverslips were placed in a chamber at room temperature. Images of Fura-2-loaded cells with the excitation wavelength alternating between 340 and 380 nm were captured using a Cohu 4915 low light CCD camera on an InCyt Dual-wavelength Fluorescence Imaging and Photometry System (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). The ratio of fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths was calculated and plotted as a function of time. Treatment of Cells with Oligonucleotides—Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. The antisense sequence used was 5′-GAC CGG AGG GGC GCT CAT-3′ for PKCμ based on the start codon (ATG) plus the 15 additional downstream bases in the human PKCμ sequence. The sequences of sense and missense were 5′-ATG AGC GCC CCT CCG GTC-3′ and GCA GCA CAT CGC ATC GAC-3′, respectively (15Chandrasekher G. Bazan N.G. Bazan H.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CHO/rVR1 cells or DRG neurons were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer with minor modifications. Briefly, for CHO/rVR1 cells, 1 day before transfection, 1 × 105 cells/well were plated into 24-well plates in 0.5 ml of growth medium without antibiotics so that they were 30–50% confluent at the time of transfection. For transfection, the oligonucleotide-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes were prepared as follows (per well). 20 pmol of oligonucleotide was diluted in 50 μl of Opti-MEM® I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and gently mixed. Lipofectamine 2000 (1 μl) was added to 50 μl of Opti-MEM® I medium and mixed gently. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the diluted oligonucleotide was combined with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000, mixed, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow the oligonucleotide-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes to form. The 100 μl of oligonucleotide-Lipofectamine 2000 complex were then added to the well and mixed gently by rocking the plate back and forth. Oligonucleotide incubation medium was replaced every 12 h for 48 h. For DRG neurons, isolated DRG neurons were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h of culture at 37 °C, the DRG neurons were transfected with oligonucleotide following the same procedure as was used for the CHO/rVR1 cells. Subcloning of PKCμ and Mutagenesis of PKCμ and rVR1—The human PKCμ cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK(±) vector was the kind gift of Dr. K. Pfizenmaier (Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology, University of Stuttgart, Germany). To generate the GFP fusion construct, PKCμ was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the XhoI-MluI site of a pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) modified by inserting a MluI linker into the plasmid digested with SmaI. The kinase-inactive D727A PKCμ was prepared by mutating an aspartic acid in the 727-position to an alanine in the pEGFP-N1-PKCμ plasmid, and the GFPrVR1S116A was prepared by mutating a serine in the 116-position to an alanine in the pEGFP-N3-rVR1 plasmid. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutation was confirmed by sequencing performed by the DNA minicore, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Generation of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-rVR1 Fusion Protein—To generate N-terminal GST-tagged rVR1 (amino acids 1–838), we have used the Gateway system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. rVR1 was amplified by PCR from the pEGFP-N3-rVR1 plasmid (16Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pDONR201 and pDEST27 vectors. The cytoplasmic N-terminal domains (amino acids 1–99, 1–118, and 1–432, respectively) and C-terminal domain (amino acids 686–838) were obtained using the same procedure. The constructs were verified by sequencing (sequence identical with AF-029310). The rat VR1-GST fusion proteins were expressed in CHO cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with cold DPBS (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free), harvested in PBS with proteinase inhibitor (proteinase inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science), sonicated, and added to the same volume of detergent mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate with proteinase inhibitor and 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoetanol). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2–3 h and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was added to glutathione-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). After being rotated overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with 2× diluted detergent mixture (same as above) containing β-mercaptoethanol and then washed twice with PBS containing β-mercaptoethanol (0.1%, v/v). The fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm NaF, and proteinase inhibitor mixture. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 5% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then probed with a primary antibody against the specific protein, washed four times with 0.2% Tween 20 in TBS, and then subjected to a second incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000; Bio-Rad). Bands were visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were polyclonal anti-capsaicin receptor antibody (1:100; Calbiochem), a polyclonal anti-PKCμ (C-20) antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Roche Applied Science), and a monoclonal anti-GST antibody (1:1000; Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Binding—GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μg of recombinant PKCμ (Calbiochem) in TBS buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with incubation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and processed for 4–20% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred and detected sequentially using a polyclonal anti-PKCμ antibody and a monoclonal anti-GST antibody on the same blot. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize bands. Co-immunoprecipitation between rVR1 and PKCμ in the rVR1 Heterologous Expression System—GFPrVR1 and GFP empty vector were transfected into CHO cells individually using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and then lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm NaF, and proteinase inhibitor mixture. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated with either 5 μl of anti-GFP (1:100) monoclonal antibody, or mouse control IGG at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the samples, and the incubation was continued for a further 3 h, after which samples were washed three times with TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. Separated proteins were transferred and detected sequentially using a polyclonal anti-PKCμ antibody and a monoclonal anti-GST antibody on the same blot. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize bands. For multiple detection with different antibodies, blots were first stripped in a solution of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% SDS for 20–30 min at 50 °C and washed twice for 15 min with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, followed by blocking and incubation with a new primary antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation between rVR1 and PKCμ in the Endogenous DRG System—2–3-Week-old rats were killed by decapitation under CO2 anesthesia. The spinal columns were removed aseptically, and dorsal root ganglia from all levels were dissected out and homogenized in lysis buffer as above. After being rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated with either 5 μl of anti-PKCμ (1:100) polyclonal antibody or rabbit control IGG at 4 °C for 12 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the samples and the incubation was continued for a further 12 h, after which samples were washed six times with TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. The subsequent steps were similar to those with the heterologous rVR1 system. Phosphorylation Reactions—Phosphorylation by PKCμ of rVR1 and different N-terminal fragments was assessed following immunoprecipitation. Cultured CHO cells were treated with 100 nm PMA or control solvent (Me2SO; 0.1% (v/v) final concentration) for 20 min and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer. PKCμ was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with PKCμ (C-20) antibody (1:100) at 4 °C for 3 h. Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with assay buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The final pellet was resuspended in assay buffer to yield a total volume of 40 μl. To initiate the phosphorylation reaction, 10 μl of phosphorylation mix (assay buffer containing GSTrVR1 or the GSTrVR1 N-terminal fragments or GST alone (10 μg/ml) and 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP) was added. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Visualization by Confocal Microscopy of GFPPKCμ Translocation— Prior to observation, CHO/rVR1 cells were cultured on 40-mm round coverslips in the culture medium with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and Geneticin (0.25 mg/ml). 24 h later, GFPPKCμ was transiently transfected into the cells with Lipofectamine Plus reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After a 4-h incubation with the DNA and Lipofectamine complex, the medium was replaced with CHO/rVR1-inducing culture medium with Geneticin (0.25 mg/ml) without tetracycline at 35 or 37 °C for a further 48 h. Before the measurement, the coverslips were introduced into the microscope chamber system, which was connected to a temperature controller set to 37 °C, and medium was perfused through the chamber with a model P720 microperfusion pump (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The images of the cells were collected at 1-min intervals using LaserSharp software through a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a 60× planapochromat lens. A krypton-argon gas laser provided excitation at 488 nm with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence. Butyrate, a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, Enhanced the Activity of rVR1 and PKCμ Expression—Sodium butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Histone acetylation influences the higher order structure of chromatin, resulting in a chromatin conformation that is more accessible to transcription factors and leading to enhanced transcription of some genes (17Arts J. Lansink M. Grimbergen J. Toet K.H. Kooistra T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As part of our effort to optimize conditions for evaluating VR1 pharmacology, we have found that butyrate can influence the function of VR1. Expression of rVR1 was induced in CHO/rVR1 cells by a change of medium to medium without tetracycline either in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate (10 μm). The butyrate dramatically enhanced the functional activity of rVR1 as evidenced by increased uptake of 45Ca2+ in response to capsaicin, low pH (pH 5.5), and high temperature (44 °C) (Fig. 1A). Likewise, the level of expression of rVR1 increased, as did that of PKCμ (Fig. 1B) and PKCβ1 (data not shown); the level of expression of other PKC isoforms was not changed. Because of the reported effects of PKA and several PKC isoforms on rVR1 activity (3Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau IV, R.W.

https://openalex.org/W2155027734,"The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and alterations of their phenotype are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Arterial wall injury induces the expression of proto-oncogenes, leading to the proliferation of VSMCs. In particular, c-Myc and c-Myb play a central role in cell cycle progression and are essential for VSMC replication. The protooncogene Pim-1 cooperates with c-Myc and enhances the transcriptional activity of c-Myb in hematopoietic cells, suggesting that Pim-1 is involved in cell cycle regulation. The aim of this study was to examine the possible involvement of Pim-1 in VSMC proliferation. Pim-1 was substantially induced in neointimal VSMCs of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, and in vivo infection with a dominant negative Pim-1-expressing adenovirus (Ad-DN-Pim-1) markedly suppressed neointima formation and cell cycle progression in the balloon-injured arteries. In cultured VSMCs, treatment with serum or H2O2 induced Pim-1 expression, and H2O2- or serum-stimulated cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis were almost completely inhibited by DN-Pim-1 overexpression. Furthermore, we performed immunohisto-chemical staining for Pim-1 in human thoracic aortas and coronary arteries obtained from six individuals at autopsy and found that Pim-1-positive cells are observed predominantly in the thickened intima of the aortas and coronary arteries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing Pim-1 expression in rodent and human arterial walls. To summarize, Pim-1 expression was observed in the neointima of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries and in human thoracic aortas and coronary arteries showing intimal thickening, and the specific inhibition of Pim-1 function markedly suppressed neointima formation after balloon injury and the proliferation of cultured VSMCs, suggesting that Pim-1 plays a role in VSMC proliferation. The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and alterations of their phenotype are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Arterial wall injury induces the expression of proto-oncogenes, leading to the proliferation of VSMCs. In particular, c-Myc and c-Myb play a central role in cell cycle progression and are essential for VSMC replication.

Injury of the arterial wall initiates the synthesis and release of numerous mitogens and the rapid induction of proto-oncogenes, leading to the proliferation of VSMCs. In particular, c-Myc and c-Myb have been found to play a central role in cell cycle progression and to be essential for VSMC replication, which has been demonstrated by various in vitro and in vivo studies (4Bauters C. de Groote P.

Cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases are also important regulators of cell proliferation; it has been shown that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 blocks VSMC proliferation and inhibits neointima formation after injury (13Chang M.W.

Acta. 2002; 1593: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and that the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 is regulated downstream of Pim-1 (25Rahman Z. Yoshikawa H. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. Immunol.

In addition, functional analysis by RNA interference in embryonic stem cells has recently demonstrated that Pim-1 is required for their differentiation into endothelial cells and VSMCs (26Zippo A. Robertis A. Bardelli M. Galvagni F. Oliviero S. Blood. 2004; 103: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Pim-1 expression is observed in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries and human coronary arteries and that dominant negative Pim-1 markedly suppresses VSMC proliferation in the balloon-injured model and in a cell culture system.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—An adenovirus was designed to express a dominant negative Pim-1 in which lysine 67 in the ATP binding domain was replaced by methionine, resulting in inactivation of its kinase domain (7Miano J.M. Tota R.R. Vlasic N. Danishefsky K.J. Stemerman M.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 761-765PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang Z. Bhattacharya N. Mixter P.F. Wei W. Sedivy J. Magnuson N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1593: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-expressing dominant negative Pim-1 (Ad-DN-Pim-1) was prepared using the Adeno-X Expression System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 6× c-Myc-tagged DN-Pim-1 cDNA was cloned into a shuttle vector, and then the resultant plasmid was cloned into the PI-SceI/I-CeuI sites of the pAdeno-X adenoviral vector. After transfection of the adenovirus plasmids into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the adenovirus particles were propagated in the cells and purified on a cesium chloride gradient followed by extensive dialysis. The titer of the virus stock was assessed by a plaque formation assay using 293 cells and expressed as plaque-forming units. We also prepared two control adenoviruses, namely Ad-LacZ, expressing bacterial β-galactosidase, and Ad-GFP, expressing green fluorescent protein.Rat Carotid Artery Balloon Injury Model—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 300–350 g at 9 to10 weeks of age; Clea Japan, Tokyo Japan) anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) were subjected to balloon angioplasty of the left common carotid artery by dilatation with a balloon catheter (2F Fogarty; Baxter) three times, and then 50 μl of Ad-DN-Pim-1 or a control virus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) (1 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) was injected into a 10-mm segment of the distal common carotid artery over a period of 20 min by using a 24-gauge intravenous catheter. The solution was then retrieved, the catheter removed, and blood circulation restored. Fourteen days after balloon injury, rats were killed, and the right and left common carotid arteries were excised and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis. Five arterial segments 2 mm in length were obtained, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm-thick slices. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining for Pim-1 and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed as follows. After blocking with 10% normal serum (Vector), sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-Pim-1 goat polyclonal IgG antibody (C-20), anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody (PC 10), or anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody from the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector). Positive signals were visualized by incubating with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate (Vector). For the double immunostaining for Pim-1 and α-smooth muscle actin, anti-α-smooth muscle actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A4) (DAKO) was used as a primary antibody, and α-smooth muscle actin was visualized with fuchsin red. To confirm the expression of GFP in treated arteries, representative common carotid artery segments were embedded in frozen section media (OCT medium, Tissue-Tek) and sectioned (5 μm) for fluorescent microscopy examination.Western Blot Analysis—Fifty micrograms of protein extracted from cultured VSMCs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a specific primary antibody (anti-Pim-1 (C-20), anti-c-Myc (9E10), or anti-β-galactosidase (Sigma)) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the results were quantified by densitometry.Morphometric Analysis—Morphometric analysis of a cross-sectional section of carotid arteries stained with hematoxylin and eosin was performed with an automated computer-based image-analyzing software package (NIH image) by a single investigator (K. S.) who was blinded to the treatment protocol. To evaluate thickening of the neointima, the areas encroached by the external elastic lamina (EEL area), the internal elastic lamina (IEL area), and the lumen area were measured. The medial area, the neointimal area, and the neointima-to-media ratio were calculated as follows: medial area = EEL area - IEL area; neointimal area = IEL area - lumen area; neointima-to-media ratio = neointimal area/medial area.Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End-labeling (TUNEL) Assay—Perfusion-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained for apoptotic nuclei with an in situ apoptosis detection Kit (Takara). In brief, after treatment with proteinase K, slides were incubated with a TUNEL reaction mixture, treated with converter-peroxidase solution, and exposed to diaminobenzidine black nickel chromagen. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and analyzed by a light microscopy for total and TUNEL-positive cells.Culture and Stimulation of VSMCs—VSMCs were grown from explants of 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rat aortic arteries and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and 20% (primary cultures) or 10% (passaged cells) fetal calf serum (FCS). The VSMCs were used for experiments at passages <5. The identity of the smooth muscle cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry for smooth muscle cell α-actin. Synchronous populations of quiescent cells were obtained by placing cultures in media that contained 0.5% FCS for 48 h. Cells were then infected with adenovirus (Ad-DN-Pim-1 or Ad-LacZ) diluted in starvation medium at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with the addition of serum mitogens (10% FCS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) or H2O2 (5 or 10 μm).Immunocytochemistry—VSMCs were cultured onto Lab-Tek tissue culture chamber slides (Invitrogen), fixed in ice-cold methanol, quenched using bovine serum albumin, and incubated with a specific primary antibody (anti-Pim-1 (C-20) or anti-c-Myc (9E10 epitope)) for 2 h. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, stained cells were examined using fluorescence microscopy.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from VSMCs before and after treatment with 200 μm H2O2. Twenty micrograms of the total RNA was size-fractionated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane. The probes used were 32P-labeled Pim-1 cDNA (1 kb; EcoRI-XhoI fragment). After hybridization with the labeled probes at 42 °C, the membrane was washed twice with 2× sodium chloride-sodium citrate (1 × SSC, 15 mm sodium citrate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), which contained 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 °C for 60 min and was then washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography was performed using an intensifying screen at -80 °C, and the exposure time was varied so that the band intensity was kept within the linear range.Determination of DNA Synthesis—Relative rates of DNA synthesis were assessed by the determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Rat VSMCs (5 × 103 cells) were plated per well of a 24-well plate in growth medium. Quiescent cells were then stimulated with serum or H2O2. The cells were exposed to [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 μCi/ml for the last 4 h of the 24-hour stimulation period. The cells were then incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 20 min, dissolved in 1 n NaOH at 37 °C for 20 min and then neutralized. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated on VSMCs isolated from several separate donors.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Stage—After detachment with 0.25% trypsin, VSMCs were resuspended, fixed in 70% ethanol, stained in a solution of phosphate-buffered saline, propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), and RNase A (500 μg/ml), and measured with a FACScan apparatus (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed for cell cycle distribution using the ModFitLT program.Thoracic Aortas and Coronary Arteries from Individuals at Autopsy— Thoracic aortas were obtained at autopsy from three individuals aged 73 (case 1), 45 (case 2), and 35 years (case 3) whose causes of death were acute myocardial infarction (case 1 and case 2) and dilated cardiomyopathy (case 3). Coronary arteries were obtained at autopsy from three individuals aged 62 (case 4), 83 (case 5), and 32 years (case 6) whose causes of death were acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm, and primary pulmonary hypertension, respectively. The study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient's bereaved relative.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data between two groups were compared by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test, and data between more than two groups were compared by a one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSPim-1 Expression in Balloon-injured Rat Carotid Arteries—To examine the possible involvement of Pim-1 in the progression of atherosclerosis, immunohistochemical staining for Pim-1 was performed in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. We first examined whether the expression of Pim-1 is induced in the arterial wall. As shown in Fig. 1, 14 days after balloon injury neointima formation was clearly visible, and Pim-1 expression was substantially induced in the neointima of injured arteries but not in the control uninjured artery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the expression of Pim-1 in the vascular wall.Inhibition of Pim-1 Activity Attenuates Neointima Formation—To examine the possible role of Pim-1 in smooth muscle cell proliferation, we evaluated the effect of the suppression of Pim-1 activity on neointima formation after balloon injury. For this purpose, we prepared adenovirus-expressing dominant negative Pim-1 (Ad-DN-Pim-1) and control adenovirus-expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) and delivered 50 μl of each adenovirus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) to balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Fig. 2A, top, shows a representative balloon-injured rat carotid artery 14 days after Ad-GFP infection. As revealed by the GFP signal in this fluorescence micrograph, many neointimal cells were infected after exposure to the adenovirus. Immunostaining of balloon-injured arteries after Ad-DN-Pim-1 infection revealed that DN-Pim-1 expression was induced in neointimal smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2A, bottom). Expression of the DN-Pim-1 protein was also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). Fig. 3A shows a representative rat carotid artery 14 days after balloon injury. In the injured artery exposed to saline or Ad-GFP, a significant concentric neointima was observed with the medium clearly defined by the internal and external elastic laminae (neointimal cross-sectional area for saline treated was 0.12 ± 0.05 mm2, and for Ad-GFP treated it was 0.12 ± 0.06 mm2) (n = 6). Overexpression of DN-Pim-1 resulted in marked suppression of the neointimal cross-sectional area (0.04 ± 0.02 mm2)(n = 6). The intima/medium ratio in arteries exposed to Ad-DN-Pim-1 (0.29 ± 0.10) was also significantly less than in arteries exposed to either saline (0.88 ± 0.37) or Ad-GFP (0.85 ± 0.26). There was no significant difference in the medial area (Fig. 3B). In addition, to elucidate the mechanism for the suppression of neointima formation in Ad-DN-Pim-1-treated arteries we examined the effect of DN-Pim-1 overexpression on the cell proliferation rate. Many PCNA-positive cells were observed in Ad-GFP-treated arteries but not in Ad-DN-Pim-1-treated arteries (Fig. 4). In addition, because it has recently reported that Pim-1 could regulate apoptosis (27Aho T.L.T. Sandholm J. Peltola K.J. Mankonen H.P. Lilly M. Koskinen P.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we performed a TUNEL assay to examine whether the effects of DN-Pim-1 in our present study relate to an increase of apoptosis. In contrast to the decrease in the number of PCNA-positive cells, the number of apoptotic cells was very low in both GFP-treated and DN-Pim-1-treated balloon-injured rat carotid arteries; the number of apoptotic cells was not increased at all even after treatment with DN-Pim-1 (data not shown). Thus, although practically it was very difficult to perform quantitative analysis because of the very low frequency of apoptosis, it is likely that the suppression of neointima formation by DN-Pim-1 is due to the reduction of cell proliferation rather than increased apoptosis.Fig. 2Adenovirus-mediated expression of GFP and DN-Pim-1 in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Ad-DN-Pim-1 and Ad-GFP were prepared, and 50 μl of each adenovirus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) was delivered to balloon-injured rat carotid arteries.

We therefore tested whether Pim-1 expression is regulated by H2O2 or serum stimulation. Cultured VSMCs (passage <5) isolated from 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rat aortic arteries were stimulated with H2O2 or serum. As shown in Fig. 5A, Pim-1 expression was induced by H2O2 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (top) and immunocytochemistry (bottom). Next, to examine whether Pim-1 mRNA level is induced by oxidative stress, we performed Northern blot analysis after H2O2 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5B, induction of Pim-1 mRNA was also observed after H2O2 treatment. Similarly, Pim-1 expression was induced by serum (10% FCS) stimulation (data not shown).Fig. 5Induction of Pim-1 mRNA and protein expression by oxidative stress in rat aortic VSMCs. A, VSMCs isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat aortic arteries were treated with H2O2 (0–10 μm) for 6 h followed by Western blot analysis (top) and fluorescent immunocytochemistry (bottom). B, VSMCs isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat aortic arteries were treated with H2O2 (200 μm) for 0–4 h followed by Northern blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Pim-1 Activity Attenuates Cultured VSMC Proliferation—To further elucidate the role of Pim-1 in VSMC proliferation, we infected isolated rat VSMCs with Ad-DN-Pim-1 (multiplicity of infection of 100). As shown in Fig. 6A, 48 h after exposure to Ad-DN-Pim-1, induction of DN-Pim-1 expression was observed by Western blot analysis. Similarly, after exposure to Ad-LacZ (control virus coding β-galactosidase), β-galactosidase expression was also confirmed. Immunocytochemistry for DN-Pim-1 showed that >95% of cells were positive upon infection with Ad-DN-Pim-1 but negative upon infection with Ad-LacZ or without transfection. In contrast, >95% of cells were X-gal-positive upon infection with Ad-LacZ but negative upon infection with Ad-DN-Pim-1 under the same conditions (Fig. 6B). No toxicity was observed in cell culture by infection of the adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100. We examined whether the induction of DN-Pim-1 affects VSMC proliferation by directly counting cell number. As shown in Fig. 7, DN-Pim-1 expression suppressed serum- or H2O2-stimulated cell proliferation, although no such effect was observed after exposure to Ad-LacZ. As shown in Fig. 8, serum-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was completely suppressed in Ad-DN-Pim-1-treated VSMCs (p < 0.05) but not in Ad-LacZ-treated VSMCs. Similarly, 5 and 10 μm H2O2 induced an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, which was also significantly inhibited by the infection of Ad-DN-Pim-1 or treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine but not by infection of Ad-LacZ. Furthermore, we performed florescence-activated cell sorter analysis to test whether Ad-DN-Pim-1 affected the cell cycle. Whereas serum and H2O2 treatment produced a significantly higher percentage of cells in the S phase and G2-M phase, DN-Pim-1 expression counterbalanced this phenomenon; Ad-DN-Pim-1 infection resulted in a higher percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase and a considerably lower percentage of cells in the S phase (Fig. 9). These results suggest that growth inhibition by DN-Pim-1 overexpression is mainly due to the suppression of cell cycle progression.Fig. 6Adenovirus-mediated expression of β-galactosidase (β-Gal) and DN-Pim-1 in rat aortic VSMCs. Isolated rat VSMCs were infected with Ad-DN-Pim-1 or Ad-LacZ (multiplicity of infection of 100). Forty eight hours after exposure to Ad-DN-Pim-1 or Ad-LacZ, Western blot analysis (A), immuno-staining (B, top row), and X-gal staining (B, bottom row) were performed to confirm the induction of DN-Pim-1 and β-galactosidase expression. More than 95% of cells were positive for DN-Pim-1 upon infection with Ad-DN-Pim-1 but negative upon infection with Ad-LacZ or without infection. In contrast, >95% of cells are X-gal-positive upon infection with Ad-LacZ but"
https://openalex.org/W2042567737,"The mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) are selenoproteins containing a catalytically active selenocysteine residue (Sec) and are important enzymes in cellular redox control. The cotranslational incorporation of Sec, necessary for activity, is governed by a stem-loop structure in the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA and demands adequate selenium availability. The complicated translation machinery required for Sec incorporation is a major obstacle in isolating mammalian cell lines stably overexpressing selenoproteins. In this work we report on the development and characterization of stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells that overexpress enzymatically active selenocysteine-containing cytosolic TrxR1 or mitochondrial TrxR2. We demonstrate that the overexpression of selenium-containing TrxR1 results in lower expression and activity of the endogenous selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase and that the activity of overexpressed TrxRs, rather than the protein amount, can be increased by selenium supplementation in the cell growth media. We also found that the TrxR-overexpressing cells grew slower over a wide range of selenium concentrations, which was an effect apparently not related to increased apoptosis nor to fatally altered intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Most surprisingly, the TrxR1- or TrxR2-overexpressing cells also induced novel expression of the epithelial markers CK18, CK-Cam5.2, and BerEP4, suggestive of a stimulation of cellular differentiation."

Here we show that in normal human T cells, misfolding of MHC-I molecules is turned on upon activation and cell division and is proportional to the level of proliferation. Immunoprecipitation showed that a number of proteins are associated with MHC-I heavy chains at the surface of activated T cells, including the CD8αβ receptor and the chaperone tandem calreticulin/ERp57, associations that rely upon the existence of a pool of HC-10-reactive molecules. Biochemical analysis showed that misfolded MHC-I molecules present at the cell surface are fully glycosylated mature molecules. Importantly, misfolded MHC-I molecules are tyrosine phosphorylated and are associated with kinase activity. In vitro kinase assays followed by reprecipitation indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of the class I heavy chain is probably mediated by a Src tyrosine kinase because Lck was found associated with HC-10 immunocomplexes. Finally, we show that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation by using the Src-family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 resulted in enhanced release of MHC-I heavy chains from the cell surface of activated T cells and a slight down-regulation of cell surface W6/32-reactive molecules. This study provides new insights into the biology of MHC-I molecules and suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in the regulation of MHC-I misfolding and expression.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; β2m, β2-microglobulin; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBL, peripheral blood T lymphocytes; CFSE, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescin diacetate N-succinimidyl ester; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; Endo-H, endoglycosidase H; Gly-F, N-glycanase F.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; β2m, β2-microglobulin; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBL, peripheral blood T lymphocytes; CFSE, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescin diacetate N-succinimidyl ester; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; Endo-H, endoglycosidase H; Gly-F, N-glycanase F. class I molecules are composites of a 44–49-kDa heavy chain, a 12-kDa light chain (β2m), and a 9–11 amino acid peptide (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 2Solheim J.C. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These composites are assembled and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum with the involvement of a growing number of chaperones (3Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Elliott T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Once the complex is properly assembled and folded it follows the exocytic pathway to the cell surface. MHC-I molecules that fail to fold properly are retro-translocated into the cytosol and degraded (4Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition to their well known role in representing peptides to CD8+ T cells, MHC-I molecules are also involved in the regulation of other biological processes in a number of cell types, including T cells. Early reports using soluble antibodies against MHC-I molecules showed inhibition of T cell proliferation induced by mitogens (5De Felice M. Turco M.C. Giarrusso P.C. Corbo L. Pizzano R. Martinelli V.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that ligation of surface MHC-I molecules influenced early as well as late activation events including tyrosine phosphorylation, cell adhesion, and apoptosis (12Bregenholt S. Ropke M. Skov S. Claesson M.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 993-999PubMed Google Scholar, 13Skov S. Bregenholt S. Claesson M.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3189-3196PubMed Google Scholar, 14Skov S. Odum N.

The molecular mechanisms whereby MHC-I molecules are involved in the regulation of intracellular signals are uncertain. Studies by Lipsky and co-workers (16Gur H. el-Zaatari F. Geppert T.D. Wacholtz M.C. Taurog J.D. Lipsky P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggested that the cytoplasmic domain of MHC-I molecules is not needed for signal transduction. At the same time, two interesting studies reported that activated human T cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed MHC-I heavy chains not associated with β2mor misfolded (17Schnabl E. Stockinger H. Majdic O. Gaugitsch H. Lindley I.J. Maurer D. Hajek-Rosenmayr A. Knapp W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Madrigal J.A. Belich M.P.

Based on earlier studies demonstrating the physical association between several cell surface receptors endowed with signaling machinery and MHC-I molecules (19Bushkin Y. Posnett D.N. Pernis B. Wang C.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 458-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Blue M.L. Craig K.A. Anderson P. Branton Jr., K.R. Schlossman S.F.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 3512-3515PubMed Google Scholar), some authors suggested that associations between misfolded MHC-I molecules and cell surface receptors were the basis for the regulation of T cell activation-related events by MHC-I molecules (17Schnabl E. Stockinger H. Majdic O. Gaugitsch H. Lindley I.J. Maurer D. Hajek-Rosenmayr A. Knapp W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Demaria S. Bushkin Y. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1993; 23: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One early study demonstrated that clustering of folded MHC-class I molecules at the cell surface was correlated with the appearance of free heavy chains (24Matko J. Bushkin Y. Wei T. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3353-3360PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent report implicates the clustering of class I molecules in the efficiency of recognition by specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (25Bodnar A. Bacso Z. Jenei A. Jovin T.M. Edidin M. Damjanovich S. Matko J. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), thus linking the presence of misfolded class I molecules at the cell surface with the control of T cell activation. Expression of misfolded MHC-I molecules at the cell surface of activated T cells has been shown to depend on endocytosis of folded MHC-I conformers (26Pickl W.F. Holter W. Stockl J. Majdic O. Knapp W. Immunology. 1996; 88: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic domain of MHC class I molecules contains a tyrosine motif that is involved in endocytosis and is essential for Nef-induced down-modulation of class I molecules (27Lizee G. Basha G. Tiong J. Julien J.P. Tian M. Biron K.E. Jefferies W.A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 28Le Gall S. Buseyne F. Trocha A. Walker B.D. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9256-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of misfolded MHC-I molecules at the cell surface of activated T cells in association with the chaperone calreticulin has been reported suggesting that plasma membrane MHC-I molecules may be subjected to quality control mechanisms (29Arosa F.A. de Jesus O. Porto G. Carmo A.M. de Sousa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16917-16922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite the above studies, data addressing biochemical aspects of the MHC-I cis-associations and their relationship with the misfolding process in normal human T cells are scarce. This is a crucial issue because of studies suggesting: (i) that MHC-I misfolding and involvement in signaling could be associated with trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomes (26Pickl W.F. Holter W. Stockl J. Majdic O. Knapp W. Immunology. 1996; 88: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Capps G.G. Van Kampen M. Ward C.L. Zuniga M.C. J.

Geppert T.D. Lipsky P.E. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and (ii) that a conserved tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain of MHC-I molecules seems to play a crucial role in MHC-I endocytosis under certain pathological situations such as during HIV infection (33Greenberg M.E. Iafrate A.J. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 34Le Gall S. Erdtmann L. Benichou S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L. Benarous R. Heard J.M. Schwartz O.

In this study we present data linking the unfolding of cell surface MHC class I molecules with undergoing phosphorylation and their association with other polypeptides. Cells and Reagents—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from buffy coats after centrifugation over Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). Partially purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes were obtained by conventional adherence techniques and referred to as PBL. Activated T cells were obtained after stimulation of PBL in RPMI media (1% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine) with 5 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin. After 1 to 5 days in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 99% humidity, activated T cells were processed for subsequent studies. Phytohemagglutinin, antibiotic/antimicotic solution, and Brij 96 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. RPMI 1640, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Methyl[3H]thymidine ([3H]TdR) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). 4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a Src-family selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor also known as PP2, was from Calbiochem. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: W6/32 (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a mouse mAb that recognizes a monomorphic epitope on all HLA heavy chains, dependent on the presence of β2m (35Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar). HC-10 (a gift from Dr. Hidde Ploegh, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) is a mouse mAb that reacts preferentially with misfolded HLA-B and -C heavy chains not associated with β2m (36Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar). 19Thy5D7, 21Thy2D3 and 2ST85H7 (a gift from Dr. Chris Rudd, Imperial College, London, UK) are mouse mAbs against the extracellular domains of CD4, CD8α, and CD8β, respectively (37Rudd C.E. Anderson P. Morimoto C. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 111: 225-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SPA-891 (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., London. UK) is a mouse mAb that reacts with protein disulfide isomerase. SPA-600 (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp.) is a rabbit polyclonal Ab that recognizes calreticulin. Poly57 is a rabbit polyclonal Ab that reacts with ERp57 (a gift from Neil Bulleid, University of Manchester, UK). 4G10 (a gift from Paul Crocker, University of Dundee, UK) is a mouse mAb that recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgG were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies (from mouse, rabbit, and swine) were from Dakopatts. Rabbit sera against the intracellular tyrosine kinase Lck were a gift from Dr. Chris Rudd (37Rudd C.E. Anderson P. Morimoto C. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 111: 225-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-ZAP-70 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Flow Cytometry—Staining steps of resting and activated T cells for flow cytometry studies were performed at 4 °C for 30 min in staining solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3) in round-bottom microtiter plates (Greiner, Nürtingen, Germany) with ∼0.5×106 cells/well. First, cells were labeled with HC-10, calreticulin, and ERp57 antibodies followed by F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit anti-mouse (HC-10) or swine anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (calreticulin and ERp57)-conjugated antibodies. Irrelevant mouse and rabbit antibodies were used as negative controls to define background staining. Cells were then counterstained with anti-TCRαβ-RPE antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, BioAtlāntico, Portugal), washed three times, and immediately acquired without fixation in a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). For each sample 10,000–20,000 viable lymphocytes were acquired using forward scatter/side scatter characteristics and analyzed using CellQuest software. Determination of T Cell Activation, Transformation, and Division—T cell activation and proliferation were studied by two methods: (i) thymidine uptake and (ii) CFSE fluorescence loss. For thymidine uptake, 0.5μCi of [3H]TdR (specific activity 5.0Ci/mmol, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, England) was added 4 h prior the end of the culture and cells harvested on glass fiber filters (Filter MAT, Skatron Instruments, Suffolk, UK), using a semiautomatic cell harvester (Skatron, Norway). The incorporated [3H]TdR was measured in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter, and results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). For CFSE fluorescence loss PBL were first labeled with CFSE prior to stimulation, and rounds of cell division were determined by sequential halving of CFSE fluorescence intensity as described (38Fonseca A.M. Pereira C.F. Porto G. Arosa F.A. Cell. Immunol. 2003; 224: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cell Labeling and Lysis—For cell surface biotinylation resting or activated PBLs were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature followed by four washes in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, labeled cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Brij) for 30 min on ice. In experiments where phosphorylation was studied a 1:100 dilution of a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added during the lysis procedure. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris and precleared for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Enzymatic Treatment—Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with the proper antibodies followed by Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C by end-over rotation. Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates to be treated enzymatically were boiled for 3 min in lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, cooled on ice for 2 min, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 μl of N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was stopped by the addition of non-reducing sample buffer. For reprecipitation experiments, the beads containing the primary immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in 2% SDS and diluted 8-fold with lysis buffer. The beads were spun down; the supernatants were recovered and cleared for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated with the proper antibodies followed by Sepharose beads overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times, boiled for 5 min in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation of MHC-I molecules from the culture supernatants, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added and supernatants centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were precleared with Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C followed by another centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation with W6/32 and HC-10 antibodies followed by Sepharose beads was performed overnight at 4 °C by end-over rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times, boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For immunocomplex kinase assays, washed immunoprecipitates were washed two additional times in Brij 96 assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Brij 96). Brij assay buffer (30 μl) containing 10 mm MnCl2 and 5μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the dried beads, and in vitro kinase reactions were allowed to occur for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and the products of the reaction were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were either blotted onto nitrocellulose filters or dried directly and were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR-1 films (Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain). Western Blots and Immunodetection—Polyacrylamide gels from biotin-labeled samples were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T Tris-buffered saline (0.1%)-Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with a 1:7500 dilution in TBS-T of ExtrAvidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico (Perbio). For immunodetection of MHC class I heavy chains the HC-10 antibody was used. For immunodetection of phosphotyrosine the membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T and incubated with 4G10 antibody (as culture supernatant) or the PY-Plus antibody mixture (clones PY-7E1 and PY20, Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). The membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes), and visualization was performed using chemoluminescence, as described above. Conformational Changes of Cell Surface MHC-I Molecules on Human T Cells upon Activation—Previous results have shown that activated human T cells and transformed T cell lines display an increase in the proportion of misfolded MHC class I molecules present at the cell surface. However, this biological event has not been fully characterized on normal human T cells. Human PBL were activated for 5 days and at time points after activation T cells were harvested, cell surface-labeled with biotin and lysed. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against folded (W6/32) and misfolded (HC-10) MHC-I molecules. Fig. 1A shows the levels of the two MHC-I conformational states studied on the cell surface of resting (day 0) and activated (days 1, 3, and 5) T cells. Although the levels of folded MHC-I molecules remained steady from day 0–3, misfolded MHC-I molecules showed a time-dependent increase; they were barely detected in resting T cells, started to appear 1 day after stimulation, and peaked by day three (Fig. 1A). Maximal expression of misfolded MHC-I molecules varied between individuals but in general reached a peak between days 3 and 5, coinciding with the peak of cell proliferation as determined by thymidine uptake (Fig. 1A). Noteworthy, both W6/32 and HC-10 antibodies immunoprecipitated a band of ∼90-kDa, corresponding to the estimated molecular weight of MHC-I dimers. To ascertain this possibility the immunoprecipitates were resolved under non-reducing and reducing conditions. As depicted in Fig. 1B, the 90-kDa protein band observed under non-reducing conditions essentially disappeared when the samples were reduced, leading to an increase in 46-kDa class I heavy chain monomers. Interestingly, the peak of expression of misfolded MHC-I molecules at day 3 correlated with the co-precipitation of a high number of protein bands, other than the MHC-I dimers, with molecular masses between 56 and 110 kDa. These co-precipitated proteins were barely observed by day 5, when the decrease in HC-10 reactive heavy chains was paralleled by an increase in folded MHC-I molecules (Fig. 1A). Physical Associations between MHC-I Molecules and Cell Surface Proteins on Human T Cells Depend on Misfolding— The immunoprecipitation results illustrated in Fig. 1A pointed to the existence of physical associations between MHC-I molecules and other receptors at the cell surface of activated T cells. Also, these associations were apparently dependent on the level of expression of misfolded MHC-I molecules. To ascertain this assumption, a number of T cell surface receptors (i.e. CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD8αβ) as well as MHC-I molecules were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of cell surface biotinylated T cells at different phases of the activation process and examined for the presence of 46-kDa heavy chains. Of the up to 10 unrelated samples studied, only the CD8αβ co-receptor was consistently found to co-precipitate a biotin-labeled protein band with a molecular weight similar to the MHC-I heavy chain from the cell surface of activated T cells, and reprecipitation studies with HC-10 antibodies confirmed that the band corresponded to MHC-I heavy chains (Fig. 1C). The results depicted in Fig. 1C also demonstrated that the higher the level of misfolded MHC-I molecules present at the cell surface the higher the amount of MHC-I heavy chain co-precipitated with the CD8αβ co-receptor (Fig. 1C, compare days 3 and 5). Importantly, co-precipitation of MHC-I heavy chains with the CD8αβ co-receptor was more effective when antibodies against the CD8β chain were used (Fig. 1D). Finally, in view of our previous studies showing that the chaperone calreticulin was present at the cell surface of activated T cells in association with misfolded MHC-I molecules (29Arosa F.A. de Jesus O. Porto G. Carmo A.M. de Sousa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16917-16922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we examined for the presence of other related chaperones. Significant levels of calreticulin and ERp57 but not protein disulfide isomerase were found on the cell surface of activated T cells (Fig. 2A). As expected from our previous studies, antibodies against calreticulin co-precipitated a pool of misfolded MHC-I heavy chains (Fig. 2A, Ref. 29Arosa F.A. de Jesus O. Porto G. Carmo A.M. de Sousa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16917-16922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), something not observed in ERp57 immunoprecipitates. Surprisingly, antibodies against calreticulin also co-precipitated a protein band of the same molecular weight as ERp57 (Fig. 2A, upper panels), and reprecipitation showed that this protein was indeed ERp57 (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Expression of the tandem calreticulin-ERp57 at the cell surface of normal human T cells (resting and activated) was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, two-color flow cytometry showed that in resting but not in activated lymphocytes, calreticulin and ERp57 were mostly at the cell surface of TCR-negative cells (Fig. 2B). Misfolded MHC-I Molecules Are Fully Glycosylated Proteins—To rule out the possibility that misfolded MHC-I molecules present at the cell surface of activated T cells originated from immature molecules that have escaped the quality control mechanisms of the endoplasmic reticulum, we examined their glycosylation status. Folded and misfolded molecules were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of cell surface biotinylated activated T cells and subjected to endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) or N-glycanase F (Gly-F) treatment. The products of the enzymatic reaction were resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized with ExtrAvidin-HRP followed by SuperSignal West Pico. As shown in Fig. 3A both folded and misfolded MHC-I heavy chain monomers present at the cell surface of activated T cells were resistant to Endo-H although sensitive to Gly-F. The 90-kDa dimers of MHC-I molecules showed a similar pattern of resistance to Endo-H and Gly-F. As a control, we immunoprecipitated total misfolded MHC-I molecules from cell lysates of non-biotinylated activated T cells with HC-10. In contrast to the results obtained with misfolded MHC-I molecules from the cell surface, Endo-H treatment of total misfolded MHC-I molecules resulted in the digestion of a fraction of these molecules, most likely immature heavy chains residing in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartments (Fig. 3B). Thus, cell surface misfolded MHC-I molecules contain mature glycans indicating that they originate from folded MHC-I molecules. Misfolded MHC-I Molecules Are Phosphorylated in Tyrosine Residues—Next, we wanted to ascertain the tyrosine dephosphorylation status of the two conformational states of MHC-I molecules present at the cell surface of activated human T cells. Several studies have suggested that a conserved tyrosine motif within the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I molecules is important for signaling events coupled with intracellular trafficking (16Gur H. el-Zaatari F. Geppert T.D. Wacholtz M.C. Taurog J.D. Lipsky P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Greenberg M.E. Iafrate A.J. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Besides, studies in mice have suggested that dephosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of cell surface MHC-I molecules is associated with the misfolded conformational state of H-2Dd molecules (39Thor G. Sepulveda H. Chada S. Dutton R.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 211-224PubMed Google Scholar) We immunoprecipitated W6/32- and HC-10-reactive molecules from post-nuclear supernatants of activated T cells that had been lysed in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) or anti-MHC-I heavy chains (HC-10) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection by ECL. In the majority of the experiments performed, probing with 4G10 antibodies revealed that HC-10 reactive heavy chain monomers (misfolded MHC-I) were phosphorylated in tyrosine whereas W6/32 reactive heavy chain monomers (folded MHC-I) were not phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, left panel). This was also true for the MHC-I heavy chain dimers. Even though in some experiments W6/32-reactive molecules appeared also to be phosphorylated, the level of phosphorylation was very weak especially when compared with the total levels of MHC-I heavy chains (data not shown). Probing with HC-10 antibodies showed that the differences in phosphorylation between folded and misfolded MHC-I heavy chains were not caused by deficient immunoprecipitation of W6/32-reactive molecules (Fig. 4A, right panel). To rule out the possibility that the phosphorylated misfolded heavy chains corresponded to immature MHC-I molecules captured from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, HC-10 immunoprecipitates were subjected"

Because aberrant intracellular localization of MUC1 in tumor cells correlates with an aggressive tumor and a poor prognosis for the patient, experiments were designed to characterize the features that modulate MUC1 membrane trafficking. By following [35S]Met/Cys-labeled MUC1 in glycosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary cells, we found previously that truncation of O-glycans on MUC1 inhibited its surface expression and stimulated its internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To identify signals for MUC1 internalization that are independent of its glycosylation state, the ectodomain of MUC1 was replaced with that of Tac, and chimera endocytosis was measured by the same protocol. Endocytosis of the chimera was significantly faster than for MUC1, indicating that features of the highly extended ectodomain inhibit MUC1 internalization. Analysis of truncation mutants and tyrosine mutants showed that Tyr20 and Tyr60 were both required for efficient endocytosis. Mutation of Tyr20 significantly blocked coimmunoprecipitation of the chimera with AP-2, indicating that Y20HPM is recognized as a YXXϕ motif by the μ2 subunit. The tyrosine-phosphorylated Y60TNP was previously identified as an SH2 site for Grb2 binding, and we found that mutation of Tyr60 blocked coimmunoprecipitation of the chimera with Grb2. This is the first indication that Grb2 plays a significant role in the endocytosis of MUC1. MUC1 is a mucin-like transmembrane protein found on the apical surface of many epithelia.

The resulting subunits remain tightly associated; the heterodimer is SDS-labile but is resistant to boiling, urea, sulfhydryl reduction, peroxide, high salt, or low pH (4Julian J. Carson D.D.

In general, MUC1 overexpression in tumors from breast, lung, kidney, and thyroid correlates with an aggressive tumor and increased metastasis (5McGuckin M.A. Walsh M.D. Hohn B.G. Ward B.G.

However, a recent immunohistological study of 71 breast carcinomas, coupled with a review of the literature, indicates that it is actually the aberrant localization of intracellular MUC1 or MUC1 in a non-apical pattern that is associated with a worse prognosis for the patient (11Rahn J.J. Dabbagh L. Pasdar M. Hugh J.C. Cancer. 2001; 91: 1973-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The reason for the intracellular (cytoplasmic) MUC1 staining in breast carcinomas is not clear. Schroeder et al. (12Schroeder J.A. Adriance M.C. Thompson M.C. Camenisch T.D. Gendler S.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) found a tumor-specific complex between MUC1 and β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus in metastatic lesions of breast cancer patients; aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of activated β-catenin in breast tumors also correlates with a poor prognosis for the patient (13Lin S-Y.

Ther. 2003; 2: 37-43Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although trafficking of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail and β-catenin (or γ-catenin) to the nucleus is clearly stimulated by either ligand binding to members of the EGF receptor family or stimulation of Src-family kinases, the mechanism for this trafficking is not clear (18Li Y. Chen W. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Yoshida K. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 37-43Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Yu W. Ren J. Chen W. Huang L. Kharbanda S. Loda M. Kufe D. Mol.

The large subunit of MUC1 is not found with β-catenin in the nucleus, but immunohistochemical staining with subunit-specific antibodies indicates that both MUC1 subunits are present in the cytoplasm of breast carcinomas (18Li Y.

Thus, it is quite likely that trafficking of the MUC1/β-catenin complex to the nucleus involves endocytosis of MUC1 from the cell surface as a first step. MUC1 glycosylation is also altered in breast tumor cells (22Hull S.R. Bright A. Carraway K.L. Abe M. Hayes D.F. Kufe D.W. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 261-267PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brockhausen I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26103-26112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and our previous studies indicate that changes in MUC1 glycosylation can alter its membrane trafficking. We found that delivery of MUC1 to the cell surface in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is absolutely dependent on the addition of O-linked glycans to its mucin-like core of tandem repeats (27Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In glycosylation-defective CHO cells, only half as much MUC1 was delivered to the cell surface when it was synthesized with shorter glycans (NeuAcGalNAc-) compared with MUC1 with normal glycans (NeuAcGal(NeuAc)GalNAc-), and MUC1 with shorter O-glycans was internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis at twice the rate of MUC1 with normal glycans (27Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in MUC1 glycosylation can clearly alter its membrane trafficking and potentially its steady state subcellular localization. We have now carried out experiments to better understand how MUC1 clathrin-mediated endocytosis is regulated independent of its heavily glycosylated ectodomain. Many transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane use cytoplasmic internalization signals such as YXXϕ (where X is any amino acid and ϕ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) or [DE]XXXL[LI] dileucine motifs to bind the well characterized adaptor protein complex AP-2 (28Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 29Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Gene. 2002; 286: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). AP-2 is a cytosolic heterotetramer with additional binding sites for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, clathrin heavy chain, and a wide range of other adaptor proteins, including the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein, β-arrestin, and epsin family members (for a review, see Refs. 30Traub L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar and 31Sorkin A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In turn, the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated FXNPXY motifs, β-arrestin recognizes phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors, and the epsin family members recognize ubiquitinylated proteins through their ubiquitin interaction motifs (30Traub L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 31Sorkin A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Together these proteins function at the plasma membrane to concentrate cargo in clathrin-coated pits and initiate their invagination. To focus on identification of endocytosis signals in the cytoplasmic domain of MUC1, we replaced its ectodomain with that of Tac (interleukin 2 receptor α-subunit), a protein that has been used previously in chimeric constructs to analyze carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic targeting signals (32Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our initial analysis of cytoplasmic domain truncation-mutants produced complex results. Our subsequent focus on truncations that inhibited MUC1 endocytosis and tyrosine mutants revealed that MUC1 internalization is dependent on at least two tyrosine residues: one within a previously described binding site for the adaptor protein Grb2, and one within a binding site for the adaptor protein complex AP-2. Recombinant cDNAs and Transfected Cells—The generation of clonal CHO cells expressing human MUC1 with 22 tandem repeats was described previously (27Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The cDNA for full-length Tac (interleukin 2 receptor α-subunit) was a gift from Michael S. Marks (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (32Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nucleotide residues encoding the amino-terminal Tac ectodomain (239 amino acids) and both the carboxyl-terminal human MUC1 transmembrane (23 amino acids) and cytoplasmic (72 amino acids) domains were amplified using PCR and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers for PCR were designed to include nucleotide restriction sites for ligation of Tac and MUC1 cDNAs to form the Tac-MUC1 chimera shown in Fig. 1. Mutation of tyrosine residues or placement of stop codons within the Tac-MUC1 cytoplasmic tail was carried out by PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis using primers with specific nucleotide changes. Clonal lines of CHO cells stably transfected with either the Tac-MUC1 chimera or Tac-MUC1 mutants in pCDNA3(neo) (Invitrogen) were selected by growth in G-418 (0.5 mg/ml). Cells were cultured as described previously (27Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Endocytosis Assay—The protocol used to measure endocytosis of MUC1 in CHO cells was previously published (27Altschuler Y.

In brief, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 30 min and chased in media containing Met/Cys for 90 min before cell surface biotinylation on ice with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. Cells were moved to 37 °C for the indicated times before stripping the cell surface biotin with the membrane-impermeant reducing agent MESNA on ice. Biotinylated MUC1 or Tac-MUC1 was recovered from immunoprecipitates using avidin-conjugated beads before SDS-PAGE and quantifying 35S-labeled bands using the BioRad Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One software. The fraction internalized at each time point was calculated after subtraction of background at time zero by using total biotinylated 35S-labeled MUC1 or chimera (without MESNA stripping) as 100%. At least two clonal cell lines expressing either MUC1 with 22 tandem repeats or Tac-MUC1 chimeras were analyzed multiple times as indicated in the figure legends. The mean and S.E.M. for data from each construct are presented in the figures, and the statistical significance of the differences between data obtained with the wild-type Tac-MUC1 and the mutants was calculated using an unpaired Student's t test based on equal variance. Equal variance was determined using Stata Statistical Software (ver. 7.0; Stata Corp., College Station, TX).

Mouse anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody was from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-Armenian hamster antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). AP-2 was immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of CHO cells using the anti-AP-2 α subunit mouse monoclonal antibody before immunoblotting with an Armenian hamster anti-MUC1 cytoplasmic tail antibody (CT2) and HRP-conjugated second antibody using our published protocol (36Poland P.A.

Phosphatase inhibitors (mixture set II) and protease inhibitors (mixture set III) were added to the detergent solution as directed by the manufacturer (Calbiochem). The blots were subsequently stripped by incubation in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3, for 30 min at room temperature before reblocking and immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-AP-2 μ2 subunit rabbit polyclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated second antibodies. Grb2 was immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of CHO cells after 3–4 h in serum-free media followed by 20 min with 25 ng/ml betacellulin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Grb2 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an Armenian hamster anti-MUC1 cytoplasmic tail antibody (CT2) followed by HRP-conjugated second antibody using our published protocol (36Poland P.A.

Phosphatase inhibitors (mixture sets I and II) and protease inhibitors (mixture set III) were added to the detergent solution as directed by the manufacturer (Calbiochem). Tac-MUC1 expressed in each cell line (1%) was immunoprecipitated as a control with mouse anti-Tac antibody and blotted with hamster CT2 antibody. Bands on film were analyzed with a Microtek 8700 scanner and Bio-Rad Quantity One software for Fig. 5. Bands in Fig. 6 were directly quantified with a Bio-Rad Versadoc and Quantity One software.Fig. 6Mutation of Tyr60 inhibits binding of Grb2. A, Grb2 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from detergent extracts of CHO cells stably expressing either Tac-MUC1 (WT) or Tac-MUC1 with either the Tyr20 or Tyr60 mutated, using the anti-Grb2 mouse monoclonal antibody before immunoblotting (IB) with an Armenia hamster anti-MUC1 cytoplasmic tail antibody (CT2). B, detergent cell extract was incubated with anti-Tac monoclonal antibodies as a control to compare expression levels. The ratio of chimera in the co-IP (A) compared with that in the total IP (B) is expressed as a ratio (C). The immunoblots and data are representative of two separate experiments. Note that two different clones of the Tyr60 mutant (Y60a and Y60b) expressing very different levels of chimera gave similar ratios of co-IP/total IP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results from our previous studies indicated that MUC1 endocytosis was enhanced 2-fold when it was modified with truncated rather than full-length O-glycans in a glycosylation-defective CHO cell line (27Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because this effect on MUC1 clathrin-mediated endocytosis was most probably caused by a decrease in either steric hindrance or interaction of the extended mucin-like ectodomain with other proteins, a chimera was prepared with the ectodomain of Tac, a cell surface type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that has been used previously in chimeric constructs to analyze carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic targeting signals (see Tac-MUC1 chimera design in Fig. 1) (32Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Replacement of the MUC1 mucin-like ectodomain of 819 amino acids with the Tac ectodomain of 239 amino acids dramatically altered the level of endocytosis (see representative profiles and data in Fig. 2, A–C). Comparison of data from multiple experiments, using levels of 35S-labeled MUC1 or chimera internalized after 10 min, indicates that this 2.7-fold increase in endocytosis that we observe in Fig. 2D, as a result of the exchange of the ectodomains, is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Thus, the mucin-like ectodomain of MUC1 severely inhibits internalization of this cell surface molecule. Because our previous data indicated that MUC1 internalization proceeds by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (27Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we predicted that truncation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail would block internalization. Binding sites for clathrin adaptor complexes are consistently found in the cytoplasmic domain of cell surface proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, removal of all but 10 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of Tac-MUC1 slowed endocytosis by ∼40%. Comparison of data from multiple experiments indicated that this difference in endocytosis caused by the truncation of the cytoplasmic tail is statistically significant (compare Tac-MUC1 mutant X10 to Tac-MUC1 with a full-length tail, WT 72, p < 0.01). It is interesting that when endocytosis of WT 72 was compared with other truncation mutants, the results were consistent with the presence of multiple signals for endocytosis within the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail. For example, removal of 13 amino acids (mutant X59) also inhibited Tac-MUC1 endocytosis by ∼40% (p < 0.05), but removal of 23 amino acids (mutant X49) did not alter endocytosis, and removal of 34 amino acids (mutant X38) or 47 amino acids (mutant X25) actually stimulated endocytosis (p < 0.01). Truncation of cytoplasmic domains can reveal cryptic endocytosis signals that are not functional in the full-length protein (37Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), so the stimulation of endocytosis observed for mutants X38 and X25 is likely to be irrelevant. Because endocytosis was inhibited when residues 11 to 25 or residues 60 to 72 were removed, this is consistent with binding of adaptor proteins within these domains. The MUC1 cytosolic tail contains seven tyrosine residues. Sequences around three of the tyrosines in the MUC1 tail (Y8GQL, Y20HPM, and Y46EKV) are consistent with the unpublished specificity of binding to the μ2 subunit of AP-2. Because only the tyrosine residue within the YXXϕ motif is absolutely essential for μ2 binding, residues Tyr8, Tyr20, and Tyr46 were mutated individually within the context of the full-length Tac-MUC1 chimera tail and stably expressed in CHO cells. No YXXϕ, NPXY, or dileucine endocytosis motifs are present within the domain between residues 60 and 72, but a tyrosine-phosphorylated motif (pY60TNP) in this domain has been shown previously to be a binding site for the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2 (38Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, full-length Tac-MUC1 chimera with the Y60N mutation was also stably expressed in CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the Y20N mutation reduced Tac-MUC1 endocytosis by 30% (p < 0.05), consistent with the presence of a YXXϕ-type endocytosis motif (Y20HPM) in the domain between residues 11 and 25, whereas mutation of neither Tyr8 or Tyr46 had no significant affect on chimera endocytosis. However, the Y60N mutation inhibited chimera endocytosis by 50% (p < 0.01), consistent with a role for Grb2 binding in MUC1 internalization. Because neither the Y20N nor the Y60N mutation alone fully blocked Tac-MUC1 endocytosis, both mutations were simultaneously introduced into the full-length Tac-MUC1. As shown in Fig. 4, the Y20,60N double mutation reduced MUC1 endocytosis by 77% (p < 0.001) compared with WT Tac-MUC1. To determine whether Y20HPM represents a binding site for AP-2, the adaptor protein complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-AP-2 α subunit antibodies and immunoblotted for both the Tac-MUC1 WT chimera and the μ2 subunit of AP-2 (Fig. 5, A and D). Although similar levels of the μ2 subunit appeared in all anti-α subunit immunoprecipitates, as unexpected, levels of the mutant chimera in the coimmunoprecipitates were decreased compared with the WT chimera. When normalized against the total level of chimera expressed in each cell line, the ratio of chimera associated with AP-2 in two different clonal cell lines expressing the Y20N mutant was decreased by 75% compared with the WT chimera (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, Tac-MUC1 interaction with the AP-2 adaptor is mediated by the Y20HPM motif. It is interesting that the Y60N mutation reduced chimera co-immunoprecipitation by 33% compared with the WT chimera consistent with the decreased level of endocytosis observed for this mutant in Fig. 4. This indicates that AP-2 can still interact with the chimera even in the absence of Grb2 binding, but Grb2 binding apparently enhances the association of MUC1 with AP-2 by an unknown mechanism. To determine whether Grb2 was binding to the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail when Tac-MUC1 was expressed in CHO cells, Grb2 was immunoprecipitated from CHO cells expressing WT or mutant Tac-MUC1 using anti-Grb2 antibodies and immunoblotted for Tac-MUC1 (Fig. 6). When normalized against the total level of chimera expressed in each cell line, it is clear that the Y60N mutation blocks 80–85% of the interaction of Tac-MUC1 with Grb2. It is interesting that the Y20N mutation that blocked μ2 binding by 75% also blocked Grb2 binding to the same extent, indicating that Grb2 binding to the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail may require prior interaction with AP-2. MUC1 interaction with members of the EGF receptor family is dependent on the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail that is phosphorylated at several residues and provides docking sites for numerous proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β, Src-family kinases, β- or γ-catenin, and Grb2 (14Li Y.

https://openalex.org/W1987676695,"Chemokine production has been associated with leukocyte infiltration into the joint during gouty arthritis, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, the causative agent of this arthropathy, have been shown to modulate their expression. In the present study, we investigated the transductional mechanisms underlying this cellular regulation in the murine macrophage cell line B10R. We report that MSU crystals rapidly and transiently increase mRNA levels of various chemokines in a concentration-dependent manner. Examination of second messenger activation revealed that macrophage exposure to MSU crystals led to MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and inhibitory protein κBα phosphorylation as well as to NF-κB and AP-1 nuclear translocation. Of interest, specific blockage of the ERK1/2 pathway drastically reduced up-modulation of MSU crystal-mediated chemokine production and activation of nuclear factors. Similarly, selective inhibition of NF-κB suppressed NF-κB DNA binding activity and the induction of all chemokine transcripts. These findings indicate that ERK1/2-dependent signals seem to be required for AP-1 and NF-κB activation and subsequent mRNA expression of the various macrophage chemokines. In addition, transcription and stability assays performed in presence of actinomycin D showed that MSU crystal-mediated MIP-1β mRNA up-regulation resulted solely from transcriptional control, whereas that of MIP-1α, MIP-2, and MCP-1 was due to both gene transcription activation and mRNA posttranscriptional stabilization. Overall, the results of this study help to define the molecular events that govern macrophage chemokine regulation in response to MSU crystals, which is of paramount importance to better understand, and eventually to tame, the inflammatory response during acute gout."
https://openalex.org/W1967127487,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) transmit signals from membrane bound G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular effector proteins. The G(q) subfamily of Galpha subunits couples GPCR activation to the enzymatic activity of phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta). Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins bind to activated Galpha subunits, including Galpha(q), and regulate Galpha signaling by acting as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), increasing the rate of the intrinsic GTPase activity, or by acting as effector antagonists for Galpha subunits. GPCR kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate agonist-bound receptors in the first step of receptor desensitization. The amino termini of all GRKs contain an RGS homology (RH) domain, and binding of the GRK2 RH domain to Galpha(q) attenuates PLC-beta activity. The RH domain of GRK2 interacts with Galpha(q/11) through a novel Galpha binding surface termed the site. Here, molecular modeling of the Galpha(q).GRK2 complex and site-directed mutagenesis of Galpha(q) were used to identify residues in Galpha(q) that interact with GRK2. The model identifies Pro(185) in Switch I of Galpha(q) as being at the crux of the interface, and mutation of this residue to lysine disrupts Galpha(q) binding to the GRK2-RH domain. Switch III also appears to play a role in GRK2 binding because the mutations Galpha(q)-V240A, Galpha(q)-D243A, both residues within Switch III, and Galpha(q)-Q152A, a residue that structurally supports Switch III, are defective in binding GRK2. Furthermore, GRK2-mediated inhibition of Galpha(q)-Q152A-R183C-stimulated inositol phosphate release is reduced in comparison to Galpha(q)-R183C. Interestingly, the model also predicts that residues in the helical domain of Galpha(q) interact with GRK2. In fact, the mutants Galpha(q)-K77A, Galpha(q)-L78D, Galpha(q)-Q81A, and Galpha(q)-R92A have reduced binding to the GRK2-RH domain. Finally, although the mutant Galpha(q)-T187K has greatly reduced binding to RGS2 and RGS4, it has little to no effect on binding to GRK2. Thus the RH domain A and C sites for Galpha(q) interaction rely on contacts with distinct regions and different Switch I residues in Galpha(q)."

Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mediate β-cell dysfunction and islet degeneration, in part, through the induction of the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide by β-cells. Cytokines also stimulate the expression of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, COX-2, and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by rat and human islets; however, the role of increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in mediating cytokine-induced inhibition of islet metabolic function and viability has been incompletely characterized. In this study, we have shown that treatment of rat islets with IL-1β or human islets with a cytokine mixture containing IL-1β + IFN-γ ± TNF-α stimulates COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation in a time-dependent manner. Co-incubation of rat and human islets with selective COX-2 inhibitors SC-58236 and Celecoxib, respectively, attenuated cytokine-induced PGE2 formation.

These results suggest that inflammatory cytokines mediate islet dysfunction and degeneration by inducing iNOS expression and NO formation by β-cells. Three isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been characterized to date, two constitutive isoforms, COX-1 and COX-3, and an inducible isoform of the enzyme, COX-2 (13Chandrasekharan N.V. Dai H.

COX-2 is undetectable in most cells but may be induced in macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, monocytes, and ovarian follicles in response to a number of stimuli including growth factors, bacterial endotoxins, and cytokines (15Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). NO has been reported to activate COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms of the enzyme in macrophages, resulting in increased PGE2 formation (16Salvemini D. Misko T.P. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Currie M.G.

In islets, cytokines have also been shown to induce the expression of COX-2, resulting in increased production of PGE2 (17Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C1581-C1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that cytokines stimulate both iNOS and COX-2 expression in islets and that NO contributes to the accumulation of proinflammatory prostaglandins by stimulating the enzymatic activity of COX-1 and COX-2. Numerous investigators have studied the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 activities, on insulin secretion both in vivo and ex vivo in isolated islet preparations. Increases in basal insulin, first phase insulin response, second phase or total insulin, and improved glucose tolerance have been observed in normal and diabetic patients following treatment with sodium salicylate, acetosalicylic acid, and ibuprofen (21Robertson R.P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, PGE2 has been shown to decrease insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in normal human subjects. Together, these data suggest that COX activity or COX-derived PGE2 modulates insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in normal and diabetic patients. In vitro, sodium salicylate, acetosalicylic acid, and ibuprofen appear to augment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets (21Robertson R.P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Salicylates have also been shown to attenuate cytokine-mediated inhibition of insulin secretion by rat islets (22Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that selective inhibition of COX-2 attenuates diabetes development in the low-dose streptozotocin mouse model and protects rat islets from cytokine-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (23Tran P.O.

In contrast, indomethacin, a more potent COX inhibitor than the salicylates, decreases first phase insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in normal human subjects (21Robertson R.P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and does not protect against cytokine-mediated inhibition of insulin secretion by rat islets in vitro (11Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L.

Autoimmun. 1989; 2: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), calling into question whether COX activity and COX-derived PGE2 mediate these effects. To determine whether COX-2 and COX-2-derived PGE2 mediate the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on islet function and viability, we have characterized the actions of cytokines on the expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2 by both rat and human islets and examined whether selective COX-2 inhibition protects islets from cytokine-induced β-cell dysfunction and morphological damage. Treatment of rat and human islets with cytokines resulted in the time-dependent expression of COX-2 and formation of PGE2, which correlated with the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on insulin secretion and islet viability. Selective COX-2 inhibitors Celebrex and SC-58236 completely prevented cytokine-induced PGE2 formation by human and rat islets, respectively. However this treatment failed to prevent the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokine treatment on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet degeneration. Consistent with previous reports, inhibitors of iNOS, AG, and l-NMMA prevented the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on islet function and viability by both rat and human islets (5Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 785-810Crossref Google Scholar). These findings suggest that although COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation by rat and human islets correlate with cytokine-induced islet damage, increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 production do not appear to mediate this damage. Instead, our findings support a primary role for NO as the mediator of cytokine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion and islet morphological degeneration.

Detection of rat iNOS (1:5000 dilution), rat COX-2 (1:100 dilution), human iNOS (1:500 dilution), human COX-2 (1:1000 dilution), and human COX-1 (1:1000 dilution) were by ECL according to manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Biosciences). Nitrite and Prostaglandin E2 Determination—Nitrite production was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (29Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10824) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. PGE2 production was determined by using a monoclonal PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer specifications. Statistical Analyses—Statistical comparisons were made between groups using a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences between treatment groups compared with untreated controls (p < 0.05) were evaluated using a least significant differences post-hoc analysis. Time-dependent Effects of IL-1β on COX-2 Expression and PGE2 Formation by Rat Islets—Previous studies have shown that IL-1β induces the time-dependent production of nitric oxide and PGE2 by rat islets that is maximal following 48 h incubation (Ref. 19Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Marino M.H. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P.M. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1581-C1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig 1a). To characterize the time-dependent expression of COX-2, rat islets were incubated for 0–48 h with 1 unit/ml IL-1β followed by Western blot analysis of COX-2 protein expression. As shown in Fig 1b, IL-1β induced COX-2 protein expression, which was first observed following 3 h of incubation, was maximally expressed following 12 h of incubation, and remained at detectable levels of expression following 48 h of incubation. Consistent with IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression, IL-1β induced the time-dependent formation of PGE2 by rat islets, which was first observed following 6 h of incubation and was maximal following 48 h of incubation (Fig. 1a). Similar to COX-2 expression, IL-1β-stimulated iNOS expression was first observed following 6 h of incubation and was maximally expressed following a 24-h incubation; its expression level was sustained for up to 48 h (Fig. 1c). iNOS expression correlates with the stimulatory actions of this cytokine on NO formation as nitrite production in response to IL-1β was first apparent following 6 h of incubation and maximal following 48 h of incubation (Fig. 1a). These results indicate that IL-1β-induced NO formation and PGE2 production correlate with IL-1β-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression by isolated rat islets. Effects of COX-2 Inhibition on IL-1β-induced NO and PGE2 Formation by Rat Islets—To examine the effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on islet PGE2 accumulation and NO formation, rat islets were incubated for 40 h with 1 unit/ml IL-1β in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml SC-58236 (30Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D. Rangwala S.H. Koboldt C.M. Seibert K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15810-15814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, IL-1β induced a ∼7-fold increase in both PGE2 and nitrite production following a 40-h incubation. The COX-2-selective inhibitor SC-58236 (25 ng/ml) prevented IL-1β-induced PGE2 formation (Fig. 2a) without affecting IL-1β-induced nitrite production by rat islets (Fig. 2b). Consistent with previous studies, the iNOS-selective inhibitor, AG, prevented IL-1β-induced nitrite production (Fig. 2b) and significantly attenuated IL-1β-induced PGE2 formation by rat islets (Ref. 18Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13767-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and Fig. 2b). SC-58236 alone failed to induce PGE2 or NO formation (Fig. 2) by isolated rat islets and did not modulate IL-1β-induced iNOS or COX-2 expression (Fig. 2b, inset, and data not shown). These results indicate that selective COX-2 inhibition by SC-58236 prevents IL-1β-induced PGE2 formation without affecting IL-1β-induced iNOS expression and NO formation by rat islets. Effects of SC-58236 on IL-1β-induced Islet Degeneration and Inhibition of Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—The inhibitory and destructive actions of IL-1β on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet degeneration are due in part to β-cell production of NO. β-Cells are the primary islet cellular source of iNOS in response to IL-1β treatment, and inhibitors of iNOS prevent IL-1β-induced islet dysfunction and damage (1Southern C. Schulster D. Green I.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 5Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 785-810Crossref Google Scholar, 8Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Recent data have implicated COX-2-derived PGE2 production as a mediator of IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion by rat islets (23Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of COX-2 activity and PGE2 formation protects islets from the inhibitory and destructive effects of IL-1β on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet viability, islets were incubated with 1 unit/ml IL-1β in the presence or absence of SC-58236 (25 ng/ml) and exogenous PGE2 (1 μm). Treatment of rat islets with IL-1β resulted in a ∼68% inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion following 40 h of incubation (Fig. 3a) and ∼98% islet morphological degeneration following 96 h of incubation (Fig. 3b). SC-58236, which prevents IL-1β-induced PGE2 formation (Fig. 2a), does not prevent the inhibitory actions of IL-1β on insulin secretion nor does it prevent islet degeneration (Fig. 3). The addition of exogenous PGE2 (1 μm) did not impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion nor did it stimulate islet degeneration. Preincubation of islets with the selective iNOS inhibitor AG prevented both the inhibitory actions of IL-1β on insulin secretion and the destructive effects of IL-1β on islet viability (Fig. 3). These results indicate that selective inhibition of COX-2 does not prevent IL-1β-induced β-cell dysfunction and damage. These findings also support a primary role for NO as the mediator of cytokine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion and islet morphological degeneration. Effects of IL-1β + IFN-γ on COX-2 Expression and PGE2 Formation by Human Islets—Although IL-1β alone is sufficient to induce iNOS and COX-2 expression and NO and PGE2 formation by rat islets, a combination of cytokines is required to induce similar responses in isolated human islets. Previous studies have shown that incubation of human islets with IL-1β + IFN-γ or IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α results in iNOS and COX-2 expression and the time-dependent formation of NO and PGE2, which is maximal following a 48-h incubation (4Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13697-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Marino M.H. Rodi C.P. Sullivan P.M. Turk J.

A. 1993; 90: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To further characterize the temporal expression of COX-2 in response to cytokines, human islets were incubated for 0–48 h with the combination of 75 units/ml IL-1β and 750 units/ml IFN-γ. As shown in Fig. 4b, IL-1β + IFN-γ induced the time-dependent expression of COX-2, which was first apparent following a 3-h incubation, maximal following an 18–24-h incubation, and remained elevated for up to 48 h. The expression of the constitutive isoform of COX, COX-1, was unaltered in human islets by cytokine treatment (Fig 4b). Consistent with COX-2 expression, PGE2 accumulation was first apparent following a 12-h incubation, and the levels continued to increase to maximal (∼11-fold) levels following 40–48 h of incubation (Fig. 4a). Similar to COX-2 expression, this combination of cytokines stimulated the time-dependent expression of iNOS, which was first apparent following a 6-h incubation and maximal following a 40–48 h incubation (Fig 4b). Cytokine-induced NO formation by human islets is also time-dependent, correlating with cytokine-induced iNOS expression, with maximal levels following 48 h of incubation (5Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 785-810Crossref Google Scholar, 32Eizirik D.L. Flodstrom M. Karlsen A.E. Welsh N. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). These results indicate that IL-1β + IFN-γ induce PGE2 and NO formation by human islets that is time-dependent and correlates with IL-1β + IFN-γ-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression. Effects of Celebrex on Cytokine-induced PGE2 and NO Formation by Human Islets—To determine the effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on cytokine-induced production of PGE2 and NO, human islets were incubated with 75 units/ml IL-1β and 750 units/ml IFN-γ in the presence of increasing concentrations of Celebrex. As shown in Fig. 5a, Celebrex inhibited IL-1 + IFN-γ-induced PGE2 formation in a concentration-dependent fashion with ∼91 and ∼97% maximal inhibition observed at 1 and 10 μm, respectively. At 10 μm, Celebrex completely prevented PGE2 formation in response to either IL-1β + IFN-γ or IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α (Fig. 5b). This inhibition of PGE2 production was not due to a decrease in COX-2 expression, as Celebrex failed to modulate cytokine-induced COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 5c). Celebrex also did not modulate cytokine-stimulated nitrite production or iNOS expression by human islets at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm (Fig. 5, a and c). At 10 μm, Celebrex appeared to slightly increase IL-1β + IFN-γ-induced NO formation (∼3.5-versus ∼2.5-fold increase for cytokine mix alone); however, this increase was not statistically significant from IL-1β + IFN-γ-induced levels. These results indicate that Celebrex inhibits cytokine-induced PGE2 formation by human islets in a concentration-dependent fashion without modulating cytokine-induced COX-2 expression. Celebrex also does not modulate cytokine-induced iNOS expression or NO formation by human islets. Effects of Celebrex on Cytokine-induced Islet Degeneration and Inhibition of Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—To determine whether PGE2 formation mediates cytokine-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet degeneration, human islets were incubated with a mixture of cytokines in the presence and absence of Celebrex. As shown in Fig. 6, incubation of human islets with IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNFα, resulted in a ∼79% inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion following 48-h incubation and ∼96% islet morphological degeneration following 96 h of incubation. Co-incubation of islets with 10 μm Celebrex, which prevented cytokine-stimulated PGE2 formation, failed to prevent the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet viability. Alone, neither exogenous PGE2 nor Celebrex inhibited basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or induced human islet degeneration (Fig. 6 and data not shown). These results indicate that selective inhibition of COX-2 fails to protect islets from the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on glucose-induced insulin secretion and islet viability. These data suggest that cytokine-induced PGE2 formation does not mediate the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on β-cell function and islet viability by human islets. Insulin-secreting β-cells are destroyed during the development of type I diabetes by an inflammatory reaction in and around islets, termed insulitis. The cellular infiltrate consists of macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and a limited number of B lymphocytes (33Bach J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 516-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Cytokines released by these macrophages and T-cells, namely IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes by inducing the expression of iNOS and the production of NO by β-cells (5Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 785-810Crossref Google Scholar). The effects of cytokines and the resulting NO production by β-cells on islet function and viability have been well characterized and include decreased oxidative phosphorylation, a potent inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and islet morphological degeneration. Evidence in support of a role for NO in mediating cytokine-induced islet damage includes the protective actions of the iNOS inhibitors AG or l-NMMA on cytokine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion and islet degeneration (1Southern C. Schulster D. Green I.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 5Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 785-810Crossref Google Scholar) and the lack of an inhibitory action of cytokines on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets isolated from iNOS-deficient mice (12Flodstrom M. Tyrberg B. Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition to iNOS expression, cytokines have been shown to induce COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in isolated rat and human islets; however, the role of COX-2-derived PGE2 on β-cell function and viability has not been fully characterized. In this study, we have characterized the temporal expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2 by rat and human islets and determined whether selective COX-2 inhibition prevents cytokine-mediated islet dysfunction and damage. Treatment of rat and human islets with IL-1β and IL-1β + IFN-γ (±TNF-α), respectively, resulted in the time-dependent production of PGE2 that was maximal following 24–48 h of incubation. Cytokine-induced PGE2 formation by rat and human islets correlates with cytokine-induced COX-2 expression, which was first observed following 3 h of incubation and remained at detectable levels of expression following 40–48 h of incubation. Selective inhibition of COX-2 in rat and human islets by SC-58236 or Celebrex, respectively, at concentrations that completely inhibit cytokine-induced PGE2 formation, did not protect islets from cytokine-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or islet morphological degeneration. These results suggest that although cytokine-induced PGE2 production and COX-2 expression correlate with cytokine-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, islet production of PGE2 does not mediate these inhibitory and destructive effects. With the exception of indomethacin, NSAIDs as a class have been shown to increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets in vitro and to improve glucose tolerance in diabetic and normal human subjects (21Robertson R.P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which NSAIDs mediate these beneficial effects is unclear. Previous reports support the hypothesis that NSAIDs exert their beneficial effects via inhibition of COX-2 activity and COX-2-derived PGE2 production. The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 has been shown to attenuate diabetes development in the low-dose streptozotocin mouse model, and selective COX-2 inhibition by SC-58236 has been shown to attenuate IL-1-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by Wistar rat islets (23Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Tabatabaie T. Waldon A.M. Jacob J.M. Floyd R.A. Kotake Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, data obtained in the current study indicate that selective COX-2 inhibition by SC-58236 fails to prevent the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated Sprague-Dawley rat islets. The addition of supraphysiological concentrations of PGE2, either alone or in combination with cytokine(s) and COX-2 inhibitor(s), also did not inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or induce islet damage by rat and human islets. These data are consistent with previous reports in which exogenous PGE2 failed to mimic the inhibitory actions of IL-1 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated rat islets (17Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and in which indomethacin, at concentrations that completely inhibit islet PGE2 production, did not attenuate the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on β-cell function (11Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine whether the strain of rat utilized for these studies could explain these discordant results, we examined whether SC-58236 prevents the inhibitory actions of IL-1 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by isolated Wistar rat islets. Similar to islets isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats, SC-58236 failed to prevent the inhibitory actions of IL-1β on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by Wistar rat islets (data not shown). These data suggest that the discordant results are not due to differences in the strain of rat utilized for experimentation. The studies are otherwise very similar in execution with the exception of the conditions used to culture the islets. Following isolation, rat (Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) and human islets used in the current study were cultured in CMRL-1066 medium containing 5 mm glucose. In contrast, Wistar rat islets, used in the study by Tran et al. (23Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose. Previous reports indicate that COX-2 expression is increased in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells when cultured in high glucose (34Lee S.H. Woo H.G. Baik E.J. Moon C.H. Life Sciences. 2000; 68: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Cosentino F. Eto M. De Paolis P. van der Loo B. Bachschmid M. Ullrich V. Kouroedov A. Delli Gatti C. Joch H. Volpe M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and in monocytes isolated from type I and type II diabetic individuals (36Shanmugam N. Gaw Gonzalo I.T. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, Persaud et al. (37Persaud S.J. Burns C.J. Belin V.D. Jones P.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S190-S192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that whereas freshly isolated mouse islets express primarily COX-1, COX-2 expression is induced and becomes the primary isoform of COX expressed in islets that are cultured in high glucose. In a concentration-dependent manner, glucose also induces COX-2 expression in human islets (37Persaud S.J. Burns C.J. Belin V.D. Jones P.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S190-S192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, in a separate report published by the same laboratory as the Tran et al. study, human islets cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose were shown to constitutively express COX-2 as the dominant COX isoform (20Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although islets cultured in high glucose constitutively express COX-2, they appear to function normally, secreting insulin in response to a high glucose challenge (23Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous PGE2 also does not modulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Ref. 17Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and current study), suggesting that increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation do not adversely affect β-cell function. Taken together, these data indicate that islets do not constitutively express COX-2 as the predominant isoform of COX under basal glucose culture conditions and that increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation do not modulate β-cell function or mediate the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet viability. One mechanism by which salicylates (sodium salicylate, acetosalicylic acid) appear to exert their beneficial effects on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance is via inhibition of IκB kinase (IKKβ) (38Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylate the IκB proteins, which sequester the transcription factor NF-κB in quiescent cells. Once phosphorylated by IKK, IκB dissociates from the NF-κB·IκB complex, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and induce gene transcription (39Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3293) Google Scholar). IL-1-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression in islets requires the activation of NF-κB (40Kwon G. Corbett J.A. Hauser S. Hill J.R. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the mechanism by which salicylates attenuate cytokine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is via inhibition of NF-κB activation and subsequent inhibition of COX-2 expression (22Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, because salicylates also inhibit iNOS expression and NO formation by rat islets (41Kwon G. Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of iNOS activity prevent the damaging actions of cytokines on the function and viability of rat and human islets, it would be reasonable to conclude that salicylates attenuate cytokine-mediated damage by preventing IKK-mediated NF-κB activation and subsequent expression of iNOS by islets. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that selective inhibition of COX-2 fails to prevent cytokine-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet degeneration in rat and human islets. However, selective inhibition of iNOS by AG or l-NMMA prevents the inhibitory and destructive effect of cytokines on β-cell function and viability, in accordance with previous reports (5Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 785-810Crossref Google Scholar). Taken together, these data provide support for the hypothesis that the mechanism by which salicylates attenuate the cytokine-mediated inhibitory and destructive effects on β-cell function and islet viability may be via inhibition of IKKβ activity and subsequent prevention of cytokine-induced NF-κB-mediated expression of iNOS by β-cells. In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that selective inhibition of COX-2 activity by SC-58236 or Celebrex fails to protect rat and human islets, respectively, from cytokine-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet degeneration. These results suggest that the inhibitory and destructive effects of cytokines on islet function and viability are not mediated by cytokine-induced production of PGE2 by islets and provides further support for cytokine-induced iNOS expression and NO formation as mediators of these inhibitory and destructive effects.

https://openalex.org/W2018440627,"Using a reporter gene assay in PC12, HEK293, HeLa, and NIH-3T3 cells, we show that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 significantly inhibits transcriptional activation of various transcription factors, including NFκB, AP1, CRE, and NFAT. A Bcl-2 mutant lacking its BH4 domain (ΔBH4) also inhibited transcription, whereas a Bcl-2 mutant lacking its transmembrane domain (ΔTM) was ineffective. Furthermore, Bcl-2 chimeric proteins containing transmembrane domains from the mitochondrial protein monoamine oxidase B (MaoB) or the endoplasmic reticulum protein cytochrome b5 showed no effect on transcription factor activity. Subcellular localization studies showed that under conditions of transient transfection, the active Bcl-2 forms (wild type and ΔBH4) were predominantly found in the nuclear fraction, whereas the non-active forms (ΔTM, MaoB, and cytochrome b5) were in the non-nuclear fraction. Additionally, stably expressed Bcl-2 loses its ability to inhibit transcriptional activation and localizes predominantly to the non-nuclear fraction. Expression of FKBP38 (a chaperone that shuttles Bcl-2 to the mitochondria) removes co-expressed Bcl-2 from the nuclear fraction and reverses its effect on transcription factor activity. Finally, using an inducible gene expression system, we show that nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 prevents entry of NFκB subunits to the nucleus without affecting NFκB release from its cytosolic inhibitory sub-unit IκBα. These results suggest that (a) Bcl-2 suppresses transcriptional activity of multiple transcription factors; (b) Bcl-2 does not interfere with NFκB activation but prevents entrance of its active subunits to the nucleus; (c) membrane anchoring is required for this function of Bcl-2; and (d) association of Bcl-2 with the nuclear compartment is also necessary.

Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved physiological process of cell death by which any superfluous or potentially dangerous cell may be eliminated (1Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Prevention, initiation, and execution of apoptosis is a complex event, involving the coordinated action of many effector proteins (3Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The best characterized class of proteins regulating apoptosis is the Bcl-2 protein family (4Adams J.M. Cory S.

Proteins belonging to this family are characterized by the presence of one or more homologous domains named Bcl-2 homology domains 1-4 (BH1-4) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; TM, transmembrane domain; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; AP1, activator protein 1; CRE, cAMP response element; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PC12, pheochromocytoma; HEK, human embryonic kidney; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; MaoB, monoamine oxidase B; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MFP, mifepristone; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

Among these, the BH4 domain is responsible for interaction with non Bcl-2 proteins such as Ras, Raf-1, and calcineurin (7Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar), and the transmembrane domain (TM) is responsible for anchoring Bcl-2 to intracellular membranes, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the nuclear membrane (8Krajewski S.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins can be divided into three major groups based on their role in modulating apoptosis: the anti-apoptotic members including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, the proapoptotic members including Bax and Bak, and the BH3-only members including Bim and Bad (5Borner C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 615-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of action of Bcl-2 is not completely understood, it is believed to involve at least in part inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (11Murphy K.M. Streips U.N.

Furthermore, Bcl-2 has been associated with calcineurin, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), and p53, possibly modulating their function (18Grimm S. Bauer M.K. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 19Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F.

We have previously shown that during aging and oxidative stress, Bcl-2 is overexpressed and found localized predominantly at the nuclear membrane (21Kaufmann J.A. Bickford P.C. Taglialatela G. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Kaufmann J.A. Perez M. Zhang W. Bickford P.C. Holmes D.B. Taglialatela G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We further showed that nuclear Bcl-2 failed to protect cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and hypothesized that the function of nuclear Bcl-2 may not be anti-apoptotic, at least in the aged or oxidatively stressed central nervous system (22Kaufmann J.A. Perez M. Zhang W. Bickford P.C. Holmes D.B. Taglialatela G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the question as to the role of Bcl-2 within the nuclear compartment remains unanswered. Although Bcl-2 has been reported in both the ER and nuclear membranes, more emphasis has been put on its role as a mitochondrial protein. More recently, growing evidence is emerging as to the role of ER-associated Bcl-2 in anti-apoptosis. A mutant Bcl-2 targeted solely to the ER membrane has been shown to be fully functional as an anti-apoptotic protein, inhibiting caspase activation and sequestering Bad to prevent it from activating the pro-apoptotic Bax (23Hacki J. Egger L. Monney L. Conus S. Rosse T. Fellay I. Borner C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Currently, research involving nuclear Bcl-2 is limited to localization studies but lacks analysis of nuclear Bcl-2 function (8Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 9Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar, 10Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Recently, work by Shirane and Nakayama (24Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) showed that FKBP38, an inherent calcineurin inhibitor containing a mitochondrial targeting sequence, co-immunoprecipitates with Bcl-2 and is required for proper localization of Bcl-2 to the mitochondrion and Bcl-2 anti-apoptosis function. Notably, these authors showed that mutation or elimination of FKBP38 results in cell death because of mislocalization of Bcl-2, mostly to the nuclear membrane. This unexpected observation raised a very important question as to the physiological function of nuclear Bcl-2 and its effect on elements involved in the maintenance of cell viability. In this study we report that high levels of Bcl-2 lead to accumulation of Bcl-2 at the nuclear membrane and result in a decrease in transcription factor activity including NFκB, AP1, CRE, and NFAT. We also show that the transactivation of a minimal promoter from SV40 thymidine kinase or a full-length mouse promoter is affected by high expression of Bcl-2, suggesting a global effect of nuclear Bcl-2 on transcription. Furthermore, we show that whereas mitochondrion- or ER-targeted Bcl-2 mutants fail to produce any effect on transcription factors, co-expression of FKBP38 with wild type Bcl-2 removes Bcl-2 from the nucleus and abolishes the transcriptional effects of Bcl-2, suggesting that Bcl-2 nuclear localization and its effect on nuclear transcription factor activity may be associated. Finally, we show that Bcl-2 prevents the translocation of active NFκB subunits to the nuclear compartment without affecting the process of NFκB activation, suggesting a role of nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 on nuclear trafficking. These results are important to define the role of nuclear Bcl-2 in the aged and oxidatively stressed central nervous system, where cell death and significant alterations of transcription factor activity have been reported (25Giardina C.

The obtained fragment was then digested with XhoI/EcoRI and re-cloned into pMKit-Neo. pMKitNeo-Bcl-2α was a kind gift of Dr. S. May, Bcl-2-cytochrome b5 and Bcl-2-MaoB were a kind gift of Dr. C. W. Distelhorst, FKBP38 was a kind gift of Dr. K. I. Nakayama. All SEAP vectors were purchased from Clontech. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293), mouse fibroblast cells (3T3), and human epithelial cells (HeLa) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) (PC12) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (HEK293-HeLa-3T3). All transfections were performed using a liposomal mediated plasmid introduction. The liposome used was DMRIE-C (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells at 40 to 50% confluence received a total of 1.2 pmol/ml of DNA coupled to DMRIE-C at a ratio of 1:3 and diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). 3 h post-transfection, the liposome/DNA mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium and the cells were allowed at least 24 h of recovery. Stable transfectants were generated using the same transfection technique, followed by the addition of the proper selective antibiotic to the culture medium (Geneticin, Invitrogen). The secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay (Clontech) was used as a measure of transcription factor activity. Plasmids containing the SEAP gene only or the SEAP gene downstream of enhancer sequences specific to binding of NFκB, API, CRE, or NFAT were cotransfected with Bcl-2, Bcl-2-ΔBH4, or Bcl-2-ΔTM. 48 h later, SEAP activity was assayed directly from the culture medium using the Great Escape Chemiluminescent Detection Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). SEAP levels are a direct measurement of the effect of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 mutants on the enhancer activity. For gene expression verification, cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease mixture inhibitors (Sigma). Following lysis, cells were sonicated for 15 s, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. For protein localization experiments, nuclear and non-nuclear fractions were prepared using the Biovision Inc. Cytosolic/Nuclear fractionation kit according to manufacturer's suggested protocol (Mountain View, CA). Briefly, cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer and lysed with the proprietary detergent from the kit. Samples were spun at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, spun 10 min at 1000 × g to remove any remaining nuclei, and then transferred to a new tube (non-nuclear protein fraction). The original pellet was resuspended in Sigma's Nuclei pure prep lysis buffer (Sigma) and nuclei isolation was carried out following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, following a 10-min incubation in lysis buffer the nuclei were layered on a 1.8 m sucrose gradient and spun at 15,500 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were re-suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline and spun at 20,800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1% protease mixture inhibitors), and sonicated 15 s (nuclear proteins). Protein samples containing 30 μg of proteins as determined by the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% gels, followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose-backed membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then incubated with 1:1000 (v:v) anti-Bcl-2 polyclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), 1:10,000 anti-FKBP38 polyclonal antibody (kind gift of Dr. K. I. Nakayama), 1:50,000 anti-β-actin monoclonal Antibody (Sigma), 1:2000 PanLamin (kind gift of Dr. A. Fields), or 1:2000 IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). This initial incubation was then followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) against rabbit IgG (for polyclonal primaries) or mouse IgG (for monoclonal primaries). Detection was achieved using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 12-well plates. Following transient transfection as described above, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or washed and viewed live in normal growth media without phenol red. Organelle markers used for imaging mitochondria, ER, and nucleus include MitoTracker Deep Red, ER-Tracker, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, respectively (Molecular Probes Inc.). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 META advanced laser scanning confocal microscope with laser excitations at 633 (MitoTracker), 351 (ER Tracker and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), 488 nm (GFP), and long pass filters >650 nm (MitoTracker), between 385 and 545 nm (ER Tracker and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and >505 nm (GFP). All imaging analysis was performed using Meta-morph imaging software version 6.0 (Universal Imaging Corp. Downingtown, PA). DNA Constructs—The GeneSwitch™ system (Invitrogen) is a gene regulation system that controls gene expression through treatment with an anti-progestin hormone. This system consists of two main genes: one encoding the GeneSwitch™ regulator protein driven by a constitutive promoter and another encoding for the inducible gene of interest. pSwitch (the plasmid vector encoding the GeneSwitch™ regulator protein) and pGene/V5-His/lacZ (an inducible plasmid vector encoding for β-galactosidase and serving as an induction control) were purchased as part of the GeneSwitch™ Kit (Invitrogen,). pGene/V5-His/mbcl-2α, the inducible plasmid vector containing our gene of interest was produced as follows: 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NotI were inserted into the Bcl-2 gene by PCR from its original vector, pMKITNeo/mbcl-2α. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the EcoRI/NotI site of the inducible plasmid vector pGene/V5-HisC provided in the GeneSwitch™ kit. For selection in mammalian cells, pSwitch contains a hygromycin resistance gene, and pGene/V5-His/lacZ and pGene/V5-His/mbcl-2α contain a Zeocin resistance gene. Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—To use the GeneSwitch™ gene expression system in PC12 cells, double stable PC12 cell lines expressing both the pSwitch vector as well as the inducible vector (pGene/V5-His/lacZ or pGene/V5-His/mbcl-2α) were created as follows: pSwitch was transfected into PC12 cells as described above. 48 h post-transfection, 100 μg/ml hygromycin was added to the culture medium to select for the positively transfected cells, all other cells die. Cells were kept in culture with hygromycin for about 1 month to ensure complete stability of the PC12-pSwitch cell line. Following this initial step, the PC12-pSwitch cells were transfected with the inducible plasmid vector (pGene/V5-His/lacZ or pGene/V5-His/mbcl-2α). 48 h following this second transfection, 400 μg/ml Zeocin was added to the culture medium (already containing Hygromycin) to select for positively transfected cells. Stability was reached 1 month later, after which the double stable cell lines were cultured in regular culture medium containing 100 μg/ml each of hygromycin and Zeocin for maintenance of transfected plasmid vectors. Bcl-2 Inhibits NFκB Transcriptional Activity—We have previously shown that Bcl-2, when overexpressed by transient transfection in PC12 cells, significantly decreases NFκB activity, as measured by the SEAP reporter gene system (30Massaad C.A. Taglialatela G. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We have also shown that this phenomenon is independent of Bcl-2 S70 phosphorylation, suggesting that the effect of Bcl-2 on NFκB transcription has different phosphorylation requirements than its anti-apoptotic activity (30Massaad C.A. Taglialatela G. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here we confirmed and extended that original observation as reported in Fig. 1A, which shows a dose-response curve illustrating that the Bcl-2-promoted decrease of NFκB activity as measured by the SEAP reporter gene assay is proportional to the amount of transfected/expressed Bcl-2 (Fig. 1B). Based on these results, 0.6 pmol of Bcl-2 expression vector was used in all further transfection experiments. Fig. 1C shows a time course experiment where NFκB activity in PC12 cells was determined by the SEAP reporter gene assay as a function of time after transient Bcl-2 transfection. A significant reduction of NFκB transcriptional activity was observed starting 24 h after Bcl-2 transfection and further increased 48 h after Bcl-2 transfection. This time course was consistent with the appearance of detectable levels of exogenously expressed Bcl-2 after transient transfection (Fig. 1D). Based on these results, 48 h after Bcl-2 transfection was selected as an end point in all further experiments. Inhibition of NFκB Activity by Bcl-2 Depends on the Integrity of the Transmembrane Domain of Bcl-2—To identify Bcl-2 domains required for affecting NFκB transcriptional activity, we used Bcl-2 deletion mutants lacking either the BH4 domain (amino acids 1-24, Bcl-2-ΔBH4) or the transmembrane domain TM (amino acids 223-247, Bcl-2-ΔTM). The BH4 domain is responsible for Bcl-2 interactions with heterologous proteins (6Reed J.C. Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Cory S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 32Denis G.V. Yu Q. Ma P.

Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol.

Fig. 2B shows the effect of these mutants on NFκB activity as determined by the SEAP reporter gene assay. Bcl-2-ΔBH4 effectively inhibited NFκB activity, indicating that the BH4 domain is not involved. On the other hand, Bcl-2-ΔTM failed to decrease NFκB activity, indicating the necessity for Bcl-2 to be anchored to a membrane to affect NFκB transcription. As both the BH4 and TM domains have been shown to be necessary for mediating the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2, their different requirement in the Bcl-2-mediated decrease of NFκB transcriptional activity further suggests that this effect of Bcl-2 is acted in a fashion independent of its classical role as an anti-apoptotic protein (30Massaad C.A. Taglialatela G. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The representative Western blot in Fig. 2C shows the typical expression of the Bcl-2 mutants used in these experiments 48 h after transient transfection. Bcl-2-ΔTM expression was consistently higher than Bcl-2-ΔBH4 or wild type Bcl-2. However, because Bcl-2-ΔTM failed to show any effect on NFκB-mediated transcription, these results would rule out the possibility that the differential effect of the two Bcl-2 mutants may be because of different degrees of expression following transient transfection. This concept is further illustrated in the dose-response curves shown in Fig. 2D. Bcl-2-ΔTM did not inhibit transcription factor activity at any of the doses of transfected DNA used in these experiments, whereas Bcl-2-ΔBH4 decreases NFκB-promoted transactivation at all concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Bcl-2 Inhibits Multiple Transcription Factors and Promoter Activities—To investigate whether the reported transcriptional effect of Bcl-2 was limited to NFκB, a similar experimental paradigm as above was applied to cells transiently co-transfected with a SEAP reporter gene vector enhanced by AP1, CRE, or NFAT. An additional SEAP construct devoid of any enhancer element but still retaining a minimal promoter from SV40 thymidine kinase (pTAL-SEAP) was also employed. Fig. 3A shows the results from these experiments. All transcription factors and promoters used were similarly affected by the cotransfected Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 mutant expression vectors: wild type Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-ΔBH4 decreased SEAP release into the culture medium, whereas Bcl-2-ΔTM had no effect, regardless of the enhancer present upstream of the TAL promoter. The Western blots shown in Fig. 3B confirmed that all forms of Bcl-2 were expressed at comparable levels, thus again ruling out the possibility that the diverse effects of the different Bcl-2 mutants may be because of varying levels of expression. Furthermore, Fig. 3C shows that transient co-expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-2-ΔBH4, or Bcl-2-ΔTM with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of a rat full-length promoter (angiotensin II) returned similar results in terms of transcriptional effects elicited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 mutants. These results suggest that the transcriptional effect exerted by Bcl-2 is not limited to NFκB activity; rather, it extends to other transcription factors and minimal (pTAL) or full-length promoters. In addition, the angiotensin II promoter/luciferase construct was also affected, further indicating that the reported transcriptional effect of Bcl-2 is not limited to the SEAP reporter gene constructs (all of which share the pTAL minimal promoter), nor to the SEAP gene itself. Furthermore, to rule out the possibility of an effect limited to PC12 cells, all experiments were repeated using NIH-3T3, HEK 293, and HeLa cells (Fig. 3, D and E), yielding similar results. Restricting Bcl-2 Expression to the Mitochondrion or ER Abolishes the Effects on Transcription on Bcl-2—Because deletion of the TM domain negates the reduction induced by transiently transfected Bcl-2 on transcription factor activity, we reasoned that anchoring of Bcl-2 to cellular membranes is necessary for allowing this effect of Bcl-2. To further characterize this phenomenon, we investigated whether any of the known subcellular localizations of Bcl-2 (mitochondrion, ER, or nuclear membranes) were primarily involved. For this purpose, we used two Bcl-2 mutants: Bcl-2-MaoB, specifically targeted to the mitochondrial membrane, and Bcl-2-cytochrome b5, specifically targeted to the ER membrane (36Wang N.S. Unkila M.T. Reineks E.Z. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44117-44128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). When we co-transfected the NFκB-SEAP reporter construct with Bcl-2-MaoB or Bcl-2-cytochrome b5 (Fig. 4B) we observed no effect on NFκB activity as compared with wild type Bcl-2, thus ruling out both the mitochondria and ER as sites of action for effects on transcriptional activity of the Bcl-2. This result suggested that Bcl-2 localized at the nuclear membrane may be primarily involved in decreasing transcription. Currently, there is no Bcl-2 mutant specifically targeted to the nuclear membrane available and therefore we could not test this conclusion directly. However, this idea is further supported by the results shown in Fig. 4C, where we determined by Western blot the subcellular distribution of wild type Bcl-2, Bcl-2-ΔBH4, and Bcl-2-ΔTM 48 h after transient transfection. Our results indicate that while wild type Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-ΔBH4 (both of which affect transcription factor activity) are significantly present in the nuclear fraction, Bcl-2-ΔTM (which is ineffective) is predominantly detected in the non-nuclear fraction. In addition, comparing stable to transient transfections of Bcl-2, we found that stable expression of Bcl-2 does not lead to a decrease in NFκB activity (Fig. 4D), and that this lack of effect is coupled with localization of Bcl-2 solely in the non-nuclear fraction (Fig. 4E). These results further support the idea that Bcl-2 needs to be localized at the nuclear membrane to affect transcription factor activity. FKBP38 Reverses the Effect on Transcription Factor Activity by Bcl-2—To further confirm the involvement of nuclear Bcl-2 in decreasing transcription factor activity, we tested the eff"
https://openalex.org/W2108626118,"Camptothecins constitute a novel class of chemotherapeutics that selectively target DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) by reversibly stabilizing a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. This cytotoxic mechanism contrasts with that of platinum drugs, such as cisplatin, which induce inter- and intrastrand DNA adducts. In vitro combination studies using platinum drugs combined with Top1 poisons, such as topotecan, showed a schedule-dependent synergistic activity, with promising results in the clinic. However, whereas the molecular mechanism of these single agents may be relatively well understood, the mode of action of these chemotherapeutic agents in combination necessitates a more complete understanding. Indeed, we recently reported that a functional homologous recombination pathway is required for cisplatin and topotecan synergy yet represses the synergistic toxicity of 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl cytidine in combination with topotecan (van Waardenburg, R. C., de Jong, L. A., van Delft, F., van Eijndhoven, M. A., Bohlander, M., Bjornsti, M. A., Brouwer, J., and Schellens, J. H. (2004) Mol. Cancer Ther. 3, 393–402). Here we provide direct evidence for Pt-1,3-d(GTG) poisoning of Top1 in vitro and demonstrate that persistent Pt-DNA adducts correlate with increased covalent Top1-DNA complexes in vivo. This contrasts with a lack of persistent lesions induced by the alkylating agent bis[chloroethyl]nitrosourea, which exhibits only additive activity with topotecan in a range of cell lines. In human IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells, the synergistic activity of cisplatin with topotecan requires processive DNA polymerization, whereas overexpression of Top1 enhances yeast cell sensitivity to cisplatin. These results indicate that the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin is due, in part, to poisoning of Top1, which is exacerbated in the presence of topotecan. Camptothecins constitute a novel class of chemotherapeutics that selectively target DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) by reversibly stabilizing a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. This cytotoxic mechanism contrasts with that of platinum drugs, such as cisplatin, which induce inter- and intrastrand DNA adducts.

However, whereas the molecular mechanism of these single agents may be relatively well understood, the mode of action of these chemotherapeutic agents in combination necessitates a more complete understanding. Indeed, we recently reported that a functional homologous recombination pathway is required for cisplatin and topotecan synergy yet represses the synergistic toxicity of 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl cytidine in combination with topotecan (van Waardenburg, R. C., de Jong, L. A., van Delft, F., van Eijndhoven, M. A., Bohlander, M., Bjornsti, M. A., Brouwer, J., and Schellens, J. H. (2004) Mol. Cancer Ther. 3, 393–402). Here we provide direct evidence for Pt-1,3-d(GTG) poisoning of Top1 in vitro and demonstrate that persistent Pt-DNA adducts correlate with increased covalent Top1-DNA complexes in vivo. This contrasts with a lack of persistent lesions induced by the alkylating agent bis[chloroethyl]nitrosourea, which exhibits only additive activity with topotecan in a range of cell lines. In human IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells, the synergistic activity of cisplatin with topotecan requires processive DNA polymerization, whereas overexpression of Top1 enhances yeast cell sensitivity to cisplatin. These results indicate that the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin is due, in part, to poisoning of Top1, which is exacerbated in the presence of topotecan.

Top1 catalyzes changes in the linkage of DNA strands via the formation of a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. A phosphotyrosyl linkage of Top1 to the 3′-end of the cleaved DNA strand allows the free 5′ DNA end to rotate. The covalent Top1-DNA intermediate is the cellular target of camptothecin (CPT) and clinically useful analogs, such as topotecan (TPT) and SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11) (reviewed in Refs. 2Champoux J.J.

These Top1 poisons reversibly stabilize the covalent Top1-DNA intermediate by inhibiting DNA religation. During S-phase, these ternary Top1-DNA-drug intermediates are converted into potentially lethal lesions, which induce cell cycle arrest and cell death. TPT and CPT-11 have been approved for first and second line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and second line treatment for ovarian cancer (7Wall M.E. Med. Res.

As with most chemotherapeutics, these CPT analogs are administered in combination with other agents (10Fiorica J.V.

Although the molecular mechanisms of single agents may be well understood, the combination of two or more agents often induces surprising interactions, which necessitates a more complete understanding of the cytotoxic lesions induced by such combinations for optimal efficacy. For example, in vitro combination experiments using platinum agents, such as cisplatin (cDDP), carboplatin, or oxaliplatin, with a Top1 poison, TPT or CPT-11, demonstrated a sequence-dependent synergy in various human tumor cell lines (14Ma J. Maliepaard M. Nooter K. Boersma A.W. Verweij J. Stoter G. Schellens J.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Goldwasser F. Bozec L.

Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 687-693PubMed Google Scholar). The most cytotoxic sequence was a platinum drug followed by a Top1 poison. Moreover, chemotherapeutic regimens that combine TPT/CPT-11 with platinum drug are showing some promise in the clinic (see Refs. 17Rowinsky E.K. Kaufmann S.H. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: S20-11-S20-26Google Scholar, 18Rowinsky E.K. Kaufmann S.H. Baker S.D. Grochow L.B. Chen T.L. Peereboom D. Bowling M.K. Sartorius S.E. Ettinger D.S. Forastiere A.A. Donehower R.C. J.

However, the lack of insight into the mechanism of synergy hampers the optimal design of clinical studies based on the combination of platinum drugs and Top1 poisons. We recently reported genetic evidence that homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for the synergistic cytotoxicity of certain drug/Top1 poison combinations (20van Waardenburg R.C. de Jong L.A. van Delft F. van Eijndhoven M.A. Bohlander M. Bjornsti M.A. Brouwer J. Schellens J.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Indeed, a functional HR pathway was required for the synergistic activity of platinum or X-irradiation in combination with TPT yet acted to suppress the synergistic combination of 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl cytidine (ara-C) with TPT. Recent structural and biochemical studies indicate that ara-C-substituted DNA acts as an endogenous Top1 poison to increase the stability of the covalent Top1-DNA intermediate (21Pourquier P.

Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12461-12466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies derive from earlier reports that endogenous DNA lesions, such as abasic sites, mismatches, and oxidative damage (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine), enhance the stability of Top1 and/or Top2 covalent complexes (23Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Sabourin M. Osheroff N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the contrary effects of HR on the synergistic activity of cDDP plus TPT versus ara-C plus TPT lead us to ask whether cDDP adducts would also act to poison Top1 or induce distinct DNA lesions that trigger aberrant repair by the HR pathways (20van Waardenburg R.C. de Jong L.A. van Delft F. van Eijndhoven M.A. Bohlander M. Bjornsti M.A. Brouwer J. Schellens J.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). cDDP may interact with nucleophiles in many cellular components, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. However, it is generally accepted that the formation of intra- and interstrand platinum-DNA adducts is the underlying cause of the cytotoxic activity of platinum drugs, such as cDDP, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin (27Ho Y.P. Au-Yeung S.C. To K.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 633-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 28Reedijk J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3611-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, whereas much is known about the repair of these DNA adducts, the mechanisms by which Pt-DNA adducts induce cell death remain poorly understood. Here we report that the synergistic activity of cDDP with TPT required processive DNA polymerization and that the formation of persistent Pt-DNA adducts in human cancer cell lines correlates with increased covalent Top1-DNA complexes. We further provide direct evidence for Pt-1,3-d(GTG) poisoning of Top1 in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that the cytotoxic activity of cDDP derives, in part, from poisoning of Top1, which is exacerbated in the presence of TPT. Moreover, these findings suggest that the distinct effects of HR on the synergistic activity of cDDP/TPT versus ara-C/TPT may be a consequence of differences in the persistence of covalent complex stabilization rather than the ability of either agent to transiently poison Top1. Plasmids, Cell Lines, and Drugs—IGROV-1 (ovarian adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and WiDr (colon cancer) human cell lines were cultured under standard conditions in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 10 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine. The nucleotide excision repair-defective yeast strain, W303rad4, was previously described (20van Waardenburg R.C. de Jong L.A. van Delft F. van Eijndhoven M.A. Bohlander M. Bjornsti M.A. Brouwer J. Schellens J.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The yeast TOP1 vector, YCpGAL1-TOP1·L, expresses yeast DNA topoisomerase I from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (29Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation and culture conditions were as described (20van Waardenburg R.C. de Jong L.A. van Delft F. van Eijndhoven M.A. Bohlander M. Bjornsti M.A. Brouwer J. Schellens J.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Topotecan (TPT) was from Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (King of Prussia, PA), SN-38, the active metabolite of CPT-11, was obtained from Aventis (Alfortville, France), and cDDP was either from TEVA Pharma (Mijdrecht, the Netherlands) or the kind gift of J. Reedijk (Leiden University). Bis[chloroethyl]nitrosourea (BCNU) was from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whereas ara-C was from Amersham Biosciences. N-Methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was from Sigma, and bleomycin (Bleo) was obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute. A 137Cs source was used with a dose rate of ∼1 gray/min Drug Cytotoxicity Assays—IGROV-1, MCF-7, and WiDr cells, treated with the indicated agents, were assayed for cell viability using the sulforhodamine B assay as described (14Ma J. Maliepaard M. Nooter K. Boersma A.W. Verweij J. Stoter G. Schellens J.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For each experiment, cells were plated with a density of 1500 cells in 200 μl per well in 96-well plates. Cells were then exposed to increasing concentrations of drug or treated with increasing doses of X-rays to determine IC50 values at day 3 or 5. On the basis of the IC50 values of the single agents, a constant drug ratio of agent 1/agent 2 was used in combination according to the following schedule: exposure with the first agent for 2 days, followed by co-treatment with the second agent for an additional 3 days. Cell viability was determined using the sulforhodamine B assay. This prolonged treatment schedule was used to avoid potential complications of the sulforhodamine B assay associated with short term drug exposure. Drug combination data were evaluated according to the median effect analysis, based on the multiple drug effect equation (30Peters G.J. van der Wilt C.L. van Moorsel C.J. Kroep J.R. Bergman A.M. Ackland S.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 227-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 31Chou T.C. Motzer R.J. Tong Y. Bosl G.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The combination index (CI) for each fraction killed was calculated using the equation, CI = d1/D1 + d2/D2 + ((d1d2)/(D1D2)), where D1 and D2 are the doses of drug 1 and 2, which by themselves result in a given fraction killed, and d1 and d2 are the doses resulting in the same fraction killed in combination. The CI values were interpreted as defining an antagonistic effect if CI > 1.2; an additive effect if 1.2 > CI > 0.8; and a synergistic effect if CI < 0.8. 32P Postlabeling Assay—The quantification of platinum-DNA intrastrand 1,2-d(GG) and 1,2-d(AG) adducts was performed with the 32P postlabeling assay according to Ref. 32Pluim D.

Subconfluent IGROV-1 cells were incubated for 2 h with 55 μm cDDP, with or without 25 nm SN-38, washed, and subsequently cultured in medium with or without 25 nm SN-38 until DNA isolation. Cells were harvested at 0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h after removal of cDDP and processed as in Ref. 32Pluim D. Maliepaard M. van Waardenburg R.C. Beijnen J.H. Schellens J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. Top1 DNA Binding Assays—Oligonucleotides containing a unique 1,3-d(GTG) site (5′-CTAAAAACACATGTGCATATCTTC-3′), untreated or treated with cDDP as described (33Shivji M.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 373-392PubMed Google Scholar), were annealed to a 5′-32P-end-labeled complementary strand (5′-GAAGATATGCACATGTGTTTTTAG-3′). This oligonucleotide lacks the canonical high affinity Top1 cleavage site. Approximately 32 fmol/reaction of damaged or undamaged double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with 0, 125, or 250 ng of purified human Top1 protein (Topogen, Columbus, OH) in the presence of 0.4 μg/μl CPT, 5% Me2SO, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, in a final 20-μl volume at room temperature. Following the addition of loading buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), protein-DNA complexes were resolved in a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Top1 Catalytic Activity Assays—Nuclear extracts were isolated from subconfluent IGROV-1 cells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in NucA buffer (1 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), diluted 1:10 with NucA buffer supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Following centrifugation at 4 °C, the nuclear pellet was washed with NucA buffer and resuspended in 0.2 volumes of NucA buffer and an equal volume of NucC buffer (1 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.4, 550 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the clarified nuclear extract was adjusted to a final concentration of 43% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Top1 catalytic activity was assessed in a plasmid DNA relaxation assay, using either untreated or platinated pBR322 DNA as substrate. Pt-pBR322 DNA was prepared by incubating 25 μg of DNA with 33.33 μm cDDP overnight at room temperature, followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. 250 ng of supercoiled pBR322 or Pt-pBR322 DNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of IGROV-1 cell nuclear extracts in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 85 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were treated with proteinase K and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis in the absence of ethidium bromide. However, to facilitate detection of nicked DNA (34Champoux J.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar), the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and subjected to an additional 3 h of electrophoresis. Intact DNA topoisomers and nicked circles were quantitated using the Eagle-eye II system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and TINA software (Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH). Oligonucleotide-based DNA Cleavage Assay—The same oligonucleotides described for the DNA binding assays above were used to assess DNA cleavage by human Top1. However, in this case, the scissile strand (with or without a platinum adduct) was 3′-end labeled with [32P]cordycepin using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a CoCl2-free buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6, 0.4 mm MgCl2). Excess unincorporated 32P-label was removed by centrifugation through a G25-Sephadex quick spin column. The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to the complementary unlabeled strand in equimolar amounts by heating for 5 min at 95 °C followed by cooling down to room temperature. Cleavage reactions (10 μl) were performed at room temperature by incubating 1 pmol of DNA (with or without platinum adduct) with or without 50 μm CPT and equal concentrations of purified human Top1 (as described in Ref. 35Woo M.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3813-3822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml gelatin. Reactions were terminated after 10 s and 5, 10, and 20 min by the addition of 3.3 volumes of loading buffer (USB-stop buffer) followed by heating to 70 °C. Cleavage products were resolved in denaturing 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplex of Enzyme (ICE) Assay—To quantitate covalent Top1-DNA complexes formed in drug treated IGROV-1 cells, we used a modification of the ICE assay (36Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were treated for 2 days at the IC50 of the first agent followed by a 30-min co-incubation with 0.5 μm TPT. In the reverse schedule, cells were incubated with the IC50 of TPT followed by the IC50 of cDDP for 30 min. For 1-h treatment schedules, cells were treated with 5× IC50 of the first agent, followed with 0.5 μm TPT for the last 30 min. For all schedules, cells were lysed with 1% sarkosyl preheated to 37 °C. Following the addition of an equal volume of 3 m NaSCN, the lysates were overlaid on a CsCl step gradient (1.82, 1.72, 1.50, and 1.35 g/ml) and centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor at 31,000 rpm, 20 °C for 16 h. The upper layer of CsCl (1.35 g/ml) also contained 3 m NaSCN. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected, and 50-μl aliquots were slot-blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Each blot contained a 10-point calibration curve of nuclear extracts as an internal control for blot-to-blot variation. DNA topoisomerase I protein was detected using the polyclonal human anti-human Top1 scleroderma antibody (Topogen, Columbus, OH), visualized with autoradiography using ECL chemiluminiscence (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified using the Eagle-eye II system (Stratagene). Relative levels of Top1-DNA covalent complexes obtained with various drug combinations were quantitated relative to the amount obtained with TPT alone. Yeast Cell Viability Assays—W303rad4 cells, transformed with YCp-GAL1-TOP1·L or pRS415 vector control, were grown overnight at 28 °C in selective media (S.C.-leucine) supplemented with 2% galactose to A600 = 1.0 and stored at -80 °C in 250-μl fractions. Thawed cells were grown overnight in S.C.-leucine + galactose to an A600 value of 0.8–1.2. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in water, and 1-ml fractions were incubated with various concentrations of cDDP for 2 h. Aliquots were 10-fold serially diluted and plated onto S.C.-leucine +galactose plates, and the number of viable cells forming colonies was determined after incubation at 28 °C. Schedule-dependent Synergy of cDDP, Bleo, Ara-C, or X-ray with TPT in Human Cancer Cell Lines—TPT, a water-soluble analog of CPT, and SN-38, the active metabolite of the prodrug CPT-11, have demonstrated considerable activity against a broad spectrum of adult and pediatric malignancies. These Top1 poisons also exhibit synergistic cytotoxic activity when used in combination with a wide range of DNA-damaging agents, including platinum drugs, Bleo, ara-C, and x-rays (14Ma J.

In the case of the nucleoside analogue ara-C, incorporation into DNA induces a structural change that increases the stability of Top1-DNA complexes, potentially acting as a Top1 poison (21Pourquier P.

However, there is considerably less understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction of these other agents with TPT. We recently reported that the synergistic activity of cDDP or x-ray with TPT in paired isogenic hamster cell lines was dependent on the presence of functional homologous recombination pathways. In contrast, a defect in homologous recombination enhanced the synergistic interactions of ara-C with TPT (20van Waardenburg R.C. de Jong L.A. van Delft F. van Eijndhoven M.A. Bohlander M. Bjornsti M.A. Brouwer J. Schellens J.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Given the contrary effects of homologous recombination on cell sensitivity to these drug combinations, we asked whether poisoning of Top1 by platinated DNA adducts also contributed to the synergistic activity of these agents. In addition to ara-C and platinum drugs, such as cisplatin (cDDP), we also included comparisons with other DNA-damaging agents, including X-rays, the alkylating agents BCNU and MNNG and Bleo. Based on the IC50 values of single agents obtained with a human ovarian carcinoma cell line IGROV-1 (shown for cDDP, TPT, and BCNU in Fig. 1 and summarized for all agents in Table I), the synergistic activity of these agents with TPT was examined. In drug combination experiments, the first agent (cDDP, x-ray, Bleo, ara-C, BCNU, or MNNG) was combined with TPT at a constant molar ratio, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The median effect analysis (30Peters G.J. van der Wilt C.L. van Moorsel C.J.

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been a valuable model system for studies of genome surveillance and checkpoint mechanisms. These systems control cell cycle progression while regulating DNA repair and DNA replication. Two distinct DNA structure checkpoints, the DNA replication checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint, have been defined in fission yeast (1Rhind N. Russell P. J.

The DNA damage checkpoint, which responds to double strand breaks and other abnormal DNA structures, functions primarily in G2 phase. The DNA replication checkpoint, which is activated when replication forks stall, functions specifically in the DNA synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle. Central elements of these two checkpoints include two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase family members, Rad3 (an ataxia telangiectasia-related homolog) and Tel1 (an ataxia telangiectasia homolog), as well as the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 checkpoint clamp and a checkpoint clamp loader that contains Rad17 and four replication factor-C subunits. Rad3 acts in a complex with Rad26 to phosphorylate the effector protein kinases Chk1 and Cds1 (4Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat.

Checkpoint adaptor or mediator proteins are required to transmit the checkpoint signal from the sensor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases to the effector kinases Cds1 and Chk1. In fission yeast, Crb2 is the adaptor protein that connects the Rad3-Rad26 complex to Chk1 (15Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2138-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas Mrc1 (mediator of replication checkpoint) mediates signal transduction from Rad3-Rad26 to Cds1 (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In both fission yeast and budding yeast, Mrc1 was identified as a vital component of the system that activates Cds1 (or its budding yeast homolog Rad53) in response to replication arrest (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Cds1 phosphorylation by Rad3-Rad26 is mediated by an interaction involving the forkhead-associated domain of Cds1 with Mrc1 (7Tanaka K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32079-32086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Genetic and physiological studies indicate that Mrc1 also has a role in preserving genome integrity that is independent of the effector kinases of the replication checkpoint (19Xu H. Boone C. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7082-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J.

Studies in fission yeast and budding yeast have shown that Mrc1 is a physiologically important substrate of checkpoint sensor kinases (20Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Zhao H. Tanaka K. Nogochi E. Nogochi C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8395-8403Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Mrc1 is phosphorylated in response to replication arrest in a Rad3/Tel1-dependent manner (23Zhao H. Tanaka K. Nogochi E. Nogochi C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8395-8403Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two (S/T)Q clusters are required for the electrophoretic mobility shift induced by this phosphorylation. Threonine 645, a site in the first (S/T)Q cluster, is required to mediate interaction with the forkhead-associated domain of Cds1. Serine 604, located in the second (S/T)Q cluster, appears to be involved in the stable association of Mrc1 with chromatin. These findings identify two mechanisms of controlling the function of Mrc1 in the replication checkpoint response. The apparent vertebrate homolog of Mrc1 is Claspin. Claspin was first identified in Xenopus egg extracts through its association with Chk1 (24Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It was initially surprising that Mrc1 and Claspin interact with different effector kinases, but this pattern is consistent with a large number of studies that have shown Chk1 having a role in the replication checkpoint in Xenopus and mammals (25Canman C.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R121-R124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Claspin is phosphorylated in response to replication fork arrest in Xenopus egg extracts. This phosphorylation is required for Claspin's association with Chk1 and for Chk1 activation (24Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Claspin associates with chromatin during S phase in a manner that depends upon the pre-replication complex and the DNA replication protein Cdc45, but not on the ataxia telangiectasia-related protein or replication protein A (26Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Claspin's chromatin association increases in response to replication arrest. These findings are consistent with the evidence that Mrc1 co-precipitates with Cdc45 in budding yeast cell lysates (21Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and with chromatin immunoprecipitation studies that showed that Mrc1 moves along chromosomes in conjunction with DNA replication proteins during S phase (20Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that Mrc1 is a non-essential replisome subunit that is ideally placed to mediate the interaction between sensor and effector kinases at stalled replication forks. Although there is evidence that Mrc1 associates with replication forks and interacts with Cdc45, it is not known if the interaction with Cdc45 is required to target Mrc1 to replication forks, nor is it known if Mrc1 associates directly with DNA. In this study we have investigated whether Mrc1 directly associates with DNA. We report that the N-terminal half of Mrc1 binds to DNA directly in vitro and displays a higher affinity for branched DNA structures. The DNA binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA binding domain; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HU, hydroxyurea. of Mrc1 was mapped to the 160–317 region of Mrc1, and we have identified two amino acids that are critical for the DNA binding activity of Mrc1. These findings correlate remarkably well with a very recent report that the 1–340 region of human Mrc1 binds to branched DNA structures in vitro (27Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Subramanian D. Croteau D.L. Hutsell S.Q. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39289-39295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have found that deletion of the DBD or the mutation of specific residues in the Mrc1 DBD renders cells sensitive to replication fork arrest and unable to properly arrest division in response to fork arrest. These findings suggest that the direct association of Mrc1 with branched DNA at stalled forks is needed for efficient function of the replication checkpoint. Fission Yeast Strains, Growth Medium, and Genetic and Molecular Methods—Standard growth media and general biochemical and genetic methods were used. Yeast cultures were grown at 32 °C in YES medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, and supplements) or Edinburgh minimal medium unless indicated otherwise. Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was used at the indicated concentration. To mutate Lys-235 and Lys-236 to glutamate at the mrc1 genomic locus, a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the indicated site(s) in the pUC28-Mrc1 plasmid. PCR was then used to amplify the 270–1150-nucleotide region of mrc1. Purified PCR products were transformed into a mrc1::ura4+ strain that had ura4+ inserted at nucleotide 660. To delete the region encoding the DNA binding domain (160–284 amino acid) of mrc1, products from overlapping PCRs were purified and transformed into the same strain. 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant transformants were picked, and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Other regions of mrc1 were sequenced to detect spurious mutations. The following strains were used in these studies: PR109, mrc1+; HZ3484, mrc1::ura4+; KT2786, mrc1::kanMX6; HZ3486, mrc1Δ160-284; HZ3488, mrc1Δ221-284; HZ3489, mrc1-K235EK236E; KT2791, mrc1-13myc; HZ3494, mrc1Δ160-284-13myc; HZ3491, mrc1Δ160-284 chk1::ura4+; HZ3492 mrc1-K235EK236E chk1::ura4+. All of the strains were leu1-32 ura4-D18. Protein Purification—GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). GST fusion proteins were pulled down by GSH beads (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, overnight at 4 °C. Purified proteins were quantified and used in electrophoresis mobility shift assays. To remove GST, purified proteins were incubated with an thrombin-agarose conjugate (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. The cleaved GST moiety in the supernatant was removed by a second incubation with GSH beads. DNA Labeling—Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32P]ATP with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The free unincorporated [32P]ATP was removed in a G25 spin column (Roche Applied Science). To make different DNA structures for EMSA, the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to other oligonucleotides. The annealed products were purified by PAGE. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Purified proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled DNA for 15 min at 30 °C in 15 μl of binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The protein-DNA complex was separated from free probes in a 4.5% acrylamide gel. The electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C with constant voltage of 150 V. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested, washed, and then resuspended in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Cells were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, subjected to a vortex with glass beads for 5 min, and boiled again for 5 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 20000 × g. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were blotted with an anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Covance). Hydroxyurea (HU) Sensitivity and Checkpoint Studies—Cells were grown in a YES medium and then transferred to YES plates with HU at the indicated concentrations. Cells were grown for 2 days before being photographed. To study the significance of the DNA binding activity of Mrc1 in a DNA replication checkpoint, a PCR-based gene targeting method was used to delete chk1 in mrc1 DNA-binding mutants. To study the checkpoint function of Mrc1, log phase cells grown in a YES medium were treated with 12 mm HU for 6 h. Cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-3-phenylindole before microscopic analysis. DNA Binding Domain in Mrc1—In view of evidence that Mrc1 and Claspin are nuclear proteins that associate with replication forks (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Katou Y. Kanoh Y.

Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether Mrc1 binds directly to DNA. Full-length Mrc1 expressed in bacteria was insoluble; therefore, we expressed GST fusion proteins that contained the N-terminal 1–610 amino acids of Mrc1 or its C-terminal 560–1019 amino acids. The GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria as shown by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A). Equal amounts of the purified proteins were incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) made by annealing two 60-mer oligonucleotides. EMSAs showed that the 1–610 region of Mrc1 bound to dsDNA, whereas the 560–1019 fragment did not interact with dsDNA (Fig. 1B). The 1–610 fragment had little affinity for single-stranded DNA and did not show sequence specificity (data not shown). These results indicated that the 1–610 region of Mrc1 has a DNA binding domain. The Mrc1 DNA Binding Domain Is Localized in the 160–317 Region—To map the DNA binding domain in Mrc1 more precisely, different regions of Mrc1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins from bacteria and tested for their ability to bind the dsDNA substrate (Fig. 2B). The 1–317 region of Mrc1 bound to dsDNA approximately as well as the 1–610 fragment. The 1–447 and 1–499 region of Mrc1 showed similar binding affinity (data not shown), whereas the 1–250 and 284–499 regions only weakly interacted with the dsDNA substrate (Fig. 2A). Further refinement of these truncations showed that the 160–317 region of Mrc1 interacted with the dsDNA almost as well as the 1–610 and 1–317 fragments (Fig. 2A). These findings indicated that amino acids 160–317 are sufficient for Mrc1 DNA binding activity in vitro. To test if the GST moiety is involved in DNA binding, it was removed from the 1–317 fusion fragment. EMSA results indicated that 1–317 alone had the same DNA binding activity as its GST fusion counterpart (Fig. 2A). Substrate Specificity of Mrc1 DNA Binding Activity—We next investigated whether Mrc1 displays a preference for specific DNA structures. dsDNA, 3′-flap, or fork structures were prepared, and equal molar amounts of the substrates were incubated with increasing amounts of the 1–610 fragment and then analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 3). The branched DNA substrates displayed a stronger interaction with the 1–610 fragment, with an apparent preference for the fork substrate over the 3′-flap (Fig. 3A). To explore further whether Mrc1 preferentially associates with fork structures, competition experiments were performed with the DNA substrates. The 3′-flap structure was radiolabeled with [32P]ATP and co-incubated with increasing amounts of the three unlabeled DNA substrates in the presence of a fixed amount of the Mrc1 1–610 fragment. EMSA showed that the fork structure was the best competitor in this assay (Fig. 3B). The dsDNA structure was the poorest competitor. These experiments demonstrated that the DNA binding domain in the N-terminal region of Mrc1 prefers to interact with branched DNA structures. Functional Analysis of Mrc1 DNA Binding Domain—To test if the DNA binding domain of Mrc1 is important for Mrc1 function, the DNA sequences that encode the 160–284 region of Mrc1 were deleted from the mrc1+ genomic locus. Cells harboring either the wild type allele (mrc1+), the deletion allele (mrc1Δ), or DBD deletion mutants were compared for their resistance to HU (Fig. 4A). These experiments were done by plating serial dilutions of cells on YES media containing 2 or 5 mm HU. Compared with wild type, mrc1Δ cells were very sensitive to HU, as observed previously (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Mrc1 DNA binding domain (160–284 amino acids) also made cells sensitive to HU, although to a lesser extent than mrc1Δ cells (Fig. 4A). The sensitivity of mrc1Δ (160–284) cells was not due to mislocalization or destabilization of the mutant Mrc1 proteins, as this protein was nuclear localized (data not shown) and no less abundant than wild type Mrc1 (Fig. 4B). To further refine the analysis of this region of Mrc1, a smaller deletion allele that removed the sequences that encode amino acids 221–284 was created. This strain showed HU sensitivity that was similar to that of the mrc1Δ (160–284) strain (Fig. 4A). We therefore decided to focus our attention on two lysine residues at positions 235 and 236 in the 221–284 region. Mutations of these lysine residues to glutamate caused an HU-sensitive phenotype that was essentially identical to the 160–284 and 221–284 deletions (Fig. 4A). Thus, these amino acids in the DBD of Mrc1 are important for its function in promoting the survival of fork arrest caused by HU. To test if the K235E and K236E mutations impaired the DNA binding activity of Mrc1, the same mutations were introduced into the construct used to express the 1–610 region of Mrc1 as a GST fusion protein in bacteria. The mutant protein was expressed, purified, and tested for its ability to bind the dsDNA substrate. Consistent with their effect on HU sensitivity, the same mutations also severely decreased the DNA binding activity of Mrc1 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that the DNA binding activity of Mrc1 is important for cell survival in the presence of hydroxyurea. Mrc1 DNA Binding Domain Is Important for Its DNA Replication Checkpoint Activity—The function of Mrc1 in the DNA replication checkpoint can be tested by measuring the septation index in a genetic background that is deficient for the Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint effector kinase (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To specifically test the functional importance of the DNA binding domain of Mrc1 in its role as a checkpoint adaptor protein, we introduced the chk1Δ allele into the mrc1-K235EK236E strain and a mrc1Δ-(160–284) strain. The double mutants were grown in medium supplemented with 12 mm HU for 6 h, and their septation index was scored by 4′,6-diamidino-3-phenylindole staining and immunofluorescence (Fig. 5). Wild type and chk1Δ cells showed the elongated, mononuclear phenotype that is expected of cells that have an intact DNA replication checkpoint. However, in the chk1Δ background both the mrc1-K235EK236E and the mrc1Δ-(160–284) mutation caused a defect in the checkpoint arrest to HU. At the 6-h time point, ∼25% of the chk1Δ mrc1-K235EK236E and chk1Δ mrc1Δ-(160–284) cells displayed a “cut” phenotype in which DNA masses were unequally segregated or the nucleus was bisected by the septum, suggesting a partial defect in the DNA replication checkpoint (Fig. 5). From these findings we conclude that the DNA binding domain of Mrc1 plays an important role in the DNA replication checkpoint activity of Mrc1. Recent studies of Mrc1 in budding yeast and Claspin in Xenopus egg extracts have provided evidence that these proteins are components of the replisome or are closely associated with the replisome (20Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K.

Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Coupled with earlier studies that showed that Mrc1 is required for the replication checkpoint response (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), these observation raised the central question of whether Mrc1 or Claspin interact with DNA structures at the fork. In this study we have found that an N-terminal 1–610 fragment of fission yeast Mrc1 can directly bind to double strand DNA structures in vitro. This fragment of Mrc1 displayed a preference for branched DNA molecules, a finding consistent with the possibility that Mrc1 is a fork-binding protein. The DBD was further localized to a 150-amino acid fragment in the N terminus of Mrc1. These observations are remarkably concordant with a recent study of human Claspin (27Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Subramanian D. Croteau D.L. Hutsell S.Q. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39289-39295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that human Claspin is a ring-shaped protein that binds to branched DNA structures with high affinity in vitro. These studies implicated the 149–340 region in the N terminus of Claspin as containing sequences essential for DNA binding. As noted previously, Mrc1 and Claspin have very weak sequence similarity (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, when the DBD regions of S. pombe Mrc1 and human Claspin were compared, a region of apparently significant sequence similarity was detected (Fig. 6). Further comparison to other fungal Mrc1 and metazoan Claspin proteins revealed invariant or nearly invariant sequences in this region. Analysis of predicted secondary structures with the Jpred program revealed the presence of a helix-loop-helix motif in the region of highest sequence conservation (Fig. 6). A closely related structure, the helix-hairpin-helix, has been found in many proteins involved in DNA metabolism (29Doherty A.J. Serpell L.C. Ponting C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is thought to be a structural motif involved in the non-sequence-specific recognition of both single strand and double strand DNA (30Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). By analogy with the crystal structure of rat DNA polymerase β in a complex with a DNA template primer (31Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the helix-hairpin-helix motif binds to DNA via hydrogen bond-mediated interactions with the DNA-phosphate backbone (30Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). One protein that contains this motif is fission yeast Mus81, a component of the Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease that cleaves branched DNA structures related to Holliday junctions and replication forks in vitro (32Interthal H. Heyer W-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 263: 812-827Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Heyer W-D. Interthal H. Russell P. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 14: R56-R58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An important question raised by the identification of a DBD in human Claspin and fission yeast Mrc1 is whether this domain is required for the function of these proteins in vivo. We addressed this question by deleting the sequences that encode the DBD in the genomic copy of mrc1+ and by making point mutations in this domain. Strains harboring these mutations displayed decreased cell survival in the presence of hydroxyurea. These cells also displayed a defective DNA replication checkpoint arrest in the presence of hydroxyurea. These phenotypes point to the functional importance of the DBD. However, it should be noted that the phenotypes of the DBD mutants are not as severe as those observed in mrc1Δ mutants (17Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Presumably, the DBD mutants have retained a partial ability to interact with forks and activate Cds1, perhaps through an association with DNA replication proteins or additional contacts with DNA. One possibility is that a “DBD-less” Mrc1 can interact with forks through an association with Cdc45, although we have been unable to replicate in fission yeast an interaction between Cdc45 and Mrc1 that was found in budding yeast (21Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In any case, our studies clearly demonstrate that an intact DBD domain is important for the function of Mrc1 as a protein that protects genome integrity when replication forks are arrested, and, by inference, it is likely that the conserved DBD domain in Claspin plays an important role in human cells. It is interesting that the properties of Mrc1 DNA binding activity are similar to those of tumor suppressor protein Brca1 (36Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both prefer branched DNA structures to linear DNA, and neither has specificity for nucleotide sequences. The functional significance of the DNA binding activity has yet to be demonstrated, but it is thought that it might play an important role in DNA repair. It will be interesting to refine the analysis of the DNA binding activity of Brca1 to determine whether it shares helix-loop-helix motifs with Mrc1 and Claspin.

In tissues susceptible to aging-related cancers, including the prostate, a relaxation of IGF2 imprinting is found, suggesting a permissive role for epigenetic alterations in cancer development. To determine whether IGF2 imprinting is altered in cellular aging and senescence, human prostate epithelial and urothelial cells were passaged serially in culture to senescence. Allelic analyses using an IGF2 polymorphism demonstrated a complete conversion of the IGF2 imprint status from monoallelic to biallelic, in which the development of senescence was associated with a 10-fold increase in IGF2 expression. As a mechanism, a 2-fold decrease in the binding of the enhancer-blocking element CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) within the intergenic IGF2-H19 region was found to underlie this switch to biallelic IGF2 expression in senescent cells. This decrease in CTCF binding was associated with reduced CTCF expression in senescent cells. No de novo increases in methylation at the IGF2 CTCF binding site were seen. The forced down-regulation of CTCF expression using small interfering RNA in imprinted prostate cell lines resulted in an increase in IGF2 expression and a relaxation of imprinting. Our data suggest a novel mechanism for IGF2 imprinting regulation, that is, the reduction of CTCF expression in the control of IGF2 imprinting. We also demonstrate that altered imprinting patterns contribute to changes in gene expression in aging cells.

Our data suggest a novel mechanism for IGF2 imprinting regulation, that is, the reduction of CTCF expression in the control of IGF2 imprinting. We also demonstrate that altered imprinting patterns contribute to changes in gene expression in aging cells. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic modification that results in the silencing of a specific allele, depending on its parental origin. Genomic imprinting plays a critical role in modulating gene expression during embryogenesis and normal development (1Reik W. Constancia M. Dean W. Davies K. Bowden L. Murrell A. Feil R. Walter J. Kelsey G. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 145-150PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin-like growth factor-2 gene (IGF2), an auto-paracrine growth factor located at the 11p15 chromosomal locus, is imprinted and exhibits monoallelic expression from the paternal allele in most adult tissues. However, a relaxation of the IGF2 imprint has been found in aging-associated human cancers, including cancer of the colon and prostate (2Cui H. Horon I.L. Ohlsson R. Hamilton S.R. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Jarrard D.F. Bussemakers M.J. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1471-1478PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, re-expression of the silenced IGF2 allele was also found in adjacent histologically normal tissues in these studies, suggesting that an alteration in imprinting had occurred prior to the development of these cancers. The factors that underlie this altered imprinting in vivo are unknown. Given the age dependence of these types of cancers, progressive cellular replication and aging may play roles in modulating genomic imprinting. The process that limits the proliferative potential of normal human cells is termed senescence. Senescent cells demonstrate a number of distinct characteristics, including an enlarged, flattened cytoplasm and nucleus, terminal growth arrest, and specific gene expression changes (4Campisi J. In Vivo. 2000; 14: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar). Senescence can be induced by programmed or epigenetic changes resulting from repeated cell divisions and from cellular insults, including oxidative stress and DNA damage. Senescence may not be limited to an in vitro phenomenon because cells expressing senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, a marker for senescent cells, accumulate with aging in human skin (5Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several mechanisms associated with aging in vivo can be found as cells undergo senescence in vitro, including telomere shortening (9Vaziri H. Dragowska W. Allsopp R.C. Thomas T.E. Harley C.B. Lansdorp P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9857-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) and changes in DNA methylation, a postreplicative addition of methyl groups within CpG dinucleotides (10Mazin A.L. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 1993; 27: 895-907PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, selected aspects of in vitro senescence are applicable to aging cells in vivo. IGF2 is located within a cluster of imprinted genes on chromosome 7 in the mouse and on 11p15 in the human. The regulation of IGF2 and its closely linked and reciprocally imprinted 3′ neighbor, H19, has been studied intensely (11Feinberg A.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 249: 87-99PubMed Google Scholar) both because of its role in human disease and as a model for understanding imprinting control mechanisms. During development, IGF2 and H19 are expressed in a coordinate fashion that suggests, in combination with their close linkage and reciprocal imprinting, common transcriptional elements. One model (the insulator model) that has been developed in vitro (12Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 13Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) and in mouse models (14Schoenherr C.J. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Pant V. Mariano P. Kanduri C. Mattsson A. Lobanenkov V. Heuchel R. Ohlsson R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has focused on the differential methylation of an imprinting control region (ICR) located between IGF2 and H19. ICRs provide gametic marks to establish the parent-of-origin-dependent expression domains and are acquired typically in the parental germ line and persist into adulthood (16Reik W. Dean W. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). When the H19 ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, IGF2 is expressed. However, expression from the maternal allele is blocked when this ICR is unmethylated. The boundaries of the mouse H19 ICR are not precise, yet deletion (or hypermethylation) of sequences between –3.8 and 2.0 kb on the maternal allele results in the biallelic expression of the linked and reciprocally imprinted IGF2 gene (17Sasaki H. Ishihara K. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). However, biallelic H19 ICR methylation does not disrupt imprinting in some cases of human Wilms' tumor (19Cui H. Niemitz E.L. Ravenel J.D. Onyango P. Brandenburg S.A. Lobanenkov V.V. Feinberg A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4947-4950PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other mechanisms may play a role in human tissues. Recently, it has been found (12Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 20Nakagawa H. Chadwick R.B. Peltomaki P. Plass C. Nakamura Y. de La Chapelle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that the repression of the maternal allele involves binding of a zinc finger CCCTC-binding factor, known as CTCF, which binds only unmethylated DNA in this ICR. This binding blocks the access of downstream enhancer proteins to the IGF2 promoter region, which transcribes from multiple differentially expressed promoters P1–P4 (21Zhan S. Zhang L. Van M. Young C. Helman L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 792: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Conversely, the hypermethylated paternal allele does not bind CTCF, and IGF2 is expressed from its promoters. There are clear structural differences when human and mouse sequences are compared. The mouse contains four CTCF binding sites in the H19 ICR in contrast to seven in the human; however, only the sixth CTCF site demonstrates differential methylation (13Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 22Takai D. Gonzales F.A. Tsai Y.C. Thayer M.J. Jones P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, the human H19 ICR is not able to function when introduced as a transgene in the mouse (23Jones B.K. Levorse J. Tilghman S.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that differences in the regulation of IGF2 imprinting may exist between species. It is also not clear what the sequential relationship between CTCF binding and methylation is in the human. In mouse embryos, mutation of the ICR leads to decreased CTCF binding and de novo methylation, suggesting a role for CTCF and its protein complex in maintaining a methylation-free domain (15Pant V. Mariano P. Kanduri C. Mattsson A. Lobanenkov V. Heuchel R. Ohlsson R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using a human model of cellular aging in which prostate epithelial and urothelial cultures were passaged sequentially, we demonstrate that a complete loss of IGF2 imprinting develops with the onset of senescence. Senescence is associated with a decrease in CTCF binding to the H19 ICR, an event that results in increased maternal allelic IGF2 expression. The loss of CTCF binding is not associated with changes in methylation at the CTCF target site but is mediated by a decrease in CTCF protein expression. The present study details a novel model for examining imprinting mechanisms in pure populations of human cells during a physiologic, programmed process. The down-regulation of CTCF is a novel mechanism for imprinting regulation that may help to explain the lack of consistent correlation between methylation of the H19 ICR and imprinting found in some human tumor tissues (20Nakagawa H. Chadwick R.B. Peltomaki P. Plass C. Nakamura Y. de La Chapelle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 24Cui H. Onyango P. Brandenburg S. Wu Y. Hsieh C.L. Feinberg A.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6442-6446PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these data provide evidence that a relaxation in imprinting has a permissive effect on gene expression during cellular aging. Given that long term chronic exposure to IGF2 appears to be important in the generation of tumors (25Rogler C.E. Yang D. Rossetti L. Donohoe J. Alt E. Chang C.J. Rosenfeld R. Neely K. Hintz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13779-13784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the loss of imprinting and increased IGF2 expression may be important for the development of aging-related cancers, especially in the prostate. Tissue Culture—Human prostate epithelial culture (HPEC) or human urothelial cells were established on collagen-coated dishes in Ham's F-12 supplemented medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (26Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar, 27Reznikoff C.A. Johnson M.D. Norback D.H. Bryan G.T. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 326-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HPEC samples were obtained from human cystoprostatectomy specimens (ages 45–60) that did not contain prostate cancer. Urothelial cells were generated from human ureteral specimens. Cells were trypsinized and passaged at 1:2 or 1:3 dilutions when confluent and underwent typically 10–15 population doublings before becoming senescent. DNA and RNA were isolated from each passage. PC3 and PPC-1 prostate cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR—To compare gene expression levels between proliferating and senescent cells, quantitative PCR was performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). 18 S RNA expression was used as an internal control for normalizing samples. Primers were designed for p16, IGF2, and WT-1 using Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 2Primers designed for p16, IGF2, and WT-1 are available on request. The IGF2 gene was spliced and transcribed by four promoters (P1, -2, -3, and -4) (28Ekstrom T.J. Cui H. Li X. Ohlsson R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 309-316PubMed Google Scholar), and primers were designed to detect the expression from each specific promoter. Imprinting Assays—To minimize DNA contamination, RQ1 DNase (Promega) treatment of total RNA and intron-crossing primers were utilized. cDNA was synthesized using murine leukemia virus transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers. Two pairs of primers were used to amplify an RNA-specific fragment containing the IGF2 ApaI polymorphism on exon 9 (29Ogawa O. Eccles M.R. Szeto J. McNoe L.A. Yun K. Maw M.A. Smith P.J. Reeve A.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). P1 (5′-GACACCCTCCAGTTCGTCTGT-3′) and P2 (5′-CGGGGATGCATAAAGTATGAG-3′) cross introns between exons 7, 8, and 9. The RNA-specific (1.3 kb) product was separated from the DNA-specific (3.3 kb) fragment using a 1% agarose gel. The second pair of primers (P3 and P4) was used to perform nested PCR (35 cycles), and 292-bp fragments were generated for restriction enzyme digestion with ApaI (New England Biolabs). P3 and P4 primer sequences were 5′-CTTGGACTTTGAGTCAAATTGG-3′ and 5′-GGTCGTGCCAATTACATTTCA-3′, respectively. Cell line DNA with both alleles sensitive to enzyme digestion was utilized as a control for complete restriction digestion. Mixing controls using upper and lower alleles confirmed this approach to be quantitative. For H19 amplification, cDNA was generated from informative samples, and primers (forward 5′-TGCACTACCTGACTCAGGAATC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGATGTCGGTCGGAGCTTC-3′) were used to amplify across the H19 RsaI polymorphism (30Zhang Y. Tycko B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The intact product length was 544 bp, and the digested fragments were 406 and 138 bp if the polymorphism was present. Analysis of CTCF Binding and Expression—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (31Johnson K.D. Bresnick E.H. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 27-36Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cross-linking was carried out by incubating cells (1 × 107) with a final concentration of 0.4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 6 min, and nuclei were isolated. Chromatin was then precleared by incubation with 50 μl of preimmune serum for 1 h followed by overnight incubation with 100 μl of Immunopure protein A-agarose (Pierce). Samples were incubated with 30 μl of anti-CTCF antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immune complexes were collected by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed, and immune complexes were eluted twice. Cross-links were reversed, and DNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol. PCR was performed using real time quantitative PCR (QPCR) (Prism 7000 sequence detection system, ABI). The product was measured by SYBR green fluorescence in 25-μl reactions, and the amount of the product was determined relative to a standard curve generated from a titration of input chromatin. Primers for the IGF2-H19 intergenic region were designed (5′ and 3′): GAGGCTTCTCCTTCGGTCTCA and GCCACTTCCGATTCCACAA. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (32Schwarze S.R. Shi Y. Fu V.X. Watson P.A. Jarrard D.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8184-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody for CTCF (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-β-actin (Sigma). Methylation Analyses—We examined four CpG islands in IGF2, of which three have been found to be methylated differentially in mice and/or human tissues (33Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 34Catchpoole D. Smallwood A.V. Joyce J.A. Murrell A. Lam W. Tang T. Munroe D. Reik W. Schofield P.N. Maher E.R. J. Med.

Genomics. 2000; 64: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The CpG islands that were tested were located on IGF2 (GenBank accession no. AF125183) at exon 4 at 21170–21525 (MR1), exon 9 at 29080–29375 (MR2), between IGF2 and H19, 2 kb upstream of the H19 start site (H19 ICR/MR3), and at –906 to –275 in the H19 promoter (MR4). Genomic DNA isolated from both proliferating and senescent HPEC/human urothelial cell cultures were treated with sodium bisulfite (CpGenome DNA modification kit, Intergen) to convert unmethylated cytosines to uridines while retaining methylated cytosines as unchanged nucleotides. The regions were amplified by primers MR1-F (5′-ACCCACTACAACTTCCCCAAC), MR1-R (5′-TATTAGGAGTTTAGGTAG), MR2-F (5′-TTGGGTGGGTAGAGTAATTAGG), MR2-R (5′-CTCAAATCACTAATCAATCAC), MR3-F (5′-GTAGGGTTTTTGGTAGGTATAGAGT), and MR3-R (5′-CACTAAAAAAACAATTATCAATTC), which are specific for the converted DNA. The PCR products were then cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). For each cloning, 10–20 positive colonies were selected randomly, amplified, and analyzed on a capillary-based fluorescent sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center DNA Sequence Laboratory. 2′-Deoxy-5-azacytidine Treatment of HPEC Cultures—Passage 1 60% confluent HPEC cultures were stained with 5 μm carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 15 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The plates were washed three times with F-12+ medium. The demethylating agent D5-AzaC (final concentration 10 μm) (Sigma) was prepared from a stock solution (in Me2SO) and was added to the HPEC culture, which was incubated for 3 days. Control cultures were treated with a Me2SO vehicle. Cultures were then placed back into the Ham's F-12+ medium for 5 days before propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Examination and sorting of CFSE-loaded cells were performed with a Vantage SE fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The CFSE was excited with an argon laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 488 nm, and the emission of the fluorochrome was collected through a 530/30 band pass filter. Data acquisition analysis and sorting were performed using DiVa electronics and accompanying software (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide staining was utilized to exclude dead cells. The high and low fluorescent fractions were defined based on CFSE staining. The same gate was applied to both treated and control cells. These sorted populations were collected, and imprinting analysis and quantitative-PCR were performed on RNA extracted from each fraction. DNA additionally was generated, and methylation analyses were performed as detailed above. The experiment was performed on three separate cultures with similar results. siRNA Transfection—HPECs, PPC-1, and PC3 cell lines were seeded to 50% confluence on 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. We used LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for HPECs and TransIT-TKO (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) for cancer cell line transfection reagents. 50–100 pmol of CTCF SMARTpool (Dharmacon, Inc.) siRNAs were combined in a medium with the transfection reagents following the manufacturer's protocol. The mixture was then added by drops to the cells in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and mixed by gentle rocking. Cells were retreated with siRNAs 12 h after the initial transfection. RNA and protein were harvested at 48 h. Experiments were performed in duplicate, with similar results. CTCF Lentivirus Infection—The open reading frame of human CTCF was cloned into the FUGW vector, which places the inserted DNA under the control of the ubiquitin promoter. A ubiquitin promoter was used in this experiment to express levels/cell of CTCF or green fluorescent protein (GFP) that were consistently lower than levels expressed by other more promiscuous promoters (e.g. cytomegalovirus). As a negative control and to determine infection efficiency, a similar vector expressing GFP was generated. Infectious virus was produced by transiently transfecting lentivirus vector and packaging vectors into the 293T cell line, as described elsewhere (38Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Early senescent HPECs had 0.1 ml of supernatant/well (6-well plate) in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene for 6 h. Cells were harvested for RNA and protein 48 h postinfection. Test infections using lentivirus-GFP showed an infection efficiency of 30–40% for senescent epithelial cell lines. Experimental results were reproduced in two independent cultures. Senescence and IGF2 Expression in Human Epithelial and Urothelial Cell Cultures—HPECs were cultured on collagen-coated plates and a low serum medium to exclude fibroblasts (26Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the epithelial cells is brisk through 10–15 population doublings, typically 4–6 passages, at which point the subconfluent cells undergo growth arrest and adopt a senescent phenotype (32Schwarze S.R. Shi Y. Fu V.X. Watson P.A. Jarrard D.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8184-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The epithelial senescent phenotype is characterized by morphological changes consisting of an enlarged, flattened cytoplasm and nucleus and by positive senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining. Increased expression of p16 RNA (13-fold) and protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, confirm the senescent phenotype (26Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar). Roughly 70% of the cells develop this phenotype when harvested at terminal senescence. Human urothelial cells demonstrate similar growth patterns. We had noted previously (8Schwarze S.R. DePrimo S.E. Grabert L.M. Fu V.X. Brooks J.D. Jarrard D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14877-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) on cDNA array an increase in the expression of IGF2 as human prostate epithelial cells were passaged from proliferation to senescence. To confirm these findings, we harvested RNA from multiple sequential passages of human prostate epithelial or urothelial cells and performed QPCR using IGF2-specific primers (Fig. 1A). An average increase of 10-fold (±3.8-fold) in IGF2 was seen with the development of senescence. IGF2 expression is driven by multiple promoters P1–P4, and as cells were passaged to senescence, the relative expression from the IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters increased (9- and 8-fold, respectively). The P2 promoter demonstrated decreased expression (7-fold) but contributed only relatively small amounts (15%) to the overall IGF2 expression in senescent cells. P1 was not expressed. The P3 and P4 promoters contain several Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT-1) binding sites that negatively regulate IGF2 expression (39Drummond I.A. Madden S.L. Rohwer-Nutter P. Bell G.I. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher F.J. II I Science. 1992; 257: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 40Lee Y.I. Kim S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Consistent with a putative role for WT-1, we found an 8-fold down-regulation of WT-1 RNA at senescence. Thus, the overall IGF2 expression increased at senescence, and this was mediated by an increase in expression from the P3 and P4 promoters. Alterations in IGF2 Imprinting with Senescence—The IGF2 gene is imprinted, demonstrating expression solely from the paternal allele in most adult tissues (1Reik W. Constancia M. Dean W. Davies K. Bowden L. Murrell A. Feil R. Walter J. Kelsey G. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 145-150PubMed Google Scholar). RNA obtained from three separate epithelial cultures was subjected to an imprinting analysis based on an ApaI polymorphism found in exon 9 of the IGF2 gene (29Ogawa O. Eccles M.R. Szeto J. McNoe L.A. Yun K. Maw M.A. Smith P.J. Reeve A.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In prostate epithelial cultures, we found minimal expression (<5%) of the maternal IGF2 allele in proliferating cultures (Fig. 1B, bands labeled P). As epithelial cells were passaged, a relaxation of IGF2 imprinting occurred. Partial re-expression of the silenced allele was evident in early senescence (Fig. 1, label ES), a period at which cell growth is minimal, and the senescent morphology is found less frequently (32Schwarze S.R. Shi Y. Fu V.X. Watson P.A. Jarrard D.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8184-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A complete loss of imprinting developed subsequently in terminally arrested, fully senescent cultures. Data obtained from human tumors and during experimental manipulation of the mouse genome indicate that the regulation of IGF2 and its adjacent 3′ imprinted gene, H19, are linked (41Forne T. Oswald J. Dean W. Saam J.R. Bailleul B. Dandolo L. Tilghman S.M. Walter J. Reik W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10243-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 42Taniguchi T. Sullivan M.J. Ogawa O. Reeve A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2159-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In three epithelial cultures that were informative for H19 (one was also informative for IGF2 imprinting), we detected no change in the monoallelic status of H19 with the passage to senescence (Fig. 1C). H19 expression was noted to decrease 12-fold in these cultures, as assessed by QPCR. Thus, IGF2 and H19 expression levels"

Here we report that A238L, an African swine fever virus protein, efficiently inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression in Jurkat T cells and in virus-infected Vero cells. Transfection of Jurkat cells stably expressing A238L with cyclooxygenase-2 promoter-luciferase constructs containing 5′-terminal deletions or mutations in distal or proximal nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) response elements revealed that these sequences are involved in the inhibition induced by A238L. Overexpression of a constitutively active version of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin or NFAT reversed the inhibition mediated by A238L on cyclooxygenase-2 promoter activation, whereas overexpression of p65 NFκB had no effect. A238L does not modify the nuclear localization of NFAT after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/calcium ionophore stimulation. Moreover, we show that the mechanism by which the viral protein down-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 activity does not involve inhibition of the binding between NFAT and its specific DNA sequences into the cyclooxygenase-2 promoter. Strikingly, A238L dramatically inhibited the transactivation mediated by a GAL4-NFAT fusion protein containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFAT1. Taken together, these data indicate that A238L down-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 transcription through the NFAT response elements, being NFAT-dependent transactivation implicated in this down-regulation.

Viruses have been known for a long time to use a variety of strategies not only to alter the host metabolism via their signaling proteins but also to hijack cellular signaling pathways and transcription factors to control them to their own advantage. Both the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) 1The abbreviations used are: NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cell; IκB, inhibitory proteins of the IκB family; Cot/TP12, serine/threonine kinase Cot; CsA, cyclosporin A; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Ion, calcium ionophore; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; RLU, relative luciferase unit(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ASFV, African swine fever virus; IL-2, interleukin-2; β-gus, β-glucuronidase. and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathways appear to be attractive targets for common viral pathogens, probably due to their ability to promote the expression of numerous proteins involved in adaptative and innate immunity (1Li Q.

NFκB is a collective term referring to a class of dimeric transcription factors belonging to the rel family. In resting cells, NFκB exists in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound to inhibitory proteins of the IκB family (9Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar, 10Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In response to a variety of stimuli, IκB proteins undergo phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 (11Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 12Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome, thus unmasking the nuclear localization sequence of the transactivating heterodimers and allowing translocation of active NFκB to the nucleus. Recently, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that another level of NF-κB regulation independent on IκB degradation exists. This second level of regulation relies in the activation of the transcriptional activity of p65 and c-rel NFκB members (reviewed in Ref. 13Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). On the other hand, proteins belonging to the NFAT are a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of many inducible genes during the immune response (14Northrop J.P. Ho S.N.

NFAT proteins are expressed in a variety of immune system cells (including macrophages) as well as in endothelial cells, certain neuronal cells, and other cells outside the immune system (2Rao A.

Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and contain two adjacent 300-amino acid regions that are conserved within the members of the family. NFAT is composed of at least four structurally related members, NFAT1, NFAT2, NFAT3, and NFAT4, as well as the constitutively nuclear NFAT5 (15Luo C. Burgeon E. Carew J.A. McCaffrey P.G.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The distinguishing feature of NFAT is its regulation by Ca2+ and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine phosphatase calcineurin. In resting cells, phosphorylated NFAT proteins localize in the cytoplasm; upon stimulation, they are dephosphorylated by calcineurin, translocated to the nucleus, and become transcriptionally active (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 15Luo C. Burgeon E. Carew J.A. McCaffrey P.G. Badalian T.M. Lane W.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). As in the case of NFκB, some recent evidence indicates that the transcriptional activity of NFAT can also be modulated by phosphorylation of the transactivation domain (20San-Antonio B.

ASFV is a large DNA virus that infects monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mφ) of different species of suids, causing an acute and frequently fatal disease (22Vinuela E. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 116: 151-170PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of the complete 170-kbp DNA sequence of ASFV has revealed several genes capable of modulating the host response (6Revilla Y. Callejo M.

Virol. 2001; 75: 2535-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Among these, A238L contains ankyrin repeats homologous to those found in the IκB family and behaves as a bona fide IκB-α viral homologue, because it binds p65 NFκB (6Revilla Y. Callejo M.

Functionally, the viral protein prevents translocation and binding of p65-p50 NFκB dimers to their target sequence in the DNA (6Revilla Y. Callejo M. Rodriguez J.M. Culebras E. Nogal M.L. Salas M.L. Vinuela E. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5405-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been described that A238L is also able to inhibit NFAT activation by inhibiting the calcineurin phosphatase activity (7Miskin J.E. Abrams C.C. Goatley L.C. Dixon L.K. Science. 1998; 281: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, the special features of this viral IκB homologue would enable the virus to act on both NFκB- and NFAT-dependent pathways, probably modulating the expression of genes involved in the development of a protective immune response against the virus (24Parry R.V. June C.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mo/Mφ plays a central role in the development of the immune response by their ability to present antigens and secrete bioactive molecules. One such secreted product released is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that is a strong lipid mediator of inflammation and modulator of the immune response. Recent evidence shows that many viruses have been linked to the regulation of COX-2 expression and the production of prostaglandins (PGs) (25Janelle M.E. Gravel A. Gosselin J. Tremblay M.J.

PGE2 inhibits the synthesis of IL-2, representing a way that viruses have developed to control the biological functions of these cells, such as the secretion of interferon-γ, a cytokine involved in activating T cells and Mo/Mφ that also has antiviral activity (30Yocum D.E. Esparza L. Dubry S. Benjamin J.B. Volz R. Scuderi P. Cell. Immunol. 1989; 122: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The limiting step in the synthesis of PGs is catalyzed by COX enzymes (31DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of the enzyme, COX-1 and COX-2; COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues (32Funk C.D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Regardless of the animal species, these promoters contain a classic TATA box, an E-box, and binding sites for transcription factors such as NFκB and NFAT/AP-1 (40Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), nuclear factor IL-6/CCAAT-enhancer protein, and cyclic AMP-response element CRE-binding proteins (35Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the regulation of COX-2 gene expression in cells infected with the ASFV strain Ba71V or with an A238L deletion mutant (ΔA238L) as well as in A238L-transfected T cells. Our results show that COX-2 transcription was induced upon infection or T cell activation both being negatively modulated by the expression of A238L. We also identified the contribution of the NFAT distal site of the COX-2 promoter in the inhibition induced by A238L. Finally, our work demonstrates that the viral protein inhibits COX-2 through the control of the transactivation of NFAT. Cell Culture, Viruses, and Reagents—Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Jurkat human leukemia T cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both media were supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units of gentamicin per milliliter and non-essential amino acids. Cells were stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) at 15 ng/ml and A23187 calcium ionophore (Ion; Sigma) at 1 μm. Cyclosporin A (CsA, Sandoz, 100 ng/ml) was added 1 h before the addition of PMA and Ion. The Vero-adapted ASFV strain Ba71V was propagated and titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells as described previously (41Enjuanes L. Carrascosa A.L. Moreno M.A. Vinuela E. J. Gen. Virol. 1976; 32: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). ASFV A238L Deletion Mutant Construction—The A238L-defective mutant ΔA238L virus was obtained by insertion of the Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase (β-gus) gene into the A238L open reading frame. For this, a 473-bp left-flanking and a 480-bp right-flanking DNA fragments were generated by PCR amplification of the ASFV strain Ba71V genome using specific oligonucleotides and cloned into plasmid p72GUS10T (42Garcia R. Almazan F. Rodriguez J.M. Alonso M. Vinuela E. Rodriguez J.F. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 40: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The recombinant ΔA238L virus was obtained as previously described (42Garcia R. Almazan F. Rodriguez J.M. Alonso M. Vinuela E. Rodriguez J.F. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 40: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, Vero cells were transfected by lipofection with pΔA238L, using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, mixed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and then infected with virus strain Ba71V. After 48 h of infection, the cells were harvested, and diluted samples were used to infect Vero cell monolayers. The infected cells were covered with agar (Invitrogen), and, 4 days later, the β-gus substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronic acid (X-Gluc, Biomol), was added to the culture medium. The blue-stained plaques were selected and used to infect fresh monolayers of Vero cells. The recombinant virus was purified after successive rounds of plaque isolation. The lack of gene A238L in the recombinant virus was assessed by Southern blot hybridization. Briefly, DNA samples from the genome of previously purified virus BA71V and ΔA238L were digested with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI, subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes following standard procedures. The DNA probes, specific for the β-gus and A238L genes, and for the SalI I′ fragment of Ba71V genome were labeled with a DIG DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Plasmid Constructs—Human COX-2 promoter constructs P2-1900 (-1796, +104), P2-1102 (-998, +104), P2-431 (-327, +104), P2-274 (-170, +104), and P2-150 (-46, +104) were generated as described previously (40Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The COX-2 promoter mutants P2-274 dNFAT MUT, P2-274 pNFAT MUT, and P2-274 d,pNFAT MUT were generated as described (40Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The AP-1-Luc plasmid includes the AP-1-responsive (-73 to +63 bp) region of the human collagenase promoter fused to the luciferase gene (43Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). NFAT-luc, containing three tandem copies of the NFAT binding site of the IL-2 promoter, and the full-length human NFATc (p1SH107c) expression plasmid (14Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), were a generous gift from Dr. G. Crabtree. The pNFκB-luc contains three tandem copies of the NF-κB site of the conalbumin promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. The pcDNA-A238L expression plasmid was generated by cloning the A238L open reading frame from Ba71V viral strain of ASFV into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The ΔCAM-AI expression plasmid encoded a deletion mutant of murine calcineurin catalytic subunit. The p65 expression plasmid pcDNA3-p65 was a gift from Dr. J. Alcamí. The GAL4 luciferase constructs (GAL4-Luc) contain five GAL4 DNA consensus binding sites derived from the yeast GAL4 gene fused to luciferase reporter gene (44Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), and the pGAL4-hNFAT1 constructs containing the first 1–451 amino acids of human NFAT1 fused to the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 transcription factor were originated as described previously (21de Gregorio R. Iniguez M.A. Fresno M. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27003-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Generation of A238L stably expressing Jurkat cells was done by transfecting 0.5 μg of empty plasmid pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-A238L using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and mixing in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Two days later, G418 antibiotic selection was applied (0.5 mg of G418 (Invitrogen) per milliliter). Cells were refed with fresh medium every 3 days until colonies were apparent (2–3 weeks). These cellular lines were named Jurkat-pcDNA and Jurkat-A238L. Vero or Jurkat-pcDNA and Jurkat-A238L cells were transfected with 250 ng of specific plasmids per 106 cells as described above. In cotransfection assays, 0.05–0.5 μg of the corresponding expression plasmid per 106 cells was added. 16 h after transfection, Jurkat-pcDNA and Jurkat-A238L cells were stimulated with 15 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μm Ion during 4 h, and Vero cells were infected with Ba71V or Ba71VΔA238L at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell at the indicated times. Then, Jurkat and Vero cells were lysed with 200 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) and microcentrifuged at full speed for 5 min at 4 °C, and 20 μl of each supernatant was used to determine firefly luciferase activity in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Results were expressed as the luminescence units after normalization of protein concentration determined by the bicinchoninic acid spectrophotometric method (Pierce). Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as the mean of the relative luciferase units (RLUs) (mean ± S.D.). mRNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from Jurkat-pcDNA or Jurkat-A238L or ASFV-infected Vero cells by the TRIzol reagent RNA protocol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA by the RevertAid First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas) and used for PCR amplification with the addition of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Specific primers used in PCR reactions were human COX-2 (forward: 5′-TTCAAATGAGATTGTGGGAAAATTGCT-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATCTT-3′), human β-actin (forward: 5′-GAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATG-3′ and reverse: 5′-TCAGGAGGAGCAATGATCTTG-3′), and A238L (forward: 5′-CGCGCGTCTAGATTACTTTCCATACTTGTT-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCGCGCAAGCTTATGGAACACATGTTTCCA-3′). The PCR reactions were performed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Western Blot Analysis—Unstimulated or stimulated Jurkat-pcDNA and Jurkat-A238L cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in radio immunolabeling protein assay (radioimmune precipitation assay) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid spectrophotometric method. Cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the separated proteins reacted with specific primary antibodies raised against COX-2 (Alexis Biochemicals, number 804-112-C050), β-actin (H-196, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and NFAT (anti-NFAT1/c2 672 rabbit antiserum, previously described (45Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redondo J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). Membranes were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako), followed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) detection by autoradiography. Determination of PGE2—PGE2 was determined in cell culture supernatants by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The target (PGE2) competes with biotinylated PGE2 at the binding site of a specific monoclonal anti-PGE2 antibody. A streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate enables the detection of biotin via generation of a colored reagent. The detection limit was about 20 pg/ml PGE2. Jurkat pcDNA or Jurkat-A238L cells were stimulated with PMA/Ion, and supernatants were recovered at different times of stimulation. Concentrations of PGs were measured by a prostaglandin screen colorimetric assay kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol, (Cayman Chemical). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—ASFV-infected Vero cells were grown on coverslips to 2 × 105 cells/cm2. Cultures were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with cold 99.8% methanol (Merck) for 15 min at -20 °C, before rehydrating twice with PBS and blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated during 2 h with the specific antibody against NFAT (G1-D10, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), rinsed extensively with PBS, and then incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the cells were rinsed successively with PBS, distilled water, and ethanol, and mounted with a drop of Mowiol on a micro slide. Visualization of stained cultures was performed under a fluorescence Axioskop2 plus (Zeiss) microscope coupled to a color charge-coupled device camera or to a Confocal Microradiance (Bio-Rad) equipment. Images were digitalized, processed, and organized with Metamorph, Lasershap2000 version 4, Adobe Photoshop 7.0, Adobe Illustrator 10, and Microsoft PowerPoint SP-2 software. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from Jurkat-pcDNA and Jurkat-A238L cells unstimulated or stimulated with 15 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μm Ion treated or not with 100 ng/ml CsA were prepared. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6; 10 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.1 mm EGTA; 0.75 mm spermidine; 0.15 mm spermine; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 mm Na2MoO4; and 2 μg/ml each of inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). After 15 min at 4 °C, 5 μl of a 10% Nonidet P-40 solution were added. Samples were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatants were used as cytosolic extracts. To avoid cytosolic contamination, nuclei were washed twice with 200 μl of buffer A. For nuclear protein extraction, 50 μl of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6; 0.4 m NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 mm Na2MoO4; and 2 μg/ml each of inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) were added, and nuclear pellets were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C, and supernatants were used as nuclear extracts. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed basically as described previously (40Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For binding reaction 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in DNA Binding Buffer (10% (w/v) polyvinyl ethanol, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 2.5 mm dithiothreitol; 2.5 mm EDTA) on ice for 15 min. Then, 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (0.5 ng) was added, and samples were incubated for additional 45 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction mixture prior to the probe. Supershift assays were performed by incubating nuclear extracts with either preimmune serum or anti-NFAT antiserum prior to the addition of the probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing gel. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were: 5′-TCGACAAGGGGAGAGGAGGGAAAAATTTGTGGC-3′ (nucleotides -117 to -91 containing the NFAT distal site of the human COX-2 promoter), 5′-TCGACAAAAGGCGGAAAGAAACAGTCATTTC-3′ (nucleotides -82 to -58, including the NFAT/AP-1 proximal site of the human COX-2 promoter), and 5′-GATCGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTC"
https://openalex.org/W1994199962,"ResT is a member of the telomere resolvases, a newly discovered class of DNA breakage and reunion enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation of co-valently closed hairpin DNA ends that are found in linear prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids. The hairpins are generated by telomere resolution, where the replicated linear DNA ends are processed by DNA breakage followed by joining of DNA free ends to the complementary strand of the same molecule. Previous studies have shown that ResT catalyzes hairpin formation through a two-step transesterification similar to tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. In the present study we have probed the reaction mechanism of ResT. The enzyme was found to efficiently utilize a substrate with a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate at each cleavage site, similar to tyrosine recombinases/type IB topoisomerases. Using such a substrate to trap the covalent protein-DNA intermediate, coupled with affinity purification and mass spectroscopy, we report a new, non-radioactive approach to directly determine the position of the amino acid in the protein, which is linked to the DNA. We report that tyrosine 335 is the active site nucleophile in ResT, strengthening the link between ResT and tyrosine recombinases/type IB topoisomerases. However, a distinct pattern of catalytic residues with similarities, but distinct differences from the above enzymes was suggested. The differences include the apparent absence of a general acid catalyst, as well as the dispensability of the final histidine in the RKHRHY hexad. Finally, two signature motifs (GRR(2X)E(6X)F and LGH(4–6X)T(3X)Y) near the catalytic residues of aligned telomere resolvases are noted.

Telomere resolution involves breakage of two phosphodiester bonds in a double-stranded DNA substrate (one in each strand) and joining of each end with the opposite DNA strand to form a covalently closed hairpin. The reaction is more complex than the breakage and reunion catalyzed by topoisomerases but simpler than the strand exchange promoted by site-specific recombinases.

These studies have revealed an active site tyrosine nucleophile, which becomes covalently linked to the DNA through a 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage as an essential reaction intermediate in both enzyme families. Activation of the nucleophilic attack is promoted by the side chains of five residues in tyrosine recombinases (22Van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24800-24807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and four residues in type IB topoisomerases (24Shuman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Tian L. Claeboe C.D. Hecht S.M. Shuman S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the tyrosine recombinases this pentad is usually RKHR(H/W), whereas in the type IB topoisomerases it is RKR(H/N) with the third residue from the recombinases missing (see also Fig. 2). The role of the basic residues at positions 1, 3, and 4, and 1 and 3, respectively, is to provide a series of hydrogen bonds with the scissile phosphate and to stabilize the transition state intermediate. The lysine at the second position plays a role in leaving group expulsion during cleavage through protonation of the 5′-OH, apparently with the help of the first arginine in the topoisomerases (27Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5711-5714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The final position in each set of catalytic residues may have a variable role in different proteins. Structural studies have shown hydrogen bonding of this residue to the scissile phosphate or 5′-OH, however, recent studies have revealed a purely structural role for this residue in the Flp enzyme (23Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24800-24807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The current study begins with a sequence alignment of known and predicted telomere resolvases to identify putative catalytic residues. The active site tyrosine nucleophile of the B. burgdorferi telomere resolvase, ResT, has been directly determined and a mutagenic and biochemical analysis of ResT was performed. Our results firmly establish a similarity of catalytic residues between telomere resolvases and tyrosine recombinases/type IB topoisomerases, but also indicate distinct differences. Generation of Oligonucleotide ResT Substrates—Wild-type replicated telomere substrates corresponding to the left end of lp17 were constructed from oligonucleotides as noted previously (29Bankhead T. Chaconas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13768-13773Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and as described below. The sequences of these oligonucleotides can be found in Table II of the Supplemental Materials. They are labeled ResT substrates A–E. Three variants were made: first, an asymmetric substrate of 63 bp, using oligonucleotides A and B; second, a symmetrical substrate of 56 bp, with a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate (OPS) 1The abbreviations used are: OPS, 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate; CPD, covalent protein-DNA intermediate; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser dissorption time-of-flight; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. at the cleavage site of ResT, using oligonucleotides C and D; third, a 56-bp substrate containing an OPS at the cleavage site on one strand (C) and a 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide (E) on the complementary strand. Each of these substrate variants was prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of the two desired oligonucleotides and annealing them by heating to 95 °C for 3 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature over 1.5 h. In the 56-bp substrates, the shorter oligonucleotide was phosphorylated at its 5′ end, whereas the longer oligonucleotide was not. The annealed 56-bp substrates were joined through their sticky ends near the axis of symmetry and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 16 °C. All three substrates were purified by gel electrophoresis on a 4% MetaPhor (Cambrex)-agarose gel (70 V, 3 h, 4 °C). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the substrate band was excised from the gel. The gel slice was frozen at -80 °C for at least 20 min, then thawed. The substrate was recovered by placing the gel slice in a Costar Spin-X column (Corning Inc.) and centrifuging for 8 min at 8000 × g at 4 °C. The recovered substrate was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) to a final concentration of 10 pmol/μl, as determined by fluorescence staining (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes). The substrates were stored at -20 °C. Generation and Analysis of Covalent ResT-DNA Complexes—In a volume of 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 500 fmol of radioactive synthetic ResT substrate carrying an OPS at the cleavage site was combined with 1–10 pmol of ResT. The reaction was incubated for 0–30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% Tris Tricine polyacrylamide gels (15 × 15 × 0.1 cm). The gels contained 5% acrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 40:1), 1 m Tris (pH 8.4), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.5% glycerol (v/v). The electrophoresis buffer contained 0.1 m Tris base, 0.1 m Tricine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The gel was run at 75 mA for 4 h at room temperature. Vacuum-dried gels were analyzed using a Packard Cyclone (Packard Bioscience) and band intensities were quantified as noted above. Preparation of a ResT Phosphopeptide, Containing the Tyrosine Nucleophile—Covalent protein-DNA intermediate (CPD) was prepared by incubating ResT with a 3′-biotinylated substrate that carried an OPS at the cleavage site. The reaction conditions were as described above, except that the reaction volume was scaled up to 600 μl. After incubation, 5 μg of porcine trypsin (sequencing grade, Princeton Separations Inc.) was added to the reaction, followed by incubation at room temperature overnight. Afterward, 150 μl of paramagnetic streptavidin microbeads from the μMacs Streptavidin Kit (Miltenyi Biotech) were added to the reaction. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture was applied to a μMacs column (Miltenyi Biotech) in a strong magnetic field, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was retained in the column, which then was washed sequentially with 250 μl of reaction buffer, 250 μl of sodium acetate (1 m, pH 7.0), 250 μl of sodium acetate (25 mm, pH 7.0), and 500 μl of water. P1 nuclease (3 units, Roche Diagnostics) in 250 μl of water was then applied to the column. After a few drops of the nuclease had gone through the column, the flow was shut off and the column in the magnetic field was incubated at 36 °C for 45 min. The stopper was then removed from the nozzle and the eluate containing the phosphopeptide and nucleotides was collected. To increase the yield, the column was washed with 500 μl of water. The eluate was concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to a total volume of ∼200 μl and directly subjected to matrix-assisted laser dissorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy to confirm the presence of the phosphopeptide, as well as tandem (MS-MS) mass spectroscopy to sequence the phosphopeptide. Mass spectroscopy was carried out by the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Facility, Institute for Biomolecular Design at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, and the SAMS facility of the University of Calgary. Their methods of treating the sample are described here briefly. For MALDI-TOF a 2-μl sample, containing the phosphopeptide in water, was mixed with matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, saturated in a MeOH/H2O solution) and spotted on a plate containing a thin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The sample and matrix were vaporized and ionized with a laser, and the mass analyzed in a TOF detector (Voyager DE-Pro, Applied Biosystems). For MS-MS a 6-μl sample was directly applied to a reversed-phase capillary column (New Objectives, BioBasic C18 PicoFrit column, 5 μm packing, 75 μm inner diameter × 10 cm) at a flow rate of 200 to 300 nl/min. A gradient from 8% acetonitrile to 80% over 13 min was used. The running solvents were: A (0.2% formic acid in water) and B (0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile). The sample was ionized at the tip of the Picofrit column as it eluted and an MS-MS experiment was performed, using a Q-TOF-2 (Micromass). Determination of the Specific Enzymatic Activity of ResT on a Plasmid Substrate—The plasmid pYT1, which contains a 50-bp replicated telomere was used to measure the enzymatic activity of the purified ResT proteins. For this purpose the plasmid was linearized first with the restriction endonuclease PstI (New England Biolabs) and purified by ethanol precipitation. Reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm spermidine, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Substrate (72.2 fmol (200 ng)) was incubated with 0.25–10 pmol (13–540 ng) ResT protein (depending upon the activity of the protein used) at 30 °C. The reactions were incubated for 0–30 min and the reaction products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide and the image acquired using an AlphaInnotech Fluorchem 8900. The resulting image was quantified using ImageQuant software version 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences). The rate of accumulation of resolved telomere was determined from the steepest slope in the graph. One unit of ResT enzymatic activity was defined as 1 fmol of substrate conversion per minute. The specific enzymatic activity was defined as units/pmol of ResT. Generation and Analysis of ResT Reaction Product from a 63-bp Asymmetric Substrate—In a volume of 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 fmol of radioactive synthetic ResT substrate was combined with 0.5–10 pmol of ResT. The reaction was incubated for 1–30 min at 30 °C and analyzed as described above. Fragment Retention on Polyacrylamide Gels—In a volume of 20 μlof 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 fmol of a 70-bp radioactive, oligonucleotide substrate was combined with 5.5 pmol of ResT. The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 0 °C and analyzed on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (30Ziegelin G. Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Lanka E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3703-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additional “Experimental Procedures” can be found under Supplemental Materials. Identification of Potential Catalytic Residues in ResT—To identify potential catalytic residues in ResT, a sequence alignment with other characterized and putative telomere resolvases was performed (Fig. 2). In addition to ResT, TelN from phage N15 and Tel from phage PY54 have been characterized previously (1Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7721-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Kobryn K.

Casjens S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was not included in the alignment because of its very high degree of identity with N15 TelN. The putative telomere resolvases from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Ectocarpus siliculosus, and Vibrio harveyi were recovered by BLAST searches against ResT. Because telomere resolvases are functionally related to tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases, consensus sequences for these two enzyme groups (31Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A.

The initial alignment was performed using ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw, see Ref. 35Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar for recent review), but manual correction was necessary to make all conserved regions and residues apparent. The final alignment shows that the overall similarity between telomere resolvases, as well as telomere resolvases and tyrosine recombinases/type IB topoisomerases, is rather low. Only close to the potential catalytic residues can reasonable similarity be found. We observed a constellation of conserved residues in the telomere resolvases, a number of which correspond to known catalytic residues in either the tyrosine recombinases or type IB topoisomerases (marked white on a blue background in Fig. 2, with corresponding ResT positions above). The only exception is Tyr-293 in ResT, which corresponds to a catalytically active histidine in tyrosine recombinases but is not conserved among the telomere resolvases (see “Discussion”). In addition to conserved residues that correspond to suspected catalytic functions, the group of telomere resolvases has several residues conserved among its members that are not found in the tyrosine recombinases or type IB topoisomerases. The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the telomere resolvases have little or no similarity to each other and the alignment of these regions can be found under Supplemental Materials (see Fig. SF1). ResT Accumulates CPD with a Substrate Containing OPS at the Cleavage Site—A feature of both tyrosine recombinases (36Burgin Jr., A.B. Nash H.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1312-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Burgin A.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 119-128PubMed Google Scholar) and type 1B topoisomerases (27Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5711-5714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which has been useful in biochemical characterization of the catalytic mechanism, is the accumulation of CPD on substrates containing OPS (Fig. 3A) at the cleavage site. The sulfhydryl group resulting from backbone cleavage is a poor nucleophile at phosphorous, resulting in an inability of the enzyme to promote either the forward or backward ligation step. To further compare ResT with the above enzyme families we tested its ability to accumulate CPD on an OPS substrate. As shown in Fig. 3B, accumulation of CPD occurred with an OPS substrate. Kinetic experiments (Fig. 3C) indicated that the rate of accumulation of CPD was equal to that of resolved telomere formation on a wild-type substrate, indicating efficient usage of an OPS substrate, as previously observed for the tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. Tyrosine 335 Is the Active Site Nucleophile in ResT—The putative tyrosine nucleophile at position 335 in ResT is conserved in all known and suspected telomere resolvases. Mutagenesis of this position in both B. burgdorferi ResT (2Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and N15 TelN (5Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10410-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) resulted in inactive proteins, suggesting its identification as the tyrosine nucleophile. However, the weak alignment between the telomere resolvases and the tyrosine recombinases/type IB topoisomerases prompted us to directly identify the position in ResT that becomes covalently linked to the DNA substrate. To simplify this process compared with previous studies (38Gronostajski, R. M., and Sadowski, P. D. (1985) 5, 3274-3279Google Scholar, 39Pargellis C.A. Nunes-Duby S.E. de Vargas L.M. Landy A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7678-7685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we developed a new approach based upon recent technological advances. We first prepared a 56-bp suicide substrate that contained OPS at the cleavage site (Fig. 4A, step I). The substrate was also biotinylated to allow subsequent purification steps. Incubation with ResT resulted in the accumulation of the covalently linked protein-DNA intermediate or CPD (step II). The accumulated CPD was then digested with trypsin (step III) and the DNA-linked peptide separated from free peptides by virtue of its biotin tag (step IV). Subsequently, the DNA was digested to 5′ mononucleotides with nuclease P1, releasing the covalently linked ResT fragment as a phosphopeptide (step V). The eluted phosphopeptide was first subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy to identify the phosphorylated tryptic fragment (step VI). The results showed a phosphorylated tryptic peptide with a mass of 2063.8 Da (M + H), which corresponds to a non-phosphorylated tryptic peptide of 1983.8 Da (also M + H). The MALDI-TOF experiment was repeated 5 times and the signal at 2063.8 Da was detected every time and was the base peak in four of those experiments. The tryptic peptide carrying tyrosine 335 has an unphosphorylated theoretical mass of 1983.96 Da (M + H) and was the only possible match. This peptide is a 17-mer with the sequence VLGHEPNDITTAFHYNR. The tyrosine at position 15 from the N terminus is the only tyrosine in the peptide. To identify the phosphorylated position and hence the point of attachment between the DNA and ResT, the phosphopeptide was sequenced by tandem mass spectroscopy (Fig. 4B). The sequencing confirmed the identity of the tryptic fragment (monoisotopic mass of 2062.92 (M only) and identified tyrosine 335 as the site of phosphorylation (see also Supplemental Materials Fig. SF2 for the original sequencing data). Mutagenic Analysis of Potential Catalytic Residues in ResT— From the initial sequence alignment and the comparison with tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases, it was possible to identify five potential catalytic residues, in addition to Tyr-335, the tyrosine nucleophile. These residues were Arg-199, Lys-224, Tyr-293, Arg-296, and His-324 (see Fig. 2). With the exception of Tyr-293, the remaining residues were all conserved in the known and predicted telomere resolvases. The tyrosine at position 293 was also observed in the Agrobacterium enzyme, and replaces the histidine normally observed at this position in tyrosine recombinases (31Esposito D. Scocca J.J.

https://openalex.org/W1971504616,"A carbohydrate-binding protein was isolated from the carpophores of the mushrooms and designated the Chlorophyllum molybdites lectin (CML) based on its origin. The molecular mass of CML was 32 kDa, and it was composed of two 16-kDa monomers with no disulfide bonds. Monosaccharide analysis indicated that 12% of the mass of CML was carbohydrate and consisted of GlcNAc:GalNAc:Gal:Man:l-Fuc in a molar ratio of 1.5:1.9: 4.4:4.8:1.0. In the hemagglutination inhibition assay, CML exhibited the strongest binding specificity toward N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) among the monosaccharides tested, whereas NeuAc did not inhibit the hemagglutination at all. GalNAc and Meα-GalNAc were also inhibitory at much higher concentrations than NeuGc. Among the glycoproteins, asialobovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and porcine stomach mucin (PSM) showed strong inhibitory effects. In surface plasmon resonance analysis, asialo-BSM and PSM exhibited the strongest binding affinity. After co-injection of CML and NeuGc or GalNAc onto the asialo-BSM- or PSM-immobilized chip, the dissociation of CML from the immobilized PSM was accelerated by NeuGc and GalNAc, but the dissociation of CML from the immobilized asialo-BSM was only promoted by GalNAc. These results and the other surface plasmon resonance experiments allowed us to conclude that the binding of asialo-BSM to CML was because of an interaction between the lectin and the GalNAc residues of asialo-BSM, and both the NeuGc and GalNAc residues were responsible for the binding of PSM to CML. The results also suggested that CML had two different carbohydrate binding domains, one specific for NeuGc and the other for GalNAc.

NeuAc and NeuGc are the most common sialic acids in most mammals, but normal human tissues do not contain NeuGc. NeuGc occurs in the glycoconjugates of many human tumors, where it may be responsible for the formation of Hanganutziu-Deicher antibodies (5Hanganutziu M. C.R. Seances Soc.

Lectins that recognize sialic acids are known in vertebrates, arthropods, mollusks, protozoa, plants, bacteria, and viruses, and some of them have been used as biological and medical probes for sugar or sugar chain detection. NeuGc-specific lectins are very rare among sialic acid-specific lectins. Although some NeuAc-specific lectins have been studied and are commercially available, NeuGc-specific lectins are difficult to obtain commercially. A few NeuGc-specific lectins have been isolated from several living sources. The lectin from the mushroom Hericium erinaceum (HEL) has specificity toward NeuGc > NeuAc (15Kawagishi H. Mori H. Uno A.

Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the course of our continuing screening for mushroom lectins (21Kobayashi Y. Ishizaki T. Kawagishi H. Int. J. Med. Mushr. 2004; 6: 113-125Crossref Google Scholar), we found lectin activity in the extract of the toxic mushroom Chlorophyllum molybdites, and the sugar binding was NeuGc-specific. C. molybdites belongs to the Agaricaceae family, and to date, no lectins have been isolated from this genus. We report here the purification and characterization of a lectin from this mushroom. Materials—Fruiting bodies of C. molybdites (Meyer: Fries) Massee were collected in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, frozen upon collection, and stored at –20 °C. QAE-Toyopearl 550C, Amino-Toyopearl 650M, and TSKgel G3000SWXL were purchased from Tosoh (Japan). The Sephacryl S-300HR column was a product of Amersham Biosciences. p-Aminobenzoic ethyl ether (ABEE reagent) and the Wakosil-II column were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical (Japan). Poly(p-acryloylaminophenyl-βGlcNAc), poly(p-N-vinylbenzyl-Galβ1→4Glc), poly(p-N-vinylbenzyl-Galβ1→6Glc) and poly(p-N-vinylbenzyl-Glcα1→4Glc) were synthesized as described previously (22Kobayashi K.

(Tokyo). 1998; 123: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All other sugars and glycoproteins for the sugar analysis, the hemagglutinating inhibition tests, and the SPR analyses were products of Nacalai Tesque (Japan), Wako Pure Chemical (Japan), Calbiochem, or Sigma. The BIAcore 2000 was a product of Biacore AB (Sweden). Preparation of Affinity Adsorbent—Bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) was conjugated to Amino-Toyopearl 650M with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride by the method reported previously (24Kawagishi H. Yamawaki M. Isobe S. Usui T. Kimura A. Chiba S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1375-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the Lectin—All of the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After defrosting, the fruiting bodies of C. molybdites were homogenized and extracted with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), overnight. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8,500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was percolated slowly through a QAE-Toyopearl column (5 × 8 cm). The nonadsorbed solution was applied directly to a BSM-Toyopearl column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with PBS. The column was exhaustively washed with the same buffer, and the adsorbed lectin was desorbed with 0.5 n ammonia. The eluant was immediately neutralized with 1 m HCl, dialyzed extensively against distilled water, ultrafiltered, and lyophilized. Approximately 0.5 mg of C. molybdites lectin (CML) was obtained from 50 g of the fresh fruiting bodies. Erythrocytes—Intact, Pronase-treated, trypsin-treated, and neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes were prepared as described previously (15Kawagishi H. Mori H. Uno A. Kimura A. Chiba S.

Res. 1988; 183: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Pig erythrocytes were treated by the same procedures. Hemagglutination and Inhibition Assay—The hemagglutinating activity of the lectin was determined by a 2-fold serial dilution procedure using intact, Pronase-treated, trypsin-treated, and neuraminidase-treated human or pig erythrocytes. The hemagglutination titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution exhibiting hemagglutination. Inhibition was expressed as the minimum concentration of each sugar or glycoprotein required for inhibition of hemagglutination of titer 4 of the lectin. SDS-PAGE and Isoelectric Focusing—SDS-PAGE was done by the method of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were heated in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The molecular mass standards (Amersham Biosciences) used were phosphorylase b (94 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-macroglobulin (14.4 kDa). Isoelectric focusing (PhastGel IEF, pH 3–9) was done in a Phastsystem. The pI standards (Amersham Biosciences) used were trypsinogen (pI 9.30), lentil lectin basic band (8.65), lentil lectin middle band (8.45), lentil lectin acidic band (8.15), myoglobin basic band (7.35), myoglobin acidic band (6.85), human carbonic anhydrase B (6.55), bovine carbonic anhydrase B (5.85), β-lactoglobulin A (5.20), soybean trypsin inhibitor (4.55), and amyloglucosidase (3.50). Molecular Mass and Molecular Structure—The molecular mass and molecular structure of CML were determined by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, and gel filtration. Gel filtration by FPLC was carried out on a Sephacryl S-300HR column (2.6 × 60 cm) operating at 4 °C in PBS at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Gel filtration by HPLC was carried out on a TSKgel G3000SWXL column (0.78 × 30 cm) operating at room temperature in PBS at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. The molecular mass was calibrated with the following standard proteins (Sigma): bovine thyroglobulin (669 kDa), horse spleen apoferritin (443 kDa), sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum was acquired on an AutoFlex (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The spectrum was measured in linear mode using 20-kV ion acceleration without postacceleration. The spectrum was recorded at a detector voltage of 1.65 kV and was the averaged results of at least 300 laser shots. Sinapinic acid was used as the matrix. CML was dissolved in 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid:CH3CN (2:1 v/v) and mixed with the matrix solution (1:4 v/v). The mixture (1 μl) was put on a stainless target and crystallized at room temperature. A mass calibration procedure was employed prior to the analysis of a sample using protein calibration standards I and II (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Protein Content Estimation—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford et al. (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1951; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Amino Acid Composition Analysis and N-terminal Sequence Analysis—The lectin was hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 24 h in a sealed evacuated tube and analyzed on a Hitachi l-8500A amino acid analyzer. The cysteine and methionine contents were determined by oxidation of the protein with performic acid followed by hydrolysis under the same conditions as that of the intact protein (35Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 235-237Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The content of tryptophan was estimated by the spectrometric method of Edelhoch (36Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the protein was analyzed on a PPSQ-10 Protein Peptide Sequencer (Shimadzu, Japan). Neutral Sugar Content Estimation—The sugar content was measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method with reference to Glc (37Hodge J.E. Hofreiter B.T. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1962; 1: 338Google Scholar). Sugar Composition Analysis—Sugar compositions were determined as described previously (38Yasuno S. Murata T. Kokubo K. Yamaguchi T. Kamei M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified lectin (200 μg) was dissolved in 20 μl of distilled water in a test tube to which 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (20 μl for neutral sugars) or 8 m HCl (20 μl for amino sugars) was added. The test tube was incubated at 100 °C in a hot block bath. After 4 (neutral sugars) or 6 h (amino sugars), the tube was cooled to room temperature, and the acid was removed by using a centrifugal concentrator at 35 °C. The dried sample was derivatized with ABEE in the presence of borane-pyridine complex at 80 °C. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Distilled water (200 μl) and an equal volume of chloroform were added to the reaction mixture. After vigorous vortexing, the sample was centrifuged (6000 × g, 1 min). The upper aqueous layer was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC under the following conditions: column, Wakosil-II 5C18HG (4.6 × 150 mm); solvent A, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid:CH3CN (90:10), solvent B, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid:CH3CN (50:50); program, 0–45 min (solvent B concentration 0%), 45–55 min (solvent B concentration 100%), 55–70 min (solvent B concentration 0%); flow rate, 1 ml/min; temperature, 45 °C; detection, absorbance at 305 nm. The monosaccharide and amino monosaccharide standards used were GlcNAc, GalNAc, Glc, Gal, Man, Xyl, and l-Fuc. Thermostability, pH Stability, and Metal Cation Requirements—The thermostability and pH stability of the lectin were examined as described previously (24Kawagishi H. Yamawaki M. Isobe S. Usui T. Kimura A. Chiba S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1375-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples in PBS were heated for 30 min at the temperatures indicated, cooled on ice, and titrated. The pH stability of the lectins was measured by incubating the samples in the following buffers for 12 h at 4 °C, dialyzing against PBS, and titrating in PBS: 50 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.0–3.0), 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0–5.5), 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–7.5), 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0–8.5), 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0–11.0). To examine metal cation requirements of the hemagglutination by the lectin, the sample (100 μg/ml) was incubated in 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature, dialyzed against PBS, and titrated. To the demetalized lectin, 0.1 m metal cation (CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, or ZnCl2) was added, and the solution was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and titrated. SPR Analysis—Real time detection of CML binding to glycoproteins was recorded by using a Biacore 2000 (26Kawagishi H. Takagi J. Taira T. Murata T. Usui T. Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Zeng X. Murata T. Kawagishi H. Usui T. Kobayashi K. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 312: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins and CML were immobilized covalently via their primary amines to carboxyl groups within a dextran layer on the sensor chip CM-5 according to the manufacturer's specifications. After chip activation with 0.4 m 1-dimethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 10 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide, BSM, asialo-BSM, fetuin, asialofetuin, PSM (in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0), transferrin (in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0), α1-acid glycoprotein (in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5), or CML (in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 5 mm NeuGc) at a concentration of 50 μg/ml was passed through the flow cells at a rate of 5 μl/min. After immobilization, the chip was capped by exposure to 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). All analyses were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Before loading of analytes, the chip was equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES-buffered saline containing 3 mm EDTA and 0.005% surfactant P-20, pH 7.4 (HBS-EP). Each analyte at various concentrations in the same buffer was injected over the immobilized ligand. After injection of the analyte, HBS-EP was introduced onto the sensor surface to start dissociation. In the case of the co-injection method, each analyte in HBS-EP was injected over immobilized ligand, and then the other analyte in the buffer was introduced onto the sensor surface. The chip was regenerated by injection of 5 μl of 50 mm HCl or NaOH, followed by HBS-EP. Association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) were calculated by using BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore AB, Sweden). The affinity constant (KD) was calculated from the ka and kd. For the calculation of rate constants, samples were appropriately diluted in HBS-EP at various concentrations. The purification procedure is summarized in Table I. Because the hemagglutination activity of the crude extract of the mushroom was inhibited by BSM (21Kobayashi Y. Ishizaki T. Kawagishi H. Int. J. Med. Mushr. 2004; 6: 113-125Crossref Google Scholar), BSM-Toyopearl was used as the affinity support for isolation of the lectin. Initially, the extract of C. molybdites was applied to QAE-Toyopeal in PBS. Under these conditions, the lectin activity was not retained on the QAE column. The lectin solution that passed through the QAE column was directly percolated through a BSM-affinity column. All of the activity adsorbed to the column. However, the lectin activity was not eluted from the column by general eluants such as 1 m NaCl or 3 m KSCN. After several trials to determine the best eluent, the lectin was recovered without significant inactivation after elution with 0.5 n ammonia and then immediate neutralization with 1 n HCl.Table IPurification of CML from 50 g of the fresh fruiting bodies of Chlorophyllum molybditesStepTotal proteinTotal agglutination activitySpecific agglutination activityRecovery of activitymgtiter aTiter was defined as the reciprocal of the end point dilution exhibiting the hemagglutination.titer/mg%PBS extract546873616100QAE ion exchange36460812853BSM affinity0.54096819247a Titer was defined as the reciprocal of the end point dilution exhibiting the hemagglutination. Open table in a new tab The purified lectin, which was designated CML, gave a single band with an apparent mass of 16 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) regardless of the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of 2-mercaptoethanol. HPLC gel filtration of CML gave a single symmetrical peak at an elution volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig. 2). The same result was obtained by FPLC gel filtration of the lectin (data not shown). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum gave a main peak at m/z 15821 and a small peak at m/z 15820 (Fig. 3). The results of SDS-PAGE, gel filtration, and MALDI-TOF mass analysis indicated that this lectin was a homodimer of 16-kDa subunits with no disulfide linkages.Fig. 2HPLC profile of CML.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of CML.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The isoelectric focusing of CML gave a broad band with a pI of ∼3.75 (Fig. 4). The protein content of the lectin was determined to be 87%. The amino acid composition is shown in Table II and revealed a high content of Glx, Gly, and Asx and a low content of Tyr, Met, and Cys. Although 3 nmol of the protein was put into a protein sequencer, the N-terminal amino acid could not be determined, suggesting that the N-terminal amino acid of CML was blocked. The carbohydrate content amounted to 12%, and the components of the sugars in the glycoprotein were identified as GlcNAc:GalNAc:Gal:Man:l-Fuc in a 1.4:1.9: 4.4:2.4:1.0 molar ratio.Table IIAmino acid composition of CMLAmino acidmol %Amino acidMol %Asx10.6Ile4.1Glx14.6Leu6.4Ser8.8Tyr0.1Thr5.2Phe3.1Gly14.0Lys3.2Ala8.7His1.8Val5.5Arg3.8Cys0.7Pro7.3Met0.7Trp1.4 Open table in a new tab CML was stable below 60 °C but was rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 60 °C (Fig. 5). CML was relatively stable over a wide range of pH values and was especially stable between pH 7.5 and 9.5 (Fig. 6).

Open table in a new tab Table IV shows the inhibition of the hemagglutination activity of the lectin by various monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and glycopeptides. Among the monosaccharides tested, the most potent inhibitor was NeuGc and its MIC was 0.63 mm. In contrast, NeuAc did not bind to the lectin even at 40 mm. Me α-GalNAc and GalNAc were also inhibitory at much higher concentrations (12.5 and 50 mm, respectively) than that of NeuGc. Asialo-BSM exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity among the glycoproteins used, and PSM also showed strong inhibition. Asialofetuin, fetuin, BSM and α1-acid glycoprotein also inhibited agglutination at much higher concentrations than asialo-BSM and PSM.Table IVInhibition of CML-mediated hemagglutination by mono- and oligosaccharides and glycoproteinsInhibitoraGlucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, l-fucose, arabinose, ribose, fructose, xylose, glucosamine, galactosamine, mannosamine, l-rhamnose, sorbose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, N-acetyllactosamine, methyl α-glucoside, methyl β-glucoside, methyl α-galactoside, methyl β-galactoside, methyl α-mannoside, methyl α-N-acetylglucosamide, methyl β-N-acetylglucosamide, methyl β-N-acetylgalactosamide, 2-deoxyribose, 2-deoxyglucose, 2-deoxygalactose, p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside, phenyl β-N-acetylglucosaminide, p-nitrophenyl β-galactoside, p-nitrophenyl β-N-acetylgalactosaminide, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, sorbitol, mannitol, lactose, melibiose, maltose, cellobiose, saccharose, lactulose, lactobionic acid, lactitol, dulcitol, rhaffinose, Fucα1→2Galβ1→4Glc and Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)Glc did not inhibit at all at concentrations up 400 mm.

https://openalex.org/W2123873984,"Factor VIII (fVIII) is a plasma glycoprotein that functions as an essential cofactor in blood coagulation. Its carboxyl-terminal “C2” domain is responsible for binding to both activated platelet surfaces and von Willebrand factor. We characterized the effect of 20 hemophilia-associated missense mutations across this domain (that all occur in patients in vivo) on its stability and its binding activities. At least six of these mutations were severely destabilizing, and another four caused moderate destabilization and corresponding reductions in both binding functions. One mutant (A2201P) displayed a significant reduction in its membrane binding activity but normal von Willebrand factor binding, while two others (P2300S and R2304H) caused the opposite effect. Several mutations (including L2210P, V2223M, M2238V, and R2304C) displayed near wild-type stabilities and binding activities and may instead affect mRNA splicing or alternative properties or functions of the protein. This study demonstrated that von Willebrand factor and membrane binding activities can be uncoupled and uniquely disrupted by different mutations and that either effect can lead to similar reductions in clotting activity. It also illustrated how a heterogeneous genetic disorder causes diverse molecular phenotypes that result in similar disease states.

The B domain has no known structural homologues. Factor VIII is initially processed by proteolytic cleavage events that remove a large portion of the B domain, generating a heterodimer that circulates in a tight complex with von Willebrand Factor (vWF) (13Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This interaction is essential for maintaining stable levels of factor VIII in circulation (14Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Marti T. Titani K. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8443-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon vascular injury, further proteolytic processing generates activated factor VIIIa, a heterotrimer that is released from vWF and binds to the membrane surfaces of activated platelets (13Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). There it recruits factor IXa into a tightly bound complex (15Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol.

Additionally many surface epitopes for both alloimmune and autoimmune antibodies as well as monoclonal antibodies are located within the C2 domain, indicating that the C2 domain might be an antigenic “hotspot” (22Scandella D.

Hemophilia A is an X-linked disorder of variable severity that is due to mutations in the factor VIII gene, which is 187 kilobases long and contains 26 exons (6Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Amplett G.W. Foster W.B. Coe M.L. Jnutson G.J. Fass D.N. Hewick R.M.

Hemophilic mutations may cause defects in factor VIII expression, secretion, and/or half-life in circulation. Alternatively some hemophilic mutations can generate stable but dysfunctional factor VIII. An international data base of point mutations that are associated with hemophilia A lists 50 unique missense mutations within the C2 domain that all have been observed in vivo and are associated with variable severity of disease symptoms (30Tuddenham E.G. Schwaab R. Seehafer J. Millar D.S. Gitschier J. Higuchi M. Bidichandani S. Connor J.M. Hoyer L.W. Yoshioka A. Peake I.R. Kolek K. Kazazian H.H. Lavergne J-M. Gianneli F. Antonarakis S.E. Cooper D.N.

Comparison of the specific clotting activity in the plasma of these patients with their circulating factor VIII antigen level (as well as observing their incidence of antibody inhibitor development) can aid in identifying the effect of different hemophilic mutations. Unfortunately these data have been uniformly reported for only a minority of these patients.The crystal structure of the factor VIII C2 domain has been solved to 1.5-Å resolution and in complex with the Fab fragment from a patient-derived antibody inhibitor at 2.0-Å resolution (11Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 31Spiegel Jr., P.C. Jacquemin M. Saint-Remy J.M. Stoddard B.L. Pratt K.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These structures show an eight-stranded β-sandwich topology indicative of the discoidin protein fold family. The membrane-binding surface of the domain consists of two protruding β-hairpin turns that display four solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues (Met-2199, Phe-2200, Leu-2251, and Leu-2252) and an adjacent ring of positively charged basic residues (Arg-2215, Arg-2220, Lys-2227, and Arg-2320). The inhibitory antibody, which blocks binding of the C2 domain to both membrane surfaces and to vWF, completely sequesters this region from solvent, indicating that it may be directly involved in both binding activities.High resolution crystal structures of the factor VIII C2 domain also provide an opportunity to analyze the position and role of each hemophilic missense mutation within this region of the protein (32Liu M.L. Shen B.W. Nakaya S. Pratt K.P. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Stoddard B.L. Thompson A.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 979-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of these missense mutations display greater than 10% surface exposure. While these solvent-exposed mutations may cause a destabilization or misfolding event in the factor VIII C2 domain, it seems plausible that some might disrupt the ability of factor VIII to bind either activated platelet surfaces and/or vWF, causing a loss in procoagulant function.In this study, the position and surface exposure of hemophilic mutations localized to the factor VIII C2 domain were reassessed. Mutations that have greater than 10% surface exposure were produced and subsequently analyzed for their effects on solubility during protein expression and purification, protein stability, PS binding, and vWF binding. A total of 20 unique mutations at 13 different amino acid positions were characterized. Based on these results, disease-associated mutations in the fVIII C2 domain were segregated into those that disrupt structure and stability, those that uniquely affect either membrane binding or vWF association, and those that cause defects in fVIII expression or function that are independent of the biophysical properties of the isolated C2 domain. The analysis serves as a detailed example of the dissection of a genetic molecular disorder where multiple structure-function phenotypes are correlated with the same disease state through different but related effects on protein activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—A factor VIII C2 domain-specific monoclonal antibody, ESH-8, was purchased from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, UK). An Fc-specific, goat anti-mouse IgG that is conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Sigma. 96-well Maxisorp plates were purchased from Nunc. Phosphatidyl-l-serine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Bovine serum albumin (fraction V powder) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were purchased from Sigma. Purified von Willebrand factor was a generous gift from M. Jacquemin (Leuven, Belgium). BL21(DE3), AD-494™ and Rosettagami™ cell lines were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). TAL-ON™ metal affinity resin was purchased from Clontech.Structural Analysis of Hemophilic Mutations—Characterization of hemophilic mutations localized to the factor VIII C2 domain was performed as described previously (32Liu M.L. Shen B.W. Nakaya S. Pratt K.P. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Stoddard B.L. Thompson A.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 979-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solvent accessibility of all side chains from the 1.5-Å crystal structure of the C2 domain was tabulated from the program NACCESS. These values ranged from 0% (completely buried, core residues) to 100% (completely solvent-exposed) as compared with the same residue in an “Ala-X-Ala” tripeptide in a fully extended conformation (33Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Residues that displayed values between 10 and 100% in this analysis (Fig. 2A) were considered to be partially to fully solvent-exposed and targeted for subsequent biochemical studies on the assumption that a subset of such mutations might display unique deficiencies in function, apart from deficiencies of core stability, that illustrate the relative significance of such functions in coagulation and hemostasis. Site-directed mutagenesis of the factor VIII C2 domain was done using the Stratagene QuikChange® kit following the standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were ordered from Operon (Qiagen).Fig. 2Solvent-exposed hemophilic mutations localized to the factor VIII C2 domain.

Ten-ml cultures were grown overnight from a single colony at 37 °C in Luria Broth (LB) medium containing 35 mg/liter chloramphenicol and 100 mg/liter ampicillin (as well as 25 mg/liter kanamycin for AD-494 and 25 mg/liter tetracycline for Rosetta-gami). One-liter cultures were inoculated with 10 ml of overnight cultures and grown to an A600 of 0.8–1.0. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactosidase. Inductions were grown for 16–20 h at 16 °C with shaking.Cells were lysed by sonication in 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm imidazole, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall) for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to TALON metal affinity resin at 4 °C for 1.5–2.0 h. TALON resin was pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at 1500 rpm at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 20 column volumes of 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm imidazole, and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. The resin was then washed with 20 column volumes of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm imidazole, and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. The protein-resin slurry was then applied to a gravity low column (Bio-Rad). The pure fraction was eluted in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm imidazole, and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol and subsequently dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. Purified factor VIII C2 domain mutants (Fig. 2b) were concentrated to between 0.5 and 5 mg/ml (dependent on yield and solubility).CD Measurements of Folding and Stability—The stabilities of the recombinant factor VIII C2 domain and soluble hemophilic mutants were measured by chemical denaturation using circular dichroism as described previously (34Dantas G. Kuhlman B. Callender D. Wong M. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). CD spectra on the wild-type domain (Fig. 3) and on the mutants were collected on an Aviv 62A DS spectrometer. All protein samples were diluted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Far-UV CD wavelength scans (200–260 nm) (Fig. 3) at varying protein concentrations (5–20 μm) were collected using a 1-mm pathlength cuvette. Protein denaturation due to guanidine HCl titration was followed by change in ellipticity at 220 nm (Fig. 4 and Table I). Measurements were carried out using a 1-cm pathlength cuvette and a Microlab titrator (Hamilton) for guanidine HCl mixing. To obtain the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔGU), chemical denaturation curves were fit by non-linear least-squares analysis using a linear extrapolation model as described previously (35Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 36Bolen D.W. Santoro M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8069-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For each mutant, three independent denaturation experiments were performed, and standard deviation values of ΔG were calculated. ΔΔG values (Table I, final column) correspond to the relative difference in the free energy change (ΔG) of unfolding between the wild-type and mutant domains; a negative value indicates destabilization of the mutant with the extent of destabilization proportional to the magnitude of ΔΔG.Fig. 3Circular dichroism spectrum of wild-type factor VIII C2 domain.

Plates were then blocked with 200 μl of 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (BSA-TBS). 100 μl of each soluble C2 domain mutant was serially diluted to concentrations between 5 and 50 nm in BSA-TBS and were incubated on the PS-coated plates for 60 min at 37 °C with shaking. These protein concentrations correspond to the linear range of the assay dose response before saturation of the membrane surface by the C2 domain becomes observable. Plates were manually rinsed three times with TBS between all incubation steps. Subsequent to the C2 domain incubation, 100 μl of the C2 domain-specific monoclonal antibody ESH-8 diluted 1:1000 in BSA-TBS was added. 100 μl of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was diluted 1:4000 in BSA-TBS and then added as the secondary antibody. The C2 domain mutants that had bound to the PS-coated plate were detected by the addition of 200 μlof p-nitrophenyl phosphate followed by absorbance measurements at 405 nm using a microplate reader.The relative binding activities of the point mutants described under “Results” compared with the wild-type C2 domain (Fig. 5 and Table I) correspond to the average of the change in signal in the ELISA assay across the range of protein concentrations. Similar to the wild-type domain, the mutants all display a linear dose response in the assay across these concentrations. All measurements were made in triplicate at all protein concentrations, allowing calculation of the standard deviation of relative binding activities using at least nine separate measurements distributed across three protein concentrations for each mutant.Fig. 5Relative stabilities and binding activities of surface-exposed C2 domain point mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2026345539,"When located next to chromosomal elements such as telomeres, genes can be subjected to epigenetic silencing. In yeast, this is mediated by the propagation of the SIR proteins from telomeres toward more centromeric regions. Particular transcription factors can protect downstream genes from silencing when tethered between the gene and the telomere, and they may thus act as chromatin domain boundaries. Here we have studied one such transcription factor, CTF-1, that binds directly histone H3. A deletion mutagenesis localized the barrier activity to the CTF-1 histone-binding domain. A saturating point mutagenesis of this domain identified several amino acid substitutions that similarly inhibited the boundary and histone binding activities. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the barrier protein efficiently prevents the spreading of SIR proteins, and that it separates domains of hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated histones. Together, these results suggest a mechanism by which proteins such as CTF-1 may interact directly with histone H3 to prevent the propagation of a silent chromatin structure, thereby defining boundaries of permissive and silent chromatin domains. When located next to chromosomal elements such as telomeres, genes can be subjected to epigenetic silencing. In yeast, this is mediated by the propagation of the SIR proteins from telomeres toward more centromeric regions. Particular transcription factors can protect downstream genes from silencing when tethered between the gene and the telomere, and they may thus act as chromatin domain boundaries. Here we have studied one such transcription factor, CTF-1, that binds directly histone H3. A deletion mutagenesis localized the barrier activity to the CTF-1 histone-binding domain. A saturating point mutagenesis of this domain identified several amino acid substitutions that similarly inhibited the boundary and histone binding activities. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the barrier protein efficiently prevents the spreading of SIR proteins, and that it separates domains of hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated histones. Together, these results suggest a mechanism by which proteins such as CTF-1 may interact directly with histone H3 to prevent the propagation of a silent chromatin structure, thereby defining boundaries of permissive and silent chromatin domains. The expression state of a eukaryotic gene depends in part on its location in the chromosome. This position effect results from the organization of eukaryotic genomes into discrete functional domains, defined by local differences in chromatin structure. The expression of genes within each domain appears to be defined and maintained by the concerted action of regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, silencers, and locus control regions. Individual domains may be bordered by boundary elements that separate regions of permissive and silent chromatin. Experimentally, boundary elements have been defined functionally by their ability to protect against position effect when flanking the assayed gene. Examples of boundary elements in metazoans include the subtelomeric anti-silencing regions at yeast telomeres, the scs and scs′ elements flanking the 87A1 hsp70 locus in Drosophila, and the chicken β-globin boundary elements (1Fourel G.

Several proteins have been associated with barrier activities in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells (5West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric regions is one of the best-studied examples of position-dependent gene expression. This phenomenon is referred to as telomere position effect and is similar to the position effect variegation (PEV) initially described in Drosophila (6Weiler K.S. Wakimoto B.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 577-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing at yeast telomeres is associated with a heterochromatin-like structure (7Braunstein M. Holmes S.G. Broach J.R. Driel R.V. Otte A.P. Nuclear Organization, Chromatin Structure, and Gene Expression. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 250-275Google Scholar, 8Fourel G. Lebrun E. Gilson E. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DNA wrapped in transcriptionally silent chromatin replicates late in S phase and is refractory to some modifying agents. In addition, nucleosomes have reduced acetylation compared with nucleosomes from active region of the genome (9Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 10Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing at subtelomeric regions is mediated by a multiprotein nucleosome binding complex called the SIR complex, composed of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 proteins (11Moazed D. Kistler A. Axelrod A. Rine J. Johnson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This complex is recruited to DNA by the telomere-binding protein Rap1 (13Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A series of physical and genetic arguments imply that this SIR complex may nucleate from the telomere and spread along the chromosome to coat more centromeric regions and thereby silence intervening genes (14Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 15Grunstein M. Cell. 1998; 93: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Silencing in natural subtelomeric regions further involves auxiliary recruitment at protosilencer relay elements found in the middle-repetitive X and Y′ subtelomeric elements (1Fourel G. Revardel E. Koering C.E. Gilson E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2522-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Fourel G. Lebrun E. Gilson E.

The proteins involved in silencing form extensive homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Both Sir3 and Sir4 can homodimerize and heterodimerize. They also bind to Sir2, Rap1 (17Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and histones H3 and H4 (18Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 19Johnson L.M. Kayne P.S. Kahn E.S. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition Sir3 interacts with histones H2A and H2B (20Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Sir4 can interact with Rap1 at telomere proximal positions in the absence of Sir2 and Sir3 proteins, but Sir4 binding at telomere-distal heterochromatin is strongly dependent on other Sir proteins (21Luo K. Vega-Palas M.A. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These interactions and the discovery of the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity of Sir2 (22Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2779) Google Scholar, 23Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) has led to the current model for the establishment of telomeric silencing. In this model, Sir4 is the first of the SIR proteins that is recruited by Rap-1 and helps determine the subsequent association of heterochromatin proteins. The Sir4-mediated recruitment of Sir2 to the DNA is followed by deacetylation of the tails of histones H3 and H4. This then allows the binding of the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins to deacetylated histone tails and the recruitment of a new Sir2-Sir4 complex. Repetition of this binding/modification cycle would result in spreading of the SIR complex outward from the nucleation site (25Hoppe G.J. Tanny J.C. Rudner A.D. Gerber S.A. Danaie S. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4167-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). How boundary proteins protect against the encroachment of repressive chromatin complexes remains unclear. However, the activity of boundary elements is usually conserved when transposed into other organisms, indicating that they share an evolutionary conserved mechanism (27Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28Defossez P.A. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5136-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two different models for boundary function have been discussed: the “nuclear organization” and the “chromatin modifying” models (29Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The nuclear organization model suggests that boundary elements congregate to create a subnuclear compartment or are tethered to a nuclear structure, which then forms a physical block against the spreading of heterochromatin (30Gerasimova T.I. Byrd K. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 31Gerasimova T.I. Corces V.G. Annu. Rev.

Laemmli U.K. Cell. 2002; 109: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The chromatin modifying model suggests that boundary proteins mediate an active process by recruiting a multiprotein complex, bearing acetyltransferase and/or nucleosome remodeling activities, which precludes nucleosome assembly, thereby disrupting a contiguous array of hypoacetylated nucleosomes required for the spread of silent chromatin (27Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 33Oki M. Valenzuela L. Chiba T. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1956-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Bi X. Broach J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In yeast, transcriptional activation domains of various species were shown to efficiently protect reporter genes against telomeric silencing (35Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These were shown to prevent the silencing of telomere-proximal genes, when interposed via a heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain between the gene and the VII-L telomere, and to generate an apparent discontinuity in silent chromatin propagation (35Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity per se appears not to be involved in these effects. One likely interpretation for these findings is that the transcription factors somehow prevent the propagation of a silent chromatin structure from the telomere. However, a direct implication of chromatin structure in this effect is currently lacking, and other interpretations are possible, including mechanisms involving changes in subnuclear localization. Interestingly, one of the strongest boundary activities detected in this organism consisted of the transcriptional activation domain of CTF-1, a member of the CTF/NF-I family of mammalian transcription and replication factors previously shown to interact directly with histone H3 (35Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTF-1 was shown to remodel reconstituted chromatin in vitro (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and native chromatin at yeast origins of replication in vivo (37Erkine A.M. Gross D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7755-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we have evaluated whether CTF-1 H3 binding activity is required for the boundary activity, whether it can modify the structure of chromatin in vivo in subtelomeric regions, and whether this may mediate the boundary effect. Saturation mutagenesis and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that the CTF-1 histone binding activity is required for boundary activity, and that the histone-binding domain can act as a barrier against the propagation of a SIR-containing, histone-hypoacetylated, silent chromatin structure from telomeres. This contrasts the activity of the VP16 transcriptional activator, which induces local histone hyperacetylation bidirectionally and prevents the propagation of SIR proteins, thus acting as a bidirectional anti-silencer. These results indicate that the boundary activity of transcription factors involves specific actions beyond DNA binding and that interaction with histones is one of the mechanisms by which the propagation of silent chromatin can be blocked. Mammalian Cells Expression Vectors—Mammalian expression vectors for fusion polypeptides consisting of the histone H3 mutants or derivatives linked to the VP16 TAD at the N terminus are based on pMLV-VP (39Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and fusions were generated as for the parental plasmid pMLV-VP-H3 (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For VP-yH3-I and VP-mH3.2, the full-length yeast S. cerevisiae histone H3 copy I and the mouse subtype sequences were amplified by PCR from pMS191 (kindly provided by S. M. Gasser (40Smith M.M. Murray K. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 641-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and p53 H5A (gift from D. Schümperli), respectively, and inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pMLV-VP. VP-mH3.1 was derived from mouse subtype two in pBluescript (pBS-mH3.2) by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid 98 (Ser(AGC) → Cys(TGT)) by PCR and similarly cloned into pML-VP plasmid. The transforming growth factor-β responsive domain of CTF-1 (TRD), 1The abbreviations used are: TRD, transforming growth factor-β responsive domain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. encoding amino acids 486–499, was extensively mutagenized and introduced in-frame into the pRSV GAL4 expression vector (41Muller K. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1645-1650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) coding for the first 147 amino acids of GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The pRSV GalTRD mutated fusion proteins were constructed by replacing the Oct2 (mammalian octamer factor 2) activation domain in pRSV GalOct2 (41Muller K. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1645-1650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), by double-stranded oligos using the XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. Except for amino acid at position 486, where Asp(GAC) was mutated to Lys(AAG) (D486K), all amino acids were mutated to an aspartate, drastically changing both charge and polarity of the amino acid as compared with that of the wild type protein. The TRD mutations fused to the pRSV GAL4 DNA-binding domain are: P487D, A488D, G489D, I490D, Y491D, Q492D, A493D, Q494D, S495D, W496D, Y497D, L498D, and G499D. Yeast Cell Expression Vectors—All mutated sequences of CTF-1 TRD were inserted in-frame at the C-terminal coding extremity of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain sequence (amino acids 1–93, abbreviated Gal). pHAC GalTRD and all TRD point mutants were constructed by insertion of double-stranded oligos containing XmaI/XbaI sites into the corresponding sites of the yeast pHAC-GAL4 vector (pHAC-GalPRO, containing the ARS1 replication origin, the CEN4 and HIS3 genes; a gift from W. Schaffner), producing: pHAC Gal TRD, pHAC Gal D486K, pHAC Gal P487D, pHAC Gal A488D, pHAC Gal G489D, pHAC Gal I490D, pHAC Gal Y491D, pHAC Gal Q492D, pHAC Gal A493D, pHAC Gal Q494D, pHAC Gal S495D, pHAC Gal W496D, pHAC Gal Y497D, pHAC Gal L498D, and pHAC Gal G499D. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse NIH3T3 cells were grown and transfected by electroporation as described previously (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells destined for both CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) and β-galactosidase assays were harvested and lysed for 10 min at room temperature in 100 μl of 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). CAT activities were determined using standard procedures and normalized to the activity resulting from the internal control CMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech) that gives an indication on the relative efficiency of transfection. Transcriptional activation assay in a chromatin context were performed in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the G5BCAT reporter construct as described earlier (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Transfected NIH3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C for 30 h and lysed in 100 μl of 2× loading buffer (Promega), and the remaining cells in 30 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Equal amounts of proteins, corresponding to roughly 10% of the total transfected cells, were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted for 1 h at 70 V onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot detection was performed using standard procedures using the rabbit LA-2 polyclonal anti-GAL4-(1–147)-VP16 antibody (a gift from S. Triezenberg) diluted 5000-fold. The rabbit antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturers. Molecular weights were estimated by comparison with the relative migration of a low range prestained SDS-PAGE marker (Bio-Rad). Gel Mobility Shift Analysis—For gel mobility shift analysis, the GalTRD mutant fusion proteins were transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells. At 24 h post-transfection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, before lysis in 80 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by repeated freeze-thaw cycles (42Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternatively, yeast cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by mechanical breakage using a Bead Beater (Biospec). 14 μg of protein extract was incubated on ice in 15 μl of reaction mixture (0.01 mm ZnCl2, 4.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4.7 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 7.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) with a 32P end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe containing the 17-bp GAL4-binding site (43Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free probe on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel as performed by Armentero et al. (44Armentero M.T. Horwitz M. Mermod N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11537-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and revealed by autoradiography and phosphoimaging. Yeast Strains and Media—All yeast media were used as described by Adams et al. (45Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Yeast cells were always grown in selective minimal media (Stratagene Inc.) at 30 °C. The boundary assay of telomeric genes in yeast were performed using yeast strains W303-1a (MATa, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp-1, can1-100 containing the TRP1 GAL4UAS URA3 inserted at telomere VII-L) for the boundary assay and with Y187 (MATα, TRP1-901, leu2-3, ade2-101, lacZ, URA3-52, His3, gal4, gal80, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) to assess transcriptional activity of Gal-TRD fusions. Analysis of URA3 Expression—The variegated expression of URA3 was monitored by scoring the fraction of yeast cells from a culture pre-grown in non-selective conditions either expressing or not the URA3 gene. Cells with a repressed URA3 gene were identified as those able to form colonies in the presence of 5-FOA, a compound toxic for cells expressing a functional URA3 gene product (46Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). After overnight growth to saturation, 10-μl drops of serial dilutions were plated onto SC and SC + 5-FOA (1 g/liter), as well as onto SC-Trp and SC-Trp + 5-FOA for a strain carrying both URA3 and TRP1 reporter genes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells containing the URA3 gene and the TRP1 gene deleted of its promoter were grown as above. 50 ml of cells (2.0 × 107 cells/ml) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm and the incubation continued for 5 min. The cross-linked cells were washed twice with digestion buffer (1 m sorbitol, 1× XbaI buffer, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptine, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and sonicated to obtain chromatin fragments of ∼500 bp. Chromatin was then digested by adding 50 units of XbaI for 45 min at 37 °C to cleave the DNA between the URA3 and the TRP1 genes. Immunoprecipitation was performed with precoated Dynabeads overnight at 4 °C and using specific antibodies against tetra-acetylated histone H4 (K5, 8, 12, 16), diacetylated histone H3 (K9, 14) (Upstate), or against SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 proteins (Santa Cruz). An aliquot of each sample was not immunoprecipitated (Input). Input and immunoprecipitated samples were incubated 6 h at 65 °Cto revert the formaldehyde cross-linking, prior to DNA purification and quantitative PCR analysis. Quantitative PCR Analysis of Immunoprecipitated DNA—Quantitative PCR was performed using the qPCR Core Kit for Sybr Green I from Eurogentec and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. PCR were carried out in a 25-μl volume with 1/1000 of the immunoprecipitated material and 1/10,000 of the input material. Enrichment ratios were measured using the absolute quantification method, as described by Arnold et al. (47Arnold B.A. Hepler R.W. Keller P.M. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Primers used are specific for the reporter URA3 gene (5′-GTT-TCAGCTTTCCGCAACAGT-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCTTCCTTCGTTCTTCC-3′), producing a 179-bp fragment, and for the reporter TRP1 gene (5′-GCGGAGGTGTGGAGACAAAT-3′ and 5′-GACAGTCCTCCGTC-GAGATCTG-3′), producing a 142-bp fragment. Both include specific junctions generated in the cloning process. Additional PCRs were performed on the telomere distal ADH4 gene (5′-GTGCAAAGCCTTGAT-GGTTTC-3′ and 5′-TGTTCAAGAGGCCAACATGC-3′) producing a 1112-bp fragment. Control PCRs of each immunoprecipitated DNA were performed in the MATa locus (5′-GAATTGGCTATACGGGACGGA-3′ and 5′-AAGT-CATGTGAACCGCATGG-3′), producing a 103-bp fragment, and in the HMRa locus (5′-CCCCGTCCAAGTTATGAGCTT-3′ and 5′-CCT-GCGCTTATTCTCAAACGT-3′), producing a 140-bp fragment. Chromatin Boundary Activity of the CTF-1 Transcriptional Activation Domain—The CTF-1 transcription activation domain was previously shown to display strong boundary activity in yeast (Fig. 1A and Ref. 35Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that CTF-1 histone interaction might be involved in its boundary activity, we first evaluated whether the histone-binding portion of CTF-1 might bear the boundary activity. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain, either alone or tethered to various portions of the CTF-1 activation domain was expressed in yeast cells containing an URA3 gene inserted in a telomeric position (35Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the GalPRO fusion protein containing the complete transcriptional activation domain of CTF-1 prevented URA3 silencing when interposed between the telomere and the reporter gene, but not when located in a telomere-distal position. Similarly, when placed between the telomeric TRP1 and URA3 genes, it selectively prevents silencing of the telomere distal TRP1 gene but not that of the telomere-proximal URA3 gene (Fig. 1C), in agreement with Fourel et al. (35Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the CTF-1 transcriptional activation domain functions as a boundary element that prevents the silencing of telomere distal genes, irrespective of the gene and promoter type but in a position dependent fashion. Thus it acts effectively as a boundary element between active and inactive chromosomal domains. In contrast, the VP16 transcriptional activator induced the expression of both the TRP1 and URA3 genes, thus acting as a bidirectional anti-silencer (Fig. 1C and Ref. 35Fourel G. Boscheron C.

Another fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the C-terminal 14 amino acids of CTF-1, known to contain the minimal interaction domain for histone H3 (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1645-1650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was similarly able to prevent silencing of the URA3 gene when recruited to telomere-proximal UAS elements and it similarly acted as a boundary element (Fig. 1, B and C). A point mutation in this subdomain, previously shown to decrease interaction with histone H3 (GalTRD Y497D (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)), significantly impaired its ability to counteract silencing. These data taken together gave a first indication that the histone interaction ability of CTF-1 may be linked to its barrier properties. Specificity of the Histone Binding Activity of CTF-1—The possibility that the CTF-1 boundary activity may be mediated by its histone H3 binding activity was further addressed by evaluating if CTF-1 can indeed interact with the yeast histone H3. Previous studies had demonstrated that the CTF-1 transcriptional activation domain selectively interacts with the mammalian histone H3.3 variant but not with H1, H2A, H2B, and H4, both in vivo using two-hybrid assays, and in vitro in co-precipitation studies (36Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, whether it can also interact with the yeast histone H3, although probable given the extremely high degree of conservation of histone sequences across species, has not been reported as yet. This was tested in vivo using a two-hybrid assay where the GAL4 CTF-1 hybrid protein was co-expressed in mammalian cells together with either a fusion of histone H3 and the strong activation domain of the viral VP16 activator, or with the unfused VP16 moiety as a control. In this assay, interaction o"

PAKs are activated by the p21 G-proteins Rac and Cdc42 in response to a variety of extracellular signals and act in pathways controlling cell growth, shape, motility, survival, and death. PAK-2 is unique among the PAK family members because it is also activated through proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3 or similar proteases to generate the constitutively active PAK-2p34 fragment. Activation of full-length PAK-2 by Rac or Cdc42 stimulates cell survival and protects cells from cell death, whereas caspase-activated PAK-2p34 induces a cell death response. Caspase-activated PAK-2p34 is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome, but full-length PAK-2 is not. Stabilization of PAK-2p34 by preventing its polyubiquitination and degradation results in a dramatic stimulation of cell death. Although many proteins have been shown to interact with and regulate full-length PAK-2, little is known about the regulation of caspase-activated PAK-2p34. Here, we identify PS-GAP as a regulator of caspase-activated PAK-2p34. PS-GAP is a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and RhoA that was originally identified by its interaction with the tyrosine kinase PYK-2. PS-GAP interacts specifically with caspase-activated PAK-2p34, but not active or inactive full-length PAK-2, through a region between the GAP and SH3 domains. The interaction with PS-GAP inhibits the protein kinase activity of PAK-2p34 and changes the localization of PAK-2p34 from the nucleus to the perinuclear region. Furthermore, PS-GAP decreases the stimulation of cell death induced by stabilization of PAK-2p34. p21-activated protein kinase (PAK)-2 is a member of the PAK family of serine/threonine kinases.

In multicellular organisms, cell metabolism needs to be tightly regulated by extracellular signals and intracellular signaling pathways. Because of the variety of signals cells receive, the precise balance and modulation of various signals are critical for normal function. Dysregulation of cell signaling pathways can result in cell death or malignant transformation. Protein kinases play a critical role in modulation of a wide variety of signals, and many protein kinases have been identified as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, demonstrating their critical role in cell signaling (1Krebs E.G.

Active Cdc42 and Rac bind to a region within the regulatory domain of PAKs. This binding region overlaps with an autoinhibitory region within PAK-1, PAK-2, and PAK-3, and p21 binding induces conformational changes that lead to PAK activation (10Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tu H. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Lei M.

PAK-4, PAK-5, and PAK-6 appear to lack this autoinhibitory region, although they are still activated by binding of active Cdc42 and Rac (7Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V.

PAKs have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of cell shape and motility through effects on the actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling pathways and regulation of cell survival and death (14Lim L.

PAKs appear to accomplish these different functions by interaction with a variety of other signaling molecules. The best known PAK interaction partners are the p21 monomeric G-proteins Cdc42 and Rac. Indeed, the PAK family was first identified in an overlay screen for proteins that interact with activated Rac (3Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Binding of Cdc42 and Rac to the so-called PBD (p21-binding domain) or CRIB (Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding) domain results in activation of PAKs. Interestingly, sphingolipids also interact with the same region and activate PAKs (20Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, the adaptor protein Nck binds to a proline-rich motif within the regulatory domain of PAK (residues 12-16 of PAK-1) and has been implicated in recruiting PAKs to activated growth factor receptor complexes (21Bokoch G.M.

More recently, PAK-3 has been shown to interact with paxillin, which acts as a scaffolding adaptor protein in integrin signaling, through a region within the PAK regulatory domain that may include the Nck-binding site (27Hashimoto S. Tsubouchi A. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6037-6045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Paxillin can compete with Nck for PAK binding; surprisingly, it also appears to compete with Pix, even though they are believed to interact with distinct regions within the regulatory domain of PAK. PAK-1, PAK-2, and PAK-4 have been shown to suppress cell death and to promote cell survival through phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad (28Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C.

Constitutive activation of PAKs appears to be involved in malignant transformation, cancer development, and cancer cell invasion.

PAK-2 is unique among the PAKs because of the existence of a cleavage site for caspase-3 or a caspase-3-like protease within the regulatory domain. Proteolytic cleavage C-terminal of Asp212 removes most of the regulatory domain, generating a constitutively active PAK-2p34 catalytic fragment (36Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 37Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Caspase-mediated generation of PAK-2p34 has been observed in response to a variety of apoptotic stimulants (31Jakobi R. Moertl E. Koeppel M.A. J. Biol.

Additionally, ectopic expression of PAK-2p34 stimulates cell death (40Lee N. MacDonald H. Reinhard C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 41Rudel T. Zenke F.T. Chuang T.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 7-11PubMed Google Scholar, 42Jakobi R. McCarthy C.C. Koeppel M.A. Stringer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38675-38685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, PAK-2 appears to have dual and opposing functions in the regulation of cell survival and death. Activated full-length PAK-2 stimulates cell survival and suppresses cell death, whereas proteolytically activated PAK-2p34 induces a cell death response. We have shown recently that localization and protein levels of PAK-2p34 are tightly regulated (42Jakobi R. McCarthy C.C. Koeppel M.A. Stringer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38675-38685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of PAK-2 is regulated by nuclear export and nuclear localization signals. In full-length PAK-2, the nuclear export signal dominates over the nuclear localization signal, resulting in cytoplasmic localization. Caspase cleavage disrupts the nuclear export signal and results in nuclear accumulation of PAK-2p34. Protein levels of PAK-2p34 are regulated by ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Caspase-activated PAK-2p34 is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome, but full-length PAK-2 is not. Expression of epitope-tagged ubiquitin stabilizes PAK-2p34 by preventing its polyubiquitination and degradation, and stabilization of PAK-2p34 results in dramatic stimulation of programmed cell death (42Jakobi R. McCarthy C.C. Koeppel M.A. Stringer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38675-38685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cleavage of PAK-2 to the PAK-2p34 fragment removes interaction sites for Nck, Pix/COOL proteins, paxillin, and Cdc42/Rac/sphingolipids, thereby freeing the PAK-2p34 fragment from these known regulators of PAK signaling. Here, we report the identification of a novel PAK-2 regulator, PS-GAP. PS-GAP is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Cdc42 and RhoA previously identified by interaction with the tyrosine kinase PYK-2 (43Ren X.R. Du Q.S. Huang Y.Z. Ao S.Z. Mei L. Xiong W-C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PS-GAP interacts selectively with caspase-activated PAK-2p34 both in vitro and in vivo, but does not interact with full-length PAK-2. The interaction with PS-GAP regulates the activity and subcellular localization of caspase-activated PAK-2p34. PS-GAP inhibits the protein kinase activity of PAK-2p34 in vitro and changes the localization of PAK-2p34 from the nucleus to the perinuclear region. Furthermore, PS-GAP appears to regulate the ability of caspase-activated PAK-2p34 to induce programmed cell death. Expression of PS-GAP reduces levels of cell death induced by stabilization of PAK-2p34. PS-GAP is the first identified protein that specifically regulates pro-apoptotic caspase-activated PAK-2p34, but not anti-apoptotic full-length PAK-2, a critical step in elucidating the pro-apoptotic PAK-2p34 signaling pathway.

An aliquot of 10 μg of GST fusion protein was mixed with 10% of the in vitro transcription/translation reaction in 200 μl of pull-down buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) plus 0.8% bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice for 1 h. An aliquot of 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with pull-down buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Molecular Cloning—To obtain full-length PS-GAP cDNA, mouse heart cDNA was amplified by PCR (49Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar) using the forward primer PS-GAP-5′ (5′-TTGTGTTCATATGGGGCTGCAGCCCCTGGAGTTTA), corresponding to the start codon region of PS-GAP (43Ren X.R. Du Q.S. Huang Y.Z. Ao S.Z. Mei L. Xiong W-C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the reverse primer PS-GAP-3′ (5′-ACATTCTAGACTACAGGAGCTTGACATAATTCTGTGGA), corresponding to the stop codon region of clone p/K18 and elongated using the Advantage 2 PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction using the Geneclean III kit and ligated into the pDRIVE vector. Clones were identified through plasmid isolation using QIAprep spin miniprep kits, followed by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Selected clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using Vector NTI Suite 7.1 (Informax). BLAST (NCBI Protein Database) was used for homology searches. To facilitate subcloning of PS-GAP, an internal BamHI site in PS-GAP-a was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis according to the megaprimer PCR method (50Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 51Jakobi R. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23894-23902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) without changing the amino acid sequence. The megaprimer was amplified with PS-GAP-5′ and ΔBamHI-3′ (TCCTCTTCGAGCTCCGCTTCGTGCGCGCGCGTATCCTCTCCCGGAACCA) using full-length PS-GAP-a as a template. Then, the megaprimer was used together with PS-GAP-3′ to amplify full-length PS-GAP-a. The cDNA encoding PS-GAP-a with the disrupted BamHI site was subcloned into pExpress/HA and pExpress/Myc for expression in mammalian cells. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—cDNA was reverse-transcribed using total RNA from mouse brain, heart, kidney, liver, and testes and BALB/3T3 mouse fibroblasts with the Thermoscript RT-PCR kit. Primer pair P1/P2 (P1, 5′-AACTACGCATATGATTCCATTTGAGCACAGATC; and P2, 5′-CAATCTGCAGAATTCTCCAGG) and primer pair P3/P4 (P3, 5′-TAACAGTCATATGAAGATTTTTCGAACCTCGCCTG; and P4, 5′-CTGATGGATCCTTATGCCCGAGCCTTTCGATTGAT) were used at 0.2 μm to amplify an aliquot of the RT reactions by PCR for 40 cycles with Platinum Taq polymerase. Products were separated by gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were seeded at densities that will allow them to reach 50% confluency within 16-24 h. Plasmid DNAs for epitope-tagged PS-GAP-a and PAK-2 constructs were transfected into cells using Genejammer or TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed. To stabilize recombinant PAK-2p34, cells were cotransfected with pMT107 encoding His-tagged ubiquitin (42Jakobi R. McCarthy C.C. Koeppel M.A. Stringer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38675-38685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting—293T cells transfected with epitope-tagged PS-GAP-a and PAK-2 constructs were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine γ-globulin as a protein standard. 500 μg of lysate protein was diluted with PBS to a final concentration of ∼5 μg/μl and incubated overnight with 20 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed with pull-down buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) and analyzed by Western blotting. Western blotting was performed using cell lysates (30 μg of protein) or immunoprecipitates (from 150-250 μg of cell lysate) by SDS-PAGE, followed by semidry transfer to polyvinylidene membranes. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using SuperSignal reagent and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Rho-GAP Assays—RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were expressed in E. coli XL2-Blue as GST fusion proteins using pGEX2-T, whereas PS-GAP-a was expressed as a GST fusion protein in TN-5B1-4 cells using pAcG2T. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were absorbed to glutathione-Sepharose as described above and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Purified GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, and GST-Cdc42 were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. For Rho-GAP assays, G-proteins were preloaded at 30 °C for 5 min using 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]GTP (800 cpm/pmol) and placed on ice. MgCl2 and GTP were added to 12 and 2 mm, respectively. GTPase activity was monitored by incubating preloaded Rho GTPase for 5 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of PS-GAP and spotting on nitrocellulose filters. Filters were washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and dried, and the remaining [γ-32P]GTP was analyzed by scintillation counting. The effects of PAK-2p34 on GTPase activity were measured by preincubation of PS-GAP-a with 10 mm MgCl2 and 200 μm ATP for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of GST-PAK-2p34 prior to performing the GAP assay as outlined above. Kinase Assays—Autophosphorylation and kinase activity of purified recombinant GST-PAK-2p34 (0.1-0.2 μg) and GST-PAK-2-T402E (0.1-0.2 μg) were determined in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. 1 μg of myelin basic protein or histone H4 was used as substrate.

The patient's mother carried only the E80D mutation. The equivalent positions are 62 and 69 in Bacillus subtilis ASL. Although both human and B. subtilis enzymes normally have Asp at position 87 (or 69), the B. subtilis ASL has Ile and Asp at 62 and 65, respectively, whereas human ASL has Glu and Arg at the equivalent positions. We have constructed, expressed, and purified the double mutant I62E/D65R as a “humanized” normal B. subtilis enzyme to compare with enzymes with a single mutation at position 62 (I62D/D65R), at position 69 (I62E/D65R/D69E), or at both positions (I62D/D65R/D69E). Vmax for conversion of adenylosuccinate to AMP and fumarate is 0.57 μmol/min/mg for I62E/D65R, 0.064 μmol/min/mg for I62D/D65R, 0.27 μmol/min/mg for I62E/D65R/D69E, and 0.069 μmol/min/mg for I62D/D65R/D69E. The Km for adenylosuccinate is elevated in the X62D mutants, and I62D/D65R is the least stable of these ASLs at 37 °C. The CD spectra of mutant and wild type enzymes are similar; thus, there are no appreciable structural changes. Clearly the Asp62 causes the most drastic effect on ASL function, whereas the Glu69 mutation produces only modest change. These results emphasize the importance of expanding tests for ASL deficiency to individuals with developmental delay of any severity, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorder. This study further demonstrates the usefulness of the B. subtilis ASL as a model to mimic the defective enzyme in ASL deficiency.

These results emphasize the importance of expanding tests for ASL deficiency to individuals with developmental delay of any severity, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorder. This study further demonstrates the usefulness of the B. subtilis ASL as a model to mimic the defective enzyme in ASL deficiency. Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism resulting from a defective enzyme important in the de novo pathway of purine biosynthesis (1Jaeken J. Van den Berghe G. Lancet. 1984; 2: 1058-1061PubMed Google Scholar, 2Van den Berghe G. Jaeken J. Scriver C.R. Beaudt A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. II. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2653-2662Google Scholar). This deficiency is characterized by variable degrees of developmental delay, often accompanied by autistic features and epileptic seizures (2Van den Berghe G. Jaeken J. Scriver C.R. Beaudt A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. II. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2653-2662Google Scholar). Biochemically, the enzyme deficiency is diagnosed by the appearance in cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and to a smaller extent in plasma, of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) 1The abbreviations used are: SAICA, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide; ASL, adenylosuccinate lyase; SAMP, adenylosuccinate; SAdo, succinyl adenosine; SAICAR, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide; AICAR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide.1The abbreviations used are: SAICA, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide; ASL, adenylosuccinate lyase; SAMP, adenylosuccinate; SAdo, succinyl adenosine; SAICAR, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide; AICAR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide. and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) (2Van den Berghe G. Jaeken J. Scriver C.R. Beaudt A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. II. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2653-2662Google Scholar). ASL catalyzes two distinct reactions in the synthesis of purine nucleotides, as shown in Scheme Ia, the cleavage of adenylosuccinate (SAMP) to AMP, the second step in the conversion of IMP to AMP and, Scheme Ib, the conversion of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR), the eighth step of the de novo synthesis (3Ratner S. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 167-197Google Scholar). The two reactions proceed by β-elimination of fumarate via a general base-general acid mechanism, where the general base abstracts a methylene proton from the carbon in the β-position relative to the leaving nitrogen, and the general acid donates a proton to the leaving nitrogen. The succinyladenosine and SAICA-riboside detected in the ASL-deficient patients are the dephosphorylated derivatives of SAMP and SAICAR, respectively. In severely affected patients, the concentrations of the compounds are comparable, whereas in more mildly affected patients, the concentration of SAICA-riboside is in the same range, but the succinyladenosine concentration is much higher, resulting in S-Ado/SAICA riboside ratios of greater than 2 (2Van den Berghe G.

To date, ∼60 patients with ASL deficiency have been diagnosed worldwide, but there may be many more because there has not been general screening for this disease, especially in cases of mild developmental delay or autism. This study focuses on a recently identified individual from Australia with ASL deficiency, diagnosed with autism at the age of 2; it was not until the age of 6 years that he experienced 2 epileptic seizures and was subsequently treated with an anticonvulsant (5Stathis S.L. Cowley D.M. Broe D. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry. 2000; 39: 274-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The patient has elevated levels of S-Ado and SAICA-riboside in the urine (normally undetectable), consistent with mild ASL deficiency. We report here the identification of the mutations in the ASL of this patient. To gain insight into the effect of these mutations on the catalytic and structural features of the enzyme, we have introduced these mutations into the ASL from Bacillus subtilis at the positions equivalent to those of the human enzyme. The human gene encoding ASL is located on chromosome 22q13.2. To date, more than 30 different mutations in the ASL gene causing this deficiency have been identified worldwide. The mutations resulting in ASL deficiency are located throughout the enzyme, with the majority of them being relatively far from the active site. However, biochemical study of the human ASL has been conducted in only a limited number of cases (7Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

As an alternative, because of the high structural similarity between the enzymes in this family, we have previously used the more stable B. subtilis ASL as a model system and have constructed in the bacterial enzyme other mutations corresponding to those associated with human ASL deficiency (10Palenchar J.L.

ASL is a homotetramer with single chains containing 431–487 amino acids, depending on the source, with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa. The active site of the ASL of B. subtilis has been examined by affinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis, implicating in the active site His68 and His141 (12Lee T.T. Worby C. Dixon J.E.

The B. subtilis and T. maritima enzymes share 50% identity plus 23% similarity in amino acid sequence, whereas the B. subtilis and human ASL share 25% identity plus 23% similarity in sequence. Homology models of the B. subtilis (16Brosius J.L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and human enzymes (11Palenchar J.L. Crocco J.M. Colman R.F.

We report here two new disease-associated mutations and the characterization of mutant enzymes with substitutions at positions 62 and 69 of the B. subtilis ASL to provide insight into the effects of the corresponding new disease-associated mutations found in the human enzymes sequenced in this paper. A preliminary version of this work has been presented (19Sivendran S. Patterson D. Spiegal E. McGowen I. Cowley D. Colman R.F. FASEB J. 2004; 19: C241-C242Google Scholar). Materials—SAMP, AICAR, HEPES, and imidazole were purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotides for both sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Biosynthesis. The protein assay concentrate was from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Identification of Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency Mutations—PCR-amplified DNAs corresponding to each exon from the affected individual and mother were sequenced. The DNA of the father was not available. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole peripheral blood cells (20Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17628) Google Scholar). The exons of ASL were amplified using the PCR primers described in Kmoch et al. (8Kmoch S. Hartmannova H. Stiburkova B. Krijt J. Zikanova M. Sebesta I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The PCR products were either purified using a Roche Applied Science High Pure Purification kit and sequenced directly or cloned using the Promega pGEM-T Easy Vector and Novagen NovaBlue competent cells and purified using the Promega Wizard Plus Minipreps and sequenced using an ABI Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit. Sequences were read on either an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer or an ABI 373 Stretch DNA sequencer. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations to the pBHis plasmid (a gift from Dr. Jack E. Dixon, University of Michigan) that encodes adenylosuccinate lyase of B. subtilis were constructed using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. The following oligonucleotides and their complements were used to generate the Ile62 mutant enzymes: CGC ATT TTA GAA GAA GAA AAG GAC ACG CG (I62E) and C CGC ATT TTA GAA GAT GAA AAG GAC ACG CG (I62D). The Asp69 mutant enzyme was generated from the following oligonucleotide and its complement: C ACG CGC CAT GAA GTT GTC GCT TTT AC (D69E). The Asp65 mutant enzyme D65R was generated from the GAA ATC GAA AAG CGC ACG CGC CAT GAC G oligonucleotide and its complement. The I62E/D65R and I62D/D65R mutant enzymes were constructed using the corresponding Ile62 mutant cDNA as the template and the following oligonucleotides and their complements: GAA GAA GAA AAG CGC ACG CGC CAT GAC G (Glu/Arg) and GAA GAT GAA AAG CGC ACG CGC CAT GAC G (Asp/Arg), respectively. The I62E/D65R/D69E and I62D/D65R/D69E mutant enzymes were constructed using the D69E oligonucleotide and its complement on the I62E/D65R and I62D/D65R mutant cDNA templates, respectively. The I62E/D69E, I62D/D69E, and D65R/D69E mutant enzymes were constructed using the D69E oligonucleotide and its complement on the I62E, I62D, and D65R mutant cDNA templates, respectively. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, carried out at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute and University of Delaware Center for Agricultural Biotechnology using an ABI Prism model 377 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems). The pBHis plasmid, which encodes a His6 tag on the N-terminus of adenylosuccinate lyase, was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and the enzymes were purified to homogeneity using Qiagen nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (12Lee T.T. Worby C. Dixon J.E. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Redinbo M.R. Eide S.M. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 786-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzymes was evaluated by 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the protein concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using E280 nm1%=10.6(12). The purified enzyme was separated into aliquots and stored at -80 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate containing 20 mm sodium chloride, pH 7. SAICAR Synthesis—SAICAR was prepared enzymatically from AICAR (10 mm) and fumarate (100 mm) with adenylosuccinate lyase (0.4 mg/ml) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, reaction mixture (2.5-ml total volume). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h and was monitored on the UV-visible spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard 8453) by the decrease in absorbance of AICAR at 267 nm and increase in absorbance of SAICAR at 269 nm. The enzyme was removed by filtering the reaction mixture using a Centricon-10 filtration device (Millipore). The filtrate was then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (1.5 × 43 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.9, and the compounds were eluted using a linear gradient from 10 mm (1 liter) to 300 mm (1 liter) NH4HCO3, pH 7.9. Of the three peaks seen, the first and second peaks are attributed to the unreacted reagents fumarate and AICAR, respectively. The product SAICAR elutes as the third peak, detected by the absorbance at 269 nm. The fractions from the third peak were pooled, evaporated to dryness under vacuum, redissolved in water, and applied to a Dowex-50 column (24 × 1 cm) (Bio-Rad A 50W-X4, 100–200 mesh, hydrogen form) equilibrated with 0.1 m HCl to desalt the product. SAICAR was eluted using water. The overall yield of the final product was 32%. Kinetics of B. subtilis Adenylosuccinate Lyase—The enzymes were incubated at a minimum concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 20 mm potassium phosphate containing 20 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0, for 30 min at 25 °C before activity measurements. The activity of wild type and mutant enzymes toward SAMP was measured by the time-dependent decrease in absorbance at 282 nm using the difference extinction coefficient of 10,000 m-1 cm-1 (22Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 162-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the activity toward SAICAR was tested from the time-dependent increase in absorbance at 267 nm using the difference extinction coefficient of 700 m-1 cm-1 (23Woodward D.O. Braymer H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 580-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard assay conditions of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at 25 °C with 60 μm SAMP were used for the determination of specific activity, expressed as the μmol of substrate converted/min/mg of enzyme used. For the activity ratios of SAMP and SAICAR, 90 μm concentrations of each substrate were used to ensure saturating conditions (10Palenchar J.L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Km for wild type and mutant enzymes was determined by varying the substrate concentration under the same conditions. The data were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots with S.E. estimates obtained from the SigmaPlot software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter was used to measure ellipticity as a function of wavelength from 250 to 200 nm in 0.2-nm increments using a 0.1-cm cylindrical quartz cuvette. The wild type and mutant enzymes were incubated at 0.4 mg/ml for 30 min at 25 °C before measuring the spectra, and the final protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, which is based on the method of Bradford, using wild type adenylosuccinate lyase as the protein standard (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The samples were scanned five times and averaged, and the spectrum of the buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate and 20 mm sodium chloride at pH 7, was subtracted. The mean molar ellipticity [θ] (deg cm2 dmol-1) was calculated from the equation [θ] = θ/10 nCl, where θ is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the molar concentration of enzyme subunits, l is the path length in centimeters, and n is the number of residues per subunit (437, including the His6 tag). Thermal Stability of Wild Type and Mutant Enzymes—The wild type and mutant enzymes were incubated at 1 mg/ml at 37 °C, and 20–200-μl aliquots were assayed (depending on the activity of the enzyme) under standard conditions every 10 min for the first hour and every 15 min for the next 3 h. All the enzyme samples were preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm sodium chloride before being transferred to 37 °C. Molecular Weight Determination by Light Scattering—The wild type and mutant enzyme molecular weights were determined using a miniDAWN laser photometer (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). The molecular weights were determined at a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in 20 mm potassium phosphate containing 20 mm sodium chloride, pH 7. The protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assays after collecting data. The data were collected at room temperature at the laser wavelength of 690 nm and analyzed using ASTRA software for Windows (25Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Molecular Weight Determination of I62E/D65R and I62D/D65R by Native Gels—The wild type, I62E/D65R, and I62D/D65R mutant enzyme molecular weights were determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by Palenchar et al. (11Palenchar J.L. Crocco J.M. Colman R.F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1694-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using a constant ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide (37.5:1), the gels were prepared with final concentrations of 5–9% and were run at pH 7.0 in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 °C and 25 mA. Modeling of Human and B. subtilis ASL Based on the Structure of T. maritima—Homology models of B. subtilis ASL have been constructed using as templates the structure of either the T. maritima enzyme crystallized at pH 4.5 (PDB1c3c) (16Brosius J.L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or the structure of the same enzyme crystallized at pH 9.0 (PDB1c3u) (17Segall M. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7391-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here we use the homology models of the B. subtilis and human ASLs based on the native T. maritima enzyme structure (PDB1c3u), as previously described by Segall and Colman (17Segall M. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7391-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), to study the human mutations identified in the affected individual. Amino acid substitutions were made for the point mutations identified in the affected individual, and energy minimization measurements were conducted using Discover 3.1 simulation program with Insight II molecular software (Biosym). Identification of Point Mutations in Adenylosuccinate Lyase-deficient Patient—To determine the mutations present in the ASL gene of the affected child, PCR amplified genomic DNA corresponding to each exon from the affected individual and mother was sequenced. The DNA sequences of the relevant region from the mother and proband are shown in Fig. 1. Two mutations were found in the proband, and one in the parent; both are on exon 2 of the ASL gene. The first mutation is an A to C substitution at nucleotide 242 of the coding sequence leading to a glutamate (GAA) to aspartate (GAC) substitution at amino acid 80 (E80D). Both the affected individual and the parent are heterozygous for this mutation. The second mutation is a T to G substitution at nucleotide 263 resulting in an aspartate (GAT) to glutamate (GAG) substitution at amino acid position 87 (D87E). The mother has the wild type coding sequence for D87, whereas the proband is heterozygous for the mutation encoding D87E. No other nucleotide changes were found in the ASL genes of the patient or the mother. Equivalent Mutations in B. subtilis to the Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency-associated Mutations Found in Humans— This study focuses on two point mutations identified in the child with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (5Stathis S.L. Cowley D.M. Broe D. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry. 2000; 39: 274-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, amino acid residues 80 and 87 in the human sequence correspond, respectively, to amino acids 62 and 69 of the B. subtilis enzyme based on sequence alignment generated using ClustalW. A complete sequence alignment of the adenylosuccinate lyases from H. sapiens, B. subtilis and T. maritima was published previously (11Palenchar J.L. Crocco J.M. Colman R.F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1694-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two point mutations in the human enzyme are E80D and D87E, and the corresponding residues in the B. subtilis enzyme are Ile62 and Asp69; thus, the Asp at position 87 in the normal human enzyme is conserved, but the Glu at position 80 is not conserved. Therefore, I62E was constructed to mimic the normal human enzyme at positions 80 and 87, I62D was generated to correspond to the single mutation of the ASL-deficient child at position 80, and D69E was designed to correspond to the single mutation of the affected child at position 87. In addition, we noted that B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase has a negatively charged aspartate at position 65, whereas the equivalent amino acid in the human enzyme is the positively charged arginine and the corresponding amino acids in the T. maritima, mouse and chicken are also positively charged. Thus, in the B. subtilis enzyme, we replaced the Asp65 with Arg (D65R). The double mutants I62E/D65R and I62D/D65R were constructed to better mimic the normal human and ASL-deficient enzyme at position 80 (E80D), respectively. The I62E/D65R/D69E mutation best mimics the deficient single point mutation at position 87 in the human (D87E). We constructed I62D/D65R/D69E to mimic the two point mutations seen in the affected child. The I62E/D69E, I62D/D69E, D65R/D69E, and D69E mutations were constructed as controls. The mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Representative enzyme samples are shown on the SDS-PAGE gel in Fig. 3. Kinetics of Mutant Enzymes—All the mutant B. subtilis enzymes constructed exhibit sufficient activity to be characterized kinetically. The Vmax and Km values using SAMP as substrate are summarized in Table I. The Vmax value of the I62E mutant enzyme (which was expected to be close to that of the normal enzyme) is very low when compared with that of the wild type B. subtilis ASL (lines 1 and 2). In the B. subtilis enzyme model, the decrease in activity could be due to the repulsion between the negatively charged group at position 62 and that of the neighboring residue, Asp65. Indeed, low Vmax values are observed for the enzymes of rows 2, 3, 5 and 6, all of which have a negatively charged amino acid at position 62. Therefore, Asp65 was replaced by Arg (D65R); and the D65R enzyme activity is reasonably close to that of wild type enzyme (lines 1 and 7). Compared with the activities of the single mutants (lines 2 and 3), the double mutants (lines 9 and 11), I62E/D65R and I62D/D65R, exhibit appreciably higher Vmax values. The original Asp65 residue of the B. subtilis enzyme apparently does have an unfavorable interaction with the negatively charged amino acid at position 62 in the I62E and I62D enzymes.Table IKinetics of wild type and mutant B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyasesEnzymeV maxk catKmkcat/Kmμmol min-1 mg-1s-1μmm-1 s-11.

Accordingly, all disease-associated mutations are best compared with the enzyme of line 9 (I62E/D65R). The most informative mutant enzymes are those shown in lines 9–12: line 10 (as compared with line 9), illustrates the effect of the single disease-associated mutation at position 69; line 11 represents the impact of the single disease-associated mutation at position 62; and line 12 illustrates the result of the double defect at both positions 62 and 69. The single mutation at position 69 causes only a 2-fold decrease in Vmax (line 10), whereas the single defect at position 62 results in a 9-fold reduction in Vmax (line 11). The double defect (line 12) is very similar in Vmax to the I62D/D65R mutant. Therefore, the I62D single point mutation causes a more significant decrease in the enzyme activity than does the D69E single point mutation. Because the child is heterozygous for the mutations, we tested the activity of an equal mixture of I62D/D65R and I62E/D65R/D69E mutant enzymes. This mixture gave a Vmax value of 0.12 μmol substrate/min/mg protein (data not shown), which is almost twice that of the double mutant (line 12). Table I also reports the kcat values for wild type and the various mutants. Compared with the wild type Km of 4 μm for adenylosuccinate, the humanized normal mutant enzyme (line 9), I62E/D65R, has a 4-fold higher Km, whereas the I62D change results in a 14-fold higher Km when present as a single mutation (line 3). This higher Km value is also seen in the humanized I62D/D65R single 62 mutant (line 11). The double defect mutant has a Km lo"

In ZR-75 breast cancer cells treated with 17β-estradiol (E2) and transfected with a construct containing three tandem estrogen responsive elements (pERE3), DRIP205 coactivates ERα-mediated transactivation. DRIP205Δ587–636 is a DRIP205 mutant in which both NR boxes within amino acids 587–636 have been deleted and, in parallel transfection studies, DRIP205Δ587–636 also coactivates ERα. Moreover, both wild-type and variant DRIP205 also colocalize with ERα in the nuclei of transfected cells. Extensive deletion analysis of DRIP205 shows that multiple domains of this protein play a role in coactivation of ERα and in interactions with ERα. Coactivation of ERα by DRIP205 does not require NR boxes, and variants with deletion of N-terminal (amino acids 1–639) and C-terminal (amino acids 576–1566) significantly coactivate ERα. DRIP205 resembles p160 coactivators that also interact with multiple regions of ERα; however, unlike p160 coactivators, DRIP205 coactivation of ERα does not require NR boxes.

NRs have a conserved modular structure that features a DNA-binding domain (DBD) C, which has high homology among different classes of NRs. In contrast, there are major differences among NRs in their A/B, E/F, and D domains that contain activation function 1, activation function 2, and hinge regions, respectively. The C-terminal E/F region of NRs also contains the ligand binding domain, which undergoes ligand-dependent conformational changes that are important for subsequent transcriptional activation of target genes. Steroid hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor α (ERα) have been extensively used as models for determining the mechanisms of ligand-dependent receptor-mediated transactivation, which requires the assembly and recruitment of a nuclear complex of coactivator/coregulatory proteins (5Olefsky J.M.

The NR box motifs have been identified in multiple NR coactivators and are structural features that facilitate ligand-dependent NR-coactivator interactions (41Kim K. Nguyen T. Saville B. Safe S. Mol.

In transfection studies, TRAP220 did not enhance E2-dependent transactivation in HeLa cells (40Coulthard V.H. Matsuda S. Heery D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10942-10951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas two reports suggest that DRIP205 coactivates ERα in vitro and in U2OS cells (10Acevedo M.L.

The mechanisms of ERα- and ERα/Sp1-mediated gene expression in breast cancer cells have been studied in this laboratory, and we have shown that coactivation of these responses are highly variable in different cell lines (41Kim K. Nguyen T. Saville B. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 804-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This study investigates ligand-dependent coactivation of ERα by DRIP205 in breast cancer cell lines transfected with pERE3. The results demonstrate that coactivation of ERα by DRIP205 in ZR-75 breast cancer cells is complex and involves multiple regions of DRIP205 and ERα. In mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, interactions of DRIP205 and ERα also involved multiple domains of both proteins. Moreover, coactivation of ERα by DRIP205 and interaction of these proteins do not require the NR box motifs of DRIP205. Cell Lines, Chemicals, and Biochemicals—Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS) or Atlanta Biologicals, Inc. (Norcross, GA). Antibiotic antimycotic solution (AAS) (×100) was obtained from Sigma. COS-7 cells and human breast cancer cell lines ZR-75 and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 5% FBS, and 10 ml/liter AAS. ZR-75 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2.38 g/liter HEPES, 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% FBS, and 10 ml/liter AAS. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 5% FBS, and 10 ml/liter AAS. Cells were cultured and grown in a 37 °C incubator with humidified 5% CO2, 95% air. Me2SO and E2 were purchased from Sigma, and all other biochemicals were the highest quality available from commercial sources. Plasmids, Cloning, and Oligonucleotides—pcDNA3-DRIP205 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Leonard P. Freedman, Merck Research Laboratories (West Point, PA). For the convenience of further cloning, the GGATCC sequence (which is the BamHI site, and translates to Gly-Ser) in the coding region of DRIP205 was mutated to GGTTCC (which still translates to Gly-Ser) using two-step PCR (Table I). The first step was to amplify several cycles of annealed fragments A and B. Then, the primers were added when the reactions were paused, and the products of the first step would stand for the template of the second step. The final products were digested with NdeI and NotI, and ligated back to pcDNA3-DRIP205, which was digested with NotI and then partially digested with NdeI. This construct was called pcDNA3-DRIP205mB and used as a template generating other constructs by PCR. The expression plasmid with deletion of both NR boxes, namely pcDNA3-Dm3 (DRIP205Δ587–636), was generated using two-step PCR (Table I). The final PCR products and plasmid pcDNA3-DRIP205mB were separately digested with NheI and SspI, followed by ligation.Table ISummary of primers and restriction enzymes for generating pcDNA3, GAL4 chimera, and Xpress-tagged (X) constructsPrimersaOverlapping sequence used to anneal fragments A and B are indicated in bold typeTemplatesRestriction enzymespcDNA3-DRIP205mBFragment A:pcDNA3-DRIP205Upper, TCTTCTGGATCTAGCCAGTCCAAAAAT TCLower, ACAACGAGCCTGAGGAACCTAACCCTGAAGFragment B:pcDNA3-DRIP205Upper, ATCTTCAGGGTTAGGTTCCTCAGGCTCGTTGTLower, TAGCATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAGGTwo-step PCR:AnnealedUpper, TCTTCTGGATCTAGCCAGTCCAAAAATTCFragments A+BNdeI, Not ILower, TAGCATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAGGpcDNA3-Dm3Fragment A:pcDNA3-DRIP205(DRIP205 Δ587–636)Upper, AACCATTCAAGCCGACACCCCAGCACTGTLower, CTGGGCAGGATTATCTGGGTTCTGAGACACFragment B:pcDNA3-DRIP205Upper, TCTCAGAACCCAGATAATCCTGCCCAGGATTTLower, TTGCTGTCTAATCCGGGCCCCGAGAGAGTATwo-step PCR:AnnealedUpper, AACCATTCAAGCCGACACCCCAGCACTGTFragments A+BNheI, SspILower, TTGCTGTCTAATCCGGGCCCCGAGAGAGTApMDUpper, TAGGATCCAAAGTTCTCTGGAACGGCTCCATGCLower, TACGACGCGTACTAATTCCCAATCAGGGCCACATpcDNA3-DRIP205mBBamHI, MluIpMDm3Upper, same as pMDpcDNA3-Dm3BamHI,Lower, same as pMDMluIpMDm4Upper, GCTAGAATTCCCGGCTAGCAGpcDNA3-EcoRI, MluILower, CGTCACGCGTCTATGTCCTGT TDRIP205mBpMDm1Upper, same as pMDpcDNA3-BamHI,Lower, TACGACGCGTACTATGTCCTGTTGACATCAAAGDRIP205mBMluIpMDm5Upper, same as pMDpcDNA3-BamHI,Lower, TACGACGCGTCACCGACTCATGCCGATCTDRIP205mBMluIpMDm6Upper, GCTAGGATCCAAGATTTCTCAACCCTTTATpMDBamHI,Lower, same as pMDMluIpMDm7Upper, GCTAGGATCCAATGTATGTCCATCCCTGTGACGApMDBamHI,Lower, TACGACGCGTCTGAATAGTGATTTTGGGAATMluIpMDm7ΔUpper, same as pMDm7pcDNA3-Dm3BamHI,Lower, same as pMDm7MluIpMDm13Upper, same as pMDm7pcDNA3-BamHI,Lower, TACGACGCGTTGGGTTCTGAGACACCTTGCTDRIP205mBMluIpMDm12Upper, same as pMDm6pMDBamHI,Lower, same as pMDm7MluIpMDm8Upper, GCTAGGATCCAAATTCCTAAGGGAACAGTGATGGTpMDBamHI,Lower, same as pMDMluIXDm5Upper, GGTAGGATCCAAGATGAGTTCTCTGGAACGpcDNA3-DRIP205BamHI,Lower, GGTAGATATCCTACACCGACTCATGCCGATEcoRVXDm7Upper, same as pMDm7pMDBamHI,Lower, GACTGATATCCTACTGAATAGTGATTTTGGGAATGEcoRVXDm7ΔUpper, same as pMDm7pMDBamHI,Lower, same as XDm7EcoRVXDm12Upper, same as pMDm6pMDBamHI,Lower, same as XDm7EcoRVa Overlapping sequence used to anneal fragments A and B are indicated in bold type Open table in a new tab pM and pVP16 vectors were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). pcDNA3.1/His A, B, and C was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). pMD, pMDm3, pMDm4, pMDm1, pMDm5, pMDm6, pMDm7, pMDm7Δ, pMDm13, pMDm12, and pMDm8 expression plasmids were generated by PCR. PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes described in Table I, and ligated back into the pM vector, which was digested with the same set of restriction enzymes. XDm5 expression plasmids were constructed by PCR. PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated to pcDNA 3.1/His C. XDm7, XDm7Δ, XDm12, and XDm8 expression plasmids were generated by PCR. PCR products were digested with BamHI, EcoRV, and ligated to pcDNA3.1/His A. VP16-hER, VP16-TAF1, and VP16-HE19 expression plasmids were generated by digestion of pM-hER, pM-TAF1 expression plasmids with EcoRI, SalI, and ligated to pVP vector digested with EcoRI and SalI. pfu Turbo DNA polymerase from Statagene (La Jolla, CA) was used in PCR. All the primers were ordered from IDT, Coralville, IA. All constructs were sequenced afterward to confirm the cloning. Transient Transfection Assays—ZR-75 or MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 12-well plates in DMEM/F-12 medium without phenol red (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 10 ml/liter AAS, and 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After incubation for 12 h, at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, cells were co-transfected with DNA using the calcium phosphate method. In coactivation experiments, cells were co-transfected with 250 ng of pcDNA3.1-β-galactosidase (used as an internal control), 1 μg of pERE3-LUC, 5 ng of pcDNA3-hERα, and various amounts of DRIP205 or deletion mutant constructs. The pcDNA3 empty vector was used to maintain DNA mass balance among different treatment groups. In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, cells were co-transfected with 250 ng of pcDNA3.1-β-galactosidase (used as an internal control), 500 ng of pGAL45-LUC, 500 ng of pM or pM-DRIP wild-type or deletion mutants, 500 ng of pVP, VP-hERα, VP-HE19, or VP-TAF1. Six h after transfection, cells were shocked with 25% glycerol/PBS for 1 min, washed with PBS (2×), and then treated with Me2SO or 10 nm E2 for another 30–48 h. Each treatment was replicated three or four times. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and harvested with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, MI). After one freeze-thaw cycle, cell lysates were centrifuged 30 s, and the supernatant was used for determination of protein activity. Luciferase (Promega Corporation, Madison, MI) and β-galactosidase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) activity were read by a Packard Luminometer. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing luciferase activity by β-galactosidase activity for each well. In coactivation experiments, -fold induction was calculated by dividing the relative luciferase activity of E2 treated groups by relative luciferase activity in controls (Me2SO-treated). In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, -fold induction was calculated by dividing -fold induction of E2/Me2SO of VP-hERα or VP-hERα deletion mutants by -fold induction of E2/Me2SO obtained using the empty vector pVP. Western Blot Analysis—For determination of ERα protein level, ZR-75 cells were seeded, transfected, and harvested as described above. After luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were read, 6 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the remaining ∼60 μl of lysates to obtain maximal protein yield. Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Equal amounts of total protein from each treatment group were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (transfer buffer: 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.025% SDS). For GAL4-DRIP fusion protein confirmation, COS-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates with DMEM/F-12 medium without phenol red supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 2 μg of each fusion protein expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Medium was changed 12 h after the transfection, and, after 48 h, cells were trypsinized, transferred, and washed with PBS (3×). Cellular and nuclear extracts were obtained using NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology). Cellular and nuclear lysates were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 0.05% Tween 20, PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Membranes were probed with primary antibody overnight, washed with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS (3×), probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, washed with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS (3×), and finally rinsed with deionized water. ERα HC20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at 1:1000 dilution. For GAL4 fusion protein expression, mouse monoclonal GAL4DBD RK5C1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 dilution. Membranes were visualized using the ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—[35S]hERα, [35S]DRIP205, [35S]DRIP-205Δ587–636, [35S]XDm5, [35S]XDm7, [35S]XDm7Δ, and [35S]XDm12 were in vitro translated using the T7 QuikCoupled Transcription Translation System (Promega Corp.). [35S]hERα (0.2 μl) and 35S-labeled DRIP205 wild-type or variant protein (0.5 μl) were incubated in 0.5 ml of coimmunoprecipitation buffer (PBS + 0.001% IGEPAL CA630). The coimmunoprecipitation buffer was freshly supplemented with 1 μm E2, 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). After incubation for 1 h on a rocker at 4 °C, 400 ng of antibody was added. DRIP205 antibody c-19 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. This antibody was raised against the C terminus of TRAP220 of human origin, and was used to pull down DRIP205Δ587–636. ERα HC 20 antibody was used for ERα immunoprecipitation. For Xpress-tagged DRIP205 deletion mutants, anti-Xpress antibody from Invitrogen was used. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction solution, followed by incubation for 2 h on a rocker at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was washed with PBS + 1% IGEPAL CA630 (3×), and finally washed with PBS. The final pellet was boiled in 30 μlof2× SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunocytochemistry—COS-7 cells were seeded onto 2-well glass chamber slides at 75,000 cells per well in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After 12 h incubation in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2, cells were transfected with 500 ng of pMD or pMDm3, and 500 ng of hERα expression plasmids using Genejuice transfection reagent (Novagen). After another 24-h incubation, cells were treated with Me2SO vehicle or 10 nm E2 for 1 h. Slides were then washed with PBS, fixed with -20 °C methanol, air-dried, and washed with PBS + 0.3% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween). Slides were blocked for 1 h with 5% donkey serum in antibody dilution buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 0.02 m PBS + 0.3% Tween 20), washed with PBS/Tween briefly, and incubated with anti-DRIP205 c-19 antibody (Santa Cruz) at 1:50 dilution in antibody dilution buffer at 4 °C for 12 h. Slides were washed (goat serum for controls) with PBS/Tween (3 × 10 min), incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz) at 1:200 dilution in antibody dilution buffer for 1 h and washed with PBS/Tween (3 × 10 min). Slides were subsequently blocked with 5% donkey serum in antibody dilution buffer for 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween briefly, incubated with anti-ERα H-184 antibody (Santa Cruz) at 1:50 dilution in antibody dilution buffer at 4 °C for 12 h (rabbit serum for controls), washed with PBS/Tween (3 × 10 min), incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) at 1:500 dilution in antibody dilution buffer for 1 h, and washed with PBS/Tween (3 × 10 min). Slides were finally washed in deionized water, and coverglass mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence images of DRIP205 and ERα were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) fitted with an Axiocam high resolution digital camera. Digital images were captured using Axiovision 3.0 software. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences between different groups were determined by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test for significance. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. for at least 3 separate determinations for each treatment. Coactivation of Wild-type and Variant ERα by DRIP205— Coactivation of ERα-dependent transactivation by DRIP205 was initially examined in ERα-positive ZR-75 and ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. The full-length DRIP205 expression plasmid (Fig. 1A) encodes for 1566 amino acids, which is identical to amino acids 16–1581 of the TRAP220 coding sequence. Both cell lines were transfected with pERE3, which contains three tandem EREs in a minimal TATA-luciferase construct, and an ERα expression plasmid. The transfected pERE3 construct is overexpressed in the transfected cells and minimal E2 inducibility is observed in ZR-75 cells in the absence of cotransfected ERα. This system is ideal for investigating coactivation of ERα and determining receptor and coactivation domain requirements for transactivation in breast cancer cell context. The results illustrated in Fig. 1, B and C, show that E2 induces transactivation 6- and 4-fold in ZR-75 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, and this was enhanced >3- and >5-fold by DRIP205. Fig. 1D shows that transfected DRIP205 has no significant effect on ERα protein expression levels in the presence or absence of E2. ERα levels were lower in cells treated with E2 because of degradation of ERα through the proteasome pathway. E2 also induced transactivation in ZR-75 cells transfected with pERE3 and wild-type or variant ERα expression plasmids with mutations in helix 12 (ERα-TAF1) (Fig. 2A) or deletion of activation function (AF) 1 (HE19) (Fig. 2B). However, studies with DRIP205 showed that coactivation was observed only with wild-type ERα, suggesting that AF1 and wild-type AF2 were both necessary for functional DRIP205-ERα interactions. The requirements for both AFs of ERα for coactivation by DRIP205 were further investigated in competition experiments by transfecting GRIP1-NR box peptide and ERα-AF1 peptide expression plasmids. Previous studies show that these peptides competitively squelch AF2 and AF1, respectively (41Kim K. Nguyen T. Saville B. Safe S. Mol.
