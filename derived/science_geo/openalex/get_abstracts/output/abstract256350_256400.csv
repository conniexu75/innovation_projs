We tested whether resveratrol (RSV), which is known to extend lifespan, impacts mitochondrial function and metabolic homeostasis. Treatment of mice with RSV significantly increased their aerobic capacity, as evidenced by their increased running time and consumption of oxygen in muscle fibers. RSV's effects were associated with an induction of genes for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and were largely explained by an RSV-mediated decrease in PGC-1α acetylation and an increase in PGC-1α activity. This mechanism is consistent with RSV being a known activator of the protein deacetylase, SIRT1, and by the lack of effect of RSV in SIRT1−/− MEFs. Importantly, RSV treatment protected mice against diet-induced-obesity and insulin resistance. These pharmacological effects of RSV combined with the association of three Sirt1 SNPs and energy homeostasis in Finnish subjects implicates SIRT1 as a key regulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis.

Mitochondria are the principal energy sources of the cell that convert nutrients into energy through cellular respiration (Wallace, 2005Wallace D.C. A mitochondrial paradigm of metabolic and degenerative diseases, aging, and cancer: a dawn for evolutionary medicine.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Compromised mitochondrial function has been linked to numerous diseases, including those of the metabolic and cardiovascular systems (Petersen et al., 2003Petersen K.F. Befroy D. Dufour S. Dziura J. Ariyan C. Rothman D.L. DiPietro L. Cline G.W. Shulman G.L. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the elderly: possible role in insulin resistance.Science. 2003; 300: 1140-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The genetic basis of such a tight link in the rat was illustrated by the cosegregation of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors with low aerobic capacity and reduced muscle expression of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Wisloff et al., 2005Wisloff U. Najjar S.M. Ellingsen O. Haram P.M. Swoap S. Al-Share Q. Fernstrom M. Rezaei K. Lee S.J. Koch L.G. Britton S.L. Cardiovascular risk factors emerge after artificial selection for low aerobic capacity.Science. 2005; 307: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In humans, insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle has been associated with a lower ratio of oxidative type 1 to type 2 glycolytic type muscle fibers, decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and ATP synthesis, and, finally, decreased expression of genes that control mitochondrial activity (Mootha et al., 2003Mootha V.K.

One gene whose decreased expression is consistently implicated in the human or animal diabetic muscle is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator, PGC-1α (Mootha et al., 2004Mootha V.K.

PGC-1α is a coactivator with pleiotropic functions (Knutti and Kralli, 2001Knutti D. Kralli A. PGC-1, a versatile coactivator.Trends Endocrinol.

Most importantly, PGC-1α controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function, which in the muscle can contribute to fiber-type switching (Lin et al., 2002aLin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E.

A cold-inducible coactivator of nuclear receptors linked to adaptive thermogenesis.Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Recently SIRT1 has been shown to function together with PGC-1α to promote adaptation to caloric restriction (CR) by regulating the genetic programs for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis in the liver (Rodgers et al., 2005Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1alpha and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). SIRT1 is one of seven mammalian homologs of Sir2 that catalyzes NAD+-dependent protein deacetylation, yielding nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (Blander and Guarente, 2004Blander G. Guarente L. The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Originally described as a factor regulating longevity, apoptosis and DNA repair (Blander and Guarente, 2004Blander G. Guarente L. The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, Sinclair, 2005Sinclair D.A. Toward a unified theory of caloric restriction and longevity regulation.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 987-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), SIRT1 also facilitates the conversion of changes in the nutritional status, which it senses via NAD+ levels, into modulation of cellular metabolism (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R.

Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1alpha and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). SIRT1 physically interacts with and deacetylates PGC-1α at multiple lysine sites, consequently increasing PGC-1α activity leading to the induction of liver gluconeogenic gene transcription (Rodgers et al., 2005Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1alpha and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). Given the role of SIRT1 as a mediator of CR and longevity and the central role for reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly produced as a consequence of mitochondrial functioning in promoting aging, it is plausible that PGC-1α and SIRT1 functions converge in tissues beyond the liver that have a high level of mitochondrial activity, such as the muscle and BAT. Since such a convergence could potentially impact on metabolic diseases, we addressed our hypothesis not in the context of CR but under conditions of caloric excess using the specific SIRT1 activator, resveratrol (RSV) (Borra et al., 2005Borra M.T. Smith B.C. Denu J.M. Mechanism of human SIRT1 activation by resveratrol.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17187-17195Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J.

Zhang L.L. et al.Small molecule activators of sirtuins extend Saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan.Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). RSV is a natural polyphenolic compound mainly found in the skin of grapes and is well known for its phytoestrogenic and antioxidant properties (Baur and Sinclair, 2006Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Therapeutic potential of resveratrol: the in vivo evidence.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). It has been shown to significantly increase SIRT1 activity through an allosteric interaction, resulting in the increase of SIRT1 affinity for both NAD+ and the acetylated substrate (Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. et al.Small molecule activators of sirtuins extend Saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan.Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the fact that in various species, RSV treatment mimics Sir2-dependent lifespan extension during CR (Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A.

In this study we tested whether RSV, through increasing SIRT1 activity, could modulate PGC-1α functions in vivo and ultimately impact on the regulation of energy homeostasis. Our data reveal that RSV potently induces mitochondrial activity, through activating PGC-1α, as evidenced by the increase in oxidative type-muscle fibers, enhanced resistance to muscle fatigue, and increased tolerance to cold, all PGC-1α-dependent effects. Importantly, these effects, induced by RSV, rendered the animals resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In support of the importance of SIRT1 in the control of energy homeostasis, we also report a significant association between three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human Sirt1 gene and energy homeostasis, extending the impact of our animal studies to human pathophysiology. The metabolic effect of RSV was initially evaluated in a cohort of male C57Bl/6J mice that were given a dose of 200 or 400 mg/kg/day (mpk) of RSV administered in either a chow diet or high fat (HF) diet for 15 weeks. With this protocol, the plasma level of RSV was dose-related and ranged from 10–120 ng/ml. Under chow-fed conditions, RSV-treated mice tended to gain less weight as compared to controls (Figure 1A). However, this effect became significant when the animals were challenged with an HF diet, such that RSV-treated, HF-fed mice weighed almost the same as the chow-fed mice (Figure 1B). This decreased body mass was accounted for by a decrease in fat as illustrated by dual X-ray absorptiometry (Figure 1B) and was also reflected in the mass of the different white fat pads (Figure 1C). Morphological analysis of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) sections by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining also showed smaller adipocytes upon RSV treatement (Figure S1). These beneficial effects of RSV on body weight and fat mass were not due to decreased food intake, as the amount of kcal of food consumed per mouse over a 24 hr period was unchanged (Figure 1D). RSV, at the dose given, did not induce hepatic toxicity, since the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (data not shown) were unchanged, as was the liver histo-morphology (Figure S1). In addition, stool composition, coat maintenance, and water intake (data not shown) were unaffected, indicating that overall, RSV was well tolerated by the animals. Finally, fecal lipid kcal content was minimally affected by RSV treatment, and greater than 98% of all dietary-derived lipid was absorbed in both groups (data not shown). The critical parameters contributing to body-weight maintenance include caloric intake and energy homeostasis (Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Towards a molecular understanding of adaptive thermogenesis.Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). As caloric intake is unaffected by RSV (Figure 1D), we assessed the effect of this compound on energy expenditure (EE) by indirect calorimetry. Basal EE, as measured by oxygen (O2) consumption, was significantly increased in HF-fed mice treated with RSV (Figure 1E), but their respiratory quotient (RQ) was not changed (data not shown). To assess the effect of RSV on the capacity for adaptive thermogenesis, we performed a cold test. RSV enhanced this capacity, since it maintained the body temperature higher as compared to that of nontreated animals (Figure 1F). In the mouse, the major contributor to the production of heat is the BAT, and morphometric analysis of the BAT mitochondria, by electron microscopy, revealed clearly larger mitochondrial structures attributed to an increased presence of cristae in RSV-treated mice as compared to that of HF-fed animals (Figure 2A). This amplification of the mitochondria was reflected both in the quantification of mitochondrial size (Figure 2A, right panel) and mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA, Figure 2D). Consistent with enhanced mitochondrial activity, a marked decrease in the lipid-droplet size was also noted. In the adult human, little BAT is present, and it is mainly the skeletal muscle that possesses the mitochondrial capacity for EE. The changes in the muscle mitochondrial morphology, however, paralleled those observed in the BAT of RSV-treated mice (Figure 2B). Whereas the oxidative fibers of the gastrocnemius were unaffected, the nonoxidative fibers in RSV-treated mice had larger and denser mitochondria aggregated between adjacent myofibrils. Mitochondrial expansion was evidenced by increased mitochondrial size (Figure 2B, right panel) and mtDNA content (Figure 2D). Histological sections of muscle stained for the presence of the mitochondrial enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, Figure 2C), and the increase in citrate synthase activity in muscle homogenates, furthermore indicates that RSV enhanced mitochondrial enzymatic activity (Figure 3A). Finally, in the isolated nonoxidative muscle fibers of RSV-treated mice, there was a significantly higher maximum VO2 rate, indeed suggesting an increased oxidative capacity (Figure 3B). The combination of the increased mitochondria size and density, mtDNA content, SDH, and citrate synthase activities and oxidative capacity is highly suggestive that RSV increases the ratio of oxidative to nonoxidative type-muscle fibers. Following the hypothesis that RSV induces a fiber-type switch and knowing that oxidative type 1 fibers are associated with an increased resistance to muscle fatigue (Booth et al., 2002Booth F.W. Chakravarthy M.V. Spangenburg E.E. Exercise and gene expression: physiological regulation of the human genome through physical activity.J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of RSV administration in an endurance test. In HF-fed animals treated with RSV, the distance run to exhaustion was twice that of the HF-fed controls (Figure 3C). To account for the potentially confounding significant weight difference between RSV-treated and nontreated HF-fed mice, we redid the test using RSV-treated and nontreated chow-fed mice, which did not significantly differ in body weight (Figure 1A). The RSV-treated mice, however, still outran the control chow-fed mice by nearly double the distance (Figure 3C). Thus, RSV treatment significantly increases the animal's resistance to muscle fatigue, consistent with increased mitochondrial activity and the transformation of muscle toward a slow type phenotype. Since it was reported that SIRT1 is required for increased physical activity in response to CR (Chen et al., 2005Chen D. Steele A.D. Lindquist S. Guarente L. Increase in activity during calorie restriction requires Sirt1.Science. 2005; 310: 1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), we carefully investigated whether the RSV-mediated increase in resistance to muscle fatigue was a result of a behavioral response or was truly a metabolic consequence. We initially examined the effect of RSV on spontaneous activity in mice by assessing their circadian activity. No significant difference was observed between chow- and HF-fed mice (data not shown). However, in RSV-treated HF-fed mice, there was a significant decrease in ambulatory locomotor activity as well as a tendency to decrease the number of rears (Figure 4A). These observations indicated that the effect of RSV on EE and weight gain could not be explained by an increase in spontaneous activity. In fact, the reduced level of activity in RSV-treated mice is in line with the decrease in resting heart rate (Figure 4B). Cardiodetrimental effects are, however, not suspected due to the lack of significant effect of RSV on blood pressure (Figure 4C), various echocardiography parameters (data not shown), PGC-1 activity (see below), and cardiac gene expression (Figure S3). To discount the potential of central nervous system (CNS)-mediated behavioral effects and to determine the effect of RSV treatment on other motor abilities, we evaluated anxiety and sensorimotor function. No significant effects were observed between RSV-treated and nontreated HF-fed mice on anxiety, as evaluated by open field (Figure 4D), light/dark box (Figure 4E), and elevated-plus-maze tests (Figure 4F). The absence of a difference between RSV-treated and nontreated HF-fed mice in pain sensitivity, as measured in the hot-plate test (data not shown), also discounted the possibility that fatigue resistance might be due to altered pain sensitivity. Interestingly, as compared to nontreated HF-fed mice, the RSV-treated mice displayed increased muscle strength (Figure 4G) and markedly improved motor coordination and traction force as revealed in the rotarod (Figure 4H) and string tests (Figure 4I). These tests support the data obtained in the exercise test and suggest that RSV may improve neuromuscular function. To make the molecular connection between RSV treatment and the apparent myofiber remodeling, we profiled the expression of ±40,000 genes by microarray analysis. As the coordination of muscle plasticity is a complex event, composed of many small but cumulatively significant changes, we used a gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to look for coordinate expression within treated samples of a priori-defined groups of genes (Mootha et al., 2003Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S. Lehar J. Puigserver P. Carlsson E. Ridderstrale M. Laurila E. et al.PGC-1alpha-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes.Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar, Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. et al.Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (20168) Google Scholar). Genes were ranked according to their correlation to RSV treatment, and then the position of each gene-set member was identified, and a maximum enrichment score (MES) for each gene set was calculated. Amongst the top 30 gene sets, which were significantly enriched in RSV-treated mice, were ribosomal mRNA processing, striated muscle contraction, electron transport chain, OXPHOS, and ATP synthesis (Table S1). Three representative GSEA-scoring plots and their corresponding heat maps are shown (Figure 5A). Of particular note is their increase in gene expression under RSV treatment. Individual genes in the enriched pathways were related to muscle contraction (e.g., troponins) as well as enhanced oxidative metabolic status, including components of the respiratory apparatus (e.g., NDUFB8), oxidative enzymes (e.g., CoxVa), and ATPases (e.g., ATP5G3). These could provide a slow but stable, long-lasting supply of ATP, which would explain the increased muscle endurance associated with RSV. In addition, sets of genes supporting organelle biogenesis such as those encoding RNA-processing enzymes and ribosomal subunits were also enriched (Figures 5 and S2). Thus, this global molecular fingerprint of RSV identified coordinated changes in the expression of groups of genes functionally involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function underpinning the enhanced oxidative capacity of the muscle. To further evaluate the hypothesis that mitochondrial activity was affected by RSV treatment, we measured the expression of PGC-1α and several of its targets by Q-RT-PCR in gastrocnemius muscle. PGC-1α mRNA was significantly induced upon RSV treatment, which also translated into an increase in PGC-1α protein (Figures 5C and 5D). We also noted an increase in PGC-1β, which has several overlapping functions with that of PGC-1α in inducing genes related to OXPHOS (Lin et al., 2002cLin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P.

Mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), a nuclear encoded mitochondrial transcription factor that is indispensable for the expression of key mitochondrial-encoded genes (Larsson et al., 1998Larsson N.G.

Genet. 1998; 18: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) and a target of NRF-1, was also increased. In addition to the transcription factors, an array of additional downstream targets of PGC-1α (Lin et al., 2005Lin J. Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Metabolic control through the PGC-1 family of transcription coactivators.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), including genes involved in fatty-acid oxidation (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, MCAD), uncoupling, and protection against ROS (uncoupling protein 3, UCP-3), and fiber-type markers (myoglobin and troponin 1) were induced by RSV. As predicted from the electron microscopy and the cold test results, we noted a significant increase in gene expression in pathways related to energy homeostasis (Figure S3A) in BAT. PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and UCP-1 mRNA levels were all induced by RSV.

https://openalex.org/W2008342341,"The mixing of polymers and nanoparticles is opening pathways for engineering flexible composites that exhibit advantageous electrical, optical, or mechanical properties. Recent advances reveal routes to exploit both enthalpic and entropic interactions so as to direct the spatial distribution of nanoparticles and thereby control the macroscopic performance of the material. For example, by tailoring the particle coating and size, researchers have created self-healing materials for improved sustainability and self-corralling rods for photovoltaic applications. A challenge for future studies is to create hierarchically structured composites in which each sublayer contributes a distinct function to yield a mechanically integrated, multifunctional material."

Common principles of budding and fusion have emerged, and many of the proteins involved in these events are now known.

Using synaptic vesicles as a model, we have now determined the protein and lipid composition; measured vesicle size, density, and mass; calculated the average protein and lipid mass per vesicle; and determined the copy number of more than a dozen major constituents.

Synaptic vesicles are dominated by proteins, possess a surprising diversity of trafficking proteins, and, with the exception of the V-ATPase that is present in only one to two copies, contain numerous copies of proteins essential for membrane traffic and neurotransmitter uptake. Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into membrane-bound organelles that communicate with each other by membrane trafficking. While many organelles readily undergo fusion or fission, transport between different organelles usually involves specialized trafficking vesicles. These vesicles bud from the precursor compartment and are transported to the target compartment, where they dock and fuse. Trafficking vesicles deliver both membrane constituents and soluble content material from the donor to the acceptor compartment or to the extracellular space (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion.Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Small trafficking vesicles, with diameters ranging between 40 and 80 nm, can be considered as the basic minimal units of membrane traffic. Vesicle transport, target recognition, docking, and fusion each involve the ordered and sequential recruitment of protein complexes from the cytoplasm. The membrane constituents of the organelle are ultimately responsible for orchestrating association of the complex, task execution, and complex disassembly. In recent years, many of the proteins involved in these reactions have been identified (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion.Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). However, little is known about overall membrane structure, including the concentration of integral membrane and membrane-associated proteins, or about the surface density of trafficking proteins such as SNAREs and Rabs. In the present study, we have attempted to arrive at a comprehensive and quantitative molecular description of synaptic vesicles (SVs) as model trafficking organelles. SVs are concentrated in the presynaptic nerve terminals of every neuron. They store neurotransmitters and undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis upon the arrival of an action potential. After exocytosis, SVs are retrieved by clathrin-dependent endocytosis and are locally recycled to regenerate exocytosis-competent vesicles. Although the intermediate steps in the recycling pathway are still debated, it is clear that nerve terminals contain endosomes and that the SV cycle may involve endosomal intermediates, although not necessarily during each recycling event (Südhof, 2004Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). SVs can be purified to apparent homogeneity in large quantities, making them amenable to biochemical studies (Nagy et al., 1976Nagy A. Baker R.R. Morris S.J. Whittaker V.P. The preparation and characterization of synaptic vesicles of high purity.Brain Res. 1976; 109: 285-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Huttner et al., 1983Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. Synapsin I (protein I), a nerve terminal-specific phosphoprotein. III. Its association with synaptic vesicles studied in a highly purified synaptic vesicle preparation.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Indeed, the protein composition of SVs is, at present, better understood than that of any other trafficking organelle, and several proteins first identified in SVs turned out to be founding members of conserved protein families involved in all trafficking steps (Jahn and Südhof, 1994Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Synaptic vesicles and exocytosis.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition, SVs contain the machinery required for the uptake and storage of neurotransmitters including vesicular transporters, ion channels, and the vacuolar H+ ATPase that fuels the transporters (Ahnert-Hilger et al., 2003Ahnert-Hilger G. Höltje M. Pahner I. Winter S. Brunk I. Regulation of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 150: 140-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, proteome analyses of enriched fractions of both SVs and brain-derived clathrin-coated vesicles have been performed, resulting in the identification of many of the known vesicle proteins (Morciano et al., 2005Morciano M. Burre J. Corvey C. Karas M. Zimmermann H. Volknandt W. Immunoisolation of two synaptic vesicle pools from synaptosomes: a proteomics analysis.J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1732-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Blondeau et al., 2004Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M. Hussain N.K. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Roy L. Boismenu D. et al.Tandem MS analysis of brain clathrin-coated vesicles reveals their critical involvement in synaptic vesicle recycling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3833-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; see also Discussion). In contrast to our advanced knowledge about individual SV proteins, we lack even elementary quantitative information on the composition of the whole vesicle. With a diameter of approximately 40 nm, SVs are small organelles, making them comparable in complexity to other supramolecular structures such as ribosomes, spliceosomes, or viruses. On the other hand, SVs are “dirty” nanostructures that may not have a fixed stoichiometric composition and are constantly visited by cytoplasmic factors. With these caveats in mind, we have used a purified SV fraction from rat brain as the starting point for the description of a prototypic SV, resulting in a detailed (albeit averaged) structural model of this trafficking organelle. To obtain a highly purified fraction of SVs, we relied on the modified version (Huttner et al., 1983Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. Synapsin I (protein I), a nerve terminal-specific phosphoprotein. III. Its association with synaptic vesicles studied in a highly purified synaptic vesicle preparation.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) of a classical fractionation protocol originally developed by Whittaker and coworkers (Nagy et al., 1976Nagy A. Baker R.R. Morris S.J. Whittaker V.P. The preparation and characterization of synaptic vesicles of high purity.Brain Res. 1976; 109: 285-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). SVs purified by this procedure are morphologically homogeneous, and more than 95% of them carry major SV proteins such as synaptophysin and synaptobrevin (Jahn and Südhof, 1994Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Synaptic vesicles and exocytosis.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The protein composition of purified vesicles was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) following separation by 16-BAC/SDS-PAGE (Hartinger et al., 1996Hartinger J. Stenius K. Hogemann D. Jahn R. 16-BAC/SDS-PAGE: A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system suitable for the separation of integral membrane proteins.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as well as by 1D SDS-PAGE. In total, 410 different proteins were unambiguously identified. To compensate at least in part for the nonquantitative nature of the proteomics analysis, we monitored the distribution of 85 proteins (including some that were not found in the proteomics analysis) using immunoblotting of subcellular fractions. This allowed the definition of three major categories: (1) copurification with SVs, (2) ubiquitous distribution in all membrane fractions, and (3) separation away from the vesicle fraction (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The main results are summarized in Table 1; the immunoblot profiles and a list of all the proteins identified by MS are shown in Figures S1 and S3 and Table S1.Table 1Summary of Proteins Identified in Purified SVsMethod of DetectionDistributionTrafficking ProteinsSNAREs Synaptobrevin/VAMP1MS● Synaptobrevin/VAMP2MS● CellubrevinMS● VAMP4—● VAMP7MS Sec22-like1MS▿ SNAP-23—▿ SNAP-25MS▿ SNAP-29MS● SNAP-47MS● Syntaxin 1AMS▿ Syntaxin 1B2MS▿ Syntaxin 2—▿ Syntaxin 3—▿ Syntaxin 6MS● Syntaxin 7MS● Syntaxin 13MS● Syntaxin 16bMS● vti1aMS●bData from Antonin et al.

MS = proteins identified by mass spectrometry (a complete list is given in Table S1); (—) = proteins not identified by mass spectrometry. More than 80 different integral membrane proteins were identified by proteomics. Of these, approximately 40 are known SV residents. The few known SV membrane proteins missed included SVOP (Janz et al., 1998Janz R. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. SVOP, an evolutionarily conserved synaptic vesicle protein, suggests novel transport functions of synaptic vesicles.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9269-9281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the chloride channels ClC3 and ClC7 (Stobrawa et al., 2001Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. et al.Disruption of ClC-3, a chloride channel expressed on synaptic vesicles, leads to a loss of the hippocampus.Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), the vesicular neurotransmitter transporters known to be confined to minor SV subpopulations (VMATs and VAChT), and a few SNAREs (see Table 1), resulting in an overall coverage of approximately 80% of all known vesicle membrane proteins. Most of the remaining membrane proteins are residents of the plasma membrane, including some channels, transporters, and a group of adhesion molecules belonging to the IgG superfamily. While the degree of plasma membrane contamination within the SV fraction is known to be low (Walch-Solimena et al., 1995Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. The t-SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 are present on organelles that participate in synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that some of these proteins may use SVs as part of their recycling pathway. Only a few membrane proteins from other subcellular membranes were identified, confirming that the analyzed SV fraction was of high purity. Some peptides corresponding to open reading frames containing predicted transmembrane segments were detected. Two of the predicted proteins resemble transporters, whereas the others show no homology to known proteins (see Table S1 for more details). While we expected trafficking proteins to occupy the dominant position in the SV proteome, we were surprised by their diversity. In addition to the SNARE proteins synaptobrevin/VAMP2, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25, which are known to function in exocytosis, a total of 20 different SNAREs were identified (Table 1), including a novel SNARE with similarities to SNAP-29 (termed SNAP-47; Holt et al., 2006Holt M. Varoqueaux F. Wiederhold K. Takamori S. Urlaub H. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Identification of SNAP-47, a novel Qbc-snare with ubiquitous expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17076-17083Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Of these, 13 copurified with SVs. Thus, SVs are equipped with SNAREs functioning not only in exocytosis but also in other fusion steps such as early and late endosome fusion, supporting the view that SVs communicate with endosomal intermediates at least at some point in their life cycle. Even more surprising was the multitude of Rab proteins identified: 33 in all, more than half of the rat's genetic inventory (Bock et al., 2001Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. A genomic perspective on membrane compartment organization.Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Rabs are presently considered to be the most specific organelle “markers.” At present, we cannot exclude that, at least to a certain extent, Rabs are deposited on the vesicles during purification from a GDI-bound soluble pool, although it is commonly believed that membrane binding is compartment specific and involves Rab-specific catalysts (Pfeffer and Aivazian, 2004Pfeffer S. Aivazian D. Targeting Rab GTPases to distinct membrane compartments.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some of the Rabs, e.g., Rab1, may reside on contaminating small trafficking vesicles of different origin. However, at least some Rabs are synaptically localized and/or copurify with SVs. These include Rab3a, Rab3b, Rab3c (Schlüter et al., 2002Schlüter O.M. Khvotchev M. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Localization versus function of Rab3 proteins. Evidence for a common regulatory role in controlling fusion.J. Biol.

Fischer von Mollard and R.J., unpublished data), and Rab11 (Khvotchev et al., 2003Khvotchev M.V. Ren M. Takamori S. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Divergent functions of neuronal Rab11b in Ca2+-regulated versus constitutive exocytosis.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10531-10539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our preparation also contained proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, in particular, the components of the AP-2 complex (Table 1). This is not surprising, considering that SVs recycle via clathrin-coated vesicles. Furthermore, partially decoated vesicles derived from recycling SVs cofractionate with SVs (Maycox et al., 1992Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. Clathrin-coated vesicles in nervous tissue are involved primarily in synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and many SV proteins were detected in a recent proteome analysis of brain clathrin-coated vesicles (Blondeau et al., 2004Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M. Hussain N.K. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Roy L. Boismenu D. et al.Tandem MS analysis of brain clathrin-coated vesicles reveals their critical involvement in synaptic vesicle recycling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3833-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A large number of peripheral proteins were also identified. These include (1) proteins involved in signaling pathways such as trimeric GTPases, protein and polyphosphoinositide kinases, and phosphatases; (2) cytoskeleton proteins; (3) metabolic enzymes; and (4) chaperones. While some of these proteins may participate in SV function, such as trimeric GTPases (regulation of vesicular neurotransmitter uptake; Ahnert-Hilger et al., 2003Ahnert-Hilger G. Höltje M. Pahner I. Winter S. Brunk I. Regulation of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 150: 140-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal proteins (vesicle transport), others may be only loosely associated with the vesicle membrane, and many are probably contaminants. Finally, we also detected some ribosomal proteins, together with proteins involved in RNA processing and proteasome components. Both ribosomes and proteasomes are in the same size range as SVs and thus are expected to copurify to some extent. Next, we performed quantitative determinations of more than a dozen major SV proteins. Quantitation was performed by either western blotting or dot blotting, using purified proteins as standards. Figure 1A shows an example of such a determination, and Figure 1B summarizes the results for all analyzed proteins, including a few data from previous publications. Synaptophysin, synaptobrevin 2 (also referred to as VAMP2), synaptotagmin 1, and synapsin I are among the most abundant proteins, in very good agreement with earlier results (Goelz et al., 1981Goelz S.E. Nestler E.J. Chehrazi B. Greengard P. Distribution of protein I in mammalian brain as determined by a detergent-based radioimmunoassay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The t-SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 are present on organelles that participate in synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We also included two vesicular glutamate transporters, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, in our analysis. These transporters display a differential localization in the brain and are known to reside on nonoverlapping vesicle subpopulations (Fremeau et al., 2001Fremeau Jr., R.T. Troyer M.D. Pahner I. Nygaard G.O. Tran C.H. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Fortin D. Storm-Mathisen J. Edwards R.H. The expression of vesicular glutamate transporters defines two classes of excitatory synapse.Neuron. 2001; 31: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). To estimate their relative contribution, we performed immunogold labeling on purified vesicles. VGLUT1 antibodies and VGLUT2 antibodies labeled 66.8% and 23.3% of the vesicles, respectively. Immunogold labeling of synaptophysin, used as a reference, labeled more than 97% of all membranous structures (data not shown). In summary, the proteins quantified here account for approximately 45% (VGLUT1-positive vesicles) and 48% (VGLUT2-positive vesicles) of the total vesicle protein. The lipid composition was measured by electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled with collision-induced dissociation (CID) and mass spectrometry (Brügger et al., 1997Brügger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Quantitative analysis of biological membrane lipids at the low picomole level by nano electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Except for cholesterol, the overall composition (Figures 1C and 1D) agrees approximately with older measurements involving thin-layer chromatography (Nagy et al., 1976Nagy A. Baker R.R. Morris S.J. Whittaker V.P. The preparation and characterization of synaptic vesicles of high purity.Brain Res. 1976; 109: 285-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Benfenati et al., 1989Benfenati F.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1851-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that (1) the cholesterol content (40 mol%) is high, (2) the amount of phosphatidylinositol is very low (as noted previously; Benfenati et al., 1989Benfenati F. Greengard P.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1851-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and (3) there is a high proportion of the plasmalogen form of phosphatidylethanolamine. All data described so far were derived from highly purified vesicle fractions and involved bulk measurements made on an unknown number of vesicles. However, to construct a molecular model, the physical parameters of an average SV need to be determined. The number of SVs present was measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which is a reliable standard way of counting particles in solution (Magde et al., 1972Magde D. Elson E.

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Vesicles were labeled with the membrane dye FM1-43, which only becomes fluorescent upon membrane insertion. Addition of vesicles to buffer containing FM1-43 increased the emitted light intensity severalfold (Figure 2A). A strong time-dependent autocorrelation (Figure 2B, bottom, black lines) for fluctuations in the signal (Figure 2B, top) was observable, which was only seen when vesicles were added (Figure 2B, bottom, red line). For each sample, the protein concentration was determined in parallel. Based on the FCS counts, the following average values were then calculated for single vesicles: protein = (17.1 ± 0.19) × 10−18 g/vesicle (Figure 2C), phospholipids = 8.8 × 10−18 g/vesicle, and cholesterol = 3.7 × 10−18 g/vesicle, resulting in a total predicted dry mass of 29.6 × 10−18 g/vesicle (Table 2; see also Supplemental Data).Table 2Physical Parameters and Composition of an Average Synaptic VesiclePhysical ParametersDensity (g/ml)1.10Outer diameter (nm)41.6Inner aqueous volume (l)19.86 × 10−21Number of neurotransmitter molecules (at 150 mM)1790Mass (g)aCalculated indirectly using the vesicle number and the sum of protein and lipid masses.

The results of nine experiments suggest that money brings about a self-sufficient orientation in which people prefer to be free of dependency and dependents.

Relative to participants primed with neutral concepts, participants primed with money preferred to play alone, work alone, and put more physical distance between themselves and a new acquaintance."
https://openalex.org/W4248650893,"We demonstrated nanoscale solid-state thermal rectification. High-thermal-conductivity carbon and boron nitride nanotubes were mass-loaded externally and inhomogeneously with heavy molecules. The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon. Considering the important role of electrical rectifiers (diodes) in electronics, thermal rectifiers have substantial implications for diverse thermal management problems, ranging from nanoscale calorimeters to microelectronic processors to macroscopic refrigerators and energy-saving buildings."
https://openalex.org/W2050417626,"Normal intestinal mucosa contains abundant immunoglobulin A (IgA)–secreting cells, which are generated from B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). We show that dendritic cells (DC) from GALT induce T cell–independent expression of IgA and gut-homing receptors on B cells. GALT-DC–derived retinoic acid (RA) alone conferred gut tropism but could not promote IgA secretion. However, RA potently synergized with GALT-DC–derived interleukin-6 (IL-6) or IL-5 to induce IgA secretion. Consequently, mice deficient in the RA precursor vitamin A lacked IgA-secreting cells in the small intestine. Thus, GALT-DC shape mucosal immunity by modulating B cell migration and effector activity through synergistically acting mediators."
https://openalex.org/W2133707588,"We report measurements and analysis of a boreal forest fire, integrating the effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, black carbon deposition on snow and sea ice, and postfire changes in surface albedo. The net effect of all agents was to increase radiative forcing during the first year (34 Â± 31 Watts per square meter of burned area), but to decrease radiative forcing when averaged over an 80-year fire cycle (â2.3 Â± 2.2 Watts per square meter) because multidecadal increases in surface albedo had a larger impact than fire-emitted greenhouse gases. This result implies that future increases in boreal fire may not accelerate climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2001685400,"Animals sustain the ability to operate after injury by creating qualitatively different compensatory behaviors. Although such robustness would be desirable in engineered systems, most machines fail in the face of unexpected damage. We describe a robot that can recover from such change autonomously, through continuous self-modeling. A four-legged machine uses actuation-sensation relationships to indirectly infer its own structure, and it then uses this self-model to generate forward locomotion. When a leg part is removed, it adapts the self-models, leading to the generation of alternative gaits. This concept may help develop more robust machines and shed light on self-modeling in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2045228008,"Deregulation of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) is emerging as a major aspect of cancer etiology because their capacity to direct the translation and stability of targeted transcripts can dramatically influence cellular physiology. To explore the potential of exogenously applied miRNAs to suppress oncogenic proteins, the ERBB oncogene family was chosen with a bioinformatics search identifying targeting seed sequences for miR-125a and miR-125b within the 3′-untranslated regions of both ERBB2 and ERBB3. Using the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 as a model for ERBB2 and ERBB3 dependence, infection of these cells with retroviral constructs expressing either miR-125a or miR-125b resulted in suppression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 at both the transcript and protein level. Luciferase constructs containing the 3′ 3′-untranslated regions of ERBB2 and ERBB3 demonstrated ∼35% less activity in miR-125a- and miR-125b-expressing cells relative to controls. Additionally, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT was suppressed in SKBR3 cells overexpressing either miR-125a or miR-125b. Consistent with suppression of both ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling, miR-125a-or miR-125b-overexpressing SKBR3 cells were impaired in their anchorage-dependent growth and exhibited reduced migration and invasion capacities.

More than 400 human miRNAs have been identified to date with up to ∼1000 miRNAs postulated to exist on the basis of bioinformatics analyses, leading to the speculation that a majority of human mRNAs are subject to miRNA regulation (9Lewis B.P.

Export to the cytoplasm is facilitated by exportin-5, where the ∼70-nt pre-miRNA is further processed by the RNase III endonuclease Dicer into a mature ∼22-nt double-stranded miRNA (1Bartel D.P.

Subsequent incorporation of one strand into RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) establishes the miRNA as competent to target mRNAs for translational arrest and, in some instances, transcript decay (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29622) Google Scholar, 2Ambros V. Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (9088) Google Scholar, 3Zamore P.D. Haley B.

Although targeting of a mRNA by a miRNA remains a poorly defined process, it appears to be largely mediated by complementarity between nucleotides 2 to 5 (numbered from the miRNA 5′ end), occasionally referred to as the “seed sequences,” with a target element in the transcript 3′-UTR (1Bartel D.P.

Involvement of miRNAs in the oncogenic process has been supported by the observation that the 13q14 deletion characterizing more than half of all chronic lymphocytic leukemias results in loss of miR-15a and miR-16-1 genes (5Calin G.A.

Additional studies using microarray profiling have demonstrated aberrant expression of miRNAs in human cancers, with deregulation of specific miRNAs distinguishing different cancer types (7Lu J.

One breast cancer study concluded that two up-regulated miRNAs (miR-21, miR-155) might act as oncogenes, whereas three other down-regulated miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-125b, and miR-145) might act as breast cancer suppressor genes (8Iorio M.V.

Of interest, these same breast cancer suppressing miRNA candidates, miR-10b, miR-125b (along with its homolog, miR-125a), and miR-145, were also identified in a recent study as being significantly down-regulated in ERBB2-amplified and -overexpressing breast cancers clinically matched against ERBB2-negative human breast cancers (13Mattie M.D. Benz C.C.

Given this involvement of miRNAs with cancer development, the manipulation of cellular miRNA levels has emerged as a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention (14Felli N. Fontana L. Pelosi E.

Efforts to predictably alter intracellular transcript profiles by increasing specific miRNA levels either through transfection or viral delivery methods have demonstrated the potential of this strategy to modulate cellular physiology (12Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (4007) Google Scholar, 14Felli N. Fontana L.

Conversely, attempts to reduce miRNA levels using biologically stable antisense moieties such as 2′O-methyl oligonucleotides or “antagomirs” have also proven capable of altering intracellular transcript profiles (15Krutzfeldt J.

Gene Ther. 2006; 13: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A bioinformatics comparison of the 3′-UTRs of ERBB2 and ERBB3 revealed a consensus target element for both miR-125a and miR-125b; thus, the present study was undertaken to assess ERBB2 and ERBB3 suppression after retroviral delivery and overexpression of these miRNAs in an ERBB2-amplified and -overexpressing human breast cancer cell line, SKBR3. Overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b reduced ERBB2 and ERBB3 at both the transcript and protein level in these cells, leading to reduced ERK1/2 and AKT signaling. Functionally, miR-125a- or miR-125b-overexpressing SKBR3 cells displayed diminished plating and anchorage-dependent growth in addition to markedly reduced cell migration and invasion capacities. Parallel studies performed on MCF10A cells demonstrated that miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression produced only marginal influences on the anchorage-dependent growth and migration of these non-transformed and ERBB2-independent human mammary epithelial cells. Cell Lines, Reagents, and Supplies—The ERBB2-dependent human breast cancer cell line, SKBR3, and the non-transformed and ERBB2-independent human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SKBR3 cells were maintained in McCoy's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MCF10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 20 ng/ml recombinant EGF (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). Antibodies used in this study included the ERBB2 mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-3 from EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA), ERBB3 mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-6 from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to total ERK1/2, phospho-Ser-ERK1/2, total AKT and phospho-Ser-AKT from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA), and mouse monoclonal antibody to β-actin from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Invasion and migration assays were preformed using 24-well formatted BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers and 24-well formatted 8-μm PET track-etched porous membranes, respectively, commercially obtained from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). Micro-RNA Data Base and Retroviral Expression of miRNAs—Nucleotides 2-7 from the 5′ end of miRNA of the 321 human miRNA listed in the Sanger miRBase 7.0 release were searched for complementarity to the 3′-UTRs of ERBB2 (Ensemble gene ENSG00000141736) and ERBB3 (Ensemble gene ENSG00000065361). Full-length human miRNAs miR-125a and miR-125b together with ∼200 bp of flanking sequence were amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into the pTOPO-D entry vector (Invitrogen). Cloned fragments were verified by sequencing, and recombinase was cloned into the pMSCVpuro expression vector (Clontech). Primers used for the genomic amplification of miR-125a and miR-125b were: miR-125a, 5′-caccggcttctgtgtctctttcacag-3′ (forward) and 5′-gacgggacggcactggccagag-3′ (reverse); miR-125b, 5′-cacctgtatgtgcgtgattgtatatg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cctcaggcatcaataacatgca-3′ (reverse). Infectious and replication-incompetent retroviral particles were produced as previously described (17Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). SKBR3 and MCF10A cells were infected with retroviral particles expressing miR-125a, miR-125b or only the puromycin resistance gene (puro control). After retroviral infection and primary puromycin selection at 0.5 μg/ml, cell pools of SKBR3-125a, SKBR3-125b, and SKBR3-puro together with MCF10A-125a, MCF10A-125b, and MCF10A-puro were maintained for multiple culture passages under lower puromycin concentration (0.25 μg/ml). 3′-UTR-luciferase Reporter Constructs and SKBR3 Transient Transfection Assays—EST clones containing the 3′-UTR sequences from ERBB2 and ERBB3 cDNA were commercially obtained (Invitrogen) and used as templates for PCR amplification of the full-length or deleted (nt 1-44 and 1-26 for deleted ERBB2 and ERBB3 UTR constructs, respectively) 3′-UTR products. PCR products were cloned into the XbaI site of the luciferase reporter pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield pERBB2wtUTR, pERBB2ΔUTR, pERBB3wtUTR, and pERBB3ΔUTR containing the wild type and deleted 3′-UTRs from ERBB2 and ERBB3, respectively. The 3′-UTR inserts from all constructs were sequence-verified. Transient transfection assays were performed in 12-well plates seeded with ∼1.5 × 105 SKBR3-125a, SKBR3-125b, or SKBR3-puro cells per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For each transfection experiment, equal volumes of a given DNA-lipid complex formulation were distributed in duplicate to each of the SKBR3-125a, SKBR3-125b, and SKBR3-puro cultures with at least three separate transfection experiments performed for each 3′-UTR construct. The β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) was co-transfected with each experiment for normalization of transfection efficiency. Because both the pCH110 and pGL3 co-transfected constructs use the SV40 promoter, potential promoter differences resulting from miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression were presumed nullified. Northern and Western Blotting—Total RNA extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) from retrovirally infected SKBR3 and MCF10A cells was analyzed by Northern blotting. Methods and probes described previously (18Scott G.K. Mattie M.D. Berger C.E. Benz S.C. Benz C.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) were used to detect ERBB2 (4.6 kilobases) and ERBB3 (4.9 kilobases) transcripts relative to control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts. Levels of enforced and endogenous expression of miR-125a and miR-125b were detected using 15% Tris borate-EDTA urea polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), with RNA transferred onto Hybond Plus membranes (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (18Scott G.K. Mattie M.D. Berger C.E. Benz S.C. Benz C.C.

Loading for small RNA species was controlled by probing with a 32P end-labeled antisense snU6 DNA oligonucleotide (5′-ttgcgtgtcatccttgcgcagg-3′). Total protein extracted from retrovirally infected SKBR3 sublines was analyzed by Western blotting using methods and antibodies described previously (19Scott G.K. Marden C. Xu F. Kirk L. Benz C.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 2: 971-984Google Scholar) to detect endogenous ERBB2 and ERBB3 receptor levels relative to β-actin and phospho-Ser-ERK1/2 and phospho-Ser-AKT relative to total ERK1/2 (42/44 kDa) and AKT. Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Assays—All cell proliferations assays were replicated in three independent experiments using the retrovirally infected cell pools (SKBR3-125a, SKBR3-125b, SKBR3-puro, MCF10A-125a, MCF10A-125b, and MCF10A-puro). In each experiment, cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated into duplicate wells of 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells per well. Total cell counts were obtained and averaged on days 2, 4, and 6 after plating. All cell migration and invasion assays were similarly replicated three times using independently infected cell pools. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in media without serum or growth factors. After counting, 1 × 104 SKBR3 cells in 0.5 ml of medium were added to either 8-μm porous chamber inserts or 8-μm porous BioCoat Matrigel chamber inserts (BD Biosciences) and placed in wells filled with 0.75 ml of medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as chemoattractant for both migration and invasion assays. MCF10A cells are capable of migration but not Matrigel invasion; after counting, 3 × 104 MCF10A cells in 0.5 ml of medium were added to 8-μm porous chamber inserts placed in wells filled with 0.75 ml of medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and growth factors (see above) as chemoattractant. After 20 h of incubation, cells remaining on the insert top layers were removed with cotton swab scrubbings as recommended by the manufacture. Cells on the membrane lower surfaces were fixed in 100% methanol for 2 min followed by staining (2 min) in a 1% toluidine blue solution prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. Inserts were washed several times in distilled water before air drying; membranes were photo-graphed using an Olympus I × 70 microscope at 70×, and cell counts were determined after totaling five random fields (each field capturing ∼6% of total membrane area) and expressed as a percentage of the control cell number. Conserved miR-125 Targeting Element Identified within the 3′-UTRs of ERBB2 and ERBB3 and Retroviral Overexpression of miR-125 Species in Human Mammary Epithelial Cells—To explore the strategy of externally delivered miRNAs to promote the down-regulation of proteins with known oncogenic properties, the ERBB family, consisting of ERBB1/EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 family members, was chosen for miRNA targeting. A bioinformatics search of ERBB family 3′-UTRs for complementarity to miRNA seed sequences (nt 2-7 from the 5′ end), as listed in the Sanger miRBase data base (Version 7.0 release), focused attention on miR-125a and miR-125b. The most proximal 3′-UTR regions of both ERBB2 and ERBB3 were found to exhibit perfect complementarity with the 5′ nucleotides, nt 1-8, of miR-125a and miR-125b. Interest in the miR-125 family was also supported by its evolutionary link to lin-4, the first identified miRNA species functionally known to regulate Caenorhabditis elegans cellular proliferation (21Ambros V. Horvitz H.R. Science. 1984; 226: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 22Wu L. Belasco J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9198-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) as well as recent identification of this miRNA family as candidate breast cancer suppressors (8Iorio M.V. Ferracin M. Liu C.-G. Veronese A. Spizzo R. Sabbioni S. Magri E. Pedriali M. Fabbri M. Campiglio M. Menard S. Palazzo J.P. Rosenberg A. Musiani P. Volinia S. Nenci I. Calin G.A. Querzoli P. Negrini M. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7065-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the maximum free energy predicted hybridization configurations between the putative 3′-UTR miR-125 target elements in ERBB2 and ERBB3 and the seed sequences in miR-125a or miR-125b all exhibit similar stabilities at ΔG ∼-14 kcal/mol, determined by mFold analysis and consistent with authentic miRNA targeting (20Doench J.G. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The use of viral constructs offers the possibility of rapidly producing high intracellular levels of mature miRNA via the endogenous miRNA processing pathway. To this end, ∼300-bp fragments containing genomic miR-125a and miR-125b sequences were obtained by PCR amplification from human DNA and cloned into pMSCV, a retrovirus producing high transcript levels driven by its long terminal repeat. A human breast cancer cell line, SKBR3, dependent upon endogenous ERBB2 amplification and receptor overexpression for its growth and survival, and the non-transformed and ERBB2-independent human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, were retrovirally infected and selected for viral integration by puromycin selection. As shown in the Northern blots of Fig. 1B, enforced expression of mature miR-125a and miR-125b was achieved in both cell lines at ∼7-10-fold increases above their endogenous miRNA levels. SKBR3 Overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b Suppresses ERBB2 and ERBB3 Transcript and Protein Expression and Inhibits Signaling by ERK1/2 and AKT Pathways—After retroviral infection and ∼10 days of puromycin selection, total RNA and protein extracts were prepared from pooled SKBR3 cells showing either miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression and from control cells similarly infected but with the pMSCV empty vector and puromycin selected. As shown in the Northern blots of Fig. 2A, ERBB2 transcript levels in the SKBR3-125a and SKBR3-125b cells were 52 and 80%, respectively, of SKBR3-puro control levels after loading normalization by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels. Likewise, ERBB3 mRNA levels in SKBR3-125a and SKBR3-125b cells were 67 and 90%, respectively, that of SKBR3-puro control levels after normalization. As shown in the Western blots of Fig. 2B, ERBB2 protein levels were reduced to 40 and 65% that of control (SKBR3-puro) levels in SKBR3-125a and SKBR3-125b cells, respectively, whereas ERBB3 protein levels were reduced to 60 and 80% that of control levels, respectively, after loading normalization by β-actin levels. The downstream signaling response of ERBB2 and ERBB3 receptor activation and heterodimerization includes serine phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT pathway intermediates. Thus, the basal activation status of these two signal transduction pathways were assessed by Western blotting protein extracts isolated from SKBR3-125a and SKBR3-125b cells relative to those from control SKBR3-puro cells. As shown in the Western blots of Fig. 2B, phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and phospho-AKT (pAKT) levels relative to total ERK1/2 and total AKT levels were significantly reduced in the miR-125a- and miR-125b-overexpressing SKBR3 cells, with the former showing greater suppression than the latter, consistent with the more pronounced ERBB2 and ERBB3 protein suppression observed in the SKBR3-125a cells compared with the SKBR3-125b cells. Analysis of ERBB2 and ERBB3 3′-UTRs for miR-125 Responsiveness—To examine the 3′-UTRs from ERRB2 and ERRB3 for responsiveness to miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression, the full-length 3′-UTR sequences from ERBB2 and ERBB3 cDNAs were cloned into the luciferase expressing pGL3-promoter vector using a unique XbaI site just downstream of the luciferase stop codon to create pERBB2wtUTR and pERBB3wtUTR expression constructs, respectively, for transient transfection into SKBR3-125a, SKBR3-125b, and SKBR3-puro cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, luciferase activities expressed off the pERBB2wtUTR or pERBB3wtUTR constructs were suppressed by 60-72% in the miR-125a- and miR-125b-expressing SKBR3 cells relative to luciferase activity expressed in the SKBR3-puro control cells. To confirm the involvement of miR-125a and miR-125b in this reporter gene suppression, 3′-UTR deletion constructs (ΔUTR) were made that eliminated the conserved CUCAGGGA-targeting elements from the ERBB2 and ERBB3 UTR reporters; bases 1-44 were deleted to create pERBB2ΔUTR, whereas bases 1-26 were deleted to create pERBB3ΔUTR. In experiments where the full-length and deleted UTR constructs for ERBB2 and ERBB3 were each transiently transfected into SKBR3-125a and SKBR3-125b cells, luciferase activity from pERBB2ΔUTR was ∼1.4-fold greater than that from pERBB2wtUTR, whereas the luciferase activity from pERBB3ΔUTR was ∼1.7-fold greater than activity from pERBB3wtUTR, as shown in Fig. 3B. Also seen in Fig. 3B is the much lower but still slightly increased (1.1-fold) luciferase activity resulting from the UTR deletion constructs (relative to their respective wild type UTR constructs) in the SKBR3-puro control cells, possibly reflecting the endogenous levels of miR-125a and miR-125b in these cells (as shown in Fig. 1B). Overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b Impairs Anchorage-dependent Growth of SKBR3—The anchorage-dependent growth consequences of enforced miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression were compared in the ERBB2-dependent SKBR3 and ERBB2-independent MCF10A cell lines. All experiments were performed on pooled puromycin-selected cells within 2-3 weeks after their retroviral infection and initial selection and while under puromycin selection pressure. As shown in Fig. 4A, within 2 days of plating an equal number of viable SKBR3-125a, SKBR3-125b, and SKBR3-puro cells, only 50 and 75% of the miR-125a- and miR-125b-overexpressing cells, respectively, remained viably attached and growing relative to the SKBR3-puro control cells. After this initial 2-day interval, growth rates estimated by linear extrapolation out to day 6 indicated an apparent 60% slower growth rate by the SKBR3-125a and SKBR3-125b cells relative to the SKBR3-puro cells. In contrast to the impaired anchorage-dependent growth associated with miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression in the SKBR3 cells, Fig. 4B shows that the similarly produced and miRNA-overexpressing MCF10A-125a and MCF10A-125b cells exhibited little if any impaired plating and growth within the first 2 days relative to control MCF10A-puro cells. Extrapolating their growth rates out to day 6 indicated an apparent 25% slower growth rate by the MCF10A-125a and MCF10A-125b cells relative to the control MCF10A-puro cells, suggesting a mild negative influence by these miRNAs on cellular proliferation mechanisms independent of ERBB2 status and possibly related to the reported tumor suppressing function of miR-125a and miR-125b (8Iorio M.V.

In vertebrate cells, this process is mediated in part by the protease separase, which destroys a small amount of cohesin, but most cohesin is removed from chromosomes without proteolysis. How this is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we show that the interaction between cohesin and chromatin is controlled by Wapl, a protein implicated in heterochromatin formation and tumorigenesis. Wapl is associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle, and its depletion blocks cohesin dissociation from chromosomes during the early stages of mitosis and prevents the resolution of sister chromatids until anaphase, which occurs after a delay. Wapl depletion also increases the residence time of cohesin on chromatin in interphase. Our data indicate that Wapl is required to unlock cohesin from a particular state in which it is stably bound to chromatin.

Our data indicate that Wapl is required to unlock cohesin from a particular state in which it is stably bound to chromatin. Sister-chromatid cohesion is required for chromosome biorientation on the mitotic and meiotic spindle and for DNA-damage repair during G2 phase (Lee and Orr-Weaver, 2001Lee J.Y. Orr-Weaver T.L. The molecular basis of sister-chromatid cohesion.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 753-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cohesion is mediated by cohesin, a ring-shaped protein complex composed of the ATPases Smc1 and Smc3 and the kleisin Scc1/Mdc1/Rad21 (Guacci et al., 1997Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A.

Scc1 is bound to a fourth subunit, called Scc3 in yeast, that exists in different isoforms in vertebrate somatic cells, called SA1 and SA2 (Losada et al., 2000Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R.

Vertebrate cells contain also two isoforms of this protein, Pds5A and Pds5B, both of which physically interact with cohesin (Sumara et al., 2000Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Gieffers C. Peters B.H.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). How cohesin binds to chromatin and how it connects replicated DNA molecules remains unknown, but it has been proposed that cohesin links sister chromatids by embracing them as a ring (Haering et al., 2002Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Molecular architecture of SMC proteins and the yeast cohesin complex.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the cohesin ring would have to be opened to either generate or dissolve the interaction between cohesin and DNA. Alternatively, it is possible that cohesin interacts with DNA directly (Akhmedov et al., 1998Akhmedov A.T. Frei C. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Kemper B. Gasser S.M. Jessberger R.

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that the majority of cohesin associates with chromatin reversibly throughout interphase. However, in G2 cells, a second population of cohesin binds to chromatin very stably. This population is only found when DNA has been replicated and may thus represent cohesin molecules that have established cohesion (Gerlich et al., 2006Gerlich D. Koch B. Dupeux F. Peters J.M.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1571-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, most cohesin is destroyed at anaphase onset by Scc1 cleavage, which is mediated by the protease separase (Uhlmann et al., 2000Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cleavage of cohesin by the CD clan protease separin triggers anaphase in yeast.Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In contrast, vertebrate cells remove the majority of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase without Scc1 cleavage (Losada et al., 1998Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T.

The activity of this “prophase pathway” is reduced if Plk1, Aurora B, or condensin I is inactivated, or if a nonphosphorylatable SA2 mutant (SA2-12xA) is expressed. Under these conditions sister-chromatid arms cannot be resolved (Losada et al., 2002Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T.

We have identified an ortholog of the Drosophila protein Wapl (wings-apart like) as a protein that is specifically associated with cohesin and that controls the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin. Wapl is highly conserved among metazoan species, essential for viability in Drosophila and mice, and has been implicated in heterochromatin formation, chromosome segregation, and tumorigenesis (Verni et al., 2000Verni F.

Expression of a novel human gene, human wings apart-like (hWAPL), is associated with cervical carcinogenesis and tumor progression.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3545-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but Wapl's molecular functions were unknown. We show that human Wapl interacts with cohesin throughout the cell cycle via cohesin's Scc1 and SA1/SA2 subunits and that Wapl forms a subcomplex with Pds5A. Like cohesin, Wapl is associated with chromatin from telophase until prophase of the next mitosis. Depletion of Wapl by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits the dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes during prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase; although Plk1 and Aurora B are active, condensin I associates with mitotic chromosomes and SA2 is phosphorylated. This defect in cohesin dissociation does also not depend on the presence of Sgo1. The resolution of chromosome arms is severely impaired in Wapl-depleted cells until anaphase, which occurs eventually after a delay, implying that separase can still be activated in the absence of Wapl. The depletion of Wapl also results in increased levels of cohesin on chromatin in interphase, and FRAP experiments show that cohesin remains bound to chromatin longer in the absence of Wapl. These results indicate that Wapl is required for the release of cohesin from both interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes, perhaps by facilitating opening of the cohesin ring or by modulating direct interactions between cohesin and DNA. Wapl is thus a regulator of cohesin's association with chromatin, whose function is not restricted to but particularly important during the early stages of mitosis. To identify cohesin-associated proteins we immunoprecipitated cohesin from lysates of logarithmically proliferating HeLa cells with antibodies to Smc3, SA1, or SA2 and analyzed the bound proteins by insolution digest and tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Besides Smc1, Smc3, Scc1, SA1/SA2, Pds5A, and Pds5B there was one additional protein reproducibly identified in all samples (Figure 1A). This protein is called Wapl (Oikawa et al., 2004Oikawa K.

Wapl was also detected in Pds5A and Pds5B immunoprecipitates (IPs; Figure 1A) but could not be found in IPs of other proteins such as anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) or condensin (data not shown). Wapl further copurified with cohesin isolated with myc antibodies from HeLa cells that stably express Scc1-myc, but no Wapl was detected in myc IPs from regular HeLa cells (data not shown). In immunoblot experiments, two Wapl peptide antibodies (986 and 987) were able to react with in vitro translated Wapl, and in HeLa extracts the antibodies recognized a 180 kDa band that could be depleted by transfection of HeLa cells with Wapl siRNAs (Figure 1C). When Wapl IPs were analyzed by MS, all cohesin subunits, Pds5A, and Pds5B could be detected (Figure 1A). Immunoblot experiments confirmed that cohesin subunits were present in Wapl IPs and that Wapl was present in cohesin but not in condensin samples (Figure 1E). When cohesin and Wapl IPs were compared by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, strikingly similar protein patterns were observed. Both samples contained bands that correspond to cohesin subunits, Pds5A, Pds5B, and Wapl (Figure 1D). The association between cohesin and Wapl could be detected in interphase and mitotic HeLa cells, and Wapl was identified by immunoblotting in cohesin samples isolated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown). We conclude that Wapl is specifically associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle in mammalian cells. The sequence of Wapl is highly conserved among metazoan species, in particular in a C-terminal region (amino acid residues 1141–1667 of Drosophila Wapl; Figures 1B and S2). Secondary structure predictions indicate that this “Wapl domain” is predominantly α-helical. It hits, although subsignificantly, to hidden Markov models of helical repeat domains like Armadillo and HEAT repeats (data not shown). In iterative NCBI-PSI-BLAST searches with the Drosophila Wapl domain we identified the hypothetical Neurospora crassa protein emb/CAD70983.1 (E-value 8e-07) and proteins of unknown function from Schizosaccharmoyces pombe and other fungi (E-values < 1e-4; Figure S2 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We used the Wapl domains of the S. pombe and Yarrowia lipolytica proteins to perform iterative PSI-BLAST searches in the proteomes of Saccharomycetales and identified proteins in Eremothecium gossypii (AAR187C), Klyveromyces lactis (KLA-CDS1440.1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rad61; E-values < 6e-05). These proteins are all members of one protein family, but their overall similarity to Wapl is low. Interestingly, Rad61 has been implicated in DNA repair, cohesion, and chromosome segregation (Game et al., 2003Game J.C. Birrell G.W. Brown J.A. Shibata T. Baccari C. Chu A.M. Williamson M.S.

USA. 2005; 102: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Wapl and Rad61 are related. To understand if Wapl is required for cohesin assembly and to address which cohesin subunit is needed for the Wapl interaction, we isolated Wapl and cohesin from HeLa cells that had been depleted of Smc3, Scc1, or Wapl by RNAi and analyzed the IPs by immunoblotting. All cohesin core subunits could be coprecipitated when Wapl had been depleted, indicating that Wapl is not essential for cohesin assembly or stability (Figure 1F and data not shown). When Smc3 had been depleted, Scc1 could still be detected in Wapl IPs. However, when Scc1 had been depleted, Smc3 did not coprecipitate with Wapl, although Smc3 was still associated with Smc1 (Figure 1E). The interaction between Wapl and the Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer therefore depends on Scc1. The depletion of SA1 and/or SA2 also reduced the association of Wapl with Smc1 (Figure S1A). Wapl may thus interact with the part of cohesin that contains Scc1 and SA1/SA2. When we separated HeLa extract by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and analyzed the fractions by immunoblotting, we observed that the majority of Wapl was detected in 8S fractions, and only a small amount was detected after long exposures in 14S fractions where cohesin sediments (Figure 2A and data not shown). The interaction between Wapl and cohesin may therefore not be stable enough to persist during the 18 hr centrifugation step. Pds5A also sediments corresponding to 8S (Sumara et al., 2000Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Gieffers C. Peters B.H. Peters J.M. Characterization of vertebrate cohesin complexes and their regulation in prophase.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar; Figure 2A), and we therefore addressed if Wapl interacts with Pds5A. Consistent with this possibility we detected more Pds5A in Wapl IPs than in cohesin IPs by MS and immunoblotting (Figures 1A and 2B). When we peptide eluted proteins bound to Wapl antibodies and separated them in density gradients, we also found that Wapl and Pds5A cosedimented in 8S fractions (Figure 2C). Finally, we observed that Pds5A could be immunoprecipitated with Wapl antibodies from 8S fractions, whereas small amounts of cohesin subunits were precipitated with Wapl antibodies from 14S fractions (Figure 2D). These results indicate that Wapl and Pds5A form a subcomplex whose interaction with cohesin is less stable than the interactions among the core cohesin subunits. However, the formation of this subcomplex appears to be dependent on the core cohesin subunits because depletion of Scc1 by RNAi greatly reduced the ability of Wapl antibodies to immunoprecipitate Pds5A (Figure S1B). Although we could not reliably detect Pds5B in all experiments, our data indicate that Wapl also interacts with Pds5B (Figure 2A). To analyze where Wapl is located we stably expressed N-terminally myc-tagged Wapl under control of the regulatable “Tet on” promoter in HeLa cells. We compared myc-Wapl and cohesin localization in these cells by staining them with myc and Scc1 antibodies, respectively. Both proteins were mainly nuclear in interphase, became cytoplasmic from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) until anaphase, and reaccumulated in nuclei in telophase (Figure 3A). Similar staining patterns were observed when soluble proteins were removed by preextraction (Figure 3B), indicating that a fraction of Wapl molecules is chromatin bound in interphase, as is cohesin. No Wapl could be detected on chromosomes from prometaphase until anaphase. Like cohesin, Wapl thus dissociates from mitotic chromosomes. We confirmed these results in fractionation experiments. HeLa cells were synchronized in S phase by release from double thymidine treatment, enriched in mitosis by subsequent addition of nocodazole, and then released again (Figure 3C). At different time points lysates were generated, separated into soluble cytoplasmic and insoluble chromatin fractions, and analyzed by immunoblotting. In S and G2 cells, Wapl could be detected both in chromatin and supernatant fractions (Figure 3C and data not shown), but in mitotic cells only small amounts of Wapl were detected in chromosome pellets (Figure 3C). To test if binding of Wapl to chromosomes depends on cohesin, Scc1-depleted HeLa cells were arrested in S phase because these cells would otherwise arrest in mitosis, where Wapl is not chromatin bound. Cell lysates were then analyzed by fractionation and immunoblotting as above. In the absence of Scc1, Wapl could not be detected in chromatin fractions (Figure 3D), indicating that the association of Wapl with chromatin depends on cohesin. To address if Wapl regulates cohesin or sister-chromatid cohesion we transfected HeLa cells with either one of two different Wapl siRNAs, which caused depletion of Wapl in both cytoplasmic and chromatin fractions beyond immunoblot detection levels (Figure 4A and Figure S1C). When these cells were preextracted and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM), cohesin was nevertheless detected in interphase nuclei, implying that cohesin binding to chromatin does not depend on Wapl (Figure 5C and data not shown). FACS analyses of cells synchronized by double thymidine treatment indicated that DNA replication was likewise normal after Wapl depletion (data not shown). To address whether Wapl depletion causes cohesion defects we enriched cells in mitosis by a 30 min nocodazole treatment, collected them by shake off, and analyzed their chromosomes by spreading and Giemsa staining. Under these conditions, chromosomes from control cells showed the typical x-shape with clearly resolved sister-chromatid arms and a tight connection of sister chromatids at the centromere (Figure 4B). However, chromosomes from Wapl-depleted cells showed a strikingly different morphology. In 88% of cells transfected with Wapl siRNAs, individual sister chromatids were hardly visible within spread chromosomes (Figure 4B). These chromosomes were nevertheless composed of two sister chromatids because the chromosome width was larger than that of single chromatids and two closely opposed chromatids could be recognized in higher magnification images of some chromosomes (Figure 4C). The aberrant morphology of chromosomes from Wapl-depleted cells was thus not due to replication defects or to precocious loss of cohesion but to defects in sister-chromatid resolution. The arms of control chromosomes were on average 0.9 ± 0.3 μm apart when cells were analyzed after 30 min of nocodazole treatment, whereas chromosomes from Wapl-depleted cells had an average arm-to-arm distance of only 0.4 ± 0.2 μm (Figure 4D). Staining of fixed cells with CREST sera revealed that also interkinetochore distances were slightly decreased by Wapl depletion (Figures S3A and S3B). When control and Wapl-depleted cells were treated for 3 hr with nocodazole, 50% of all Wapl-depleted cells still contained chromosomes whose sister chromatids had not been resolved, whereas such chromosomes were only seen in 11% of control cells (Figure 4C). Wapl depletion thus causes severe defects in sister-chromatid resolution, even when mitosis is artificially prolonged. The opposite effect was seen when myc-Wapl was overexpressed. When uninduced myc-Wapl cells were analyzed by chromosome spreading, about 5% of mitotic cells contained separated sister chromatids. After induction of myc-Wapl expression with doxycycline, however, 25% of mitotic spreads showed separated sister chromatids (Figure S3C). Wapl overexpression therefore causes cohesion defects. To understand if the abnormal chromosome morphology in Wapl-depleted cells causes defects in mitotic progression, we synchronized control and Wapl-depleted cells by double thymidine treatment and analyzed them by IFM. After Wapl depletion, more cells were found in prophase and prometaphase, whereas metaphases and anaphases were reduced (Figure 4F). In prometaphase cells, Mad2 was enriched on many kinetochores and in 88% of these cells, cyclin B had not been degraded (control cells 90%), indicating that the spindle-assembly checkpoint had been activated (Figures S3D and S3E). We also filmed Wapl-depleted and control cells that stably expressed GFP-tagged histone H2B by time-lapse microscopy and measured the time from NEBD to anaphase onset. Control cells needed on average 43 min for this period, whereas Wapl-depleted cells needed 67 min (Figures 4E and 4G). However, eventually, most Wapl-depleted cells entered anaphase and separated sister chromatids. Wapl depletion therefore delays progression through the early stages of mitosis. Because cohesin dissociation is required for resolution of sister chromatids, we analyzed if the resolution defect in Wapl-depleted cells may be caused by defects in cohesin dissociation. First, we depleted Wapl in HeLa cells that stably express SA2-myc, enriched cells in prometaphase by a 30 min nocodazole treatment, harvested them by shake off, and analyzed their chromosomes by spreading and IFM with myc and condensin antibodies. After control treatment, myc staining was enriched at centromeres in 90% of all prometaphase cells that expressed SA2-myc (n = 100), and only 5% of these showed in addition staining on chromosome arms. However, after Wapl depletion, 64% of all myc-positive prometaphase cells (n = 100) contained chromosomes with equally intense centromere and arm staining. The staining intensity of these chromosomes was higher than that of control chromosomes (Figure 5A and data not shown). Wapl depletion thus causes a defect in cohesin dissociation from chromosome arms. We tested next if endogenous cohesin can also be detected on chromosomes after Wapl depletion. It is important to note that we have previously not been able to detect endogenous cohesin on prometaphase or metaphase HeLa chromosomes by IFM. Even when components of the prophase pathway were inactivated, cohesin could only be detected on mitotic chromosomes by expression of tagged cohesin subunits (Sumara et al., 2002Sumara I.

We show that perception of the phytohormone cytokinin is a key element in this switch. Mutation of a Lotus japonicus cytokinin receptor gene leads to spontaneous development of root nodules in the absence of rhizobia or rhizobial signal molecules. The mutant histidine kinase receptor has cytokinin-independent activity and activates an Escherichia coli two-component phosphorelay system in vivo. Mutant analysis shows that cytokinin signaling is required for cell divisions that initiate nodule development and defines an autoregulated process where cytokinin induction of nodule stem cells is controlled by shoots.

The results support a model in which a stressed intermediate, with DNA-unwinding stress and DNA-compaction stress, is formed during initial transcription, and in which accumulated stress is used to drive breakage of interactions between RNAP and promoter DNA and between RNAP and initiation factors during promoter escape."

The depth and geometry of fractures match those in Arctic permafrost and ice-age weathering profiles. This agreement supports a conceptual model in which ice segregation in near-surface permafrost leads progressively to rock fracture and heave, whereas permafrost degradation leads episodically to melt of segregated ice and rock settlement."
https://openalex.org/W2156961733,"We combined local photolysis of caged compounds with fluorescence imaging to visualize molecular diffusion within dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Diffusion of a volume marker, fluorescein dextran, within spiny dendrites was remarkably slow in comparison to its diffusion in smooth dendrites. Computer simulations indicate that this retardation is due to a transient trapping of molecules within dendritic spines, yielding anomalous diffusion. We considered the influence of spine trapping on the diffusion of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and inositol-1,4,5-triphospate (IP(3)), two synaptic second messengers. Diffusion of IP(3) was strongly influenced by the presence of dendritic spines, while Ca(2+) was removed so rapidly that it could not diffuse far enough to be trapped. We conclude that an important function of dendritic spines may be to trap chemical signals and thereby create slowed anomalous diffusion within dendrites."

https://openalex.org/W2118920382,"Nitric oxide (NO) regulates a number of signaling functions in both animals and plants under several physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). NO can react with a variety of molecules, including heme-containing proteins, protein- and nonproteinassociated thiol groups, and other free radicals (2Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I.

S-Nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitrogen monoxide group to the thiol side chain of cysteine, is considered the most widespread and functionally important form of physiological NO-dependent posttranslational modification (3Hess D.T.

S-Nitrosylated proteins in plants have been identified and experimental evidence of regulation through S-nitrosylation is currently available for only three proteins: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (4Lindermayr C.

Many more examples of protein S-nitrosylation and consequent modifications in activity have been reported in animal systems (7Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Regulation of procaspase 3 is just one example of how S-nitrosylation can control fundamental processes, such as apoptosis: in resting cells, caspase-3 zymogens are S-nitrosylated at the active site cysteine, and enzyme activity is inhibited, whereas during Fas-induced apoptosis they are denitrosylated and the function of the catalytic site is regained (8Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Plant genomes do not contain structural homologs of caspases, but encode several related proteins, named metacaspases, that are also present in protozoa and fungi. Metacaspases, together with paracaspases (found in Dictyostelium discoideum and metazoa), have been proposed to be the ancestors of metazoan caspases and to be involved in regulation of programmed cell death processes in these lineages (9Uren A.G.

Despite conservation of the catalytic dyad of histidine and cysteine in metacaspases, paracaspases, and caspases, their overall sequence similarity is very low. Plant metacaspase zymogens autoprocess in a manner similar to that of caspases, but their substrate specificity differs because metacaspases have an Arg/Lys-specific proteolytic activity (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The predicted structural similarity between caspases and metacaspases suggests that the acid-base motif that favors S-nitrosylation of the catalytic cysteine in caspases (11Brüne B. Mohr S. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2001; 2: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is conserved around the same residue in metacaspase. This observation prompted us to investigate the possible role of NO as a regulator of metacaspase activity in plants through S-nitrosylation. We demonstrate that NO regulates the proteolytic activity of the Arabidopsis thaliana type-II metacaspase AtMC9 and that NO blocks autoprocessing and activation of the AtMC9 zymogen through S-nitrosylation of the catalytic cysteine residue. In contrast, the mature processed form of AtMC9 is insensitive to NO inactivation because of a second catalytic cysteine that is not susceptible to S-nitrosylation and thereby acts as a salvaging catalytic residue within the catalytic center of processed AtMC9. Recombinant Wild-type and Mutant AtMC9—The cDNA for the open reading frame of AtMC9, At5g04200, was obtained as described previously (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D.

Briefly, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with the forward and reverse primers (5′-ATGGATCAACAAGGGATGGTC-3′ and 5′-TCAAGGTTGAGAAAGGAACGTC-3′), provided with the adequate 5′ extensions for Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) was performed and the fragment inserted into pDEST17. The plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysE and production of the His6-tagged protein was induced by incubation in 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h. The protein was purified with metal ion affinity chromatography (BD Talon™, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Protein concentration was checked by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Point mutagenesis of AtMC9 was done with the “megaprimer” method (12Colosimo A. Xu Z. Novelli G. Dallapiccola B. Gruenert D.C.

Briefly, 2 mg of protein extracts was incubated with 20 mm methyl methanthiosulfate and 2.5% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min with frequent vortexing to block free cysteine. Excess methyl methanthiosulfate was removed by protein precipitation with 2 volumes of cold acetone, and proteins were resuspended in 0.1 ml of 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS (pH 7.7) per mg of protein. After the addition of 1 mm (N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (Pierce) and 1 mm ascorbic acid, the mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in the dark with intermittent vortexing. For purification of biotinylated proteins, samples were diluted with 2 volumes of neutralization buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 7.7)), supplemented with 140 μl of neutravidin-agarose, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with washing buffer (600 mm NaCl in neutralization buffer), resuspended with 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, incubated 5 min at 95 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to protein gel blot analysis with specific polyclonal anti-AtMC9 antibodies (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D.

As negative controls, the same samples were immunoprecipitated without (N-(6-(biotinamido) hexyl-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide. Purified recombinant AtMC9 was assayed with a similar method (15Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar): 20 μm AtMC9 was incubated with 200 μm sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in MES buffer (pH 7.5) in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, followed or not by an additional incubation for 1 h under the same conditions with 10 mm of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Excess of reagents (GSNO/DTT) were eliminated by protein precipitation with 2 volumes of cold acetone. The recombinant proteins were subjected to the biotin-switch method, resuspended on SDS-PAGE buffer, and loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE. S-Nitrosylated proteins were detected with antibiotin antibody. Metacaspase Activity Assay—Assays were performed as described previously (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzymes were preactivated for 15 min in the appropriate buffer containing 1 mm DTT at room temperature. Ten pmol of enzyme was added to a final assay volume of 150 μl buffer (50 mm MES, pH 5.3, 10 mm DTT, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl) and 50 μm substrate Ac-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-VRPR-amc). Release of fluorescent amc was measured at λex of 380 nm and λem of 460 nm with a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Synthetic substrate Ac-VRPR-amc was synthesized by Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Modeling of AtMC9—Procaspase 7 was used as a template for the generation of a three-dimensional homology model of AtMC9 with MODELLER 8v1 (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10563) Google Scholar). The template used was Bookhaven's Protein Data Bank entry 1GQF. Protein structure alignments yielded 93% similarity between AtMC9 and human paracaspase 7. Alignments of metacaspases, paracaspases, and caspases were done with ClustalW (17Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar) according to the conservation of the secondary structure. Nitrosylation of Cys-147 in AtMC9 Impairs Autocleavage—First, we investigated whether AtMC9 could be S-nitrosylated in vitro. Purified recombinant AtMC9 was incubated with the transnitrosylating agent GSNO and subjected to the biotin-switch method that selectively biotinylates S-nitrosylated cysteines (15Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Protein gel blot analysis with an antibiotin antibody revealed that the full-length AtMC9 zymogen was S-nitrosylated and that the intensity of the signal correlated with the dosage of added GSNO (Fig. 1A). As expected, the signal was abolished when the thiol-specific reductant DTT was added after the GSNO treatment. Recombinant type-II metacaspase zymogens autoprocess into a 22-kDa (p20) and a 15-kDa (p10) subunit during purification. Both subunits are expected to heterodimerize to produce the active form of the protease (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), but only the fulllength protein and the p20 protein fragment were S-nitrosylated (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A). The possibility that the p10 fragment was lost during the biotin-switch procedure was excluded by visualization of the fragment through silver staining. We tested the S-nitrosylation status of recombinant AtMC9C147A, a mutant version of AtMC9 in which the Cys residue residing in the catalytic dyad was changed into an Ala residue (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation occurred predominantly at Cys-147 because the biotin-derived signal in AtMC9C147A was almost completely lost (Fig. 1C). We wanted to identify AtMC9 S-nitrosylation in vivo as evidence of a possible biological function. Because endogenous AtMC9 protein levels in wild-type plants are below the detection limit by protein gel blot analysis, we used transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying AtMC9 (MC9OE-1 and MC9OE-2) and AtMC9C147A (MC9C147AOE-1 and MC9C147AOE-2) under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. These independent homozygous lines differ in the level of transgene expression. Until now, no aberrant phenotypes have been detected in these lines. S-Nitrosylated proteins in extracts from these transgenic plants were isolated by the biotin-switch method and purified with neutravidin-agarose beads. Protein gel blot analysis of purified proteins with an antibody specifically recognizing AtMC9 showed that the fulllength and the p20 fragment of the AtMC9 protein were clearly visible in MC9OE lines, whereas in both MC9C147AOE lines no signal was detectable (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that also in vivo the zymogen of metacaspase 9 is S-nitrosylated at Cys-147. We had previously shown that a mutation in the catalytic Cys-147 (AtMC9C147A) abolishes both AtMC9 autoprocessing and activity toward several synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we assessed whether S-nitrosylation of the catalytic cysteine residues affects the autocatalytic activation of prometacaspase 9 to the mature and active form. Purified recombinant prometacaspase 9 was incubated for 15 min at pH 7.5 in the absence or presence of the NO donors SNP or GSNO before zymogen activation was triggered by switching the reaction mixture to pH 5.3 with a MES buffer. This acidic condition had been found before to be necessary for AtMC9 activation (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Protein gel blot analysis of samples taken at 4-min intervals after the pH switch revealed a clear delay in AtMC9 autoprocessing when preincubated with SNP (Fig. 2A) and GSNO (data not shown). The reduced autoprocessing capacity of S-nitrosylated prometacaspase 9 was in accordance with a 30% reduction in activity toward an optimized synthetic tetrapeptide substrate Ac-VRPR-amc (Fig. 2B) (18Vercammen D. Belenghi B. van de Cotte B. Beunens T. Gavigan J.-A. De Rycke R. Brackenier A. Inzé D. Harris J.L. Van Breusegem F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Oddly, an almost doubled VRPRase activity was observed when processed AtMC9 (obtained by a 15-min preincubation in the acidic assay buffer) was incubated with SNP or GSNO (Fig. 2B). This effect was dose-dependent up to 10 equivalent units of GSNO, while the activity decreased with higher concentrations (Fig. 2C), probably because of aspecific S-nitrosylation of all the cysteine residues present in the protein (19Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with SNP (data not shown). Complete autoprocessing could be allowed (data not shown) and normal VRPRase activity (Fig. 2B) restored after removal of the NO group from the S-nitrosylated prometacaspase 9 by adding the reducing agent DTT. A Second Cysteine Is Involved in the Activity Mechanism of AtMC9 and Is Insensitive to S-Nitrosylation—Strikingly, all reported protein sequences of fungal, protozoic, and plant metacaspases contain, in addition to the conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic His-Cys dyad (Cys-147 in the AtMC9 sequence), a second highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-29 in the AtMC9) between the first strand and helix motifs (Fig. 3A). In caspases and paracaspases, this residue is absent. The importance of this second cysteine was first demonstrated for a Trypanosoma brucei metacaspase. The petite phenotype (clonal lethality and irreversibly damaged respiratory competence) obtained upon heterologous overexpression of a T. brucei (TbMC4) metacaspase in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was not observed upon overproduction of a mutated protein in which the corresponding Cys-29 and the adjacent Cys residues were replaced by an Ala (20Szallies A. Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To assess the functionality of this second conserved cysteine residue in plant metacaspases and its possible salvaging role in the S-nitrosylated form, we produced and purified three different N-terminal His6-tagged mutant versions of AtMC9 in which the catalytic Cys-147 (AtMC9C147A), the second conserved cysteine (AtMC9C29A), or both cysteines (AtMC9C147AC29A) were mutated to an Ala. During AtMC9 zymogen autoprocessing, together with p20 and p10 subunit formation, the His6 tag was cleaved from the N-terminal end as evidenced by protein gel blot analysis with an anti-His antibody. This event produced five different protein fragments, corresponding to the full-length and the p20 fragment, with and without a His6 tag (Fig. 3B), and the p10. His6 cleavage occurred either at LYKK-5, a peptide signature artificially introduced into the expression vector by Gateway cloning of the AtMC9 open reading frame, or alternatively at an internal putative cleavage site close to the N-terminal end, VKKR10 (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). While the mutant version AtMC9C147A remained unprocessed and inactive (10Vercammen D. van de Cotte B. De Jaeger G. Eeckhout D. Casteels P. Vandepoele K. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45329-45336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), AtMC9C29A performed autoprocessing, but the resulting protein fragment signature differed from that of the wild-type AtMC9. This mutant was unable to cleave at one or both of the potential N-terminal cleavage sites (LYKK-5 and VKKR10) in the vicinity of the N-terminal His tag, thus producing only one p20 subunit. The full-length and p20 subunit fragments were recognized by both the anti-His and the specific anti-AtMC9 antibody (46 and 28 kDa, respectively; Fig. 3B), confirming that the corresponding fragments without His6 tag were not produced. Processed AtMC9C29A had only 10% of VRPRase activity compared with that of the wild-type AtMC9 (Fig. 4A). This drastic loss of activity indicates either a fundamental role for Cys-29 in substrate cleavage or an inhibitory effect of the N-terminal peptide. To exclude this latter possibility, we tested whether AtMC9C147A, which is unable to cleave itself, and AtMC9C29A, which does not cleave the N-terminal peptide, were both able to cleave the VRPR substrate once correctly processed. Therefore, we supplemented both mutant versions with a minimal amount of readily activated recombinant wild-type AtMC9 and incubated the resulting mix for 1 h to allow complete processing. Protein gel blot analysis with an anti-AtMC9 antibody showed a correct cleavage pattern and correct maturation of all mutant proteins (Fig. S1B-S1E). VRPRase activity of both AtMC9C147A and AtMC9C29A had strongly increased, whereas in the double mutant AtMC9C147AC29A no activity was observed (Fig. 4A). These data confirm that at least one of the two cysteines is needed for protease activity. We also studied the effect of S-nitrosylation on the activity of the different processed AtMC9 mutant forms by adding SNP for 20 min. Incubation of AtMC9C147A with SNP caused only a minor inhibition of the activity compared with the untreated one (Fig. 4B). This inhibition could be attributed to some minor and aspecific S-nitrosylation of the remaining cysteine residues. In contrast, S-nitrosylation of the AtMC9C29A mutant inhibited the activity by 75% (Fig. 4B). S-Nitrosylation of this mutant was confirmed by the biotin-switch assay (Fig. S1D). We provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence for S-nitrosylation of the Arabidopsis type-II metacaspase 9 and for a posttranslational role of S-nitrosylation on regulation of metacaspase activity. Metacaspases are members of the CD clan of cysteine proteases encompassing also caspases, paracaspases, legumains, gingipains, separases, and clostripains (21Mottram J.C. Helms M.J. Coombs G.H. Sajid M. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that have originally been proposed to be the plant functional homologs of mammalian caspases as regulators or executors of cell death (22Woltering E.J. van der Bent A. Hoeberichts F.A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Functional evidence supporting this hypothesis has first been shown in the yeast YCA1 and T. brucei metacaspases (20Szallies A. Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lächelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Fröhlich K.-U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In Norway spruce (Picea abies), metacaspases maintain the balance between differentiation and cell death during embryogenesis (24Bozhkov P.V. Suarez M.F. Filonova L.H. Daniel G. Zamyatnin Jr., A.A. Rodriguez-Nieto S. Zhivotovsky B. Smertenko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14463-14468Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, mere overproduction of AtMC9 does not lead to obvious cell death-related phenotypes, suggesting that its proteolytic activity is inhibited. Our data indicate that in planta S-nitrosylation of metacaspases can contribute to maintain this inhibition by impairing autocleavage and, thus, avoiding inappropriate activation. Through basal NO levels, which are provided by a constitutive production driven by NO synthase activities (25Crawford M.N. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and by enzymatic and nonenzymatic reduction of nitrite (26Planchet E. Gupta K.J. Sonoda S. Kaiser W.M. Plant J. 2005; 41: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), Cys-147 might be S-nitrosylated in AtMC9 and kept in its inactive unprocessed zymogenic form. Because DTT was able to activate AtMC9 autoprocessing as well as the enzymatic activity of the S-nitrosylated zymogenic form, denitrosylation could push AtMC9 toward its active state. In vivo, denitrosylation might be accomplished by endogenous or external stimuli that can perturb the cellular redox balance. In these events, redox enzymes, such as thioredoxin or glutaredoxin, might catalyze the reaction (19Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Alternatively, S-nitrosylated AtMC9 might be activated through cleavage by an upstream protease. In accordance with caspase cascade models, primary suspects are the type-I metacaspases that, like initiator caspases, contain an N-terminal prodomain that could be involved in regulatory protein-protein interactions (9Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional relevance of AtMC9 (de)nitrosylation events in plants is supported by the spatio-temporal coincidence of NO accumulation and AtMC9 gene expression. AtMC9 expression is highest in xylem elements and during lateral root formation, while the AtMC9 proteolytic activity levels are above all detected during the first days of seedling germination. 9D. Vercammen and B. Belenghi, unpublished results. In parallel, NO has been demonstrated before to primarily accumulate and exert a regulatory role during seed germination (27Bethke P.C. Badger M.R. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), lateral root development (28Correa-Aragunde N. Graziano M. Lamattina L. Planta. 2004; 218: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and xylem differentiation (29Gabaldón C. Gómez Ros L.V. Pedreño M.A. Barceló A.R. New Phytol. 2005; 165: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NO and S-nitrosylation are crucial elements in keeping human caspases permanently in an inactive form. Even after processing, caspase-3 activity is blocked when the thiol side chain of its catalytic cysteine residue is S-nitrosylated. The reason for this strict inhibition is the inability of the catalytic cysteine to act as a nucleophile within the proteolytic reaction scheme (15Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, S-nitrosylation does not affect AtMC9 activity in its processed mature form. We demonstrated that a second catalytic cysteine that resides in the vicinity of the genuine catalytic center can function as alternative nucleophile in AtMC9 when Cys-147 is S-nitrosylated. This second catalytic cysteine residue (Cys-29 in AtMC9) is highly conserved in all known metacaspases but absent in all members of the caspase and paracaspase families. This “salvage” cysteine is insensitive to S-nitrosylation and can rescue the S-nitrosylated catalytic Cys-147 within the canonical His-Cys dyad even in the presence of high levels of NO, allowing fine-tuning of the regulation of AtMC9 activity, particularly in a cellular environment with high NO levels. In the absence of an upstream activator protease, AtMC9 is locked in its inactive proform. However, once processed by such a protease, AtMC9 is insensitive to and even more active (Fig. 2B) in a high NO environment. A prediction of the three-dimensional protein structure of the AtMC9 zymogen with the known crystal structure of human procapase 7 as a template confirms the proposed tertiary structure homology of metacaspases with animal caspases (9Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). This structure suggests that Cys-29 is located within the catalytic groove in close proximity of the canonical catalytic residues Cys-147 and His-95, explaining the rescuing role of Cys-29. When Cys-147 is S-nitrosylated, AtMC9 can use the second cysteine as an alternative nucleophile for catalyzing the proteolytic reaction, while in non-S-nitrosylated AtMC9, it can also act as a catalytic cysteine because the AtMC9C29A mutant, once correctly processed, displays more than 50% activity (Fig. 4A). Despite its predicted position within the catalytic groove and its salvage capacity in the processed AtMC9 form, Cys-29 is not able to substitute for the catalytic role of Cys-147 during autoprocessing, as illustrated by the inability of the AtMC9C147A to autoprocess and by its complete proteolytic inactivity. Only after processing, Cys-29 can substitute for Cys-147 as a catalytic residue that can be explained by the distance of Cys-29 from His-95 (7.49 Å) in the zymogen that might be too long for these two residues to interact. Once processed, conformational changes, as also described for human procaspase 7 (30Riedl S.J. Fuentes-Prior P. Renatus M. Kairies N. Krapp S. Huber R. Salvesen G.S. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14790-14795Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), may correctly position Cys-29 within the catalytic groove. The insensitivity of Cys-29 to S-nitrosylation is probably due to a different charged area surrounding the Cys-29. In AtMC9, the NO-sensitive Cys-147 is surrounded by basic (His-148) and acid (Asp-145) amino acids located at 1.23 and 8.23 Å, respectively. This surrounding environment promotes a concerted acid-base catalysis of protein transnitrosylation by facilitating, on the one hand, the H+ release of the SH group of Cys-147 and, on the other hand, the donation of NO+ from the NO donor (3Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). In contrast, the surrounding area of Cys-29, with more distant acidic and basic amino acids, is unfavorable for S-nitrosylation. Obviously, experimental determination of the tertiary structure of AtMC9 will consolidate this hypothesis and might provide additional insights into the proteolytic mechanism of metacaspases. In summary, we demonstrate that, like mammalian caspases, plant metacaspases can be kept inactive through S-nitrosylation of a critical Cys residue but are insensitive to S-nitrosylation when matured. We speculate that this rather surprising discrepancy is related to differences in NO householding between plants and mammals. Whereas mammals control internal NO levels very tightly by fine regulation of the activity of the various NO synthase isoforms, plants must deal with atmospheric NO as well as with internal leakage of NO that accumulates under normal growth conditions because of its production from nitrite (1Delledonne M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Therefore, plant metacaspases might have adapted to the NO-dependent regulatory mechanism known in human caspase 3 to function properly.

https://openalex.org/W2078703243,"N-linked protein glycosylation is found in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, it is the most abundant protein modification of secretory and membrane proteins, and the process is coupled to protein translocation and folding. We found that in bacteria, N-glycosylation can occur independently of the protein translocation machinery. In an in vitro assay, bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase glycosylated a folded endogenous substrate protein with high efficiency and folded bovine ribonuclease A with low efficiency. Unfolding the eukaryotic substrate greatly increased glycosylation. We propose that in the bacterial system, glycosylation sites are located in flexible parts of folded proteins, whereas the eukaryotic cotranslational glycosylation evolved to a mechanism presenting the substrate in a flexible form before folding."

Emerging hierarchical formulations add the potential of tracing the damage mechanisms down through all scales to the atomic.

Tethering factors can be categorized as long, coiled-coil proteins (e.g., p115, Uso1p, and GM130/golgin-95) or multisubunit protein complexes that physically link the vesicles and the target membranes upstream of membrane fusion and are believed to significantly contribute to the specificity of the transport reaction (Lowe, 2000Lowe M.

How the different types of tethering factors contribute to the overall specificity of this process is presently unknown. Transport protein particle (TRAPP) complexes I and II are required for tethering endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles to Golgi membranes and for Golgi traffic (Cai et al., 2005Cai H. Zhang Y.

The yeast TRAPP I complex consists of seven different proteins (Bet5p, Bet3p, Trs20p, Trs23p, Trs31p, Trs33p, and Trs85p), while TRAPP II contains three additional subunits (Trs65p, Trs120p, and Trs130p). The mechanism by which the TRAPP complexes mediate the tethering process is unknown, although in yeast, it may involve the exchange of guanine nucleotide on Ypt1p, a Rab GTPase family member (Jones et al., 2000Jones S. Newman C. Liu F. Segev N. The TRAPP complex is a nucleotide exchanger for Ypt1 and Ypt31/32.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4403-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2000Wang W. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. TRAPP stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Ypt1p.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The structures and functions of the TRAPP subunits are being elucidated. The structure of sedlin (the mammalian ortholog of yeast Trs20p) revealed an unexpected similarity to the structures of the N-terminal regulatory domain of two SNARE proteins, Ykt6p and Sec22b, suggesting that sedlin may play a regulatory role in the pairing of SNAREs in the early secretory pathway (Jang et al., 2002Jang S.B. Kim Y.G. Cho Y.S. Suh P.G. Kim K.H. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of SEDL and its implications for a genetic disease spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49863-49869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that Bet3p plays a critical role in anchoring TRAPP specifically to the Golgi (Kim et al., 2005bKim Y.G. Sohn E.J. Seo J. Lee K.J. Lee H.S. Hwang I. Whiteway M.

Behlke J. et al.Structure of palmitoylated BET3: insights into TRAPP complex assembly and membrane localization.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a process that depends on both a flat, positively charged surface and a hydrophobic channel (Kim et al., 2005bKim Y.G. Sohn E.J. Seo J. Lee K.J. Lee H.S. Hwang I. Whiteway M. Sacher M. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of bet3 reveals a novel mechanism for Golgi localization of tethering factor TRAPP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we determined the structure of bet3 in complex with trs33. The tertiary structure of trs33 is closely similar to that of bet3 but lacks the hydrophobic channel seen in bet3 (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S. Yi M.J. Lee K.H. Wagner J. Munger C. Kim Y.G. Whiteway M. Cygler M. Oh B.H. Sacher M.

Clarification of TRAPP architecture will be a crucial step toward the elucidation of the virtually unknown molecular mechanism of the tethering process mediated by these complexes. Here, we report the molecular interactions between all six subunits constituting vertebrate and yeast TRAPP I. This led to the identification of the bet3-trs33-bet5-trs23 heterotetramer and the bet3-trs31-sedlin heterotrimer as the two stable subcomplexes of mammalian TRAPP I, and the crystal structures of these subcomplexes were solved. In contrast, the yeast orthologs of these proteins form a functional and stable six-subunit complex. Single-particle electron microscopy revealed that the yeast TRAPP I complex has an elongated, bilobal overall shape, which nicely accommodates the crystal structures of the mammalian subcomplexes. Together with the identification of the minimal unit required for Ypt1p guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, this detailed architectural analysis of the complete TRAPP I tethering factor allows us to present a model by which this complex imparts specificity in ER-to-Golgi traffic. In order to examine the network of interactions between the TRAPP I subunits, we utilized an in vitro system using purified individual subunits. We could purify a total of five subunits (bet3, bet5, trs23, trs33, and sedlin) to homogeneity but were able to detect only two binary interactions: the formation of the complexes between bet3 and trs33 and between bet5 and trs23. Because mammalian trs31 could not be expressed in E. coli, we resorted to the trs31 ortholog from zebrafish (hereafter referred to as trs31), which displays very high sequence identity (80%) with its mammalian counterparts. Coexpression of trs31 with bet3 resulted in the purification of a heterodimer between the two proteins. Because we suspected that some TRAPP subunits may interact with two subunits simultaneously, the bet3-trs33 and bet3-trs31 heterodimers were incorporated into the in vitro binding assay. As demonstrated by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay (Figure 1A), sedlin interacted strongly with only the bet3-trs31 heterodimer. In contrast, a GST-bet5 fusion protein interacted with the bet3-trs33 heterodimer and trs23, but not with any of the other proteins. Quantitation of the bands on the gel indicates a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the bet3-trs31-sedlin complex and a 1:1:2 stoichiometry for the bet3-trs33-bet5 complex, consistent with their molecular sizes on a size-exclusion column (51 kDa and 71 kDa, respectively; Figure 1B). Incubation of trs23 with the bet3-trs33-bet5 complex resulted in the production of a four-subunit complex. Gel filtration followed by electrophoretic analysis of the mixture indicated that one copy of bet5 in the three-subunit complex was slowly replaced by trs23 (Figure 1B). However, when bet3, trs33, bet5, and trs23 were coexpressed in E. coli, they readily formed a heterotetramer (86 kDa) with a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry as estimated by gel filtration (data not shown) and confirmed by the structure determination as described below. The tetrameric complex did not interact with the bet3-trs31-sedlin complex in the analyses by gel filtration and GST pull-down. These observations strongly suggest that vertebrate TRAPP I is composed of the tetrameric and trimeric subcomplexes and that an as yet unidentified vertebrate subunit may link these complexes. To investigate whether the corresponding subcomplexes can be produced with the yeast counterparts, we carried out coexpression experiments in E. coli rather than a similar in vitro binding assay because all hexahistidine-tagged yeast orthologs were insoluble when expressed individually. The Trs85p subunit was omitted from these studies since it is nonessential to the function of TRAPP I. Of the remaining subunits, only Trs33p is nonessential. This subunit was included in these studies because (1) it interacts with Bet3p (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S. Yi M.J. Lee K.H. Wagner J. Munger C. Kim Y.G. Whiteway M. Cygler M. Oh B.H. Sacher M. Biochemical and crystallographic studies reveal a specific interaction between TRAPP subunits Trs33p and Bet3p.Traffic. 2005; 6: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and (2) deletion of two nonessential TRAPP subunits can be lethal (Tong et al., 2001Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. et al.Systematic genetic analysis with ordered arrays of yeast deletion mutants.Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Indeed, upon coexpression of TRAPP I subunits, stable Bet3p-Trs33p-Bet5p and Bet3p-Trs31p-Trs20p complexes were produced (Figure 1C). Quantitation of the bands on the SDS gels indicated a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for both subcomplexes. While this stoichiometry was supported by size-exclusion chromatography for the Trs20p-containing subcomplex (∼75 kDa; Figure 1C), both size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 1C) and dynamic light scattering (data not shown) indicated that the Bet5p-containing complex was likely to be a dimer of trimers (∼160 kDa). When each trimeric complex was coexpressed with Trs23p, stable tetrameric complexes of Bet3p-Trs33p-Bet5p-Trs23p and Bet3p-Trs31p-Trs20p-Trs23p were formed (Figure 1D), and both exhibited a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. Reasoning that Trs23p might serve to link the two heterotrimeric complexes together, we coexpressed all six yeast TRAPP I subunits using three dual-expression vectors. Strikingly, when all six yeast proteins were coexpressed, a stable complex was formed. Quantitation of the bands on the SDS gel indicated a stoichiometry of 2:1:1:1:1:1 with respect to Bet3p:Trs33p:Trs31p:Trs23p:Trs20p:Bet5p, supported by the apparent size of ∼170 kDa on a size-exclusion column (Figure 2A). The fact that Bet3p is present at twice the level of the other subunits is consistent with its interaction with both Trs31p and Trs33p and is consistent with an earlier study that showed the presence of at least two copies of Bet3p in TRAPP I (Sacher et al., 2000Sacher M. Barrowman J. Schieltz D. Yates III, J.R. Ferro-Novick S. Identification and characterization of five new subunits of TRAPP.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the six coexpressed TRAPP I subunits self-assemble into a recombinant TRAPP I complex herein referred to as rTRAPP I. The complex was not formed when the Trs23p subunit was omitted from the coexpression vector (data not shown), strongly suggesting that Trs23p links the two heterotrimeric subcomplexes together to form the rTRAPP I complex. To verify that the six subunits are components of the same complex, we examined the peak fraction from the size-exclusion column by several methods. First, static light scattering suggests a monodispersed sample (data not shown). Second, the proteins migrate as a single band on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (data not shown), suggesting that only one species is present in the fraction. Finally, the subunits bind to and elute from an ion-exchange column as a single unit (data not shown). In order to validate any further structural analyses, it was necessary to show that rTRAPP I behaves similarly to TRAPP I purified directly from yeast (herein referred to as TRAPP I). It was previously shown that TRAPP I acts as a GEF for the GTPase Ypt1p (Jones et al., 2000Jones S. Newman C. Liu F. Segev N. The TRAPP complex is a nucleotide exchanger for Ypt1 and Ypt31/32.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4403-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2000Wang W. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. TRAPP stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Ypt1p.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether rTRAPP I could exchange nucleotide on this GTPase. To assay for GEF activity, 3H-GDP was bound to Ypt1p and the ability of rTRAPP I and various subcomplexes to release the bound, radiolabeled nucleotide was assayed. As a control, we also assayed Dss4p, a protein with a broad spectrum of GEF activity. As shown in Figure 2B, compared to Dss4p, rTRAPP I displayed potent Ypt1p GEF activity. The release of nucleotide was essentially complete within 5 min of addition of the GTPase. These results indicate that rTRAPP I is an assembled and active form of TRAPP I. To narrow down the active region of rTRAPP I, we assayed the ability of subcomplexes to release nucleotide from Ypt1p. Neither the Bet3p-Trs33p-Bet5p-Trs23p nor the Bet3p-Trs31p-Trs20p-Trs23p heterotetrameric subcomplexes could support nucleotide release (Figure 2C). This strongly suggested that subunits in both of these subcomplexes are needed for this function. Indeed, the addition of Bet5p to the Bet3p-Trs31p-Trs20p-Trs23p subcomplex resulted in GEF activity (Figure 2C). The most reasonable assumption is that the subunits closest to Trs23p, the linker between the heterotrimeric subcomplexes, are required for this activity. Therefore, we needed to determine the arrangement of the subunits in the Bet3p-Trs31p-Trs20p-Trs23p subcomplex. Coexpression of Trs23-Bet5p-Trs20p did not lead to the identification of such a subcomplex. However, we could coexpress and purify the heterotetramer Bet5p-Trs23p-Bet3p-Trs31p (Figure 2D), suggesting that Trs23p links Bet5p to the Bet3p-Trs31p dimer with Trs20p bound elsewhere to the dimer. When we assayed this heterotetramer for GEF activity, we found that it was nearly as active as rTRAPP I in releasing nucleotide from Ypt1p (Figure 2B). The fact that rTRAPP I was slightly more active than Bet5p-Trs23p-Bet3p-Trs31p could reflect a slight difference in the structures of these subunits when found within the fully assembled complex. These results suggest that the minimal unit needed for GEF activity is Bet5p-Trs23p-Bet3p-Trs31p. Previous studies resulted in conflicting data as to whether TRAPP could also act as a GEF for the GTPases Ypt31p and Ypt32p, which function later in the secretory pathway than Ypt1p (Jones et al., 2000Jones S. Newman C. Liu F. Segev N. The TRAPP complex is a nucleotide exchanger for Ypt1 and Ypt31/32.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4403-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2000Wang W. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. TRAPP stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Ypt1p.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We found that rTRAPP I was incapable of releasing nucleotide from either of these two GTPases (data not shown), suggesting that TRAPP I is a GEF for only Ypt1p. The structure of the bet3-trs31-sedlin subcomplex was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. The bet3 and trs31 monomeric structures are similar to each other except for the presence of an additional C-terminal α helix in trs31 (Figure 3; see also Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). However, a clear difference is that while bet3 has a prominent central channel that can fully accommodate a myristoyl or palmitoyl group covalently attached to a cysteine residue (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S.

Although trs31 exhibits 11% and 14% sequence identity with bet3 and trs33, respectively, the structure of trs31 is more similar to that of bet3 than that of trs33 (Figure S1). The bet3-trs31 heterodimer interacts with sedlin in a side-by-side manner to form a flat subcomplex in which sedlin interacts predominantly with trs31 mainly by using two shallow grooves. One groove (referred to as groove A) is formed by a part of α2 and loop β4-β5 of sedlin and accepts α2 of trs31 (Figure 3A and Figure 4A). The other groove is formed by the C-terminal part of α1, loops α1-β3, and β4-β5 of sedlin. It accepts the α2-α3 loop of trs31 (Figure 3A). These interactions bury a solvent-accessible surface area of 742 Å2 of trs31. At the bet3-sedlin interface, a conserved segment in loop α2-α3 of sedlin, which was proposed as a putative protein-binding motif (Jang et al., 2002Jang S.B. Kim Y.G. Cho Y.S. Suh P.G. Kim K.H. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of SEDL and its implications for a genetic disease spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49863-49869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is snugly docked to the hydrophobic groove of bet3 formed by helix α1 and loop β3-α4 (Figure 4B), burying a solvent-accessible surface area of 385 Å2. By interacting with the C-terminal helix of trs31, sedlin undergoes a conformational change in α1: a 6.5-turn helix in the complex, as opposed to a 4-turn helix in the isolated protein (Jang et al., 2002Jang S.B. Kim Y.G. Cho Y.S. Suh P.G. Kim K.H. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of SEDL and its implications for a genetic disease spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49863-49869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a result, while free sedlin is structurally similar to the N-terminal regulatory domain of the SNARE proteins Ykt6p and Sec22b (Jang et al., 2002Jang S.B. Kim Y.G. Cho Y.S. Suh P.G. Kim K.H. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of SEDL and its implications for a genetic disease spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49863-49869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), sedlin in the heterotrimeric subcomplex more closely resembles these SNAREs. The bet3-trs31 portion in the trimeric subcomplex has an unusually flat, wide, positively charged surface that is comprised of residues from both subunits (Figure 3A). The lysine and arginine residues in trs31 on this surface are nearly invariant in the metazoan orthologs (Figure S2). Previously, a charge-inversion mutation of two conserved lysine residues (Lys24 and Lys96) on this surface of yeast Bet3p was shown to result in a Bet3p mutant protein that remained predominantly in the cytosol (Kim et al., 2005bKim Y.G. Sohn E.J. Seo J. Lee K.J. Lee H.S. Hwang I. Whiteway M. Sacher M. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of bet3 reveals a novel mechanism for Golgi localization of tethering factor TRAPP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and overexpression of TRS33, which also has a flat, positively charged surface, drove this mutant Bet3p to Golgi membranes (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S. Yi M.J. Lee K.H. Wagner J. Munger C. Kim Y.G. Whiteway M. Cygler M. Oh B.H. Sacher M.

Given these observations, the flat surface of the bet3-trs31 complex is presumed to be the membrane-proximal surface.Figure 4Focused Structural ViewsShow full caption(A) Detailed views of groove A of the sedlin family subunits.

The conserved residues interacting with the groove are shown as sticks. The structure of the bet3-trs33-bet5-trs23 subcomplex was determined at 2.4 Å resolution. The four subunits are arranged to form an unusually flat molecular complex through the side-by-side interactions between bet3-trs33 and bet5 and between bet5 and trs23 (Figure 3B). The structure of the bet3-trs33 portion in this subcomplex is virtually the same as that of the bet3-trs33 heterodimer reported earlier (Kim et al., 2005aKim M.S. Yi M.J. Lee K.H. Wagner J. Munger C. Kim Y.G. Whiteway M. Cygler M. Oh B.H. Sacher M. Biochemical and crystallographic studies reveal a specific interaction between TRAPP subunits Trs33p and Bet3p.Traffic. 2005; 6: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and is similar to the bet3-trs31 unit in the trimeric subcomplex. The bet5 subunit (145 residues) is composed of 5 β strands and 3 α helices that are arranged to form an α/β fold, with the single β sheet sandwiched by the N-terminal α helix at one side and the C-terminal antiparallel α helices at the other side (Figure 3B). The folding topology and the number of secondary structural elements of bet5 are identical to those of sedlin (140 residues), which exhibits 10% sequence identity with bet5. The structure of bet5 is most similar to that of isolated sedlin (Jang et al., 2002Jang S.B. Kim Y.G. Cho Y.S. Suh P.G. Kim K.H. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of SEDL and its implications for a genetic disease spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49863-49869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in the Protein Data Bank (ID code 1H3Q) and even more similar to that of sedlin in the trimeric subcomplex (Figure S3). Although bet5 and sedlin are structurally similar, as are bet3-trs33 and bet3-trs31, bet5 binds to a surface of bet3-trs33 opposite to the interface of bet3-trs31 for binding sedlin in the trimeric subcomplex. As a consequence, the position of bet5 relative to bet3-trs33 in the tetrameric subcomplex is completely different from the position of sedlin relative to bet3-trs31 in the trimeric subcomplex (Figures 3A and 3B). Like groove A of sedlin, the corresponding groove of bet5 is shallow and accepts α2 of bet3 (Figure 3B and Figure 4A). In addition, parts of α2, α3, and loop α2-α3 of bet5 lean tightly against the hydrophobic groove of trs33 formed by the helices α1 and α4 and loop β2-α4 (Figure 3B and Figure 4B). The trs23 subunit (219 residues) is composed of two domains (Figure 3B). One is a sedlin-like domain (140 residues), which is very similar to bet5 in the three-dimensional structure (Figure 3B and Figure S3A). While an alignment of the whole sequence of trs23 and bet5 showed only limited homology between the two proteins, a structure-based sequence alignment of the sedlin-like domain of trs23 and bet5 revealed that the two domains are similar not only in the length of the polypeptides but also at the primary sequence level (22% identity) (Figure S3B). The sedlin-like domain of trs23 and bet5 bind to each other primarily through the intermolecular packing of the α1 helices cradled by the gently curved intermolecular β sheet formed by the juxtaposition of the β sheets of the two subunits (Figure 3B). With the very high structural similarity and the extensive binding interface (1785 Å2) between the two proteins, the bet5-trs23 heterodimeric interaction looks like a stable homodimeric interaction related by a 2-fold symmetry. The other domain of trs23 (residues 23–101) is present in the middle of the polypeptide and is connected to the sedlin-like domain by two flexible loop segments (Figure 3B) whose electron densities are weak or missing. This domain exhibits barely detectable sequence homology to several PDZ domains, with the highest similarity to the sixth PDZ domain of InaD-like protein (INADL). However, the sequence similarity is limited to the C-terminal 40 residues (Figure S4A), as observed by others (Ethell et al., 2000Ethell I.M. Hagihara K. Miura Y. Irie F. Yamaguchi Y. Synbindin, A novel syndecan-2-binding protein in neuronal dendritic spines.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

Although axons target specific laminae during development, dendritic lamination has been thought to occur largely by pruning of inappropriately placed arbors. We discovered by in vivo time-lapse imaging that retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites in zebrafish show growth patterns implicating dendritic targeting as a mechanism for contacting appropriate synaptic partners. Populations of RGCs labeled in transgenic animals establish distinct dendritic strata sequentially, predominantly from the inner to outer retina. Imaging individual cells over successive days confirmed that multistratified RGCs generate strata sequentially, each arbor elaborating within a specific lamina. Simultaneous imaging of RGCs and subpopulations of presynaptic amacrine interneurons revealed that RGC dendrites appear to target amacrine plexuses that had already laminated. Dendritic targeting of prepatterned afferents may thus be a novel mechanism for establishing proper synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1998000155,"High consumption of olive oil in the Mediterranean diet has been suggested to protect DNA against oxidative damage and to reduce cancer incidence. We investigated the impact of the phenolic compounds in olive oil, and the oil proper, on DNA and RNA oxidation in North, Central, and South European populations. In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover intervention trial, the effect of olive oil phenolic content on urinary oxidation products of guanine (8-oxo-guanine, 8-oxo-guanosine and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine) was investigated. Twenty-five milliliters of three olive oils with low, medium, and high phenolic content were administered to healthy males (n=182) daily for 3 wk. At study baseline the urinary excretion of 8-oxo-guanosine (RNA oxidation) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (DNA oxidation) was higher in the Northern regions of Europe compared with Central and Southern European regions (P=0.035). Urinary excretion of the 8 hydroxylated forms of guanine, guanosine, deoxyguanosine and their nonoxidized forms were not different when comparing olive oils with low, medium, and high phenolic content given for 2 wk. Testing the effect of oil from urinary 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine changes from baseline to post-treatment showed a reduction of DNA oxidation by 13% (P=0.008). These findings support the idea that ingestion of olive oil is beneficial and can reduce the rate of oxidation of DNA. This effect is not due to the phenolic content in the olive oil. The higher DNA and RNA oxidation in Northern European regions compared with that in Central and Southern regions supports the contention that olive oil consumption may explain some of the North-South differences in cancer incidences in Europe."

Mitogen activation of CD4 T cells enhances A3G expression and leads to recruitment of low molecular mass (LMM) A3G, which functions as a post-entry human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) restriction factor, into enzymatically inactive, high molecular mass (HMM) RNA-protein complexes that include Staufen RNA-transporting granules. We now report that interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-15 and, to a lesser extent, IL-7 enhance the expression of A3G in peripheral blood lymphocytes and that this effect is blocked by inhibitors of the JAK and MAPK signaling pathways. In mixed cultures of CD4+ T cells containing either HMM or LMM A3G, HIV preferentially infected cells containing HMM A3G. A3G shifted into a HMM complex when IL-2, -7, or -15 was added to resting T cells, likely explaining how cytokine treatment renders resting CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV infection. Similarly, poly(I:C)/tumor necrosis factor-α-induced maturation of dendritic cells was associated with a sharp increase in A3G expression; however, this induction led to the accumulation of LMM A3G.

The APOBEC3A–H family is expressed in a tandem array on chromosome 22 (30Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Several of the genes encoding these enzymes are expressed in an inducible manner. For example, both A3A and A3B are up-regulated by phorbol esters and consequently were originally termed phorbolin-1 and -2, respectively (30Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Another cytidine deaminase family member, activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which is present on chromosome 12 and plays a critical role in class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation in B cells, is induced by IL-4 (31Zhou C. Saxon A. Zhang K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as well as by cell division (32Rush J.S. Liu M. Odegard V.H. Unniraman S. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13242-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The A3G gene is also inducible. Treatment of resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and IL-2 increases expression of the A3G protein (19Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of the H9 T cell line with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces expression of A3G mRNA and protein (33Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41744-41749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a result that correlates with the effects of phorbol esters on A3A and A3B. Further, PMA activation of A3G gene expression is dependent on activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in H9 leukemic T cells (33Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41744-41749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Mitogenic activation relieves the A3G-mediated post-entry restriction block in CD4+ T cells and causes these cells to become permissive to HIV infection (14Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The mitogen effect is caused by shifting A3G from its active LMM form into inactive HMM complexes that include Staufen RNA-transporting granules and Ro ribonucleoprotein complexes (34Chiu Y.L. Witkowska H.E. Hall S.C. Santiago M. Soros V.B. Esnault C. Heidmann T. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15588-15593Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Certain cytokines, including IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, have been reported to render resting CD4+ T cells permissive for HIV infection (35Cohen O.J. Kinter A. Fauci A.S. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 159: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36Fauci A.S. Nature. 1996; 384: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 37Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Marmon S.

Virol. 2002; 76: 9103-9111Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have explored the possibility that these cytokines activate A3G gene expression and recruit the LMM A3G present in primary resting CD4+ T cells into HMM A3G complexes. In addition, we have examined A3G expression in interferon-treated monocyte-derived macrophages and in dendritic cells (DCs).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation and Culture of Primary Cells—Buffy coats from individual healthy donors were processed on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD14– PBLs were prepared by negative selection with anti-CD14+ microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions using Automacs technology (Miltenyi Biotec). Residual CD14+ cells were further depleted by adherence to plastic for 3 h. To enrich CD4+ cells, PBLs preincubated with anti-CD4+ microbeads were positively selected with the Automacs. The purity of these populations was >95% when analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were routinely cultured (2 × 106 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/streptomycin.Immature DCs were derived by culturing CD14+ monocytes for 6 days in complete medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml IL-4 (R&D Systems) and 50 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (BIOSOURCE) (39Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). DC maturation was induced by incubating the immature DCs for 24 h with 25 μg/ml poly(I:C) (Amersham Biosciences) and 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (BIOSOURCE) (40Spisek R. Bougras G. Ebstein F. Masse D. Meflah K. McIlroy D. Gregoire M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2003; 52: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The phenotype of these DCs was verified by immunostaining with antibodies specific for immature and mature DCs. Macrophages were derived from CD14+ blood monocytes by culturing these cells for 7–12 days in medium supplemented with 5% human AB serum (Omega).Cytokine Stimulation—To study potential changes in A3G expression over time, freshly isolated CD14– PBLs were preincubated overnight at an approximate density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in medium and then stimulated with IL-2 (50 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), IL-7 (62.5 ng/ml), IL-9 (50 ng/ml), IL-15 (12.5 ng/ml), or PHA (5 μg/ml). All cytokines were purchased from R&D Systems. Samples were collected 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 120, and 168 h following treatment and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR to assess changes in A3G mRNA levels or by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-human A3G-specific antibody to detect changes in protein expression (19Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Dose-response experiments with these cytokines as well as with IL-4, IL-12, and IL-13 (R&D Systems) were performed similarly with samples collected at 48 h for real-time PCR analysis and at 120 h for immunoblotting studies. The potential effects of interferon on A3G expression were studied in macrophages treated with interferon-α (1000 units/ml; Schering-plough, intron a); interferon-β (1000 units/ml; R&D Systems), or interferon-γ (1000 units/ml; R&D Systems). For the kinase inhibitor experiments, CD14– PBLs were pretreated for 1 h with 12.5, 50, or 100 μm AG490 (Calbiochem) or 2.5, 10, or 20 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling) before being stimulated with the indicated cytokine or PMA. To analyze A3G complexes in cytokine-treated cells, freshly isolated CD4+ T cells were treated with the indicated cytokine or mitogen for 5 days, washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed before analysis by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) as described below.Immunoblotting—Harvested cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in lysis buffer (LB; containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)) or, for the phosphorylation studies, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaVO3, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). After clarification of the lysates, protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). An equal amount of lysate protein from different samples was loaded in individual lanes of 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by electrophoretic separation of proteins. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes followed by immunoblotting with anti-A3G antibodies (19Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), anti-ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), or anti-PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The specificity of the anti-A3G antibody has been described previously (41Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2005; 21: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Membranes were subsequently stripped and re-probed with anti-β-actin antibodies (Sigma) to compare protein loading.Quantitative Real-time PCR—A3G mRNA transcripts were assayed using quantitative kinetic reverse transcription PCR methodology (Applied Biosystems) and Taqman chemistry (Roche Applied Science). Total RNA was extracted from pelleted cells with RNeasy (Qiagen) and subjected to on-column DNasing prior to elution of the purified RNA. A portion of the RNA was reverse-transcribed and subjected to real-time PCR with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). A quantification standard prepared by run-off in vitro transcription of a molecular clone containing the A3G open reading frame was assayed along with the cellular RNAs and used to construct a standard curve. Total RNA concentrations in the extracts were measured on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), and A3G mRNA was reported as copies per nanogram of total RNA.Infection and Sorting of CD4+ T Cells—Reporter ppt-GFP viruses were produced by calcium phosphate transfection of HEK 293T cells with VSV-G envelope expression plasmid (provided by Dr. J. Burns, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA), the packaging construct CMVR8.2 (provided by Dr. D. Trono, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland and described in Ref. 42Naldini L.

Freshly purified CD4+ T cells were stimulated with PHA for 24 h, followed by stimulation with IL-2 for an additional 72 h, and then infected with vsv-g ppt-GFP virus. Cells were harvested 24–48 h later and sorted according to GFP positivity using a FACS DiVa (BD Biosciences) instrument. The GFP positive, GFP negative, or unsorted fractions were then either 1) washed, lysed in LB, and analyzed by FPLC or 2) stained for CD3, CD4, CD25, or CD69 positivity with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCaliber instrument (BD Biosciences). The data were acquired with CellQuest software and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).Analysis of A3G HMM and LMM Complexes by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography—FPLC analysis was performed as described previously (14Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD4+ T cells or DCs were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in LB. Lysates were applied to a calibrated Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column attached to an FPLC apparatus (AKTA, Amersham Biosciences). The FPLC running buffer consisted of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. One column volume (24 ml) was collected in 1-ml fractions.RESULTSA3G Is Induced by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15—A range of individual cytokines was first tested to assess whether any altered the expression of A3G in primary CD14– PBLs. Cells were cultured for up to 120 h with four doses of each cytokine. Lysates were then prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-human A3G antibodies. IL-2 (5, 12.5, 25, 50 ng/ml) and IL-15 (1, 5, 12.5, 25 ng/ml) consistently induced moderate up-regulation of A3G protein expression (Fig. 1A). Treatment with IL-7 (1, 12.5, 25, 62.5 ng/ml) also produced an increase in A3G protein expression at this time point (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting with anti-β-actin antibodies confirmed comparable protein loading (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of the cells with IL-4 (5, 12.5, 25, 50 ng/ml), IL-6 (5, 12.5, 25, 50 ng/ml), IL-9 (5, 12.5, 25, 50 ng/ml), IL-12 (0.4, 1, 2, 4 ng/ml), or IL-13 (2, 5, 10, 20 ng/ml) did not significantly alter levels of A3G expression (Fig. 1A). All of the cytokines were biologically active based on their ability to stimulate STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Three independent experiments were performed with three different donors, and the protein bands were quantitated with Scion Image 1.63c software. A3G protein was enhanced in PBLs treated with IL-2 (∼3.5-fold) or IL-15 (∼4-fold), whereas a lesser increase (∼2-fold) was observed in PBLs treated with IL-7 (Fig. 1B).When changes in A3G protein expression were monitored over time, IL-2 and IL-15 enhanced expression as early as 12–18 h (Fig. 1C). The response to these cytokines peaked after 48 h and persisted for 120–168 h (Fig. 1C). The time course following PHA stimulation was similar (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IL-7 required more than 48 h of stimulation to enhance A3G expression, and this response did not peak until 7 days after initial stimulation (Fig. 1C). A3G protein levels in the mock- and IL-6-treated samples remained constant over the entire time course (Fig. 1C). Together, these findings demonstrate that IL-2 and IL-15 enhance A3G expression in primary PBLs as early as 12 h after stimulation, with a peak response occurring ∼48 h after stimulation. IL-7 also increased A3G expression, but induction by this cytokine occurred with much slower kinetics and could be the result of an indirect pathway.Interferon Treatment of Monocyte-derived Macrophages, but Not PBLs, Results in Enhanced A3G Expression—We next assessed the regulation of A3G protein levels in monocyte-derived macrophages. A3G is recruited into a HMM complex when monocytes differentiate into macrophages, likely contributing to the enhanced permissivity of these cells to HIV infection (14Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Macrophages contain significantly less A3G protein than do monocytes relative to total levels of protein and β-actin (Fig. 1D). However, when macrophages were treated with interferon-α, -β, or -γ, A3G protein levels markedly increased, almost achieving the level found in monocytes (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that, at least in macrophages, A3G may form part of the interferon response to viral infection. Similar induction of A3G expression by interferon-α and -γ has recently been described by Peng et al. (43Peng G. Lei K.J. Jin W. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When PBLs were treated with interferon-α, -β, -γ, or both -α and -γ, no effect on A3G protein expression was observed, despite an increase in PKR expression (Fig. 1E). These results highlight differences in the inducible A3G response in macrophages and PBLs.Enhanced A3G Protein Expression in PBLs Correlates with Higher Levels of A3G mRNA and Is Not the Result of Enhanced mRNA Stability—A3G mRNA levels in the same PBLs treated with the same doses of cytokine shown in Fig. 1A were assessed by quantitative real time PCR. At 48 h, IL-2 induced an ∼8-fold increase in A3G mRNA at the highest dose (50 ng/ml), whereas the highest dose of IL-15 (25 ng/ml) stimulated an ∼4-fold increase in A3G mRNA (Fig. 2A). IL-7 caused an increase in A3G mRNA but displayed greater donor-to-donor variability at this time point, likely because IL-7 effects require more than 48 h to become manifest in most donors (Fig. 2A). When A3G mRNA levels were analyzed over time, IL-2 and IL-15 induced up-regulation of A3G mRNA as early as 6 h after treatment, whereas the effects of IL-7 were slower and less pronounced (Fig. 2, B–D). A3G mRNA levels in the mock-, IL-6-, and IL-9-treated samples remained relatively unchanged over the entire time course (Fig. 2E). To assess whether the observed increase in A3G mRNA was due to increased synthesis of mRNA or increased stability of mRNA transcripts, PBLs were stimulated with either IL-2 or IL-15 to enhance A3G mRNA levels and then tracked over time for the persistence of these transcripts after inhibiting new mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D. A3G mRNA transcripts in the IL-2- and IL-15-treated samples decayed at a rate similar to that of the mock-treated sample, indicating that increased mRNA synthesis, and not enhanced mRNA stability, likely underlies the observed increase in A3G expression (Fig. 2, F and G). Rose et al. (33Rose K.M. Marin M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41744-41749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) similarly found that PMA stimulation of H9 leukemic T cells stimulates increased A3G mRNA synthesis with no effect on mRNA stability. Our findings highlight the ability of IL-2 and IL-15 to activate de novo A3G gene expression in primary PBLs.FIGURE 2Induction of A3G mRNA expression by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. A, effects of cytokines on expression of A3G mRNA. Samples were treated identically to those in Fig. 1A but were collected 48 h after treatment for analysis of A3G mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR. The data reflects the results from three independent experiments using three different donors. Error bars representing S.D. data from three donors were included. B–E, effects of cytokines on expression of A3G mRNA over time. Samples were treated identically to those in Fig. 1C and then harvested and subjected to analysis of A3G mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR. The results presented reflect samples taken from a single donor and are representative of results obtained from three independent donors. F and G, CD14– PBLs were incubated with IL-2 (50 ng/ml) (F) or IL-15 (12.5 ng/ml) (G) for 24 h before being treated with actinomycin D (Act D, 5 μg/ml) at t = 0. Samples were collected at the indicated times and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for A3G mRNA expression. The results are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation of A3G Expression Is Sensitive to Inhibitors of the Janus Kinase (JAK) and MAPK Signaling Pathways—Although IL-2 and IL-15 play distinct roles in immunologic responses, they also share some o"

Its mode of action against malarial parasites, however, has remained undefined. Our in vitro investigations with the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum document a remarkable increase in AZ potency when exposure is prolonged from one to two generations of intraerythrocytic growth, with AZ producing 50% inhibition of parasite growth at concentrations in the mid to low nanomolar range. In our culture-adapted lines, AZ displayed no synergy with chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine, or artesunate. AZ activity was also unaffected by mutations in the pfcrt (P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter) or pfmdr1 (P. falciparum multidrug resistance-1) drug resistance loci, as determined using transgenic lines. We have selected mutant, AZ-resistant 7G8 and Dd2 parasite lines. In the AZ-resistant 7G8 line, the bacterial-like apicoplast large subunit ribosomal RNA harbored a U438C mutation in domain I. Both AZ-resistant lines revealed a G76V mutation in a conserved region of the apicoplast-encoded P. falciparum ribosomal protein L4 (PfRpl4). This protein is predicted to associate with the nuclear genome-encoded P. falciparum ribosomal protein L22 (PfRpl22) and the large subunit rRNA to form the 50 S ribosome polypeptide exit tunnel that can be occupied by AZ. The PfRpl22 sequence remained unchanged. Molecular modeling of mutant PfRpl4 with AZ suggests an altered orientation of the L75 side chain that could preclude AZ binding. These data imply that AZ acts on the apicoplast bacterial-like translation machinery and identify Pfrpl4 as a potential marker of resistance.

Licensed antibiotics with antimalarial activity offer considerable promise as suitable partners for novel combination therapies directed against drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections. Clinical studies have demonstrated good clinical cure rates with treatments that use tetracycline, its more potent derivative doxycycline, or clindamycin, in combination with fast-acting antimalarials such as quinine (1White N.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 2Lell B. Kremsner P.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2315-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Baird J.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1565-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Whereas the mode of action of these antibiotics has until recently remained elusive for Plasmodium, against bacteria they act by binding to the 70 S ribosome (comprised of the 50 S and 30 S subunits), thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Tetracycline and doxycycline bind to the 30 S subunit (comprising the 16 S rRNA and ribosomal proteins), whereas clindamycin binds to the 50 S subunit (comprising the 23 S rRNA, the 5 S rRNA, and ribosomal proteins including L4 and L22) (4Poehlsgaard J. Douthwaite S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The World Health Organization recommends doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis for travelers to endemic areas. Tetracycline and doxycycline, however, manifest toxicity in children below the age of eight and in pregnant women, effectively precluding their use in the most important malaria patient populations (5Kain K.C. Shanks G.D. Keystone J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 33: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Another antibiotic that appears particularly promising for antimalarial combination therapy is azithromycin (AZ), 2The abbreviations used are: AZ, azithromycin; CQ, chloroquine; FIC50, fractional IC50; SP, signal peptide; LSU, large subunit; CI, confidence interval; DV, digestive vacuole; ACP, acyl-carrier protein. a 15-membered azalide that has been broadly used for the treatment of streptococcal, staphylococcal, chlamydial, and gonorrheal infections. Notably, AZ displays a good safety profile for young children and pregnant women (6Girard A.E. Girard D. English A.R. Gootz T.D. Cimochowski C.R. Faiella J.A. Haskell S.L. Retsema J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This semisynthetic second-generation antibiotic was derived from its parent compound erythromycin by introducing a methyl-substituted nitrogen group at position C-9 of the lactone ring, resulting in several improved features. These include a broader spectrum of activity, more favorable pharmacodynamics, and a longer elimination half-life. This extended half-life has been attributed to AZ concentrating inside lysosomes in phagocytic cells, as a result of protonation of its two basic amine groups (7Retsema J. Girard A. Schelkly W. Manousos M. Anderson M. Bright G. Borovoy R. Brennan L. Mason R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), followed by AZ leaching out into the bloodstream over a period of several days to a week. This provides effective therapeutic coverage with AZ for several days post-completion of treatment. Against bacteria, AZ acts by binding reversibly to the 50 S ribosomal subunit, in the vicinity of the peptidyltransferase center in domain V and the entrance of the polypeptide tunnel (4Poehlsgaard J. Douthwaite S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This binding site is formed by the association of domains II and V of the bacterial 23 S rRNA and includes the ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 that line the protein exit tunnel (8Hansen L.H. Mauvais P. Douthwaite S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Douthwaite S. Hansen L.H. Mauvais P. Mol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). AZ binding interferes with transpeptidation/translocation of nascent polypeptides exiting the polypeptide tunnel, leading to premature detachment of incomplete peptide chains and subsequent cell death (11Retsema J. Fu W. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2001; 18: S3-S10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hansen J.L. Ippolito J.A. Ban N. Nissen P. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Mol.

Structure. 2003; 11: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). AZ activity against malarial parasites was initially discovered by in vitro testing of chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive and CQ-resistant P. falciparum lines (14Gingras B.A. Jensen J.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1992; 47: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Gingras B.A. Jensen J.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 49: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed a slow onset of parasite killing, similar to tetracycline, doxycycline, and clindamycin (16Yeo A.E. Rieckmann K.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vitro screening for potential drug combinations was suggestive of additive to synergistic interactions with AZ-CQ as well as AZ-quinine combinations in some CQ-resistant P. falciparum strains (17Ohrt C. Willingmyre G.D. Lee P. Knirsch C. Milhous W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2518-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Against CQ-sensitive strains, the effect was additive. In vivo studies, initially conducted in mice infected with blood stage Plasmodium berghei parasites, also showed good treatment efficacy with AZ monotherapy. This efficacy was enhanced by combining AZ with the fast-acting blood schizonticidal agents CQ, quinine, artemisinin, or halofantrine (15Gingras B.A. Jensen J.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 49: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Andersen S.L. Ager A. McGreevy P. Schuster B.G. Wesche D. Kuschner R. Ohrt C. Ellis W. Rossan R. Berman J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 52: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AZ curative blood schizonticidal efficacy was also confirmed in Aotus monkeys infected with CQ-resistant P. falciparum (18Andersen S.L. Ager A. McGreevy P. Schuster B.G. Wesche D. Kuschner R. Ohrt C. Ellis W. Rossan R. Berman J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 52: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence that AZ was clinically effective in treating P. falciparum malaria in humans came from pilot studies showing that AZ monotherapy was an effective prophylactic agent (19Kuschner R.A. Heppner D.G. Andersen S.L. Wellde B.T. Hall T. Schneider I. Ballou W.R. Foulds G. Sadoff J.C. Schuster B. Taylor D.N.

Med. 1995; 123: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A more recent treatment trial in India reported close to 100% cure rates in patients treated with AZ plus CQ, with this combination proving to be far more effective than monotherapy with the individual agents (21Dunne M.W. Singh N. Shukla M. Valecha N. Bhattacharyya P.C. Dev V. Patel K. Mohapatra M.K. Lakhani J. Benner R. Lele C. Patki K. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1582-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). High levels of treatment efficacy were also observed in a recent trial from Thailand that studied regimes of combining AZ with quinine or artesunate (22Noedl H. Krudsood S. Chalermratana K. Silachamroon U. Leowattana W. Tangpukdee N. Looareesuwan S. Miller R.S. Fukuda M. Jongsakul K. Sriwichai S. Rowan J. Bhattacharyya H. Ohrt C. Knirsch C. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2006; 43: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A monotherapy trial in India also found AZ to be well tolerated and highly effective in treating Plasmodium vivax malaria (23Dunne M.W. Singh N. Shukla M. Valecha N. Bhattacharyya P.C. Patel K. Mohapatra M.K. Lakhani J. Devi C.U. Adak T. Dev V. Yadav R.S. Lele C. Patki K. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2005; 73: 1108-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The proven antimalarial efficacy observed with AZ has made it important to define its mode of action against malarial parasites. One pressing question is whether AZ, a weak base, acts inside the parasite digestive vacuole (DV), a lysosomal-like acidic compartment (pH 5.0–5.4) where CQ and other weak base 4-aminoquinolines concentrate and act by interfering with heme detoxification (24Foley M. Tilley L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 55-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 25O'Neill P.M. Bray P.G. Hawley S.R. Ward S.A. Park B.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 29-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. Rosenthal P.J. Antimalarial Chemotherapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 43-63Google Scholar). Such an activity might account for earlier reports of AZ-CQ in vitro synergy (17Ohrt C. Willingmyre G.D. Lee P. Knirsch C. Milhous W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2518-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that AZ acts by inhibiting the bacterial-like protein synthesis machinery present in the Plasmodium apicoplast, an organelle of cyanobacterial origin that has been shown in the related Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii to be indispensable for parasite growth (27Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 29Ralph S.A. van Dooren G.G. Waller R.F. Crawford M.J. Fraunholz M.J. Foth B.J. Tonkin C.J. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we have investigated the efficacy of AZ alone or in combination with fast-acting antimalarials, the effect on AZ susceptibility of point mutations in DV transmembrane transporters, the selection of AZ-resistant parasite lines, and the molecular mechanisms that can cause AZ resistance. Our results directly implicate the apicoplast 50 S ribosomal subunit as the target of AZ in P. falciparum. Parasite Culture and in Vitro Antimalarial Drug Assays—P. falciparum parasites were cultured in vitro in human red blood cells as described (30Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Antimalarial susceptibilities were measured in 96-well plates over 48 or 96 h of exposure with an initial parasitemia of 0.5 or 0.2% synchronized ring stage parasites, respectively. Drug IC50 values (producing 50% inhibition of [3H]hypoxanthine uptake) were derived by linear regression from the dose-response curves (30Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). In the 48-h drug assays, parasites were exposed to drug for 30 h, and 0.5 μCi of radiolabeled [3H]hypoxanthine was added to each well for the last 18 h. In the 96-h drug assays, media was replaced after 48 and 72 h, and [3H]hypoxanthine was added at the 72-h time point (0.5 μCi/well). Media replacements contained appropriate amounts of drug to ensure that drug concentrations remained constant in each well throughout the duration of the assay. To test the interaction of AZ with other drugs, each drug was tested alone and in combination at fixed ratios of its IC50 value, as calculated separately for each assay (AZ, test drug ratios of 0:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:1, 3:1, 5:1 and 1:0). Fractional IC50 (FIC50) values from 96-h assays were calculated as previously described (32Ohrt C. Richie T.L. Widjaja H. Shanks G.D. Fitriadi J. Fryauff D.J. Handschin J. Tang D. Sandjaja B. Tjitra E. Hadiarso L. Watt G. Wignall F.S. Ann. Intern. Med. 1997; 126: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and used to plot isobolograms. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests were performed for statistical comparisons. AZ dihydrate (CP-62,993-03) was obtained from Pfizer. Thiostrepton, tetracycline, doxycycline, and erythromycin were purchased from Calbiochem, whereas triclosan and CQ were purchased from Sigma. Selection of AZ-resistant P. falciparum Lines—P. falciparum lines were selected for resistance to AZ using the following regime. First, we exposed Dd2 and 7G8 parasites (5 × 1010 each) to 38 and 115 nm AZ, respectively (i.e. 30 and 90 ng/ml of AZ dihydrate), for 3 days with twice daily feeding. We then increased the drug concentration to 380 nm for both lines and maintained this level for 4 days. For the following 15 days Dd2 and 7G8 parasite lines were again maintained at 38 and 115 nm AZ, respectively. Giemsa-stained thin blood films were examined every 2 to 3 days to check for viable asexual-stage parasites. Once a week, 30–40% of the culture was replaced with freshly drawn red blood cells. For both lines, AZ-resistant ring stage parasites were observed by day 21. Once the parasitemias reached 2–3%, parasites were phenotypically characterized for their drug response profiles using [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assays. Dd2 and 7G8 AZ-resistant parasite lines (termed AZ-RDd2 and AZ-R7G8, respectively) were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution (33Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and cultured in the presence of 640 and 1280 nm AZ, respectively. DNA Constructs and Sequencing—A 1.0-kb DNA fragment encompassing the open reading frame of the P. falciparum apicoplast-encoded ortholog of the rpl4 ribosomal protein gene (denoted Pfrpl4; GenBank™ accession number X95276) was PCR amplified from the wild-type and AZ-resistant parasite lines using primers p1083 (5′-AATGGTAACATATCTATTTTGGGAATAGA) and p1084 (5′-AATTTCCACCTCCTTTATTTAATAGTA). This fragment was used in nested PCR with internal primers p1112 (5′-TTatcgatAATATTATTATTTTAAATAATAATACA; ClaI site in lowercase) and p1111 (5′-AcgtacgAATTAAAAATATTAAATAATTATACATAAT (BsiWI site in lowercase) to amplify a full-length 0.6-kb coding sequence fragment lacking only the ATG start and TAA stop codons. Amplified products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using T7 and M13-reverse primers (Invitrogen). For the transfection studies, sequence-verified Pfrpl4 inserts were subcloned into the ClaI and BsiWI restriction sites of the expression plasmid pLN-ACP-V5. This plasmid, based on pLN (34Nkrumah L.N. Muhle R.A. Moura P.A. Ghosh P. Hatfull G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Fidock D.A. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), contains a 180-bp sequence encoding the N-terminal bipartite leader sequence of the fatty acid synthase acyl-carrier protein (ACP), used to target proteins to the apicoplast (35Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), as well as a 3′ sequence encoding a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST). The final construct, termed pLN-ACP-Pfrpl4-V5 (supplemental Fig. 1), contained mutant or wild-type Pfrpl4 fused at its 5′ end to the ACP leader sequence and at its 3′ end to the V5 tag. This fusion gene is regulated by a 1.0-kb calmodulin 5′-untranslated region and a 0.8-kb hsp86 3′-untranslated region. Related constructs were made that replaced the 3′ V5 tag with a GFP-Mut2 (green fluorescent protein) sequence, creating the pLN-ACP-Pfrpl4-GFP plasmid. From these plasmids, we derived pLN-SP-Pfrpl4-V5 and pLN-SP-Pfrpl4-GFP by replacing the full-length ACP apicoplast targeting sequence with a 57-bp signal peptide (SP) sequence from the ACP gene. All of these constructs were also made with a 0.9-kb hsp86 5′-untranslated region fragment in place of the calmodulin 5′-untranslated region. This resulted in 16 constructs, which were all transfected into Dd2 parasites. The calmodulin promoter series of constructs were also transfected into 3D7 and GC03 parasites. Transfections were carried out as previously described (36Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and recombinant lines were selected using 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin hydrochloride. The 0.9-kb full-length P. falciparum nuclear genome-encoded ortholog of the rpl22 ribosomal protein gene (Pfrpl22; PlasmoDB ID number PF14_0642) was PCR amplified using p1429 (5′-TAATGATATTGCGCAAGTGTTGATTTGT) and p1432 (5′-GTACATAAATATATACACATTTAATTTTTAACAAACGGA). The apicoplast large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene (GenBank accession number X95275) was PCR amplified as a 2.9-kb fragment with primers p986 (5′-GCGAAATAGAGCATAAGGAAAGTTCG) and p800 (5′-AGCTAATGGTGAGATTTGAACT). PCR fragments were gel purified and fully sequenced on both strands using internal primers. Structural Modeling—Sequences and structures of ribosomal L4 proteins were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out at the SDSC workbench using CLUSTAL W (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55752) Google Scholar). The model of the PfRpl4 conserved loop from Lys57 to Pro97 was built with MODELLER (38Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar). As templates, we used the Escherichia coli and Deinococcus radiodurans L4 proteins, which share 39 and 32% sequence identity with PfRpl4 in this loop region. The AZ molecule in the D. radiodurans ribosome structure (13Schlunzen F. Harms J.M. Franceschi F. Hansen H.A. Bartels H. Zarivach R. Yonath A. Structure. 2003; 11: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) also served as a ligand for modeling. The loop of the PfRpl4 G76V mutant was also built using MODELLER with all three wild-type protein structures as templates. The quality of these models was evaluated with DOPE potential (39Melo F. Sanchez R. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 430-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their superimposition and rendering were carried out with PyMol. AZ Displays Extraordinary Increases in Potency against P. falciparum Strains Exposed for a Second Generation of Growth as Compared with Thiostrepton, Triclosan, and CQ—A previous study with two P. falciparum lines observed an 80–220-fold increased potency when the duration of AZ exposure was prolonged from 48 to 96 h (16Yeo A.E. Rieckmann K.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We extended this observation to other multidrug-resistant and drug-sensitive lines and compared the effect to that of other antimalarial agents that share similar modes of action or are in clinical use. The lines chosen were Dd2 (Indochina; resistant to CQ, quinine, pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine), 7G8 (Brazil; resistant to CQ and pyrimethamine), and GC03 (a CQ-sensitive progeny of the HB3 × Dd2 genetic cross (40Wellems T.E.

Comparative antimalarial agents included thiostrepton (which targets the GTPase site of the apicoplast LSU rRNA (41McConkey G.A. Rogers M.J. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol.

Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yuthavong Y. Fidock D.A. Sherman I. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2005: 429-461Google Scholar)). A comparative profile of responses to each compound for these parasite lines is presented as IC50 values in Fig. 1. After 48 h, Dd2, 7G8, and GCO3 displayed AZ IC50 values of 3.5, 15.7, and 18.1 μm, respectively, whereas after 96 h these values decreased to 103, 190, and 77 nm, respectively (supplementary Table 1). This translated into a substantial 34-, 83-, and 234-fold increase in AZ potency resulting from a second generation of parasite exposure. In comparison, these lines had thiostrepton IC50 values of 377, 521, and 917 nm, respectively, after 96 h, corresponding to more modest 4.5-, 1.3-, and 2.5-fold increases in susceptibility. In 96-h assays with these same lines, the triclosan IC50 values were 4186, 424, and 1526 nm, and CQ IC50 values were 134, 113, and 24 nm, respectively. This corresponded to 1.0–2.0-fold increases in triclosan or CQ susceptibility. These results indicate that AZ becomes a highly active antimalarial that manifests its potency after a second generation of parasite intraerythrocytic growth. This increase in potency far exceeds other agents that also presumably target apicoplast pathways, including in the case of thiostrepton presumably the same ribosomal subunit involved in protein synthesis. AZ Is Not Synergistic with CQ, Amodiaquine, or Artesunate— To investigate the antimalarial activity of AZ in combination with CQ, 96-h combination drug assays were performed using the CQ-resistant P. falciparum lines Dd2, 7G8, and 3BA6 (the latter is a CQ-resistant progeny of the HB3 × Dd2 cross). From these, FIC50 values were determined and isobolograms were derived and plotted. As illustrated in Fig. 2, this combination appeared essentially additive for Dd2 (mean FIC50 value: 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10–1.69) and 3BA6 (mean FIC50 value: 1.38, 95% CI, 1.22–1.55) and was also additive for 7G8 (mean FIC50 value: 1.05, 95% CI, 1.02–1.08). We also assayed the TM90C6A and TM90C6B Thai isolates that have been more recently adapted to in vitro culture (46Looareesuwan S. Viravan C. Webster H.K. Kyle D.E. Hutchinson D.B. Canfield C.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 54: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). AZ-CQ combination assays performed with these lines also found no evidence for synergy (TM90C6A mean FIC50 value, 1.35, 95% CI, 1.25–1.45; TM90C6B mean FIC50 value, 1.15, 95% CI, 1.04–1.25; Fig. 2). In view of the decline of CQ as a first-line antimalarial and the increasing interest in the use of amodiaquine or artesunate as alternative antimalarials (notably for combination therapy), we also assayed AZ-amodiaquine and AZ-artesunate combinations with the drug-resistant Dd2 and 7G8 lines. In 96-h combination assays, mean FIC50 values for AZ-amodiaquine were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.01–1.56) and 1.23 (95% CI, 0.87–1.58), whereas mean FIC50 values for AZ-artesunate were 1.62 (95% CI, 1.02–2.22) and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.14–1.54) against Dd2 and 7G8 parasite lines, respectively (data not shown). Thus, these assays found no evidence of in vitro synergy between AZ and either of these drugs. Parasite Susceptibility to AZ Is Not Influenced by Mutations in the DV Transmembrane Proteins PfCRT and PfMDR1—We assessed whether P. falciparum susceptibility to AZ in vitro could be influenced by point mutations in the DV transmembrane proteins PfCRT or PfMDR1 (the latter is also known as Pgh1). This was for several reasons. First, genetic studies have demonstrated that mutant forms of these proteins can affect parasite in vitro susceptibility to a wide range of antimalarials, including CQ, quinine, mefloquine, halofantrine, and the anti-influenzal agent amantadine (47Fidock D.A.

Second, there is a published report of AZ-CQ synergism that raised the possibility of their sharing a related mode of action (17Ohrt C. Willingmyre G.D. Lee P. Knirsch C. Milhous W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2518-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Third, AZ, like CQ, is a weak base that could be predicted to accumulate in the acidic P. falciparum DV (where CQ also accumulates and exerts its antimalarial property (54Saliba K.J. Folb P.I. Smith P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). We thus took advantage of existing recombinant lines that had been genetically modified to express mutant forms of either protein (50Sidhu A.B. Verdier-Pinard D. Fidock D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2058237916,"Lunar soils have been thought to contain two solar noble gas components with distinct isotopic composition. One has been identified as implanted solar wind, the other as higher-energy solar particles. The latter was puzzling because its relative amounts were much too large compared with present-day fluxes, suggesting periodic, very high solar activity in the past. Here we show that the depth-dependent isotopic composition of neon in a metallic glass exposed on NASA's Genesis mission agrees with the expected depth profile for solar wind neon with uniform isotopic composition. Our results strongly indicate that no extra high-energy component is required and that the solar neon isotope composition of lunar samples can be explained as implantation-fractionated solar wind."

By conducting experiments in natural environments, biologists can study how evolutionary processes such as natural selection operate through time. We predicted that the introduction of a terrestrial predator would first select for longer-legged lizards, which are faster, but as the lizards shifted onto high twigs to avoid the predator, selection would reverse toward favoring the shorter-legged individuals better able to locomote there. Our experimental studies on 12 islets confirmed these predictions within a single generation, thus demonstrating the rapidity with which evolutionary forces can change during times of environmental flux."
https://openalex.org/W2161567251,"Replicative life span in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is increased by glucose (Glc) limitation [calorie restriction (CR)] and by augmented NAD+. Increased survival promoted by CR was attributed previously to the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase activity of sirtuin family protein Sir2p but not to changes in redox state. Here we show that strains defective in NAD+ synthesis and salvage pathways (pnc1delta, npt1delta, and bna6delta) exhibit decreased oxygen consumption and increased mitochondrial H2O2 release, reversed over time by CR. These null mutant strains also present decreased chronological longevity in a manner rescued by CR. Furthermore, we observed that changes in mitochondrial H2O2 release alter cellular redox state, as attested by measurements of total, oxidized, and reduced glutathione. Surprisingly, our results indicate that matrix-soluble dihydrolipoyl-dehydrogenases are an important source of CR-preventable mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, deletion of the LPD1 gene prevented oxidative stress in npt1delta and bna6delta mutants. Furthermore, pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate, substrates for dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase-containing enzymes, promoted pronounced reactive oxygen release in permeabilized wild-type mitochondria. Altogether, these results substantiate the concept that mitochondrial ROS can be limited by caloric restriction and play an important role in S. cerevisiae senescence. Furthermore, these findings uncover dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase as an important and novel source of ROS leading to life span limitation."

In the developing fly wing, a gradient of the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β)–type morphogen decapentaplegic (Dpp) is transduced into a gradient of concentration of the phosphorylated form of the R-Smad transcription factor Mad. The endosomal protein Sara (Smad anchor for receptor activation) recruits R-Smads for phosphorylation by the type I TGF-β receptor. We found that Sara, Dpp, and its type I receptor Thickveins were targeted to a subpopulation of apical endosomes in the developing wing epithelial cells. During mitosis, the Sara endosomes and the receptors therein associated with the spindle machinery to segregate into the two daughter cells. Daughter cells thereby inherited equal amounts of signaling molecules and thus retained the Dpp signaling levels of the mother cell."

By using our novel immunoassay, the normal and/or diseased skin, breast, prostate, and ovary contained the highest concentration of KLK14. Serum KLK14 levels were significantly elevated in prostate cancer patients compared with healthy males. KLK14 displayed trypsin-like specificity with high selectivity for P1-Arg over Lys.

Thus, KLK14 represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for several pathologic conditions. As with all S1A family SP, KLK14 is synthesized as an inactive precursor or zymogen (herein denoted pro-KLK14), containing a 6-amino acid N-terminal pro-peptide that maintains its latency (7Yousef G.M. Magklara A. Chang A. Jung K. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3425-3431PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hooper J.D. Bui L.T. Rae F.K. Harvey T.J. Myers S.A. Ashworth L.K. Clements J.A. Genomics. 2001; 73: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proteolytic removal of the pro-peptide at Lys24–Ile25 is required to generate active KLK14, a process that may be performed by KLK5 (19Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 198-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of Asp198 in its S1 binding pocket (7Yousef G.M. Magklara A.

Genomics. 2001; 73: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), KLK14 is predicted to exert trypsin-like substrate specificity with a preference for basic P1 residues (Schechter and Berger nomenclature (20Schechter I.

Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4793) Google Scholar) is used to describe the interaction between protease subsites (Sn-S1;S1′–Sn′) and corresponding substrate residues (Pn-P1;P1′–Pn′), where P1–P1′ denotes the scissile bond). However, we (21Felber L.M. Borgono C.A. Cloutier S.M. Kundig C. Kishi T. Ribeiro C.J. Jichlinski P. Gygi C.M. Leisinger H.J. Diamandis E.P. Deperthes D. Biol.

Hence, KLK14 manifests dual, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like, substrate specificity. To date, putative biological substrates and (patho)physiological roles for KLK14 have been inferred from its expression pattern, substrate specificity, and the known function of co-localized KLKs. Phage-displayed pentapeptide motifs preferred by KLK14 were identified within several intact proteins, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules laminin, collagen type IV, and matrilin-4 (21Felber L.M.

The latter may support a role for KLK14 in cancer progression via ECM digestion, particularly in breast, ovarian, and prostate tumors that bear elevated KLK14 levels. Because of its presence and prominent activity in the stratum corneum of the skin (13Stefansson K. Brattsand M. Ny A. Glas B. Egelrud T. Biol.

More recently, our group has reported that KLK14 may also mediate pleiotropic effects by signaling through proteinase-activated receptors 1, 2, and 4 (22Oikonomopoulou K. Hansen K.K. Saifeddine M. Tea I. Blaber M. Blaber S.I. Scarisbrick I. Andrade-Gordon P. Cottrell G.S. Bunnett N.W. Diamandis E.P. Hollenberg M.D. J. Biol.

KLK14 may exercise its functions alone or in a proteolytic cascade pathway, as KLK5 may activate pro-KLK14 and vice versa (19Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 198-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Collectively, studies on KLK14 reveal that this novel SP may play important (patho)physiological roles at the main sites of its expression and bears clinical utility. To gain further insights into the biological significance of KLK14 action, this study examines KLK14 expression, specificity, activity against candidate substrates, and several modes of regulation. Mature KLK14—Mature recombinant KLK14 was produced in the Easyselect™ Pichia pastoris expression system (Invitrogen), as described previously (21Felber L.M. Borgono C.A. Cloutier S.M. Kundig C. Kishi T. Ribeiro C.J. Jichlinski P. Gygi C.M. Leisinger H.J. Diamandis E.P. Deperthes D. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR-amplified KLK14 cDNA encoding the mature enzyme form of KLK14 (amino acids 25–251 based on GenBank™ accession number AAK48524) was cloned into P. pastoris expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites between the 5′ promoter and the 3′ terminator of the AOX1 gene, in-frame with the yeast α-mating factor (for secretion), using standard techniques. The PmeI-linearized pPICZαA-KLK14 construct was transformed into chemically competent P. pastoris yeast strains X-33, GS115, and KM71. A stable X-33 transformant was selected, and recombinant KLK14 expression was induced with 1% methanol/day for 6 days at 30 °C in a shaking incubator (250 rpm). Mature recombinant KLK14 was purified to homogeneity from culture supernatant by a two-step procedure consisting of cation-exchange and affinity chromatography. Typically, 1 liter of culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and concentrated 20-fold by positive pressure ultrafiltration in an Amicon™ stirring chamber (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) with a 10-kDa cutoff nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The concentrated supernatant was diluted 1:4 in 10 mm MES (pH 5.3) and fractionated on a pre-equilibrated 5-ml cation-exchange HiTrap™ SP HP column (GE Healthcare), with the automatedÁKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Adsorbed KLK14 was eluted with a multistep salt gradient using 1 m KCl in 10 mm MES (pH 5.3) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min as follows: (a) continuous linear gradient of 0–0.3 m KCl for 17 min, (b) maintenance at 0.3 m KCl for 20 min, (c) followed by a continuous linear gradient from 0.3–1 m KCl for 50 min. Elution fractions (3 ml) containing KLK14 were identified (as described below), pooled, and concentrated using Biomax-10 Ultrafree®-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The concentrated fractions were diluted 1:4 in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) binding buffer and incubated with 1 ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then packed into an Econo-Pac open column (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with binding buffer. KLK14 was eluted with 0.1 m glycine buffer (pH 3.0). Pro-KLK14—First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by reverse transcriptase using the Superscript™ preamplification system (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of total human cerebellum RNA (Clontech) as a template. The cDNA encoding prepro-KLK14 (amino acids 1–251 based on GenBank™ accession number AAK48524) was PCR-amplified in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μl of cerebellum cDNA as a template, 100 ng of primers (forward, 5′ CACC ATG TTC CTC CTG CTG ACA GCA CTT; reverse, 5′ AGA CCA TCA TTT GTC CCG CAT CGT TTC CT, containing CACC sequence required for TOPO® cloning (underlined) and the native KLK14 stop codon (italics)), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 0.75 μl (2.6 units) of Expand Long Template PCR polymerase mix (Roche Diagnostics) on an Eppendorf master cycler (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles, and a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1™D/V5-His-TOPO® (Invitrogen) using the pcDNA3.1™ Directional TOPO® expression kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The KLK14 sequence within the construct, denoted pcDNA3.1-KLK14, was confirmed with an automated DNA sequencer using vector-specific primers in both directions. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) were stably transfected with 3 μg of PmeI-linearized pcDNA3.1-KLK14 by lipofection using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected HEK-293 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 48 h, cells were re-plated into 35-mm dishes, and the selection agent Geneticin (G418, 300 μg/ml final concentration; Invitrogen) was added. Resistant clones were chosen over 14 days under continuous G418 selection and cultured separately in 24 wells followed by 6-well plates. One clone, denoted P1–4, was selected for large scale expression of pro-KLK14 and grown in DMEM with 10% FBS until 80% confluency. At this stage, the media were replaced with serum-free CD Chinese hamster ovary media supplemented with GlutaMax™I (8 mm final concentration; Invitrogen). Conditioned media was collected by centrifugation after 10 days of incubation. Recombinant pro-KLK14 was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned serum-free media of HEK-293 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-KLK14 sequentially by cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography. Prior to purification, 1 liter of media was prepared as described above for yeast culture supernatant. Concentrated CM was diluted 1:4 in 10 mm MES (pH 5.3) and applied to a previously equilibrated 5-ml SP HP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), previously equilibrated with 10 mm MES (pH 5.3), on theÁKTA fast performance liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Pro-KLK14 was eluted with a multistep salt gradient of 1 m KCl in 10 mm MES (pH 5.3) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min as follows: (a) continuous linear gradient of 0–0.25 m KCl for 17 min, (b) maintenance at 0.25 m KCl for 33 min, (c) linear gradient of 0.25–0.35 m KCl for 8.3 min, (d) maintenance at 0.35 m KCl for 33 min, and (e) followed by a linear gradient of 0.35-0.8 M KCl for 33 min. Elution fractions (3 ml) were analyzed by our newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; described herein) and by detection methods mentioned below. Fractions containing pro-KLK14 were then pooled, concentrated, and supplemented with a final concentration of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O onto a 1-ml Vydac C4 reversed-phase column (The Separations Group, Inc., Hesperia, CA) connected to an Agilent series 1100 HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Palo Alto, CA). Elution was performed with a multistep acetonitrile (ACN) gradient at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min consisting of 5-min linear gradients of 20–25, 25–30, 30–32, 32–35, 35–40, and 40–100% ACN intervened by 15-min steps at 25, 30, 32, and 35% ACN. ACN was removed from each fraction by evaporation with nitrogen gas at a pressure of 15 p.s.i. For both recombinant KLK14 proteins, purity was assessed on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (described below). Concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce), and protein identity was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry, as described previously (23Luo L.Y. Grass L. Howarth D.J. Thibault P. Ong H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Proteins were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). To monitor recombinant KLK14 production, purification, and/or activity, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and zymography. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed using the NuPAGE BisTris electrophoresis system and precast 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 30 min (Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized with a Coomassie G-250 staining solution, SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen), and/or by silver staining with the Silver Xpress™ kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blots—For immunodetection of KLK14, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were subsequently transferred onto a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) at 30 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.1 mol/liter Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 mol/liter NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C and probed with a KLK14 polyclonal rabbit antibody (produced in-house; diluted 1:2000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times for 15 min with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were washed again as above, and fluorescence was detected on x-ray film using chemiluminescent substrate (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles). Zymography—The proteolytic activity of recombinant KLK14 proteins was visualized by gelatin zymography (Invitrogen). Recombinant KLK14 was diluted 1:1 in Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on precast Novex® 10% gelatin zymogram gels (Invitrogen) at 125 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The gels were subsequently incubated in zymogram renaturing buffer (Invitrogen) for two 30-min intervals at room temperature, followed by incubation in zymogram developing buffer (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 37°C. Gels were stained with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain and destained until the white lytic bands corresponding to areas of protease activity were visible. New Zealand White female rabbits and BALB/c female mice were repeatedly immunized with purified recombinant mature KLK14 (100 μg) for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody development, respectively. KLK14 was diluted 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant for the first injection and in incomplete Freund's adjuvant for subsequent injections. Injections were repeated three times for mice and six times for rabbits at 3-week intervals. The polyclonal sera were tested every 2 weeks by an immunofluorometric method described in detail elsewhere (10Borgono C.A. Grass L. Soosaipillai A. Yousef G.M. Petraki C.D. Howarth D.H. Fracchioli S. Katsaros D. Diamandis E.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 9032-9041PubMed Google Scholar), until the highest antibody titers against KLK14 were detected. Monoclonal antibodies against KLK14 were produced by standard hybridoma technology. The splenocytes from preselected immunized mice were fused with the Sp2/0 myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol 1500. The resultant hybridoma cells were cultured in 96-well plates in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 20% FBS, 200 mm glutamine, 1% OPI (oxaloacetic acid, pyruvic acid, insulin), and 2% HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine; Sigma) for selection at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 10–14 days. Hybridoma supernatants were collected and screened by an immunofluorometric technique described previously (24Obiezu C.V. Shan S.J. Soosaipillai A. Luo L.Y. Grass L. Sotiropoulou G. Petraki C.D.

https://openalex.org/W1985288684,"Son of sevenless (Sos) is a dual specificity guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates both Ras and Rho family GTPases and thus is uniquely poised to integrate signals that affect both gene expression and cytoskeletal reorganization. Here, using genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology, we demonstrate that Sos is recruited to the plasma membrane, where it forms a ternary complex with the Roundabout receptor and the SH3-SH2 adaptor protein Dreadlocks (Dock) to regulate Rac-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement in response to the Slit ligand. Intriguingly, the Ras and Rac-GEF activities of Sos can be uncoupled during Robo-mediated axon repulsion; Sos axon guidance function depends on its Rac-GEF activity, but not its Ras-GEF activity. These results provide in vivo evidence that the Ras and RhoGEF domains of Sos are separable signaling modules and support a model in which Robo recruits Sos to the membrane via Dock to activate Rac during midline repulsion."

https://openalex.org/W2088257639,"Transcription factor function can be modulated by post-translational modifications. Because the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β associates with the nuclear coactivator p300, which contains acetyltransferase activity, acetylation of C/EBPβ was examined to understand its regulation and function. C/EBPβ is acetylated by acetyltransferases p300 and p300/CREB-binding protein associated factor. Endogenous C/EBPβ in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes is also recognized by an acetyl-lysine-specific antibody. Analysis of truncations of C/EBPβ and peptides based on C/EBPβ sequences identified multiple lysines within C/EBPβ that can be acetylated. Among these, a novel acetylation site at lysine 39 of C/EBPβ was identified. Mutation of Lys-39 to arginine or alanine impairs its acetylation and the ability of C/EBPβ to activate transcription at the promoters for C/EBPα and c-fos. Different C/EBPβ-responsive promoters require different patterns of acetylated lysines in C/EBPβ for transcription activation. Furthermore, C/EBPβ acetylation was increased by growth hormone, and mutation of Lys-39 impaired growth hormone-stimulated c-fos promoter activation. These data suggest that acetylation of Lys-39 of C/EBPβ, alone or in combination with acetylation at other lysines, may play a role in C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation.

Acetylation of nuclear proteins was first detected in histones and is viewed as a part of a mechanism allowing DNA to become accessible to transcription regulatory machinery (1Allfrey V.G.

In the nucleus, acetylation of several transcription factors is reported to have broad impact on their function. For example, acetylation of p53 stabilizes it by preventing its ubiquitination by Mdm2, allowing p53 to enter the nucleus to activate target genes (3Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol.

Acetylation in the DNA-binding domain of HMGI(Y) is inhibitory, decreasing its DNA-binding ability and weakening its transcriptional potency (10Kouzarides T.

C/EBPβ is present in cells in three forms as follows: LAP1 (full-length liver-enriched activating protein 1, residues 1–296) (17Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), LAP2 (residues 22–296), and the inhibitory form LIP (residues 151–296). C/EBPβ plays an important role in the gluconeogenic pathway (18Croniger C. Trus M. Lysek-Stupp K. Cohen H. Liu Y. Darlington G.J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. J. Biol.

For example, phosphorylation of human C/EBPβ at a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) substrate site at Thr-235 (which corresponds to Thr-188 in mouse C/EBPβ) (29Nakajima T. Kinoshita S.

The phosphorylation of C/EBPβ at Thr-188 is rapidly increased in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner by factors such as growth hormone (GH) (30Piwien-Pilipuk G.

Murine C/EBPβ has been observed to relocalize to heterochromatin within the nucleus in response to GH in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation at Thr-188 (36Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35668-35677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of rat C/EBPβ at Ser-105 or of mouse C/EBPβ at Thr-217 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase stimulates proliferation in differentiated hepatocytes induced by transforming growth factor-α (37Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A- or protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-240 of rat C/EBPβ is reported to attenuate DNA binding (38Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GH induces a delayed de-phosphorylation at a GSK-3 site at Ser-184 of mouse C/EBPβ, which may interfere with its binding to the c-fos promoter (39Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of C/EBPβ at Ser-184 also contributes to adipogenesis and activation of adipocyte genes such as C/ebpα and aP2 (35Tang Q.Q. Gronborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ has been shown to interact with p300 (40Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a nuclear coactivator with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity (41Ogryzko V.V. Schlitz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ also associates with cAMP response-element-binding protein-binding protein, a coactivator and acetyltransferase homologous to p300 (42Kovacs K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36959-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Duong D.T. Waltner-Law M.E. Sears R. Sealy L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32234-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because of the association between C/EBPβ and these acetyltransferases, this study investigates the acetylation of C/EBPβ and its functional consequences. This report indicates that C/EBPβ is acetylated, in agreement with several recent reports (44Joo M. Park G.Y. Wright J.G. Blackwell T.S. Atchison M.L. Christman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6658-6665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Xu M. Nie L. Kim S.H. Sun X.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Multiple acetylation sites are identified, including a novel acetylation site on C/EBPβ at Lys-39 (numbering is based on the murine sequence of C/EBPβ unless indicated otherwise). Importantly, mutation of Lys-39 decreases the ability of C/EBPβ to mediate transcriptional activation of target gene promoters. Using an antiacetyl-lysine antibody that recognizes acetylated Lys-39, endogenous C/EBPβ was found to be acetylated in preadipocytes, in which C/EBPβ is an important factor during adipogenesis. C/EBPβ is a critical mediator of GH-regulated transcription of c-fos (46Clarkson R.W.E. Chen C.M. Harrison S. Wells C. Muscat G.E.O. Waters M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Cui T.X. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Kaplani J. Kwok R. Schwartz J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A nonacetylatable mutation at Lys-39 of C/EBPβ impaired GH-stimulated c-fos promoter activation, and GH was found to increase acetylation of C/EBPβ. Taken together, this study identifies acetylation at Lys-39 as novel modification of C/EBPβ that is regulated and contributes, alone and in combination with other acetylatable lysines, to C/EBPβ-mediated transcription. Plasmids and Antibodies—The numbering used to designate residues in C/EBPβ is based on the mouse C/EBPβ sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM009883). The following C/EBPβ plasmids were used. The plasmid encoding full-length C/EBPβ (LAP1) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV-C/EBPβ) was a gift from Dr. U. Schibler (University of Geneva) and Dr. L. Sealy (Vanderbilt University). The plasmid HA-C/EBPβ encodes C/EBPβ (residues 22–296, also known as LAP2) tagged with HA at the N terminus (42Kovacs K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36959-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HA-C/EBPβ is able to activate the c-fos promoter at least as well as full-length CMV-C/EBPβ (data not shown). LAP2 is a prominent active form of C/EBPβ in GH-responsive 3T3-F442A cells (21Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31597-31604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hereafter, C/EBPβ will be designated as LAP2 unless otherwise indicated. Mutations were introduced into HA-C/EBPβ at indicated residues using Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The mutated forms of C/EBPβ are referred to as follows: K39R, K39A, K39Q, K117R, and K215R/K216R; TM refers to combined mutations K39R/K117R/K215R/K216R. As additional controls for mutation of Lys-39 in the transcriptional activation domain of C/EBPβ, arginine 42 was mutated to alanine (R42A) and lysine 98 was mutated to arginine (K98R). HA-C/EBPβ mutated to alanine at phosphorylation sites Thr-188 (T188A) or Ser-184 (S184A) was similarly generated. GST-C/EBPβ plasmids encode fusion proteins of GST with truncated forms of C/EBPβ (residues 22–227, 22–193, and 22–103) as described previously (42Kovacs K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36959-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HIS-C/EBPβ encodes C/EBPβ tagged with six histidine residues at the N terminus (48Kovacs K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recombinant HIS-C/EBPβ was expressed and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). Plasmids for full-length, N-terminally FLAG-tagged p300 (p300) and N-terminally FLAG-tagged P/CAF (P/CAF) were prepared, expressed, and purified as described previously (49Kashanchi F. Duvall J.F.

The plasmid 5XC/EBP-luc encodes a luciferase reporter gene driven by five copies of a consensus C/EBP site (42Kovacs K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36959-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The plasmid C/EBPα-luc was a gift from Dr. O. MacDougald (University of Michigan) (34Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13571-13575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasmid for c-fos/luciferase (c-fos-luc), which contains the mouse c-fos promoter (–379 to +1) upstream of luciferase, was a gift from Dr. W. Wharton (University of South Florida) and Dr. B. Cochran (Tufts University) (51Harvat B.L. Wharton W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding rat growth hormone receptor (GHR) was provided by Dr. C. Carter-Su (University of Michigan) (52Wang X. Moller C. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3573-3579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RSV-β-galactosidase was provided by Dr. M. Uhler (University of Michigan). pcDNA3.1 vector, used to normalize the total amount of DNA in transfections, was purchased from Clontech. The following antibodies were used: anti-HA (Covance) and anti-C/EBPβ (specific for the C terminus of C/EBPβ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at dilutions of 1:100 for immunoprecipitations and 1:1000 for immunoblotting. Anti-acetyl-lysine (anti-Ac-K (Upstate); monoclonal antibody 4G12 that detects acetylated lysines on histones and p53) was used at a dilution of 1:500 for immunoblotting. An antibody against a peptide corresponding to human C/EBPβ phosphorylated at Thr-235 (homologous to Thr-188 of mouse C/EBPβ) (anti-pC/EBPβ, Cell Signaling) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoblotting. Cell Culture—293T cells were provided by Dr. M. Lazar (University of Pennsylvania). Murine 3T3-F442A preadipocyte fibroblasts were provided by Dr. H. Green (Harvard University) and Dr. M. Sonenberg (Sloan-Kettering). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 8% calf serum (Invitrogen) in an environment of 10% CO2, 90% air at 37 °C. Prior to use in experiments, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, CRG7; Serological Corp), which was also supplemented with deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA, 1 μm, Sigma) and nicotinamide (NAM, 5 mm, Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing rat GHR containing the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain (referred to as CHO-GHR cells) were provided by Dr. G. Norstedt (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) and Dr. N. Billestrup (Steno Diabetes Center, Copenhagen, Denmark) (53Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 8% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Prior to experiments, CHO-GHR cells were incubated overnight in medium containing 1% BSA instead of serum. All media were supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 100units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. Calcium phosphate transfections were performed as described previously (54Chen D. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar), except 50 mm HEPES-buffered saline was used instead of BES-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—293T cells were lysed using Lysis Buffer (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol), supplemented with 150 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, as well as 1 μm TSA and 5 mm NAM. For 293T cells expressing HA-C/EBPβ, lysates were precleared using protein G-Sepharose beads (G beads; Amersham Biosciences). Samples were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitates were collected on beads for 1 h. To test endogenous proteins, 3T3-F442A cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100). Lysates were precleared using protein A-agarose beads (A beads; RepliGen). Samples were immunoprecipitated using anti-C/EBPβ antibody for 3 h at 4°C, and immunoprecipitates were collected on beads for 1 h. Beads were washed three times in Acetylase Buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol, 22 mg/ml sodium butyrate (Sigma), 3 mg/ml dithiothreitol (Invitrogen)). SDS protein dye (50 mm Tris, 1% SDS, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) was then added to the beads, and samples were boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described previously (55Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Bands on immunoblots were visualized using IRDye 700-coupled anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) or IRDye 800-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) on the Odyssey infrared scanning system (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE) as described previously (47Cui T.X. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Kaplani J. Kwok R. Schwartz J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Molecular weight was estimated using Kaleidoscope protein molecular weight standard (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Acetylation of C/EBPβ—Acetylation assays were performed using Acetylase Buffer. To test the acetylation of C/EBPβ in vitro, purified HIS-C/EBPβ (3 μg) or the purified GST-C/EBPβ fusion proteins (3 μg each) were incubated in Acetylase Buffer alone or with added purified p300 or P/CAF (1 μg each), and 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA (55 m Ci/mmol; ICN). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 30°C, separated by SDS-PAGE (8%), and analyzed by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1). To examine acetylation of expressed C/EBPβ, CMV-C/EBPβ (LAP1) was expressed in 293T cells to obtain high protein expression. C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated using anti-C/EBPβ and used in the acetylase assay described above. Protein levels were assessed by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). For expressed CMV-C/EBPβ, a duplicate immunoblot was probed with anti-C/EBPβ to evaluate migration and protein loading. C/EBPβ Peptide Acetylation—The following peptides containing candidate lysines in C/EBPβ were synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein Structure Facility: DCLAYGAKAARAAPR (amino acids 32–46), FADDYGAKPSKKPADYGYV (amino acids 91–109), SLGRAGAKAAPPACF (amino acids 110–124), PPPPALLKAEPGFE (amino acids 126–139), GFEPADCKRADDAPA (amino acids 137–151), PSPADAKAAPAACF (amino acids 189–202), and PAAPAKAKAKKTVDKLSD (amino acids 206–223). A peptide based on histone H3 (amino acids 7–22) that is acetylated by p300 and P/CAF (50Lu Q. Hutchins A.E. Doyle C.M. Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15727-15734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) served as a positive control, ARKSTGGKAPRKQLAT. Each peptide (2 μg) was incubated in Acetylase Buffer with 1 μl of [3H]acetyl-CoA (5.8 Ci/mmol; ICN), without or with purified p300 or P/CAF (1 μg each), and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. Samples were then spotted on grade P81 cellulose paper (Whatman). Paper was rinsed with 0.1% phosphoric acid (Sigma), and acetylation, expressed as relative counts/min, was measured in CytoScint scintillation mixture (ICN Biomedicals) using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). In Vivo Acetylation of C/EBPβ—CMV-C/EBPβ (LAP1) was expressed in 293T cells, and 48 h later cells were incubated with 200 μl of [3H]sodium acetate (2.90 Ci/mmol; ICN) for 1 h. C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBPβ or rabbit IgG (Sigma), which served as a control. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and analyzed by autoradiography. To assess the acetylation of WT HA-C/EBPβ or of HA-C/EBPβ mutated at various lysines, appropriate plasmids were coexpressed with or without plasmids for p300 (2.2 μg) or P/CAF (0.2 μg) in 293T cells. pcDNA3 was used to control for total amount of DNA transfected. 24 h later, cells were incubated overnight with TSA (1 μm) and NAM (5 mm) in serum-free DMEM containing 1% BSA. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA; samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with either anti-Ac-K or anti-HA. Phosphorylation of WT or mutated HA-C/EBPβ was similarly analyzed, except immunoblots were probed with anti-pC/EBPβ instead of anti-Ac-K. To examine the regulation of acetylation of C/EBPβ, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids for WT HA-C/EBPβ and GHR, and then 24 h later, they were incubated overnight with TSA (1 μm) and NAM (5 mm) in serum-free DMEM containing 1% BSA. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 250 ng/ml (11.5 nm) human GH (recombinant GH kindly provided by Lilly) for 15 min prior to lysis. Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer; samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA as described and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Ac-K and anti-C/EBPβ. Membranes were scanned using the Odyssey infrared scanning system (47Cui T.X. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Huo J.S. Kaplani J. Kwok R. Schwartz J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and bands were quantified using Odyssey software. Acetylation of C/EBPβ was calculated using values for acetylation (anti-Ac-K) divided by total C/EBPβ (anti-C/EBPβ or anti-HA). Statistical analysis of results from three or more experiments was performed using Student's t test (Excel) or 1-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (Prism version 3). Transcription Assays—WT HA-C/EBPβ or HA-C/EBPβ mutated at various residues alone or in combination (each 400 ng/35-mm well) were coexpressed with reporter plasmids 5XC/EBP-luc, C/EBPα-luc, or c-fos-luc each (400 ng/well) in CHO-GHR cells, a reliable system to assess reporter gene activation with or without GH. β-Galactosidase (300 ng/well) was coexpressed to normalize for transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, cells were deprived of serum and lysed for luciferase assay 24 h after that, as described previously (56Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were treated with vehicle or GH (500 ng/ml, 23 nm) for 4 h before lysates were prepared. Transcriptional activation was determined by luciferase output as measured using an Opticomp luminometer and is expressed as relative luciferase units/β-galactosidase. Each condition was analyzed in triplicate for each experiment. Statistical analysis of results from replicate, independent experiments was performed using 1-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (Prism version 3).

https://openalex.org/W1975537381,"Voltage-activated potassium (Kv) channels contain a central pore domain that is partially surrounded by four voltage-sensing domains. Recent X-ray structures suggest that the two domains lack extensive protein-protein contacts within presumed transmembrane regions, but whether this is the case for functional channels embedded in lipid membranes remains to be tested. We investigated domain interactions in the Shaker Kv channel by systematically mutating the pore domain and assessing tolerance by examining channel maturation, S4 gating charge movement, and channel opening. When mapped onto the X-ray structure of the Kv1.2 channel the large number of permissive mutations support the notion of relatively independent domains, consistent with crystallographic studies. Inspection of the maps also identifies portions of the interface where residues are sensitive to mutation, an external cluster where mutations hinder voltage sensor activation, and an internal cluster where domain interactions between S4 and S5 helices from adjacent subunits appear crucial for the concerted opening transition."

Disease-related mutations in the gene are responsible for the autosomal dominant Best macular dystrophy (BMD) (2Marquardt A. Stohr H. Passmore L.A. Kramer F. Rivera A. Weber B.H. Hum. Mol.

Sci. 2004; 45: 3683-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus far, a total of 100 distinct mutations have been identified including 92 in BMD, four in adult vitelliforme macular dystrophy, one in bulls eye maculopathy, and three in autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy patients (for further information see BMD mutation data base). Of these, more than 93% are missense mutations, distributed in a non-random fashion across the highly conserved N-terminal half of the protein. Clinically, BMD is characterized by striking yellowish lesions in the macular area eventually leading to a decline in central vision at later stages in disease pathology. The disease manifests in teenage years although with reduced penetrance and considerable variability in phenotypic expression. Histopathologically, aberrant remnants of heterogeneous material including proteins, lipids, and lipofuscin-containing particles are found in the central retina at the level of the RPE. Typically, BMD patients display a characteristic electrooculogram (EOG) abnormality with a greatly reduced light peak/dark trough ratio reflecting RPE dysfunction (7Arden G.B. Barrada A. Kelsey J.H. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1962; 46: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Accumulating experimental evidence suggests bestrophin-1, but also its highly conserved family members bestrophin-2, bestrophin-3 and bestrophin-4 (8Stohr H. Marquardt A. Nanda I. Schmid M.

Genome Res. 2004; 105: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), to be involved in Ca2+-dependent transport of chloride ions across cellular membranes. It is still unclear whether bestrophin-1 acts directly as an EOG light peak-producing chloride channel (Refs. 10Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yocom J. Bakall B. Schiavone M.T. Wadelius C. Marmorstein L.Y. Peachey N.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3733-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On this note, studies on Vmd2-deficient mice suggested that the light peak of the EOG may be dependent on voltage-gated calcium channels that in turn may be regulated by bestrophin-1 (15Marmorstein L.Y. Wu J. McLaughlin P. Yocom J. Karl M.O. Neussert R. Wimmers S. Stanton J.B. Gregg R.G. Strauss O. Peachey N.S. Marmorstein A.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An alternative function of bestrophin-1 may be its involvement in volume sensitivity of RPE cells (16Fischmeister R. Hartzell H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 562: 477-491Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that functional aspects of bestrophin-1 other than those thought to be of elementary importance to the generation of EOG responses could be involved in primary disease pathology. To further clarify the nature of BMD-related pathology, investigation into bestrophin-1 membrane topology is needed. In particular, defining the positions of pathogenic mutations relative to defined topological structures may provide clues as to how these mutations interfere with protein function. While in silico hydropathy analyses of the primary bestrophin-1 amino acid sequence reveal six potential hydrophobic domains, insertion of N-glycosylation and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sites into the protein suggested that only four of these may properly traverse the membrane, with an additional hydrophobic domain dipping into the lipid bilayer (11Tsunenari T.

By employing the in vitro translation/translocation Escherichia coli leader peptidase (Lep) gene assay (17Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have sought an alternative experimental approach to study membrane topology of bestrophin-1. This method has been successfully applied for resolving membrane topologies of a great number of proteins (19Lehmann S. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12047-12051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Lep contains two N-terminal transmembrane domains, H1 and H2, and a catalytic P2 domain at the C terminus. While the H1 domain of Lep has the ability to target and traverse the ER membrane, the transmembraneous H2 domain of Lep is replaced in the assay system by putative membranespanning peptide fragments and tested for glycosylation at the P2 loop indicating proper membrane insertion of the fragment in question. This approach provides evidence for a model of bestrophin-1 with four TMDs and one large cytoplasmatic loop between putative TMDs 2 and 5. Accordingly, the relatively hydrophobic segments of putative TMD3 and TMD4 are likely located within the cytoplasm. In addition, three out of 18 disease-related mutations located within one of the four putative TMDs (I73N, Y85H, F281del) were found to show significant effects on endoplasmic reticulum membrane insertion. Therefore defective membrane integration of bestrophin-1 may represent a potential disease mechanism for a minor subset of BMD-related mutations. Bioinformatics Analyses—Similarity searches with bestrophin-1 sequences (GenBank™ accession number NP_004174) were done in public data bases available at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the University of California, Santa Cruz, CA. Phylogeny tree construction was done with PHYLIP, version 3.5 (22Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 23Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar), and TREECON, version 1.3b (24Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 569-570PubMed Google Scholar), programs and was based on the Neighbor-Joining method (25Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Topological structure prediction used the TOPPRED II software (26von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), which is based on the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar). The average hydrophobicity values of putative TMDs of 20-23 amino acid residues were calculated using the Eisenberg scale (28Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). An average hydropathy plot of multiple bestrophin-1-related protein sequences was generated by the PEPWINDOWALL program with a window of 19 amino acids (27Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar). DNA Manipulations—Initially, full-length VMD2 was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human RPE mRNA and directionally cloned into the pCEP4 vector via KpnI and SfiI restriction sites (named pCEP-hVMD2), which were introduced into the reverse transcriptase-PCR product at the respective 5′-ends of forward (5′-CTA GGG TAC CAT GAC CAT CAC TTA CAC AAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGG CCT TGC CGG CCT GGA ATG TGC TTC ATC CCT GT-3′) primer sequences. Fragments of the VMD2 transcript were PCR amplified from the pCEP-hVMD2 template, digested with BclI/NdeI restriction enzymes, and subsequently inserted into the pGEM1 plasmid carrying a modified Lep gene (29Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to replace the H2 domain. For generation of the mutated bestrophin-1 constructs, the disease-related mutations were introduced into pCEP-hVMD2 by site directed mutagenesis (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The correct sequence of all constructs was verified by direct sequencing. In Vitro Transcription/Translation in Reticulocyte Lysate—Fusion constructs consisting of the H1 domain of Lep, defined human bestrophin-1 putative TMD fragments, and the Lep P2 loop were PCR-amplified with a Lep-specific forward primer containing the T7 promoter sequence (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAC CAC C-3′) and with a reverse primer (5′-TTA ATG GAT GCC GCC AAT GCG-3′). PCR templates were subsequently transcribed/translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. The reactions were performed in reticulocyte lysates in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12.5 or 15% polyacrylamide gels. To confirm glycosylation status, translated products were treated with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). Polyacrylamide gels were scanned with a Typhoon 9200 phosphorimaging plate scanner and analyzed by the ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Glycosylation efficiency was measured by assessing the fraction of the band density of the glycosylated signal as compared with the total band signal (glycosylated and non-glycosylated products from a single reaction). Phylogenetic Relationship of Bestrophin-1 Sequences—To specifically identify bestrophin-1-related orthologuous sequences in vertebrate and invertebrate species and to distinguish those from paraloguous family members, all available protein sequences with amino acid identities greater than 25% to human bestrophin-1 were extracted from public data bases (see supplemental Table S1). An unrooted dendrogram of 41 protein sequences from 14 representative invertebrate and vertebrate taxa separates at least four main branches of bestrophin-1-related proteins consequently differentiating between four subfamilies termed bestrophin-1 (VMD2), bestrophin-2 (gene VMD2L1), bestrophin-3 (VMD2L2), and bestrophin-4 (VMD2L3) (Fig. 1). Most of the invertebrate bestrophin sequences could not be attributed to one of the four groups hampering their assignment as orthologuous or paraloguous proteins relative to bestrophin-1. Overall, the data show that the human bestrophins are more closely related to their phylogenetically conserved orthologues than their human paraloguous family members. Putative Transmembrane Domains of Bestrophin-1 and Its Orthologues—In silico hydrophobicity analysis of human bestrophin-1 suggests six potential transmembrane domains (TMD1 to TMD6) in the respective N-terminal regions with average values ranging from 0.69 to 0.82 (Fig. 2, A and B). The C-terminal half of the protein is predominantly hydrophilic. Similarly, hydropathy plotting of the nine bestrophin-1-related vertebrate orthologues including sequences derived from human, chimpanzee, crab-eating macaques, bovine, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish (Fig. 1) result in a consistent pattern of four major and two minor hydrophobic peaks further supporting six potential membrane-spanning regions for the bestrophin-1 subfamily (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the Membrane-spanning Potential of Putative TMDs—The membrane-spanning potential of the six putative transmembrane segments of bestrophin-1 was systematically analyzed by the in vitro translation/translocation Lep system (17Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, membrane integration is directed by a series of alternating signal anchor (SA) and stop transfer (ST) sequences (31Lingappa V.R. Lingappa J.R. Blobel G. Nature. 1979; 281: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 33Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). With the H1 domain of the E. coli Lep protein providing an ST and the H2 domain an SA signal, the catalytic P2 loop C-terminal to the H2 domain will be inserted into the ER lumen where it is accessible to glycosylation (Fig. 3A). Initial control experiments demonstrate a glycosylation efficiency of wild type Lep in the range of 60 ± 4% (Fig. 3B, left). These and all subsequent experiments were done at least three times independently and in each case mean values and appropriate standard deviations were calculated. Overall, the range of glycosylation efficiencies is in good agreement with earlier reports (17Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Glycosylated versus non-glycosylated products migrate at an increased molecular weight of ∼3 kDa. The specificity of the system was tested by replacing the H2 domain with a hydrophilic C-terminal fragment of bestrophin-1 (amino acids 367-389) unlikely to insert into the membrane. As expected, this construct resulted in a non-glycosylated product (Fig. 3B, middle). Conversely, H2 substitution with a hydrophobic sequence of bestrophin-1 (amino acids 28-50) potentially representing a membrane-spanning sequence, translocates the P2 catalytic site to the ER lumen leading to glycosylation which subsequently may or may not be abolished after endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 3B, right). To individually analyze the SA potential of the six predicted TMDs of bestrophin-1, the Lep H2 domain was consecutively replaced by the respective TMD sequences (Table 1). TMD1, TMD2, TMD5, and TMD6 revealed similar glycosylation efficiencies with mean values between 52 ± 4% and 61 ± 6% (Fig. 3C).

Open table in a new tab SA and ST Function of Adjacent Bestrophin-1 Fragments Containing Consecutive TMDs—In a second set of experiments, a series of constructs were generated each containing pairs of putative TMDs, namely construct VMD2(28-90aa) including TMD1 and TMD2, VMD2(55-149aa) with TMD2 and TMD3, VMD2(130-201aa) with TMD3 and TMD4, VMD2(176-253aa) with TMD4 and TMD5, and finally VMD2(207-291aa) with TMD5 and TMD6 (Table 1). The two constructs VMD2(28-90aa) and VMD2(207-291aa) yielded non-glycosylated products (average efficiency 16 ± 2 and 0, respectively) suggesting that in each fragment both potential TMDs are correctly inserted into the membrane and consequently direct the catalytic P2 domain toward the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). In contrast, strong glycosylation was found for fusion fragments VMD2(55-149aa) (61 ± 3%) and VMD2(176-253aa) (50 ± 3%) indicating that in each construct only one of the two putative TMDs is integrated into the ER membrane. Considering the glycosylation efficiencies of individual TMDs (Fig. 3C), those may be suspected to likely represent the TMD2 and TMD5 segments, respectively (Fig. 3D). Fusion fragment VMD2(130-201aa) containing TMD3 and TMD4 showed moderate to low glycosylation (29 ± 7%) barely above the given threshold. This may be due to inefficient SA activity of either TMD3 or TMD4. The glycosylation values of individual TMDs (Fig. 3C) seem to favor TMD4 to traverse the membrane although with reduced efficiency of the SA sequence in the context of the VMD2(130-201aa) construct. As the sequence context is crucial for the nascent polypeptide to acquire proper topology (35Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Monne M. Hessa T. Thissen L. von Heijne G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we generated additional constructs containing three consecutive TMDs (Fig. 3E and Table 1). Glycosylation of fusion constructs VMD2(28-149aa) and VMD2(176-291aa) was below or only slightly above background suggesting an even number of SA/ST sequences to insert into the ER membrane (Fig. 3E). Similar to the above considerations, TMD3 and TMD4 are likely candidates, which may not or only inefficiently traverse the ER membrane. The remaining constructs VMD2(55-201aa) and VMD2(91-253aa) yielded glycosylated products implying an odd number of SA/ST sequences. Again, this finding is consistent with TMD3 and TMD4 segments failing to efficiently participating in ER membrane insertion (Fig. 3E). In both cases alternative explanations are conceivable if either TMD3 or TMD4 act as true transmembrane domains. This interpretation, however, would contradict the glycosylation results obtained with constructs VMD2(28-149aa) or VMD2(176-291aa), respectively. Finally, a series of C-terminally truncated constructs was generated replacing the Lep H2 domain with N-terminal contiguous bestrophin-1 sequences containing increasing numbers of putative TMDs (Fig. 3F and Table 1). Fusion constructs VMD2(1-55aa), VMD2(1-90aa), and VMD2(1-149aa) containing in ascending order the potential membrane segments TMD1, TMD1 + TMD2, and TMD1 + TMD2 + TMD3, respectively, reveal glycosylation patterns (Fig. 3F, upper and middle panels) in full agreement with the previous experiments, which included the respective transmembrane domains by itself lacking their neighboring sequence context (Fig. 3, C-E). Extending the bestrophin-1 construct to include hydrophobic segment TMD4 (VMD2(1-201aa) yields a non-glycosylated product. Again, this is in agreement with the notion that TMD3 and TMD4 may fail to insert into the membrane and thus should remain at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 3F, lower panel). The glycosylation pattern of construct VMD2(1-253aa), additionally containing TMD5, and construct VMD2(1-291aa) comprising the entire N-terminal half of bestrophin-1, is also best explained by assuming that TMD3 and TMD4 do not or only inefficiently traverse the ER membrane, while TMD1, TMD2, TMD5, and TMD6 represent functional SA and ST sequences in vitro and therefore may act as authentic transmembrane domains in vivo (Fig. 3F). Effects of BMD-related Mutations on Bestrophin-1 Topology—Approximately one-third of known BMD-associated mutations cluster within or in close proximity to predicted bestrophin-1 TMDs. To examine possible effects of these point mutations on membrane topology, we introduced a total of 18 disease mutations in various constructs and tested those in the in vitro translation/translocation Lep system (Fig. 4A and Table 1). By in vitro mutagenesis, point mutations Y29H, L41P, I73N, Y85H, L140R, A146K, A195V, I201T, S231R, T237R, F276L, and F281del were introduced into the respective individual TMD sequence constructs. Compared with normal TMD sequences (Fig. 3C), missense mutations I73N and Y85H in TMD2, L140R in TMD3, and deletion F281del in TMD6 significantly alter the glycosylation pattern by individually abolishing insertion of the mutated fragments into the ER membrane (Fig. 4B). Mutations W24C, R25Q, and S27R immediately flanking TMD1 at the N-terminal side as well as mutations Q293K, N296H, and E300K immediately flanking TMD6 at the C-terminal side do not exert measurable effects on ER membrane insertion (Fig. 4C). Mutations exerting effects in individual TMD analyses (I73N, Y85H, L140R, and F281del) were re-investigated in extended sequence constructs containing neighboring sequences and adjacent TMDs (Table 1). To this end, the effects of the I73N mutation embedded in a native peptide environment containing TMDs 1, 2, and 3 could not be replicated (Table 1). In contrast, the L140R mutation displayed significant effects on membrane-spanning potential in constructs including TMDs 2 and 3 or TMDs 2, 3, and 4 but not in a sequence context containing TMDs 3 and 4. The Y85H mutation embedded in its native sequence context extending from amino acids 55-149 revealed significantly less glycosylation efficiency (37 ± 2) than its wild type counterpart (61 ± 3) (Fig. 4D). In a construct with the Y85H mutation in the context of the first three consecutive TMDs (VMD2(28-149aa)) (Table 1), no significant glycosylation differences to the non-mutated control were found. Mutation F281del exerted an effect on membrane integration, increasing the glycosylation efficiency from 0 in wild type to 11 ± 2inthe mutant construct containing TMDs 5 and 6 (VMD2(207-291aa)). Likewise, in a construct containing TMDs 4, 5, and 6 (VMD2(176-291aa)) the glycosylation efficiency was reduced from 25 ± 2 in wild type to 17 ± 2 in the mutant counterpart. Concluding, we provide experimental evidence that the Y85H mutation in TMD2 and the F281del mutation in TMD6 may significantly effect membrane integration. Similarly, L140R in TMD3 also displays measurable effects on membrane insertion properties, although its pathological effect remains unclear as TMD3 is not likely to represent a membrane-spanning domain. Our data suggest a topological model of bestrophin-1 with four out of six potential protein segments traversing the membrane including putative TMDs 1, 2, 5, and 6. This leaves a large cytoplasmatic loop of 139 amino acids between TMD2 and TMD5 containing hydrophobic domains TMD3 and 4. Accordingly, a short N terminus of 27 amino acids and a long C-terminal region of 294 amino acid residues both would be localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 5A). This model explains best the results obtained by substituting the H2 domain of the translation/translocation E. coli Lep system with a series of bestrophin-1 fragments containing single or multiple potential TMDs in its natural sequence environment. It is also in agreement with in silico hydrophobicity and hydropathy data, which reveal high phylogenetic conservation throughout the vertebrate orthologues of bestrophin-1. An alternative transmembrane topography of bestrophin-1 was proposed by Tsunenari et al. (11Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) based on experimental evidence obtained from insertion mutagenesis of N-linked glycosylation sites and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sites. Similar to our model, the authors suggest cytosolic N and C termini as well as four segments to traverse the membrane. Conflicting interpretations concern the putative transmembrane domains TMD4 and 5 (Fig. 5B). While our data best fit a model where TMD4 is part of a hydrophobic intracellular loop, TMD5 should be integral to the membrane. In contrast, the model by Tsunenari et al. (11Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) assumes a more complex topology with TMD4 traversing the membrane followed by TMD5, which is suggested to reside on the extracellular side by dipping into the lipid bilayer. As a consequence, these differences in the two suggested models would lead to differences in the number of extracellular loops. Accordingly, the model presented here predicts two extracellular loops (loop1ext from 51 to 67 aa and loop2ext from 254 to 268 aa), while Tsunenari et al. (11Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) suggest three such loops (loop1ext from 56 to 73 aa, loop2ext from 200 to 234 aa, and loop3ext from 261 to 270 aa). Alternatively, Tsunenari et al. (11Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) point out that TMD5 could also reside entirely beyond the membrane participating in an extracellular loop that would comprise amino acid residues 200-270. This is contrasting our results, which demonstrate that TMD5 has a strong membrane spanning potential with a glycosylation value of 58 ± 6% which is significantly higher than that of TMD4 (41 ± 3%). In addition, assuming membrane-traversing features for TMD4 but not TMD5 would clearly conflict with some of our glycosylation data, in particular with those obtained with constructs TMD5, VMD2(207-291aa), VMD2(55-201aa), and VMD2(1-201aa). At present, the dissenting results obtained by the two experimental approaches cannot be resolved. It should be noted, however, that both techniques employ artificial in vitro systems that are not reflecting physiological conditions as are normally present in vertebrate cells. In particular, the Lep system may not allow the distinction between TMD5 acting as an authentic TMD or as a reentrant loop due to its high hydrophobicity. Similarly, mutational insertion of glycosylation sites or tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sites may alter proper protein processing or lead to partially misfolded protein structures locally affecting distinct sequence properties. In this context, it may be of interest to compare the functionality of wild type bestrophin-1 and bestrophin-1 modified after insertional mutagenesis. A functional test of choice could be whole cell recording experiments of bestrophin-1 channel activity (10Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus far, little is known about the molecular pathology of point mutations associated with BMD. Based on our working model of bestrophin-1 topology, we were therefore interested to evaluate possible effects of disease-associated amino acid changes on the membrane-traversing potential of putative TMDs. Of the 12 TMD-associated alterations analyzed, four (I73N, Y85H, L140R, and delF281) revealed a significantly altered glycosylation pattern in the single TMD translation/translocation Lep analysis. Two mutations, namely Y85H and F281del, retained this effect in a native bestrophin-1 sequence context further supporting a compromising role of these mutations on bestrophin-1 structure/function. These findings correlate well with data in public data bases that show a high proportion of mutations occurring in TMDs of membrane proteins to be linked to human disease (Human Gene Mutation Data Base). Moreover, such TMD-associated mutations have been found to be frequently involved in gain or loss of polar residues and ionizable residues notably arginine (37Schneider D. Liu Y. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Partridge A.W. Therien A.G. Deber C.M. Proteins. 2004; 54: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). While I73N replaces a hydrophobic with a polar residue, the two remaining mutations, Y85H and L140R, substitute hydrophobic residues by positively charged amino acids. As was shown for comparable mutational changes in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (39Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), TMD-associated mutations in bestrophin-1 may also have an impact on folding efficiency. This is in line with previous findings showing that Y85H mutant bestrophin-1 exerts an inhibitory effect on whole cell currents when transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells (10Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Y85H mutation is localized within a core region, which is thought to be a functionally active pore of the putative chlorideconducting bestrophins (13Hartzell C. Qu Z. Putzier I. Artinian L. Chien L.T. Cui Y. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Qu Z. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41Qu Z. Chien L.T. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Anion selectivity analysis by cysteine substitutions of a region spanning murine bestrophin-2 from residue Cys-69 to Asp-104 revealed that in bestrophin-2 the selectivity filter is distributed over ∼20 amino acid residues within TMD2 (41Qu Z. Chien L.T. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the cysteine mutations found to play a potential role in anion permeation is the tyrosine residue at position 85 in murine bestrophin-1. Together these data underline the key role of the tyrosine residue in both the assembly of membrane topology and the conductance of ions across the membrane. In summary, our data provide support for a working model of bestrophin-1 topology with four of the putative six hydrophobic segments traversing the membrane orienting the N and C termini to the cytoplasm. This model further predicts a relatively hydrophobic intracellular loop between TMDs 2 and 5, which is composed of the putative TMDs 3 and 4. Due to the inability to sufficiently insert into the membrane the latter two hydrophobic segments were excluded as membrane-spanning domains. The experimental system used in this study has the advantage that hydrophobic fragments can be analyzed individually or embedded in their local protein environment thus providing a valuable tool to verify measurable effects in an increasingly native sequence context. In an effort to begin to clarify the molecular pathology of BMD-related mutations, we have further shown that in some cases even subtle changes involving replacement of a single amino acid residue can exert striking effects on membrane-spanning properties. We therefore conclude that a minor proportion of BMD-related mutations may mediate a direct effect on membrane topology by destabilizing TMD structure.

https://openalex.org/W2061086038,"Control of membrane-receptor activity is required not only for the accuracy of sensory responses, but also to protect cells from excitotoxicity. Here we report the isolation of two noncomplementary fly mutants with slow termination of photoresponses. Genetic and electrophysiological analyses of the mutants revealed a defect in the deactivation of rhodopsin, a visual G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The mutant gene was identified as the calmodulin-binding transcription activator (dCAMTA). The known rhodopsin regulator Arr2 does not mediate this visual function of dCAMTA. A genome-wide screen identified five dCAMTA target genes. Of these, overexpression of the F box gene dFbxl4 rescued the mutant phenotypes. We further showed that dCAMTA is stimulated in vivo through interaction with the Ca(2+) sensor calmodulin. Our data suggest that calmodulin/CAMTA/Fbxl4 may mediate a long-term feedback regulation of the activity of Ca(2+)-stimulating GPCRs, which could prevent cell damage due to extra Ca(2+) influx."
https://openalex.org/W2012735248,"Sulfonylurea receptors SUR1 and SUR2 are the regulatory subunits of K(ATP) channels. Their differential affinity for hypoglycemic sulfonylureas provides a basis for the selectivity of these compounds for different K(ATP) channel isoforms. Sulfonylureas have a 100- to 1000-fold greater affinity for SUR1 vs. SUR2. Structure-activity studies suggested a bipartite binding pocket. Chimeric SUR1 approximately SUR2 receptors have shown TMD2, the third bundle of transmembrane helices, to be part of an ""A"" site that confers SUR1 selectivity for sulfonylureas. The purpose of this study is to determine the position of the ""B"" site. Previous photoaffinity labeling studies have placed the B site on the amino-terminal third of SUR and colabeled the associated K(IR). In our study, deletion of TMD0, the first bundle of transmembrane helices, did not compromise labeling. Further deletions into the cytoplasmic linker, L0, eliminated binding and labeling. Alanine substitutions in L0 identified a limited number of conserved residues, Y230 and W232, important for affinity labeling. A fragment of K(IR)6.2, missing M2 and the entire carboxyl terminal, assembles with SUR1 and is affinity labeled, while deletion of 10 or more amino-terminal residues compromises labeling. These studies indicate that the B site involves L0 and the K(IR) amino terminus, elements that are critical for control of channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2029135290,"High voltage-gated calcium channels enable calcium entry into cells in response to membrane depolarization. Association of the auxiliary β-subunit to the α-interaction-domain in the pore-forming α1-subunit is required to form functional channels. The β-subunit belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase class of scaffolding proteins containing a Src homology 3 and a guanylate kinase domain. Although the latter is responsible for the high affinity binding to the α-interaction domain, the functional significance of the Src homology 3 domain remains elusive. Here, we show that injection of isolated β-subunit Src homology 3 domain into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the α1-subunit reduces the number of channels in the plasma membrane. This effect is reverted by coexpressing α1 with a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin, a GTPase involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Full-length β-subunit also down-regulates voltage-gated calcium channels but only when lacking the α-interaction domain. Moreover, isolated Src homology 3 domain and the full-length β-subunit were found to interact in vitro with dynamin and to internalize the distantly related Shaker potassium channel. These results demonstrate that the β-subunit regulates the turnover of voltagegated calcium channels and other proteins in the cell membrane.

As shown by the crystal structure of CaVβ complexed to AID, the CaVβ-GK binds to the AID, whereas CaVβ-SH3 interacts with GK. Although SH3 domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs in ligand proteins (6Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), no interactions mediated by the CaVβ-SH3 have been described yet. Moreover, the functional integrity of CaVβ-SH3 domain is uncertain since the residues homologous to the ones critical for binding PXXP motifs in canonical SH3 modules are occluded in the crystal structure of CaVβ. Intriguingly, canine and human cardiac cells express splicing variants encoding short versions of the CaVβ that only encompass the variable N-terminal region and the SH3 domain (7Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Delisle B.P. Yunker A.M. Robia S.L. Walker J.W. McEnery M.W. January C.T. Kamp T.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 17: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Cohen R.M.

Here, we studied the effect of isolated CaVβ-SH3 on calcium channel function and expression. The SH3 domain of the rat β2a isoform of CaVβ (β2a-SH3) was expressed in bacteria, purified, and injected into Xenopus oocytes expressing the cardiac CaVα1 (CaV1.2) subunit isoform. We found that the β2a-SH3 induces removal of channels from the plasma membrane in a dynamin-dependent fashion. This function is preserved by full-length CaVβ in the absence of CaVα1 subunit or when binding to it is disrupted by deleting the AID site. Our results define a novel interaction and outline a new function for the calcium channel β-subunit. Recombinant Proteins—The cDNA encoding the SH3 domain of the rat β2a isoform (Swiss-Prot entry:Q8VGC3) encompassing residues 24–136 was subcloned between BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites by conventional PCR methods into pRSETB vector (Invitrogen) to introduce a polyhistidine tag at the N-terminal. The molecular mass predicted by the amino acid sequence of the CaVβ2a-SH3 His-tagged protein is 16.7 kDa. The His-tagged CaVβ2a-SH3 was expressed in BL-21 (DE-3) E. coli bacteria by a 2-h induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen, and stored until use at –80 °C. Right before protein purification, the cells were resuspended in phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and disrupted by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the protein was purified from the cleared cell lysate by using a cobalt-based metal affinity chromatography (Talon, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by size-exclusion chromatography onto a Superdex™ S-200 column 26/60 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated up to 1–2 mg/ml by centrifugation using Amicon Ultra tubes with 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Millipore), aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C until use. The full-length CaVβ2a was prepared as described (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of His-tagged CaVβ2a-SH3 determined from the size exclusion chromatography calibration curve was obtained from the partition coefficient value (Kav) calculated from its elution volume as described (10Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), where Kav is equal to (Ve – Vo)/(Vt – Vo) and Ve is the elution volume of the protein; Vo is the void volume of the column calibrated with blue dextran, and Vt is the total bed volume. A set of globular protein standards was used as indicated in Fig. 1. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the mass spectrometry laboratory, Zentrums Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. The protein was digested by trypsin, and the peptides were analyzed in an Ultraflex matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). The GST-Dyn829–842 peptide was prepared as follows. Two overlapping oligonucleotides were designed according to the dynamin sequence (Swiss-Prot entry: Q05193) to encode the peptide sequence from residues 829–842 (829PPQVPSRPNRAPPG842). After annealing, the oligonucleotides were ligated into pGEX vector (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) to fuse a GST at the N-terminal (GST-Dyn829–842 peptide). The GST alone and GST-Dyn829–842 peptide were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (10Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Dynamin mutation and CaV1.2 Δ AID deletion were done by standard overlapping PCR using complementary oligonucleotides. Binding Assay—Pull-down assays using His-tagged CaVβ2a-derivatives as baits were performed as described (10Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-CaVβ2a derivatives were coupled to cobalt-based agarose for 1 h at 4°C and incubated for another hour with precleared tsA201 cell extract obtained 24–48 h after transfection with dynamin or with YFP-CaV1.2 expression vector. The beads were pelleted and washed five times, and bound fractions were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. In the binding assays to dynamin, the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti dynamin antibody (BD Biosciences). Binding to YFP-CaV1.2 was visualized by fluorescence scanning using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Xenopus Oocytes Preparation, Injection, and Electrophysiological Recordings—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, and maintained as in a previous report (10Neely A. Garcia-Olivares J. Voswinkel S. Horstkott H. Hidalgo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All capped cRNAs were synthesized using the MESSAGE-machine (Ambion, Austin TX), resuspended in 10 μl of water and stored in 2-μl aliquots at –80 °C until use. The CaV1.2-subunit used in this study bears a deletion of 60 amino acids at the N-terminal end that increase expression (11Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recordings on CaV1.2-expressing oocytes were performed 2–5 h after protein injection (50 nl of the protein stock solution, 1–2 mg/ml/oocyte) and 5–7 days after cRNA injection using the cut-open oocyte technique with a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) as described (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The external solution contained (in mm)10Ba2+, 96 n-methylglucamine, and 10 HEPES pH 7.0, and the internal solution contained (in mm) 120 n-methylglucamine, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.0. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the pCLAMP system and software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Linear components were eliminated by P/-4 prepulse protocol. The normalized charge movement-voltage plot and the average current-voltage plot were obtained as described (12Dzhura I. Neely A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 274-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Ionic currents mediated by Shaker potassium channel were recorded 1 day after cRNA injection with two-electrode voltage clamp technique using a Dagan TEV 200A or Warner OC725A and filtered at 10 kHz. For the bafilomycin treatment, oocytes were incubated with 500 nm bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) 24 h prior to protein injection (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Shaker channel used, Sh IR (inactivation removed), bears an N-terminal deletion that removes fast inactivation (13Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Surface Expression Measurements in Xenopus Oocytes—Surface expression of CaV1.2 channels bearing the HA epitope (CaV1.2-HA) was measured by immunoassay as described (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–7 days after CaV1.2 RNA injection, oocytes were separated in two groups: for electrophysiological recordings and for immunoassay. Oocytes were incubated in blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science). After washing, oocytes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat FAB fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and extensively washed, and individual oocytes were placed in 50 μl of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay femto substrate (Pierce) in 96-well microplates (Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chemiluminescence-quantified 30 s later with a luminometer (Viktor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). β2a-SH3 Reduces the Number of Channels Expressed in the Plasma Membrane—The purified SH3 domain of the CaVβ2a with an expected molecular mass of 16.7 kDa elutes as a mono-disperse peak from a size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B). The size exclusion chromatography calibration curve yielded an apparent molecular mass of 20.8 kDa that is compatible with a monomeric conformation of the protein. Mass spectrometry analysis on the purified β2a-SH3 confirmed its identity (data not shown). β2a-SH3 was injected in Xenopus oocytes expressing CaV1.2, and gating and ionic currents were measured using the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp technique. Injection of β2a-SH3 into oocytes causes a dramatic decrease in charge movement (Qon, Fig. 1C) that develops with a time constant of 0.9 h (Fig. 1D). Qon stems from the conformational changes leading to channel opening (14Bezanilla F. Stefani E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 331-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and, thus, it is proportional to the number of channels. Since decrease in Qon proceeds without changes in the voltage or time dependence (Fig. 1, E–G), it likely reflects a reduction in the number of channels in the cell surface (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, injection of full-length CaVβ, does modify channel gating as expected (15Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). We corroborated that the drop of Qon upon β2a-SH3 injection stems from a decrease in the number of channels in the plasma membrane by immunoassay (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Channel surface expression was measured in oocytes expressing HA-tagged CaV1.2 channels and compared with Qon measurements on the same group of oocytes as shown in Fig. 2A. Impaired assembly and forward trafficking or enhanced backward trafficking may be responsible for the reduction in the number of channels expressed in the plasma membrane upon β2a-SH3 injection. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we examined the effect of β2a-SH3 when incorporation of new proteins into the plasma membrane was inhibited by bafilomycin. We have previously shown that indeed, bafilomycin treatment interrupts incorporation of new CaV1.2 channels in oocytes and causes a net reduction of channel density due to constitutive turnover (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Injection of β2a-SH3 in bafilomycin-treated oocytes resulted in 35% reduction in Qon (Fig. 2C) that compares with the 29% observed in control conditions (Fig. 2B). Thus, down-regulation induced by β2a-SH3 was not prevented by bafilomycin, indicating that this domain interferes with the backward trafficking rather than with the incorporation of newly formed channels. β2a-SH3-induced Reduction of Qon Depends on Dynamin—Removal of membrane proteins from the surface implicates endocytosis. Several SH3-containing proteins participate in the regulation of this process by associating with dynamin, a GTPase that excises endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (16Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 17Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 18Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The proline-rich domain (PRD) of dynamin binds to SH3 domains in the partner protein, and this interaction recruits dynamin to the plasma membrane. Moreover, endocytosis of ion channels and receptors through a dynamin-dependent process has been reported (20Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 21Zeng W.Z. Babich V. Ortega B. Quigley R. White S.J. Welling P.A. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F630-F639Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the potential role of dynamin in β2a-SH3 induced channel internalization. We first verified the presence of endogenous dynamin in Xenopus oocytes by Western blot analysis using anti-dynamin antibody and detected a protein of molecular mass similar to a heterologously expressed HA-tagged dynamin I (Fig. 3A). Coexpressing CaV1.2 with dynamin did not have a direct impact on channel expression, and β2a-SH3 induced reduction of Qon was equivalent (compare Fig. 1C and 3B). We then examined the effect of expressing a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin lacking GTPase activity that inhibits endocytosis (dynamin K44A) (23Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Co-expression with dynamin K44A reduced oocyte survival rate and yielded smaller Qon than CaV1.2 alone or with dynamin WT. Although the causes for these changes are unclear, we still observed that β2a-SH3-induced reduction of Qon was blunted by expression of dynamin K44A (Fig. 3C). To further test the role of dynamin, we fused a 14-amino-acid residue peptide spanning the proline-rich region of dynamin I to GST protein to produce GST-Dyn829–842 peptide. This peptide is known to disrupt the interaction between dynamin and SH-3 domains and to inhibit endocytosis in synaptic vesicles (24Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. Camilli P.De Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 25Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 3D shows that preincubation of β2a-SH3 with GST-Dyn829–842 peptide, but not with GST alone, inhibits its potency to reduce Qon. Furthermore, β2a-SH3 binds in vitro to dynamin (Fig. 4A) and, consistently with the electrophysiological data, this binding is partially blocked by GST-Dyn829–842 peptide but not by GST (Fig. 4B). We tested the ability of β2a-SH3 to bind to the full-length channel. Using a similar pull-down assay, we did not observe binding of β2a-SH3 to CaV1.2 fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP-CaV1.2; Fig. 4C). In contrast and as expected, CaVβ and the functional core of CaVβ (26Opatowsky Y. Chomsky-Hecht O. Kang M.G. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52323-52332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) encompassing the SH3 and GK domains (Fig. 1A, C1–C2) bound to the channel. β2a-SH3 and Full-length CaVβ2a Down-regulate the Distantly Related Shaker Potassium Channel Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—Because β2a-SH3 promotes channel internalization without binding to the channel protein, we examined the effect of β2a-SH3 onto the distantly related Shaker potassium channel that lacks binding activity to the CaVβ-subunit (27Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. Waard De. M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Injection of β2a-SH3 to oocytes expressing the Shaker channel resulted in no changes in channel gating (supplemental Fig. S1), but ionic currents were reduced by ∼60% 1 h after protein injection (Fig. 5A). This current reduction was also partially blocked by preincubation of β2a-SH3 with GST-Dyn829–842 peptide but not with GST (Fig. 5B). Full-length CaVβ2a preserves the ability of β2a-SH3 to down-regulate Shaker channels expressed in oocytes. CaVβ2a reduced ionic currents to a similar degree as β2a-SH3 (Fig. 5C) without changes in the voltage dependence (supplemental Fig. S2). This current decrease was also antagonized by GST-Dyn829–842 peptide. Moreover, CaVβ2a bound in vitro to dynamin, and this interaction was inhibited by GST-Dyn829–842 peptide (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that CaVβ still acts through the dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. Full-length CaVβ2a Reduces the Number of Plasma Membrane CaV1.2 Channels Lacking the AID but Not WT Channels—A corollary from the above results is that free CaVβ may also be able to reduce surface expression of CaV1.2 channels when the CaVα1-CaVβ primary interaction site is disrupted. To test this possibility, we deleted the AID site of CaV1.2 (residues 459–475) to obtain CaV1.2-ΔAID channels. This mutated channel yields gating currents that, with respect to their voltage and time dependence, are indistinguishable from wild type CaV1.2 (Fig. 6, A and B), but as expected, CaVβ2a loses its ability to potentiate ionic currents (Fig. 6C). As recently corroborated by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), surface expression of CaV1.2 channels in oocytes is not altered by injection of CaVβ2a protein (Fig. 6D). In contrast, in oocytes expressing CaV1.2-ΔAID, injection of CaVβ2a reduces Qon to the same extent as did β2a-SH3 in oocytes expressing wild type CaV1.2 (Fig. 6E). To further prove that channels lacking the AID are indeed expressed in the plasma membrane and that CaVβ decreases the number of channels at the cell surface, we performed the surface expression assay with CaV1.2-ΔAID HA-tagged channels. CaVβ2a injection decreased Qon and chemiluminescence signal in CaV1.2-ΔAID-expressing oocytes (Fig. 6F). We here show that the SH3 domain of the β-subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channels promotes internalization of membrane proteins in a dynamin-dependent manner. In addition, we found that CaVβ-SH3 binds in vitro to dynamin and, since this association is inhibited by GST-Dyn829–842 peptide, we propose that this interaction is mediated by the PRD of dynamin. Nevertheless, simulated docking predictions indicate that CaVβ-SH3 is unlikely to interact with PXXP motifs unless a considerable structural rearrangement occurs (4Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The dynamin PRD-CaVβ-SH3 interaction may be mediated by non-canonical PXXP binding residues in CaVβ-SH3 or, alternatively, exposition of canonical residues may be tunable by a yet unknown regulatory protein or event. The interaction between recombinant β2a-SH3 and dynamin may reflect an in vivo phenomenon given that a SH3-only form of the CaVβ protein is expressed in cardiac cells (8Cohen R.M. Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Shah V. Hell J.W. Kamp T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2363-H2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding of CaVβ-SH3 to the protein being sequestered is not required since no interaction between the β2a-SH3 and the whole CaV1.2 channel was observed, and certainly, no association occurs with the Shaker channel. CaVβ-SH3 has been reported to associate only with isolated regions or truncated CaVα1 channels (28Maltez J.M. Nunziato D.A. Kim J. Pitt G.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi S.X. Miriyala J. Tay L.H. Yue D.T. Colecraft H.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that other cytoplasmic regions within the whole channel hinder this association. In the presence of the full-length CaVβ-subunit, calcium channels lacking the AID site, but not WT channels, are down-regulated, as though binding to CaVβ prevents the channel complex to be internalized. Since association of the CaVβ to VGCCs ensures normal channel activity, this would constitute an efficient quality control mechanism in which the same protein ensures functional fitness and survival of the channel in the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). Our recent finding that the CaVα1-CaVβ interaction is reversible at the level of the plasma membrane (9Hidalgo P. Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Garcia-Olivares J. Neely A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24104-24110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) supports this mechanism. The ability of this auxiliary subunit to influence internalization of other membrane proteins anticipates that replacement of complete signal transduction assemblies may be triggered by the presence of free CaVβ. Although the whole picture is certainly still incomplete, our findings outline a novel signaling pathway for the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2075944299,"Previous studies have shown that repeated application of TRAIL induces acquired resistance to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Using human prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 and human pancreatic carcinoma MiaPaCa-2 cells as a model, we now demonstrate for the first time that two states of acquired TRAIL resistance can be developed after TRAIL treatment. Data from survival assay and Western blot analysis show that acquired TRAIL resistance was developed within 1 day and gradually decayed within 6 days after TRAIL treatment in both cell lines. After TRAIL treatment, the level of Bcl-xL increased and reached a maximum within 2 days and gradually decreased in both cell lines. Bcl-xL-mediated development of acquired TRAIL resistance was suppressed by knockdown of Bcl-xL expression. Protein interaction assay revealed that during the development of TRAIL resistance, Bcl-xL dissociated from Bad and then associated with Bax. Overexpression of mutant-type Bad (S136A), which prevents this dissociation, partially suppressed the development of acquired TRAIL resistance. Thus, our results suggest that (a) dissociation of Bad from Bcl-xL and (b) an increase in the intracellular level of Bcl-xL are responsible for development of acquired TRAIL resistance.

It is thought that TRAIL induces apoptosis by binding to the death receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5), members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which results in conformational changes that expose a binding surface for Fas-associated death domain, an adaptor protein (4Kischkel F.C.

The adaptor molecule recruits the initiators caspase-8 and -10 to promote formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The activation of caspases has been documented by several observations, providing evidence that caspase-8, an initiator caspase, cleaves Bid and triggers mitochondrial damage and subsequently induces the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (6Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnermri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c in the cytoplasm binds to Apaf-1, which then permits recruitment of procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome protein complex. The formation of the apoptosome results in the activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 cleaves and activates procaspase-3 (7Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G.

This results in the activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3. Caspase-3 plays an important role in both death receptor- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (8Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J.

Huang X. Roth J.A. Fang B. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Several possible molecular mechanisms have been suggested for cellular resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptotic death (19Zhang L. Fang B. Cancer Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). One possibility is dysfunctions of DR4 and DR5.

Finally, a fourth possibility is that changes in proteins which affect caspase activation may produce TRAIL resistance. This includes the mutational inactivation of proapoptotic molecules (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bim, or Bid) or the overexpression of death inhibitors (FLIP, FAP-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)). These death inhibitors operate by several different mechanisms. The anti-apoptotic molecules of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) heterodimerize with pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax, Bak) and interfere with release of cytochrome c by pore-forming proteins (Bid, Bik) (29Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Members of the IAP family (c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP) directly bind and inhibit activation of caspases including caspase-3, -7, and -9 (30Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

Thus, the overexpression of these anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, IAP family, and FLIP family proteins or loss of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can result in TRAIL resistance. In this study we investigated possible mechanisms for acquired resistance to TRAIL. We observed that repeated application of TRAIL induced acquired TRAIL resistance that is transient and is developed through two different modes, activation of Bcl-xL and increase in the intracellular level of Bcl-xL. Cell Culture and Survival Assay—Human prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 cells and human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate for monolayer cell culture. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and air at 37 °C. For trypan blue exclusion assay (34Burow M.E. Weldon C.B. Tang Y. Navar G.L. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hammond T.G. Clejan S. Beckman B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4940-4946PubMed Google Scholar), trypsinized cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.2 ml of medium, 0.5 ml of 0.4% trypan blue solution, and 0.3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). The samples were mixed thoroughly, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and examined under a light microscope. At least 300 cells were counted for each survival determination. Reagents and Antibodies—Anti-cIAP-1 and anti-cIAP-2 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Flip antibody was purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Anti-PARP was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-caspase-8, anti-phospho-Ser-473-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-Bad, and anti-phospho-Ser-136-Bad were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bcl2, anti-Bax, anti-caspase-9, and anti-caspase-3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-actin was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Production of Recombinant TRAIL—A human TRAIL cDNA fragment (amino acids 114-281) obtained by reverse transcription-PCR was cloned into pET-23d (Novagen, Madison, WI) plasmid, and His-tagged TRAIL protein was purified using the Qiaexpress protein purification system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA Interference by siRNA of Bcl-xL—To stably express siRNA for the long-term knockdown, pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro vector (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) was used for clonal cell lines. The inserts for hairpin siRNA into pSilencer were prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides. For human Bcl-xL siRNA, the top strand sequence was 5′-GATCCAGGATACAGCTGGAGTCAGTTCAAGAGACTGACTCCAGCTGTATCCTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and the bottom strand sequence was 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAAGGATACAGCTGGAGTCAGTCTCTTGAACTGACTCCAGCTGTATCCT-3′. The annealed insert was cloned into pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro digested with BamHI and HindIII. The correct structure of pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro-Bcl-xL was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The resultant plasmid, pSilencer-Bcl-xL, was transfected into DU-145 cells, and hygromycin B (250 μg/ml)-resistant cell clones were isolated. The interference of Bcl-xL protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-Bcl-xL antibody. Transfection—To generate Bcl-xL overexpressing DU-145 cells, cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-neo or pcDNA3-Flag-Bcl-xL, which was kindly provided by Dr. G. Nunez (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). The expression level was determined by immunoblot analysis. Protein Extracts and PAGE—Cells were lysed with 1× Laemmli lysis buffer (2.4 m glycerol, 0.14 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.21 m sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.3 mm bromphenol blue) and boiled for 10 min. Protein content was measured with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The samples were diluted with 1× lysis buffer containing 1.28 m β-mercaptoethanol, and equal amounts of protein were loaded on 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) using a Hoefer gel apparatus. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v) at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody (diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions) for 2 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive protein was visualized by the chemiluminescence protocol (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of x-ray film was carried out by scanning densitometer (Personal Densitometer, GE Healthcare) using area integration. In Vivo Binding of Bcl-xL and Bad or Bax—To examine the interaction between Bcl-xL and Bad/Bax, DU-145 cells in 100-mm culture plates were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3Bad or pcDNA3BadS136A (kindly provided by Dr. Zieg, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for 2 days. Then the cells were treated with TRAIL (200 ng/ml) for 4 h, and attached cells were cultured for 1 or 2 days additionally. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 80 μm aprotinin, and 2 mm leupeptin, and the lysates transfected with Bad were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Bad, or the lysates without transfection were incubated with anti-Bax antibody for 2 h. After the addition of protein G-agarose, the lysates were incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Bcl-xL antibodies. The proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot hybridization, total RNAs (10 μg) isolated from cells were fractionated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gels, blotted onto Nytran Plus (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with the 32P-labeled BCL-XL or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe. Propidium Iodide Staining and Flow Cytometry—Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry were used for cell cycle analysis. Untreated control cells or attached cells after TRAIL treatment were washed with PBS, then harvested by trypsinization. Cells were suspended in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum. After washing again, each cell was resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml. 3 ml of cold absolute ethanol was added drop-wise into 1 ml of cells while gently vortexing, then cells were kept for 1 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were spun down to remove ethanol and washed twice with PBS, and 1 ml of propidium iodide staining solution (50 μg/ml) containing 0.5 mg RNase A was added. Then cells were incubated in the dark for 3 h at 4°Cand analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Hialeah, FL). Development and Decay of Acquired TRAIL Resistance—We investigated whether TRAIL resistance develops after TRAIL treatment. In the first step in this study we examined the time course of TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. TRAIL treatment led to apoptosis, as shown by cell surface blebbing and the formation of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 1A). These observations were consistent with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 1B), which is the hallmark feature of apoptosis. Fig. 1A also shows that ∼50% of the cells died and were lysed within 4 h of treatment with 200 ng/ml TRAIL. Interestingly, repopulation occurred among the remaining cells. We further examined whether these repopulated cells had the same TRAIL sensitivity. DU-145 (Fig. 2, A and B) or MiaPaCa-2 (Fig. 2C) cells were exposed to 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h, detached cells (>90% dead cells) were washed out, and then attached cells were incubated for various times before being challenged to 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h. Data from survival assay and Western blot analysis show that acquired TRAIL resistance developed immediately, was sustained for 3 days, and then gradually decayed within 6 days in both cell lines (Fig. 2). These data suggest that acquired TRAIL resistance is transient rather than intrinsic.FIGURE 2Effect of repeated TRAIL treatment on survival and proteolytic cleavage of PARP in DU-145 cells (A and B) or human pancreatic carcinoma Mia PaCa-2 cells (C). Cells were first treated with TRAIL (200 ng/ml) for 4 h, and then detached cells were removed by washing with PBS. After removal of the detached cells, fresh media were added onto the remaining attached cells and incubated for the time indicated (0-4 h or 1-6 d) and then treated a second time with TRAIL (200 ng/ml) for 4 h. Cell survival was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay (upper panel), and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for PARP or actin (lower panels). Con, untreated control cells.

Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is possible that cell cycle-dependent differential sensitivity to TRAIL may result in selection of a TRAIL resistant population. This possibility was examined with cell cycle analysis by comparing untreated control cells with attached cells after TRAIL treatment. Fig. 3 shows that TRAIL treatment reduced the G1 population by 5.1% and increased the G2/M population by 5.7%. These results suggest that even though TRAIL treatment increases the TRAIL-resistant population, the amount is not significant enough to be responsible for the development of acquired TRAIL resistance. Involvement of Bcl-xL in Acquired TRAIL Resistance—We hypothesized that expression of anti-apoptotic molecules is responsible for transient TRAIL resistance after TRAIL treatment. To test this hypothesis, the levels of several well known anti-apoptotic molecules were examined 2 days after TRAIL treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, Bcl-xL, which increased by a factor of 3, was distinctly overexpressed compared with the other anti-apoptotic molecules. Data from kinetic studies illustrate that after TRAIL treatment, the level of Bcl-xL increased and reached a maximum within 2 days and gradually decreased in both DU-145 and MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). To confirm the changes in Bcl-xL expression after TRAIL treatment, Bcl-xL gene expression was examined various times after treatment with 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h. Fig. 4D shows an increase in Bcl-xL mRNA immediately after TRAIL treatment of DU-145 cells. We further examined whether Bcl-xL plays an important role in the development of acquired TRAIL resistance by using siRNA of Bcl-xL. DU-145 cells were stably transfected with either pSilencer control plasmid or pSilencer-siBcl-xL vector. We selected several stable transfectants and chose one transfectant for further studies. Fig. 5A shows that the expression of Bcl-xL was effectively reduced in the siBcl-xL #1, #2, #3, and #5. Fig. 5, B and C, show that a single clone (siBcl-xL #1) and a pool of transfected (siBcl-xL #1, #2, #3, and #5) cells were sensitive to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. TRAIL-induced proteolytic cleavage of PARP as well as activation of caspases were increased in a single clone (siBcl-xL #1) and a pool of transfected cells (data not shown). To examine the role of Bcl-xL in the development of acquired TRAIL resistance, pSilencer control plasmid-transfected cells, single clone (siBcl-xL #1) cells, or a pool of transfected cells were treated for 4 h with 200 or 10 ng/ml (isosurvival dose) of TRAIL, respectively. After a first TRAIL treatment, detached cells were removed, and attached cells were incubated various times before a second TRAIL treatment. Fig. 6, A-C, shows that development and decay of acquired TRAIL resistance was observed in pSilencer control plasmid-transfected cells but not in siBcl-xL #1 and the pool of transfected cells. Moreover, the second TRAIL treatment enhanced cytotoxicity in siBcl-xL #1 cells. Similar results were observed with the pool of transfectants (Fig. 6C). In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-xL protected cells from TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and PARP cleavage as well as activation of caspases (data not shown).FIGURE 5TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, proteolytic cleavage of PARP, and activation of caspases in control plasmid (pSilencer) or pSilencer-siBcl-xL stably transfected DU-145 cells.

However, the kinetics of development of acquired TRAIL resistance does not exactly correspond to the kinetics of elevation of intracellular Bcl-xL level (Fig. 2 and 4, B and C). Immediately after TRAIL treatment, acquired TRAIL resistance can develop without a significant increase in Bcl-xL protein level (Fig. 2A). How can we reconcile this discrepancy? We hypothesized that two separate pathways are involved in the development of acquired TRAIL resistance after TRAIL treatment. One is dependent on the elevation of Bcl-xL level, which was described above. The other is activation of Bcl-xL, achieved by phosphorylating Bad so that Bad becomes inactive and can no longer inhibit Bcl-xL. Previous studies have shown that biologically active Bad, a pro-apoptotic molecule, is a dephosphorylated form that interacts with the Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to inhibit its anti-apoptotic function (37Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inactive form of Bad is highly phosphorylated and binds to 14-3-3 scaffold proteins and cannot interact with Bcl-xL (37Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We postulated that association of Bad with Bcl-xL inhibits the biological function of Bcl-xL, and conversely, dissociation of Bcl-xL from Bad restores Bcl-xL function. To examine whether interaction between Bcl-xL and Bad is altered by treatment with TRAIL, DU-145 cells were treated with 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h and incubated for 0-2 days. Fig. 7A shows that Bad dissociated from Bcl-xL immediately after treatment with TRAIL, and the dissociation was sustained. Fig. 7A also shows that Akt and Bad were phosphorylated after treatment with TRAIL. We hypothesized that Bad is phosphorylated by activated (phosphorylated) Akt, and TRAIL-induced phosphorylation of Bad, through Akt, is responsible for dissociation of Bad from Bcl-xL. To test the hypothesis, we employed wild-type Bad against mutant-type Bad, which cannot be phosphorylated by Akt (39Hayakawa J. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. Kanda Y. Hisamoto K. Nishio Y. Adachi K.

Fig. 7B shows that TRAIL treatment dissociated Bcl-xL from wild-type Bad but not mutant-type Bad (S136A).

https://openalex.org/W1969654809,"The expression mechanism of long-term potentiation (LTP) remains controversial. Here we combine electrophysiology and Ca(2+) imaging to examine the role of silent synapses in LTP expression. Induction of LTP fails to change p(r) at these synapses but instead mediates an unmasking process that is sensitive to the inhibition of postsynaptic membrane fusion.

COX-1 is the dominant source of housekeeping prostaglandins, whereas COX-2 synthesizes prostaglandins of relevance to pain, inflammation, and mitogenesis. Despite these distinctions, the two enzymes are remarkably conserved, and their subcellular distributions overlap considerably. To address the functional interchangeability of the two isozymes, mice in which COX-1 is expressed under COX-2 regulatory elements were created by a gene targeting knock-in strategy. In macrophages from these mice, COX-1 was shown to be lipopolysaccharide-inducible in a manner analogous to COX-2 in wild-type macrophages. However, COX-1 failed to substitute effectively for COX-2 in lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 synthesis at low concentrations of substrate and in the metabolism of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol. The marked depression of the major urinary metabolite of prostacyclin in COX-2 null mice was only partially rescued by COX-1 knock-in, whereas the main urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2 was rescued totally. Replacement with COX-1 partially rescued the impact of COX-2 deletion on reproductive function. The renal pathology consequent to COX-2 deletion was delayed but not prevented, whereas the corresponding peritonitis was unaltered. Insertion of COX-1 under the regulatory sequences that drive COX-2 expression indicated that COX-1 can substitute for some COX-2 actions and rescue only some of the consequences of gene disruption. Manipulation of COX-2 also revealed a preference for coupling with distinct downstream prostaglandin synthases in vivo. These mice will provide a valuable reagent with which to elucidate the distinct roles of the COX enzymes in mammalian biology."
https://openalex.org/W2065066076,"In a yeast two-hybrid screen of mouse brain cDNA library, using the N-terminal region of human type V adenylyl cyclase (hACV) as bait, we identified G protein β2 subunit as an interacting partner. Additional yeast two-hybrid assays showed that the Gβ1 subunit also interacts with the N-terminal segments of hACV and human type VI adenylyl cyclase (hACVI). In vitro adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity assays using membranes of Sf9 cells expressing hACV or hACVI showed that Gβγ subunits enhance the activity of these enzymes provided either Gαs or forskolin is present. Deletion of residues 77-151, but not 1-76, in the N-terminal region of hACVI obliterated the ability of Gβγ subunits to conditionally stimulate the enzyme. Likewise, activities of the recombinant, engineered, soluble forms of ACV and ACVI, which lack the N termini, were not enhanced by Gβγ subunits. Transfection of the C terminus of G protein receptor kinase 2 to sequester endogenous Gβγ subunits attenuated the ability of isoproterenol to increase cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells overexpressing hACVI even when Gi was inactivated by pertussis toxin. Therefore, we conclude that the N termini of human hACV and hACVI are necessary for interactions with, and regulation by, Gβγ subunits both in vitro and in intact cells. Moreover, Gβγ subunits derived from a source(s) other than Gi are necessary for the full activation of hACVI by isoproterenol in intact cells.

To date at least nine isoforms of membrane-bound mammalian adenylyl cyclases have been cloned and characterized (for review, see Refs. 1Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv.

All are stimulated by Gαs and, with the exception of type IX, also by forskolin. The different AC isoforms also share similar structural features consisting of a cytosolic N-terminal region, two sets of six transmembrane spans separated by a cytosolic loop (C1), and a cytosolic tail (C2) (1Smit M.J.

The N termini of the two cytosolic domains (C1a and C2a) are highly conserved among nine types of AC and form the catalytic core (5Tang W.J. Gilman A.G.

These two domains can be separately expressed and reconstituted to restore catalytic activity that is responsive to both forskolin and Gαs (6Yan S.Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.H. Tang W.J. J. Biol.

For example, ACI and ACVIII are stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin as is ACIII in vitro (3Patel T.B. Du Z. Pierre S. Cartin L. Scholich K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Cali J.J. Parekh R.S. Krupinski J. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G.

The function of the mammalian ACs can also be modulated by protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and protein kinase C. ACV and ACVI activities are inhibited by protein kinase A (14Iwami G. Kawabe J. Ebina T. Cannon P.J. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12481-12484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 15Chen Y. Harry A. Li J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas ACII and ACVII are activated by protein kinase C (16Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10630-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Watson P.A. Krupinski J. Kempinski A.M. Frankenfield C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28893-28898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in regulation between isoforms are, in part, related to the high degree of sequence variation associated with regions outside of the catalytic core. For instance, the C-terminal region of the C1 domain, C1b, is highly variable among the nine AC isoforms and has been found to be involved in some of the type-specific characteristics. In ACII, ACIV, and ACVII, the C1b region is required for stimulatory actions of Gβγ subunits (18Weitmann S. Schultz G. Kleuss C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10853-10858Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Diel S. Klass K. Wittig B. Kleuss C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The C1b region in ACI is also necessary for the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin and consequent stimulation of enzyme activity (20Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storms D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol.

Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The N-terminal segment of the different AC isoforms is also highly variable, and this region may play an important role in type-specific regulation of these enzymes. In ACVI, the N-terminal region is critical for both protein kinase C-mediated and Gαi-mediated inhibition of the enzyme (22Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Kao Y.Y. Lai H.L. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46271-46279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although the functional significance of this latter interaction remains unknown. Moreover, the N-terminal segment of ACVIII has been shown to play a critical role in regulating its activity by capacitative calcium entry in intact cells (25Gu C. Cooper D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors results in the activation of G protein α subunit and the release of Gβγ subunits from the heterotrimeric complex (26Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 27Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Both Gα subunit and Gβγ subunits can then interact with their effectors and mediate signal transduction. The known Gβγ effectors include phospholipases (28Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), ion channels (29Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), G protein-coupled receptor kinases (30Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L.

Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), and some isoforms of AC. Among the AC isoforms, ACII, ACIV, and ACVII are stimulated by Gβγ subunits provided that some Gαs is present (13Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), whereas ACI and ACVIII are inhibited by Gβγ (13Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 32Steiner D. Saya D. Schallmach E. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To date, either nothing (ACV) or very little (ACVI) is known about the role of the N-terminal segments of these enzymes in regulating their activity. Therefore, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens using the N-terminal 241 residues of human ACV (hACV) as bait and identified Gβ2 subunit as its potential interacting partner. In vitro AC activity assays showed that in the presence of Gαs or forskolin Gβγ subunits enhanced the activity of hACV and human ACVI (hACVI). The conditional stimulation (i.e. in presence of Gαs or forskolin) by Gβγ was also observed with rat ACV and rat ACVI but not canine ACV, which is distinctly dissimilar from its human and rat isoforms. The deletion of residues 77-151 in the N terminus in hACVI abolished the ability of Gβγ to conditionally stimulate activity. Consistent with this, the recombinant soluble forms of ACV and ACVI lacking the N-terminal segments were unaffected by Gβγ subunits. Furthermore, the C terminus of G proteincoupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2-CT) by sequestering Gβγ subunits in vivo decreased isoproterenol-elicited increase in cAMP accumulation in cells expressing hACVI. Pertussis toxin treatment did not affect the ability of GRK2-CT to attenuate isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells. Together these results show that the Gβγ subunits derived from sources other than Gi participate in mediating the full activation of hACVI by the β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Clontech MatchMaker Gal4 Two-hybrid System 3 was used for the screening of a mouse brain cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence encoding the N terminus of hACV (amino acid residues 1-241) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pCMVSPORT6 that contains the N-terminal region of hACV (Invitrogen). The PCR fragment was cut with BamHI and XhoI and ligated to the binding domain vector pGBKT7 digested with BamHI and SalI. The resulting pGBKT7-hACV-N was transformed into yeast strain AH109 together with empty activation domain vector pGADT7 to check for the self-activation. A mouse brain cDNA library was screened with the bait plasmid pGBKT7-hACV-N following the manufacturer's instructions. Transformed yeast cells were grown on medium devoid of Leu, Trp, His, and adenine at 30 °C for 7 days. Colonies growing on the above medium were tested for the β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids from clones showing positive β-galactosidase assay were isolated and sequenced. To test the interaction between two known proteins, AH109 yeast cells were transformed with plasmids to express hACV-N, hACVI-N (aa 1-151), or the C1 and C2 domains of hACVI as fusion proteins with GAL4 binding domain and Gβ1/GAL4 activation domain. Controls were transformed with one of the fusion constructs and the corresponding empty vector. The transformants were grown on media devoid of Trp and Leu. β-Galactosidase expression was determined using colony-lift filter assay. Cells transformed with pGADT7-T and pGBKT7-53 served as a positive control. Binding of the N-terminal Region of hACV with Gβ1γ2—The N-terminal region of hACV was fused with a GST tag (GST-hACV-N). Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified under non-denaturing conditions using glutathione affinity resin essentially as described (33Salim S. Sinnarajah S. Kehrl J.H. Dessauer C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15842-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), except that NaCl concentration was increased to 250 mm in the lysis buffer. The protein was dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Binding assays were performed with purified recombinant protein. 15 μg of GST-hACV-N or GST was incubated with 5 μg of Gβ1γ2 for 30 min at 4 °C. The glutathione beads equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2% lubrol) were added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4°Con a rotating mixer. After washing 4 times with wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% lubrol), beads were boiled in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Adenylyl Cylase Constructs and Expression—Human ACV and ACVI expressing baculovirus was generated as described before (34Chen-Goodspeed M. Lukan A.N. Dessauer C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1808-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To construct deletion mutants of hACVI, hACVIΔN (aa 1-151 deleted), hACVIΔ1-76, and hACVIΔ77-151, fragments encompassing nucleotides 1-1250 of hACVI containing deletions of nucleotides 1-453, 1-228, or 229-453, respectively, were PCR-amplified with an EcoRI site and ATG at the 5′ end. The fragments were cut with EcoRI and SstI and cloned into the cognate sites in the plasmid pFastbacdual-hACVI described before (34Chen-Goodspeed M. Lukan A.N. Dessauer C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1808-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The hACVI mutants expressing baculovirus was generated following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Baculovirus to express rat ACV was obtained from Drs. Yibang Chen and Ravi Iyengar (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine). The baculovirus to express canine ACV was obtained from Dr. Yoshihiro Ishikawa (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Both of these enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells. Rat ACVI was expressed in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA1-rACVI from Dr. Richard Premont (Duke University). Membranes from Sf9 or COS-7 cells expressing ACV and ACVI from different species or hACVI mutants were isolated as described previously (35Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 36Gao X. Patel T.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Essentially, cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and pellets were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. After homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer, cells were centrifuged at 290 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose containing the aforementioned protease inhibitors. Purification of G Protein Subunits—The constitutively active Q213L mutant form of Gαs was used. Gαs was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (7Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Gβ1γ2 subunits were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (35Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). AC Activity Assays—Gαs was preincubated with 20 μm GTPγS and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min for activation in medium containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Sf9 membranes containing the desired AC forms were preincubated at room temperature for 2 min with Gβ1γ2 or Gβ1γ2C68S at the indicated concentrations before initiating the reactions. The AC assays were performed as described before (38Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The reactions were initiated by the addition of Gαs or forskolin at the indicated concentrations and continued at room temperature for 15 min. Wherever GST-phosducin was present, 200 nm GST-phosducin (gift from Dr. Heidi Hamm, Vanderbilt University) or GST alone was preincubated with 50 nm Gβ1γ2 on ice for 20 min. In parallel, 40 nm Gαs was preincubated with 4 μgofmembranes from Sf9 cells expressing hACV or hACVI at room temperature for 10 min. Thereafter, the two preincubations were mixed together, and AC activity reaction mix was added to initiate the assays. Cyclic AMP Accumulation Assay—Cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells was monitored as described previously (36Gao X. Patel T.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The day before transfection, COS-7 cells (1.2 × 106) were seeded in 100-mm dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing hACVI, GRK2-CT, GαsQ213L, or M2 muscarinic receptor separately or together using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) as indicated in the figure legends. Empty vector was added to keep the total amount of plasmid the same for each transfection. One day later cells were trypsinized and plated in 24-well plates. The next day, cells were washed and labeled with [3H]adenine (1 μCi/well) for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. Pertussis toxin (25 nm), when present, was incubated with cells for 6 h before treatments. Cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, and preincubated for 15 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.2 mm) before the addition of agonist, isoproterenol, forskolin, or carbachol for 10 min at the indicated concentrations. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing [14C]cAMP as an internal standard to correct for recovery. Cyclic AMP in the trichloroacetic acid extracts was isolated as described above. The expression of hACVI and GRK2-CT was monitored by Western blotting using anti-ACV/ACVI antibody SC-590 (Santa Cruz) and anti-GRK2 antibody 3A10, provided by Dr. Adriano Marchese (Loyola University Chicago). Although the N-terminal region of ACVI may interact with Snapin (24Chou J.L. Huang C.L. Lai H.L. Hung A.C. Chien C.L. Kao Y.Y. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46271-46279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the functional consequences of this interaction remain unknown. Moreover, the function(s) of the relatively large N-terminal regions of hACV (241-aa residues) and hACVI (151-aa residues) has not been defined. We postulated that the N-terminal region of hACV may regulate the activity of hACV by interacting with other proteins. Therefore, to identify the proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain of hACV, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library using a construct that expressed amino acids 1-241 of hACV as bait. Of 1.1 million clones screened, we identified 11 independent clones that showed positive interactions with the N-terminal domain of hACV. Among them, Gβ2 subunit was the most interesting candidate (the other 10 clones are presented in supplemental Table S1). The interaction with Gβ2 was confirmed by re-transforming the AH109 cells with the isolated pACT2-Gβ2 and bait plasmids and monitoring β-galactosidase activity as well as the ability of the transformants to grow on medium devoid of Leu, Trp, His, and adenine (not shown). Because Gβ1 is highly homologous to Gβ2, we transformed cells with constructs to express the N-terminal region of hACV and Gβ1. Similar to the results with Gβ2, the N terminus of hACV also interacted with Gβ1 (Fig. 1A). Because hACVI and its close homologue hACV are similarly regulated (2Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), using the yeast two-hybrid assay we also investigated whether the N terminus (aa 1-151) of hACVI interacted with the Gβ1 subunit. Like its counterpart in hACV, the N-terminal segment of hACVI also showed interaction with Gβ1 (Fig. 1A). As a control, the binding domain vector pGBKT7 together with pGADT7-β1 or the activating vector pGADT7 together with pGBKT7-N-terminal region of hACV or hACVI were co-transformed into AH109. The β-galactosidase activity in these controls was similar to background (Fig. 1A). Moreover, specificity of the interactions between N termini of hACV and hACVI with Gβ1 was also demonstrated by the inability of the C1 (aa 306-673) and C2 (aa 861-1115) domains of hACVI to interact with Gβ1 (Fig. 1A). Gβ subunits are tightly bound to Gγ subunits, and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins permits the Gα and Gβγ subunits to regulate their respective effectors (26Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 37Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Therefore, using purified Gβ1γ2, we investigated whether Gβ1γ2 bound the N-terminal region of hACV. As shown in Fig. 1B, the N-terminal region of hACV, which was expressed in and purified from bacteria as a GST fusion (GST-hACV-N), interacted with Gβ1, confirming our data from the yeast two-hybrid assay. Next, we tested the ability of Gβ1γ2 to modulate hACV and hACVI activity. Membranes from Sf9 cells expressing hACV or hACVI were preincubated with Gβ1γ2 and then stimulated with forskolin or Gαs. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, Gβ1γ2 did not affect the basal activity of hACV or hACVI. However, Gβ1γ2 increased the activation of hACV and hACVI by forskolin or Gαs (Fig. 1, C and D). Gβ1γ2 was more effective at augmenting hACVI activity than hACV (Figs. 1, C and D). Thus, 100 nm Gβ1γ2 increased the activity of hACV stimulated by forskolin or Gαs by 57 and 106%, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for hACVI were 133 and 194%, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the isoprenylation of Gγ subunit is required for Gβγ to modulate their effectors (38Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), controls were also performed with mutant of Gγ2(C68S) that cannot be isoprenylated. As shown in Figs. 1, C and D, the non-isoprenylated Gβ1γ2(C68S) did not further stimulate Gαs or forskolin-stimulated hACV or hACVI activity. Moreover, when phosducin, which binds and sequesters Gβγ (39Muller S. Straub A. Schroder S. Bauer P.H. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11781-11786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was added, the ability of Gβ1γ2 to stimulate hACV or hACVI activities was obliterated (Fig. 1E). Overall, the data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the N termini of ACV and ACVI specifically interact with Gβ1γ2 and that isoprenylation is required for Gβ1γ2-mediated enhancement of forskolin- or Gαs-stimulated hACV and hACVI activity. Moreover, the sequestration of Gβ1γ2 by phosducin abolishes the ability of Gβ1γ2 to stimulate hACV and hACVI activities. We also determined if the Gβ1γ2 subunits altered the ability of purified, myristoylated Gαi to inhibit hACVI. Essentially, the ability of Gαi to inhibit Gαs-stimulated activities of hACVI was monitored. As shown for hACVI in supplemental Fig. S1, Gβ1γ2 did not alter the ability of Gαi to inhibit the activities of hACVI. These data show that Gβ1γ2 specifically alters the ability of Gαs to stimulate hACV and hACVI. Gβ1γ2 enhanced Gαs-stimulated hACV and hACVI activity in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of ∼10 nm (Fig. 2A). This value is similar to the EC50 value for the conditional stimulation of ACII by Gβγ subunits (18Weitmann S. Schultz G. Kleuss C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10853-10858Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gβ1γ2 altered the efficacy or potency of forskolin and Gαs to stimulate hACVI, enzyme activity was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of forskolin or Gαs with and without Gβ1γ2. As shown in Figs. 2, B and C, Gβ1γ2 did not alter the EC50 values of forskolin or Gαs to stimulate hACVI. However, the maximal stimulation by both forskolin and Gαs was markedly increased in the presence of Gβ1γ2 (Figs. 2, B and C). These data clearly show that Gβ1γ2 increases the efficacy of both forskolin and Gαs. The ability of Gβγ to augment hACV and hACVI activity in the presence of Gαs is reminiscent of the conditional stimulation of the activities of ACII and ACIV by Gβγ subunits (40Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 41Gao B.N. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10178-10182Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, here onward the term “conditional stimulation” is used to describe the effects of Gβγ subunits on ACV and ACVI. Because the Gβγ binding sites on ACII have been reported to reside in the C2 domain and the C1b region (18Weitmann S. Schultz G. Kleuss C.

In a search for new regulators of ARF signaling, we discovered a novel nuclear protein that we named NIAM (nuclear interactor of ARF and MDM2) for its ability to bind both ARF and the p53 antagonist MDM2. NIAM protein is normally expressed at low to undetectable levels in cells because of, at least in part, MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When reintroduced into cells, NIAM activated p53, caused a G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and collaborated with ARF in an additive fashion to suppress proliferation. Notably, NIAM retains growth inhibitory activity in cells lacking ARF and/or p53, and knockdown experiments revealed that it is not essential for ARF-mediated growth inhibition. Thus, NIAM and ARF act in separate anti-proliferative pathways that intersect mechanistically and suppress growth more effectively when jointly activated. Intriguingly, silencing of NIAM accelerated chromosomal instability, and microarray analyses showed reduced NIAM mRNA expression in numerous primary human tumors.

ARF, the alternative reading frame product of the INK4a/ARF locus (1Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), is a potent tumor suppressor and key activator of p53 (2Lowe S.W. Sherr C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Sherr C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Once expressed, ARF protects cells against oncogenic transformation by stimulating p53-mediated expression of apoptotic and growth inhibitory genes (3Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E.

Together, p53 and ARF are two of the most commonly inactivated genes in human cancers (6Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys.

Notably, ARF also acts through other regulators besides p53 to suppress cancer, as revealed by its ability to inhibit the growth of cells lacking functional p53 (8Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E.

The fact that ARF and p53 are both inactivated in a significant percentage of human tumors also suggests distinct tumor suppressor activities for each protein (13Nicholson S.A. Okby N.T.

Our understanding of ARF signaling is incomplete but improving as more ARF-associated proteins are identified (for review, see Ref. 16Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). It is well established that ARF induces p53 transcriptional activity by binding and inactivating MDM2 (mouse double minute-2; HDM2 in humans) (2Lowe S.W. Sherr C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). MDM2 is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) 3The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; CIN, chromosomal instability; TKO, triple knock-out; DKO, double knock-out. and p53 transcriptional target that acts in a negative autoregulatory feedback loop to restrict p53 activity (17Iwakuma T. Lozano G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar). Although the majority of ARF resides in nucleoli, accumulating evidence suggests that an active fraction of ARF stimulates p53 by binding MDM2 in the nucleoplasm (18Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, recent work shows that ARF is bound and sequestered in the nucleolus by nucleophosmin (also called B23), thereby inhibiting ARF-p53 signaling by restricting ARF-MDM2 association in the nucleoplasm (19Korgaonkar C.

Additional complexity to ARF-p53 signaling is suggested by the fact that ARF associates with several other proteins that directly regulate p53 (23Hasan M.K. Yaguchi T. Sugihara T. Kumar P.K.R.

The regulation of this pathway is not well understood but is presumably mediated by the individual or combined actions of many different ARF-binding proteins (16Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Recent studies imply important roles for such diverse factors as ARF-binding protein-1 (27Chen D. Kon N. Li M. Zhang W. Qin J.

This study explores a new ARF-associated protein, NIAM (nuclear interactor of ARF and MDM2), which we show has intrinsic anti-proliferative activity that intersects with the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway. NIAM can relocalize ARF into the nucleoplasm, stabilizes and activates p53, and is down-regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, NIAM normally helps maintain chromosomal stability. This is significant because a defining feature of most cancers is genetic instability, and NIAM is down-regulated in a variety of human tumors. Together, these findings suggest that NIAM may be a novel modifier or suppressor of tumorigenesis. Cell Culture—Most cell types were maintained in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2-4 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, including human 293T; PANC-1, and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma (both provided by Joseph Cullen, University of Iowa); U2OS osteosarcoma; U2OS-derived, Narf6-expressing, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible p14ARF (provided by Gordon Peters, London Research Institute); MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma (provided by Lori Wallrath, University of Iowa); and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer (provided by Lori Wallrath), 22Rv1 prostate cancer (provided by Michael Henry, University of Iowa), and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer (provided by Joseph Cullen) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, with additional 2.5 g/liter d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate for BxPC-3 cells. Cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 3 h to inhibit the proteasome. DNA Constructs—Mouse and human wild-type NIAM cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from normal liver and pancreas cDNA pools (Clontech), respectively. Primers containing ClaI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites were used to amplify the murine (forward, 5′-CCATCGATAGCGTGTTGAGCGGCCTGGCC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGAATTCAATCTGAAGACTGAATTG-3′) and human (forward, 5′-ACATCGATACCATGAGCCTGCTGGACG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGAATTCAATCTGAAGACTGAATTGGGC-3′) NIAM cDNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA).

For mammalian cell expression, cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or a modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (40Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Production of ecotropic retroviruses in 293T cells and infections of mouse fibroblasts were performed as described (1Quelle D.E.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3145-3150PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analyses—NIAM mRNA expression was measured in human tissue cDNA panels (Clontech) by semiquantitative PCR for 34 cycles with the same primers used to clone fulllength NIAM (see above). As a control, the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified for 22 cycles using the forward primer 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. For quantitative assays, real-time RT-PCR was performed with total cellular RNA that was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Reverse transcription of NIAM mRNA was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using a high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as specified by the manufacturer. Subsequent PCRs consisted of 40 ng of cDNA added to 12.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.25 μl (0.6 μm) of gene-specific NIAM primers (forward, 5′-CAGGATGAAAAAGCTCCCGAA-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCAGCATTTTCAAACACCGTG-3′), and PCR-grade water to a total reaction volume of 25 μl. PCR was performed as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, with annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min on an ABI 7000 real-time sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). -Fold differences in NIAM mRNA expression were calculated using NIAM expression calibrated to 18 S ribosomal RNA expression and computed using ABI relative quantitation software (Applied Biosystems). In Vitro Binding Assays—Coupled in vitro transcription and translation of plasmids containing human or mouse NIAM were performed using the TnT kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with equivalent amounts of GST or GST-human ARF proteins that were previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Protein complexes were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with 1 mm NaF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed with 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid, stained with Coomassie Blue, and dried. Autoradiography and phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare) were used to detect protein interactions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Frozen cell pellets were lysed on ice in Nonidet P-40 buffer and briefly vortexed, and lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min prior to sonication (1 × 5-s pulse) and clarification by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed using protein A- or G-Sepharose plus antibodies against mouse p19ARF (1Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), human p14ARF (Sigma, mouse monoclonal, clone DCS-240, 2 μg/immunoprecipitation), the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Roche Applied Science, rat monoclonal, clone 3F10, conjugated to agarose, 10 μl/immunoprecipitation), NIAM (rabbit polyclonal against a C-terminal peptide of NIAM (NH2-CLKSPSQASPIQSSD-COOH), referred to as NIAM-C, 10 μg/immunoprecipitation), and p16INK4a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal, catalog no. sc-1207, 2.5 μg/immunoprecipitation). Immune complexes were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein (50-100 μg/lane) were loaded on gels as a control for relative protein expression levels. Proteins were detected on membranes by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) with antibodies against mouse p19ARF (Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA), rabbit polyclonal, Ab-1, 0.7 μg/ml), human p14ARF (2 μg/ml), MDM2 (monoclonal, clone 2A10, 1:50 dilution; and Oncogene Research Products, mouse monoclonal, Ab-1, 1 μg/ml), p53 (Oncogene Research Products, sheep polyclonal, Ab-7, 1:2,500 dilution), anti-p21 (Pharmingen, mouse monoclonal, clone 6B6, 1.5 μg/ml), green fluorescent protein (GFP; Abcam (Cambridge, MA), rabbit polyclonal, ab290, 1:5000 dilution), γ-tubulin (Sigma, mouse monoclonal, clone GTU-88, 1:10,000 dilution), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam, mouse monoclonal, ab8245, 1:10,000 dilution), HA (conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 1:1000 dilution), and NIAM-C (1.5 μg/ml). Colony Formation Assays—Narf6 cells were transfected with the pXM-HA vector or pXM-HA-NIAM (human wild-type) along with one-tenth the amount of GFP (pEGFP-C3, Clontech). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, GFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACSDiva instrument (BD Biosciences) and plated in triplicate at 1 × 103 cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture dish with or without 1 mm IPTG to induce ARF expression. Dishes were cultured for 14 days before colonies were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa. Subcellular Localization—Narf6 cells were transfected with the pXM-HA vector or pXM-HA-NIAM (mouse or human wild-type) on glass coverslips in a 6-well dish. One day posttransfection, cells were treated with or without 1 mm IPTG to induce ARF expression, and 16-24 h later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Human ARF was stained using anti-human p14ARF antibody (1 μg/ml), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, 1:200 dilution), and Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences, 1:200 dilution). Exogenous HA-NIAM was detected using HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (Roche Applied Science, 1:100 dilution). Nuclei were visualized by staining with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml for 1 min, and samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Cell Cycle Analyses—Cell cycle progression into S phase was measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation into replicating DNA (9Korgaonkar C. Zhao L. Modestou M. Quelle D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μm BrdUrd was added for 22-24 h to the medium of cells 1 day post-transfection (3 days post-infection of p53-/-/Mdm2-/-/Arf-/--NIAM short hairpin RNA (shRNA; referred to as shNIAM) or p53-/-/Mdm2-/-/Arf-/--control shRNA (referred to as shCON) MEFs). Cells (3.5 × 104/well in 8-well poly-l-lysinecoated chamber slides; BD Biosciences) were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) at -20 °C, treated with 1.5 n HCl, and sequentially stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody (Abcam, sheep polyclonal, 8 μg/ml), biotinylated anti-sheep IgG (Amersham Biosciences, 1:200 dilution), Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (1:200 dilution). Exogenous HA-NIAM and nuclei were stained as described above, and the BrdUrd positivity of NIAM expressors was quantified by counting under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The statistical significance of the data was analyzed by a unpaired, two-tailed, equal variance Student's t test. To determine the cell cycle distributions of GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells after transfections with GFP, GFP-NIAM, and GFP-ARF constructs, cells were sorted on a FACS-Diva instrument, stained with propidium iodide, and assayed for DNA content using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) as described (24Zhao L. Samuels T. Winckler S. Korgaonkar C. Tompkins V. Horne M.C. Quelle D.E. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometric profiles were analyzed using ModFit LT Version 2.0 software. p53 Reporter Assays—A p53 reporter construct containing p53-responsive promoter elements fused to the firefly luciferase gene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was cotransfected into U2OS cells with varying amounts of pXM-HA-NIAM with or without pcDNA3-p14ARF (human; 3 μg) plus varying amounts of empty pXM-HA for a constant amount of DNA (12 μg) per transfection. A pRL-SV40 construct containing Renilla luciferase (Promega, 80 ng) was included in all transfections to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was measured in duplicate or triplicate from at least three independent experiments 48 h post-transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) and a Sirius V3.1 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Ubiquitination Assays—In vivo ubiquitination of HA-NIAM was measured in U2OS cells cotransfected with His-tagged ubiquitin (provided by Mary Horne, University of Iowa) and pXM-HA or pXM-HA-NIAM plus empty vector, pcDNA3-HDM2 (wild-type), or an HDM2 mutant (Ala466-473; provided by Karen Vousden, Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, Scotland, UK). Two days post-transfection, cells were treated with or without proteasome inhibitors (clasto-lactacystin β-lactone at 5 μm for 4 h or MG132 at 50 μm for 3 h). Cells were lysed in 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) plus 5 mm imidazole and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were sonicated, and ubiquitinated proteins were bound for 2 h at room temperature on 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (prewashed with the lysis buffer) as described (42Xirodimas D.P. Chisholm J. Desterro J.M.S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Samples were washed extensively as described (43Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), and His-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in 5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 30% glycerol, and 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol. Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-NIAM antibody (both anti-HA and anti-NIAM-C antibodies were used separately to obtain confirmatory results). RNA Interference—NIAM (shNIAM, 5′-ACTGGAAGTTCTGAAGAAA-3′) and control (shCON, 5′-ACTGGAAGTGCTGAAGAAA-3′) target shRNAs were designed using OligoEngine targeting software (www.oligoengine.com) according to criteria established by Brummelkamp et al. (44Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3967) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) were annealed (3 μg each in 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and 2 mm magnesium acetate) and cloned into pSUPER.retro.neo.GFP (OligoEngine). Stable polyclonal populations of NIH 3T3 cells and primary MEFs expressing the NIAM knockdown (shNIAM) or control point mutant (shCON) shRNA targeting constructs were generated by transfection or retroviral infection, respectively, followed by cell sorting for GFP-positive cells on a FACSDiva instrument. Stable NIH 3T3 populations were further selected in 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) for 2 weeks and maintained in 0.4 mg/ml G418 thereafter. Metaphase Analyses—Metaphase spreads were prepared by standard protocols as described previously (45Wang P. Greiner T.C. Lushnikova T. Eischen C.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3708-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing MEFs (p53-/-/Mdm2-/- and p53-/-/Mdm2-/-/Arf-/-) lacking or expressing NIAM were treated at passage 14 with Colcemid (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Cells were then stained with both propidium iodide (Sigma) and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Blinded counts were performed on at least 50 separate metaphase spreads by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Melville, NY) with MetaVue software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Identification of a Novel ARF- and MDM2-interacting Protein, NIAM—To identify novel factors within the ARF signaling pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and discovered several new ARF-associated proteins (46Tompkins V. Hagen J. Zediak V.P. Quelle D.E. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 641-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most frequently identified ARF partner in the screen was NIAM, which we named based on findings presented herein that it is a nuclear interactor of ARF and MDM2. Full-length mouse and human NIAM cDNAs, which have nearly 90% nucleotide homology, were cloned by RT-PCR after identifying identical cDNA sequences within the data bases. 4The GenBank™ Data Bank accession numbers for the original nucleotide sequences of mouse and human NIAM are XM_134725 and CR616019, respectively. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the NIAM transcript is widely expressed at low levels in most human tissues, with the highest expression observed in the pancreas, lung, and liver (Fig. 1A). When translated in vitro, the cDNAs encoded polypeptides of ∼50 kDa (human NIAM) and 55-60 kDa (mouse NIAM) that bound directly with purified GST-tagged ARF (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the mouse and human NIAM proteins (84% amino acid identity) are predicted to contain nuclear/nucleolar localization sequences; a lysine-rich region; and two poorly understood domains rich in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and arginine (FYRN and FYRC) thought to mediate protein-protein associations (Fig. 1C) (47Hsieh J.J.D. Ernst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To examine the association between endogenous NIAM and ARF proteins, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of NIAM and screened a large number of cell lines and non-transformed primary cells for NIAM expression. We consistently observed very low to undetectable levels of endogenous NIAM protein expression, particularly in human cancer cell lines (data not shown). Notably, NIAM expression was much higher in MEFs lacking p53 compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 2A). Endogenous NIAM expression was also elevated in immortalized NIH 3T3 fibroblasts compared with primary wild-type MEFs, although these levels were minor in comparison with exogenous HA-NIAM levels in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. We took advantage of the fact"

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of the membrane lipid environment in ClC-2 function, and in particular the effect of cholesterol and ClC-2 distribution in membrane microdomains. Detergent-resistant and detergent-soluble microdomains (DSM) were isolated from stably transfected HEK293 cells by a discontinuous OptiPrep gradient. ClC-2 was found concentrated in detergent-insoluble membranes in basal conditions and relocalized to DSM upon cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. As assessed by patch clamp recordings, relocalization was accompanied by acceleration of the activation kinetics of the channel. A similar distribution and activation pattern were obtained when cells were treated with the oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide and after ATP depletion. In both cases activation was prevented by cholesterol enrichment of cells. We conclude that the cholesterol environment regulates ClC-2 activity, and we provide evidence that the increase in ClC-2 activity in response to acute oxidative or metabolic stress involves relocalization of this channel to DSM.

Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Although a number of roles have been suggested for this channel to date, its biological significance still remains a fundamental question. It has been suggested to participate in epithelial transport processes (2Lipecka J. Bali M. Thomas A. Fanen P. Edelman A. Fritsch J. Am. J.

Smith R. Schaack J. Wilcox C. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this respect, ClC-2 mutations have been found in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (5Haug K. Warnstedt M. Alekov A.K. Sander T. Ramirez A. Poser B. Maljevic S. Hebeisen S. Kubisch C. Rebstock J. Horvath S. Hallmann K. Dullinger J.S. Rau B. Haverkamp F. Beyenburg S. Schulz H. Janz D. Giese B. Muller-Newen G. Propping P. Elger C.E. Fahlke C. Lerche H. Heils A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In addition, ClC-2 has been proposed to be the molecular candidate for the native cardiac inward-rectifying chloride channels (6Duan D. Ye L. Britton F. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E63-E71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been speculated that the physiological role of these channels in the heart may become more prominent under pathological conditions, such as ischemia and hypoxia (6Duan D. Ye L. Britton F. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E63-E71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ClC-2 is activated by hyperpolarization, extracellular acidification, and hypotonic cell swelling (7Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated additional regulation by protein kinases (8Fritsch J.

McKinzie S. Zinsmeister A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G942-G947Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the influence of membrane lipids on ClC-2 activity has not yet been investigated. Among membrane lipid components, cholesterol plays an active role in regulating the lipid bilayer dynamics and structure. Experimental evidence indicates that it is involved in the assembly and maintenance of sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich microdomains (16Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar, 17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8054) Google Scholar). These are known as “detergent-insoluble membranes” (DIM), 3The abbreviations used are: DIM, detergent-insoluble membranes; DSM, detergent-soluble microdomains; HEK, human embryonic kidney; mβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TBH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: DIM, detergent-insoluble membranes; DSM, detergent-soluble microdomains; HEK, human embryonic kidney; mβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TBH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. or most commonly “lipid rafts.” These structures are implicated in signal transduction, intracellular trafficking of lipids and proteins, and translocation of solutes across the membrane (18Martens J.R. Sakamoto N. Sullivan S.A. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8409-8414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5136) Google Scholar). DIM have been proposed to concentrate various membrane proteins such as signal transduction enzymes, membrane receptors, ion transporters, and channels (20Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 21Kabouridis P.S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since the first demonstration of Kv2.1 channel localization to lipid microdomains (18Martens J.R. Sakamoto N. Sullivan S.A. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and that the cholesterol-rich environment is important for their activity. Yet little is known about the possible association of anionic channels with lipid rafts, except for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which has been proposed to relocalize to DIM upon stimulation of the inflammatory response (27Kowalski M.P. Pier G.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cholesterol has also been shown to regulate volume-activated anion current in endothelial cells (28Levitan I. Christian A.E. Tulenko T.N. Rothblat G.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Romanenko V.G. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but in the absence of the molecular identity of these volume-dependent channels, their precise localization is unknown. Our results suggest that another class of anionic channel, ClC-2, is significantly present in cholesterol-rich microdomains (DIM) in both transfected HEK293 cells and native tissues. DIM disruption by cholesterol depletion increases the kinetics of channel activation, whereas membrane enrichment in cholesterol exerts an opposite effect. We also provide evidence that the previously demonstrated increase in ClC-2 activity in response to acute oxidative or metabolic stress involves dissociation of this channel from DIM. Constructs, Cells, and Animals—The cDNA of rat ClC-2 was kindly provided by T. J. Jentsch (Hamburg, Germany). The cDNA was subcloned either in pIRES-EGFP, which enables the expression of a nontagged ClC-2 protein, or pQBI25-fC1, which generates an N-terminal GFP-ClC-2 fusion protein. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transiently transfected with pQBI25-fC1 plasmid or stably transfected with a linearized pIRES-EGFP plasmid, and selection was done with 500 μg/ml G418. In a set of experiments, tissues were obtained from C57BL/6 mice (Centre de Distribution, Typage and Archivage CNRS, Orléans, France). Treatments—All chemicals were from Sigma except where indicated otherwise. For cholesterol depletion, cells were preincubated for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by 30 min in the presence of 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) at 37 °C. Cholesterol replenishment was performed by removal of mβCD-containing medium and incubation for 45 min in a solution containing a cholesterol-mβCD complex (water-soluble cholesterol; Sigma), at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml cholesterol and 2.5 mm mβCD. Cholesterol enrichment prior to any treatment was performed by exposing cells for 2 h to the same cholesterol-mβCD complex. In control patch clamp analyses, the mβCD analogue α-cyclodextrin was utilized. Oxidation was stimulated by 30 min of incubation in 1.5 mm tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH). Inhibition of glycolysis was achieved by incubating cells for 3 h in a glucose-free Ringer's solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, and 2 mm glutamine. ATP depletion was performed by adding 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, and 1 μm antimycin A to the Ringer's solution. Cells were further incubated for 90 min. Preparation of Lipid Membrane Microdomains—Cells were grown to confluence, washed twice in cold PBS, and transferred to centrifuge tubes. Two additional washes were performed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 tablet/10 ml of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Tissue samples from heart, brain, and kidney were homogenized in a hypotonic solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated in lysis buffer with or without 1% saponin. Cell lysates were passed 10 times through a 21-gauge needle, and 200 μl of lysate were mixed with 400 μl of a 60% OptiPrep solution (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) (40% final concentration). A three-step discontinuous OptiPrep gradient was prepared by layering 1.2 ml of 30% OptiPrep in detergent-free lysis buffer and 600 μl of buffer alone on top. Gradients were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 2 h at 4°C in a Beckman XL-70 ultracentrifuge, using a swinging 55-Ti rotor. After spinning, eight fractions of 300 μl were recovered from each gradient. DIM reach their isopycnic point at the interphase 0/30% OptiPrep (fractions 2 and 3). In most experiments, fractions were pooled to obtain DIM (fractions 2–4) and DSM (fractions 6–8) preparations. Immunoblotting—For whole-cell protein analysis, 20 μl of gradient fractions were resuspended in modified 2× Laemmli containing 7 m urea. For surface protein analysis, cells were previously incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) and subjected to OptiPrep gradient as described above. Biotinylated (surface) proteins were recovered by incubation of gradient fractions with agarose bead-immobilized monomeric avidin (Pierce). The avidin-containing pellets were resuspended in modified Laemmli. Samples were heated at 37 °C for 2 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE in an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 3.5 m urea. The amount of ClC-2 in each fraction was estimated by Western blot. Briefly, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk diluted in TBS/Tween 0.1%. Membranes were incubated with an anti-ClC-2 antibody (clone H-90; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted at 1:500. Raft marker flotillin-1 (Flo-1) was detected by a monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) diluted at 1:1000 and a non-raft marker transferrin receptor by a monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted at 1:1000. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were enabled to visualize protein signal after incubation with ECL solution. In some experiments, the protein concentration of each fraction was determined by the DC method (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein per well were loaded. Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type ClC-2 were grown on polylysine-precoated coverslips, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS/Triton and incubated at 4 °C overnight with the primary ClC-2 antibody (ACL-002; Alomone Labs, Israel; final dilution 1:250 in PBS/Triton). After washing and blocking with 5% normal goat serum, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa-fluor 594; Molecular Probes). Glass coverslips were mounted using the Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined by confocal laser microscopy (Axiovert 100 M; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Controls were carried out on cells expressing the pIRES vector alone or by peptide competition using ClC-2 antibodies preincubated for 1 h with a 5-fold excess of the corresponding peptide antigens. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature as described previously (13Hinzpeter A. Lipecka J. Brouillard F. Baudoin-Legros M. Dadlez M. Edelman A. Fritsch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C45-C56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Current recordings were performed using either the classical or the nystatin-perforated whole-cell patch clamp configuration. Nystatin stock solution (50 mg/ml) was prepared daily in Me2SO. Aliquots were diluted (1:250) in the internal solutions and sonicated for at least 30 s. The bath solution contained the following (in mm): 150 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes-Na+, and 35 sucrose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 60 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 35 Na2SO4, 10 Hepes, pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH. Changes in liquid junction potential were calculated and taken into account. For recordings using the standard whole-cell configuration, the bath solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes-Na+, and 20 sucrose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 29 NaCl, 33 CsCl, 71 sodium gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes-Na+, 2 EGTA, 2 MgATP, pH 7.3. Currents were recorded by application of regular voltage pulses of desired length and amplitude from a holding potential of 0 mV with an interval of at least 60 s to allow current deactivation. Time courses for activation and deactivation were described by fitting a mono- or double exponential plus a constant term as shown in Equation 1, I(t)=Afexp(−t/τf)+Asexp(−t/τs)+A0 (Eq. 1) where I(t) is current as a function of time; Af, As, and A0 are fast, slow, and time-independent constants, respectively, and τf and τs are the fast and slow time constants. The relative open probability as a function of voltage was estimated from measurements of the initial currents at 40 mV after each negative test voltage jump. The conductance values were adjusted by using a Boltzmann distribution as shown in Equation 2, G=Go+Gmax/(1+exp(V−V0.5)/k) (Eq. 2) where G, Go, and Gmax are conductance as a function of voltage, residual conductance, and maximal conductance (extrapolated), respectively. V0.5 is the voltage at which 50% activation occurs, and k is the slope factor. All measured values are presented as means ± S.E. The significance of differences between means was determined using either paired or unpaired t test when appropriate. Cholesterol and Phospholipid Analysis—Cholesterol and phospholipid content were monitored by thin layer chromatography. The lipid-containing organic phase was obtained from gradient fractions by liquid-liquid extraction with 6 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min, and the resulting lower phase was aspirated. For cholesterol analysis, aliquots of 4 μl of the different samples and cholesterol standard were applied to HP-K plates (Whatman, Clifton, NJ), developed in chloroform/acetone (95:5 v/v), stained with the CuSO4 reagent, and developed by charring at 170 °C. For phospholipid analysis, two sequential mobile phases were utilized as follows: chloroform/triethylamine/ethanol/water (30:30:34:8) and hexane/diethyl ether (100:4.5). The resulting bands were analyzed by the Imagemaster software (Amersham Biosciences). ClC-2 Is Partially Localized to Cholesterol-rich Microdomains in HEK293 Cells and Mouse Tissues—To evaluate the microdomain distribution of ClC-2, stably transfected HEK293 cells were subjected to 1% Triton X-100 incubation and a discontinuous gradient. After analysis of an equal volume aliquot of each fraction, ClC-2 was found almost equally distributed in fractions 3 and 6 (Fig. 1A, 1st panel). However, when an equal protein amount per fraction was loaded, ClC-2 was found mostly associated with fraction 3 (Fig. 1A, 2nd panel). Fractions 3 and 6 correspond to DIM and DSM, respectively, as confirmed by the distribution of DIM markers flotillin-1, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin and of DSM marker transferrin receptor. Under these migration conditions, ClC-2 can be detected either as a single or as a double band when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. As this pattern differs from the one that is usually described, we aimed to confirm the identity of ClC-2. Both bands, which are absent from cells transfected with the empty plasmid (mock), were identified by mass spectrometry as ClC-2 (data not shown). We also analyzed the distribution of endogenous ClC-2 in mouse heart, brain, and kidney. In these tissues, a significant fraction of ClC-2 was detected in DIM (Fig. 1B). Addition of 1% saponin (a cholesterol-solubilizing detergent) to the lysis buffer induced a decrease in the amount of DIM-associated ClC-2, suggesting that DIM localization in these tissues is cholesterol-dependent (not shown). Fig. 1C shows the quantification of ClC-2 concentration by total protein in DIM and DSM in cells and tissues, which reveals a tissue-specific variability in the partial association of this channel with cholesterol-containing (DIM) fractions. Thus, ClC-2 presence per protein content is about 2-fold higher in DIM than in DSM in HEK293 cells, almost equally distributed in both domains in brain and heart, and about 3-fold lower in DIM versus DSM in kidney (Fig. 1C). In subsequent experiments, and based on the distribution of DIM and DSM markers, fractions 2–4 were pooled as DIM, and fractions 6–8 as DSM. The effect of cholesterol content modulation was first evaluated biochemically. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with the cholesterol-depleting agent mβCD (10 mm, 30 min) led to a relocalization of ClC-2 to DSM. This effect was reversed by cholesterol replenishment, as found by addition of the cholesterol-mβCD complex, which significantly reduced the presence of ClC-2 in DSM, and returned to control values. Fig. 2B shows the effect of cholesterol enrichment by direct incubation of cells with the cholesterol-mβCD complex, which redistributed ClC-2 to DIM as compared with the control. The densitometric analysis indicates that ClC-2 relocalization to DSM following mβCD treatment is significant both at the cell surface and in the total cell. The effect of cholesterol-mβCD complex alone on ClC-2 distribution is also significant in both pools (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D shows the changes in cholesterol content of DIM and DSM induced by the different conditions tested. mβCD induced a significant decrease in cholesterol in both domains. This effect was reversed by subsequent cholesterol replenishment, whereas cholesterol enrichment significantly increased its content in DSM. These results clearly indicate a link between cholesterol content and ClC-2 solubility. Modulation of Cholesterol Content Affects Channel Function—The effect of cholesterol depletion or enrichment on channel function was analyzed in transfected HEK293 cells using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Because preincubation of cells with mβCD did not allow us to regularly obtain tight seals, in most experiments tests were performed after cell break in using nystatin. ClC-2 currents were recorded in response to negative voltage jumps followed by a +40-mV step. Fig. 3A shows traces obtained by hyperpolarization to –120 mV in the same cell, before and after exposure to 10 mm mβCD for 30 min. Current activation was clearly faster after cell treatment by the drug. By contrast, cholesterol enrichment by preincubation of cells for 2 h with the cholesterol-mβCD complex resulted in slower kinetics of current activation. Mean current densities at –120 mV were not significantly different before and after treatment of 18 cells with mβCD (–1.11 ± 0.11 nA and –1.12 ± 0.08 nA, respectively), whereas current amplitude was reduced when cells were cholesterol-enriched (–0.65 ± 0.08 nA, n = 7, p < 0.005). No changes were observed either in cells incubated with 10 mm of the inactive stereoisomer α-cyclodextrin or in cells transfected with enhanced GFP alone (not shown). As described previously, ClC-2 current activation at negative potentials and deactivation at +40 mV displayed fast and slow components (30Zuniga L. Niemeyer M.I. Varela D. Catalan M. Cid L.P. Sepulveda F.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 555: 671-682Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Quantification of changes in the activation or deactivation kinetics was done by fitting Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to the current relaxations at –120 and +40 mV. Fig. 3B shows the time constants of current activation. Both constants were statistically decreased by mβCD treatment, whereas they were increased after cholesterol enrichment. When cholesterol-depleted cells by mβCD were further incubated for 45 min with the cholesterol-mβCD complex, activation constants were similar to the values measured in control cells, indicating that the effect of mβCD could be reversed by cholesterol replenishment. The fractional amplitudes of the fast (12.7 ± 2.1), slow (73.2 ± 2.5), and instantaneous (16.9 ± 2.2) components were not statistically affected by treatments (not shown). The kinetics of channel closure at a positive potential were not modified by cholesterol depletion or enrichment treatments, as shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Current deactivation parameters in ClC-2-transfected HEK293 cells subjected to different treatmentsTreatmentτ fast (s)Af (%)τ slow (s)As (%)Ao (%)nPerforated whole-cell configuration Control0.24 ± 0.0221.3 ± 1.81.83 ± 0.0958.0 ± 2.220.7 ± 3.018 mβCD (cholesterol-depleted)0.20 ± 0.0223.7 ± 2.71.61 ± 0.1256.5 ± 1.919.8 ± 2.318 Cholesterol-mβCD complex (cholesterol-enriched)0.19 ± 0.0223.6 ± 1.02.03 ± 0.1550.7 ± 2.525.7 ± 3.07 mβCD + cholesterol-mβCD complex (cholesterol-replenished)1.16 ± 0.0222.8 ± 1.11.69 ± 0.1150.9 ± 3.726.3 ± 3.36 Oxidation0.15 ± 0.014ap < 0.005.18.1 ± 1.52.01 ± 0.1654.8 ± 5.027.2 ± 2.28Conventional whole-cell configuration 2 mm ATP0.25 ± 0.0218.3 ± 1.12.07 ± 0.1555.7 ± 2.026.0 ± 1.928 2 mm AMP0.19 ± 0.01bp < 0.05.26.4 ± 4.8bp < 0.05.1.73 ± 0.2356.7 ± 3.316.9 ± 4.89a p < 0.005.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab The voltage dependence of currents was estimated in some cells by recording families of currents evoked at negative and positive potentials. Representative current traces elicited from a holding potential of 0 mV in response to negative test pulses followed by pulses to +40 mV are illustrated in Fig. 3C. Steady-state activation curves (Equation 2) are illustrated in Fig. 3D. mβCD treatment and cholesterol enrichment resulted in a rightward and leftward shift of the Po/V curve, respectively. The V0.5 and slope factors were –109 ± 2 and –25 ± 2 mV (n = 15) for control cells, –94 ± 5 and –20 ± 2 mV for mβCD-treated cells (n = 6), and –137 ± 4 and –27 ± 3 mV for cholesterol-enriched cells (n = 5). From these curves it can be observed that the fraction of channels opened in the range of physiological potentials (around –60 to –80 mV) was substantially higher in cells treated by mβCD as compared with cells enriched in cholesterol. Modulation of Cholesterol Content Affects Plasma Membrane Channel Distribution—Subcellular ClC-2 localization was assessed by two approaches as follows: (i) by confocal immunocytochemistry, using a ClC-2 antibody previously validated by complete absence of labeling in tissues from ClC-2 KO mice (31Pena-Munzenmayer G. Catalan M. Cornejo I. Figueroa C.D. Melvin J.E. Niemeyer M.I. Cid L.P. Sepulveda F.V. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and (ii) by examining the GFP fluorescent signal of a GFP-ClC-2 construct transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Confocal images of middle sections of cells under different cholesterol conditions are shown in Fig. 4A. Similar patterns of ClC-2 labeling were obtained by the two detection methods. Prior to any treatment, ClC-2 exhibited a markedly punctate staining pattern in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, suggesting the concentration of this protein in certain membrane microdomains (Fig. 4A, panels a and b). Cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4A, panels c and d) induced a discrete modification in the membrane distribution of channels, which became more regularly scattered over the membrane surface. By contrast, incubation of cells with cholesterol-mβCD complex for 2 h clearly diminished plasma membrane staining (Fig. 4A, panels e and f). The specificity of ClC-2 immunostaining was assessed either by the absence of labeling in cells transfected with an empty plasmid (Fig. 4A, panel g) or by the absence of labeling when ClC-2 antibodies were preincubated with an excess of the corresponding peptide antigen (Fig. 4A, panel h). The decrease in ClC-2 expression at the plasma membrane when cells were enriched in cholesterol was confirmed by Western blotting of surface-biotinylated ClC-2 (Fig. 4B). Oxidative and Metabolic Stress Affect Channel Function—In an attempt to find a physiopathological significance for the cholesterol-dependent regulation of ClC-2 activity, we tested oxidative and metabolic stress as exogenous stimuli that have been proven to activate the channel (11Huber S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2114402010,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2α (PI3K-C2α) is a type II PI-3-kinase that has been implicated in several important membrane transport and signaling processes. We previously found that overexpression of PI3K-C2α inhibits clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking and induces proliferation of novel clathrin-coated structures within the cytoplasm. Using fluorescently tagged fusions of PI3K-C2α and clathrin, we explored the behavior of these structures in intact cells. Both proteins are present in the structures, and using rapid image acquisition and fluorescence photoactivation probes, we find that they exhibit localized, rapid mobility (5–20 μm/s). The movement is micro-tubule-based as revealed by use of inhibitors, and PI3K-C2α accumulates on microtubules rapidly and reversibly following cytoplasmic acidification, which also blocks movement. Dynactin mediates the movement of these clathrin-PI3K-C2α structures, since disruption of dynactin function by overexpression of its p50 subunit also inhibits movement. Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments reveal an interaction between endogenous PI3K-C2α and dynactin subunits. Together, these results reveal a molecular linkage between PI3K-C2α and the microtubule motor machinery, with implications for membrane trafficking in intact cells.

Clathrin-coated membranes are ubiquitous in all eukaryotic cells. They play key roles in physiological processes, such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and other forms of vesicular transport (reviewed in Refs. 1Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C.

An appreciation of the dynamic behavior of CCS was initially inferred from biochemical and cell biological experiments (reviewed in Ref. 6Roth M.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and was directly observable with the advent of fluorescently tagged coat proteins microinjected into cells or transiently expressed as a GFP-tagged fusion protein (7Gaidarov I.

Several lines of evidence identify coated pits as relatively stationary spots on the plasma membrane of cells that periodically disappear and reappear in a “blinking” process, construed to reflect internalization into short lived coated vesicles that undergo rapid uncoating. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the cytoskeleton interfaces with vesicular transport at many levels. Involvement of actin in endocytosis in yeast has been well established (10Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell. 2005; 16: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that microtubules (MTs) also function at several stages in vesicular transport. For example, the long range movement of AP-1- and GGA1-coated structures can be abolished by disruption of MT (15Puertollano R. van der Wel N.N. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S.

Phosphoinositides play a regulatory role in many of these processes, since they bind to proteins that regulate both coated pit assembly and cargo binding, and the cytoskeletal motor machinery (reviewed in Refs. 19Haucke V.

We have been interested in a novel PI3K implicated in clathrin-dependent functions. Besides being a downstream effector of growth factor receptors like other PI3Ks (22Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A.

Commun. 2003; 306: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2α (PI3KC2α) has recently been found to be essential for ATP-dependent priming of neurosecretory granule exocytosis (24Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Hammond G.R. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Domin J. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4841-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our previous work has shown that PI3K-C2α is highly enriched in clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (25Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11943-11950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and this localization may reflect both its clathrin binding and catalytic activities (26Gaidarov I. Zhao Y. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40766-40772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further, overexpression of PI3K-C2α results in inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane trafficking (27Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and is also accompanied by the appearance of numerous CCSs occurring throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. This is in striking contrast to the localization of clathrin in virtually all eukaryotic cells, in which the coat structure is localized on the PM and TGN, and to a considerably lesser extent on peripheral, endosomal membranes (8Keyel P.A. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13190-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Here we use live cell imaging techniques to demonstrate that these unique structures contain both clathrin and PI3K-C2α. Further, they exhibit rapid, localized motility, which may reflect their presence as coated buds or segments on membrane tubules. The movement is attributable to interaction with the MT motor machinery, probably mediated by interaction of PI3K-C2α with dynactin. Our results indicate that the dynamics and function of CCSs in cells can be modulated by their interaction with PI3K-C2α.

George Patterson and Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health), were cloned into the Sal and SmaI sites of pMTSM-PI3K-C2α. pMTSM-Glu-p50 was generated by cloning full-length p50 (excised from GFP-p50-N1, a generous gift of Dr. Richard Vallee, Columbia University, New York) into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pMTSM vector, and Glu was inserted into the Sal and SmaI sites. pRSET-B mCherry was from Dr. Roger Y. Tsien (University of California San Diego). PA-GFP-Clathrin-C1 and mCherry-Clathrin-C1 were constructed by the same strategy as GFP-Clathrin-C1 (7Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Reagents—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-human PI3K-C2α was generated by injection of His-tagged PI3K-C2α-2–365. Monoclonal antibodies against p150 and p50 were purchased from BD Biosciences. A monoclonal antibody against the Glu epitope was from Research Diagnostics. Monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody DMα1 and polyclonal anti-p50 antibody were generous gifts from Dr. Mark Black (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). A monoclonal antibody anti-clathrin (X22) was from the American Type Culture Collection, and polyclonal anti-clathrin antibody R5 has been described (25Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11943-11950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nocodazole, taxol, latrunculin B, and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. Immunoprecipitation—Cells with or without ectopically expressed PI3K-C2α were lysed in 100 mm MES (pH 6.8), 0.1% Triton, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (27Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were challenged with polyclonal anti-p50 or anti-PI3K-C2α antibody and blotted with anti-p150, anti-p50, and anti-PI3K-C2α antibodies. Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunostaining of transiently transfected COS1 cells was performed as described previously (7Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 27Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) except that for p50 staining cells were permeabilized in 0.05% saponin, 100 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA for 30 s before fixation. For live cell imaging, transfected COS1 cells were seeded into glass bottom culture dishes (Mat-Tek). After spreading, the complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced with HEPES-supplemented F-12 medium, and images were acquired at the indicated time intervals. For pharmacological treatments, cells were first imaged before treatment and then incubated in complete medium containing 10 μg/ml nocodazole, 1 μm taxol, 1.2 μm latrunculin B, or 30 μm cytochalasin D for the indicated periods. The cells were then transferred into HEPES-supplemented F-12 medium containing the corresponding chemical reagents, and images were acquired as indicated. Cold treatment was performed by incubation on ice for 2–3 h, followed by cold 3.7% formalde-hyde fixation. For acidification treatment, cells were incubated in acetic acid-adjusted Ringer buffer (pH 5) for 2 min before imaging or fixation; no effects were seen at pH 7. Cellular ATP was depleted by the addition of 0.3% NaN3 in culture medium lacking glucose and serum for 10–15 min, and images were acquired in the same medium. Samples were imaged using ×63 Planapo/1.4 numerical aperture objectives on either a Zeiss 510 Meta laser confocal system or a Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV wide field microscope system equipped with a Photometrics Cascade camera controlled by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Inc.). Simultaneous imaging of YFP and mCherry signals was accomplished using a Dual-view system (Optical Insights, Inc.). Photoactivation experiments were performed on a Zeiss 510 Meta laser confocal system. Regions of interest of ∼7–14 μm2 were photoactivated using a diode laser (405 nm, 25 milliwatts) at a 52% setting, and images were recorded by excitation with an argon laser (488 nm, 30 milliwatts) at a 5% setting. GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analysis of normalized pixel intensities. PI3K-C2α Induces Cytoplasmic Clathrin-coated Structures with Rapid Movement—Our previous work has shown that overexpression of PI3K-C2α inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane trafficking (27Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is also accompanied by the appearance of numerous intracellular CCSs. To learn more about the nature of these novel structures, we investigated their behavior in live COS1 cells transiently expressing both PI3K-C2α and GFP-clathrin. Upon direct observation through the microscope eyepiece, we unexpectedly found that these structures were moving rapidly within the cytoplasm of cells. This is readily apparent in single maximum projection images (Fig. 1A) formed by combining stacks of 15 images captured at 36-ms intervals from cells expressing GFP-clathrin alone (control) or cells expressing both GFP-clathrin and PI3KC2α. Whereas the CCSs in the control cells appear virtually stationary on this approximately 0.5-s total time scale, as observed previously (7Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 8Keyel P.A. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13190-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Ehrlich M. Boll W. Van Oijen A. Hariharan R. Chandran K. Nibert M.L. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2004; 118: 591-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), the blurriness in the PI3K-C2α projection suggests considerable movement. Another appreciation of this difference is evident on examination and overlay of individual frames (Fig. 1B); CCS spots in the control over this ∼360-ms time span show virtually no movement, and overlay of the frames reveals almost perfect superimposition. In contrast, the position of the GFP-clathrin signal changes dramatically between frames in the PI3K-C2α-expressing cells, as revealed by the lack of spot coincidence in the overlay image. Finally, a complete animation sequence of these images in real time provides dramatic evidence of the remarkable rate and nature of this movement (available as supplemental Video 1, right panel). It was possible to discern several kinds of movement in the animation sequences of cells expressing PI3K-C2α and GFP-clathrin. Occasionally, we could see GFP-CCSs decorating ring-like structures of 1–2 μm diameter, presumably vesicles or vacuoles, and these CCSs consistently ran along the perimeter during a several-s observation time. Interestingly, very few of the dynamic CCSs in the PI3K-C2α-expressing cells appeared to be moving vectorially over substantial distances. This is evident both in the general absence of long tracks in the maximum projection image in Fig. 1A (in which two short atypical translational movements are indicated by the arrows) and on viewing the video sequence (supplemental Video 1, right panel). Rather, within several frames (i.e. comprising less than 0.4 s), the overwhelming majority of CCSs seem to completely disappear from their origins, and new structures appear in the field. We reasoned that the highly motile behavior of the intracellular CCS might depend directly on the presence of PI3K-C2α in the coat structure. To test this hypothesis, we prepared GFP/YFP-PI3K-C2α fusion protein constructs and confirmed that, like nonfluorescent PI3K-C2α, they also caused the appearance of intracellular CCSs and inhibition of transferrin uptake upon overexpression in cells (Fig. S1). We then expressed both mCherry-clathrin and YFP-PI3K-C2α in COS1 cells and monitored the behavior of the proteins using simultaneous imaging of both signals. YFP-PI3K-C2α was almost entirely associated with mCherry-clathrin spots (Fig. S2), and both proteins were observed to move together in the cytoplasm with the rapid dynamics described above (supplemental Video 2). This result is consistent with our previous observation that ≥90% of exogenous PI3K-C2α spots colocalized with intracellular clathrin in fixed cells (27Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Since these structures contain both clathrin and PI3KC2α, we refer to them here as PI3K-C2α-CCS. The remarkable mobility of PI3K-C2α-CCSs, as compared with CCSs in control cells, also suggests that PI3K-C2α is capable of imparting motility to CCSs. Upon examining the movement of some GFP-PI3K-C2α-CCS spots, it was occasionally possible to follow their positions for short periods and when they could be tracked in three or more successive frames to estimate velocities (see examples in Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Video 3). The apparent speed of CCSs measured in this way varied greatly, with many moving at 5–10 μm/s but some exhibiting much higher apparent velocities, occasionally exceeding 20 μm/s (Fig. 1C). These enlarged images also suggested that the GFP-clathrin signal might comprise a coated tubular region as well as a discrete bud, although movement could also affect the appearance of these structures. The proliferation of intracellular CCSs with rapid dynamics was also observed upon expression of PI3K-C2α in human 293 or HeLa cells, as well as in Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Together, these observations indicate that PI3K-C2α expression induces the appearance of novel CCSs that move extremely rapidly but linearly only over very short distances if at all. PI3K-C2α-CCSs Show Restricted Mobility—The nonvectorial movement of the PI3K-C2α-CCSs suggested that the overall mobility of the particles, though extremely rapid, might actually be limited to a local region. To learn more about their behavior, we utilized a photoactivable variant of GFP (PA-GFP) (30Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Expressing this reporter alone, we found that after photoactivation of a small region, PA-GFP fluorescence intensity dropped rapidly (see a representative example in Fig. 2 and supplemental Video 4) with an apparent half-time of about 1 s (n = 11 cells), although this is likely to be an overestimate, since it is on the time scale of photoactivation and signal acquisition. This probably reflects the rate of diffusion of the ∼27-kDa protein in situ, since GFP has been shown to have minimal interaction with cellular constituents (32Luby-Phelps K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 192: 189-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the diffusion properties of PA-GFP in cells are experimentally indistinguishable from those of GFP. 4E. N. Pugh, Jr., personal communication. The PA-GFP-PI3K-C2α fusion protein was then expressed. When subjected to whole cell photoactivation, its overall fluorescence pattern and rapid movement were indistinguishable from that obtained upon expression and conventional imaging of GFP-PI3K-C2α, confirming the similar behavior of the two proteins (data not shown). Following photoactivation of a small area of cells expressing PA-GFP-PI3K-C2α, a biphasic decay curve was observed with a rapid component and much slower phase (representative examples in Fig. 2 and supplemental Video 5). An experimentally indistinguishable curve was observed when cells co-expressing nonfluorescent PI3K-C2α and PA-GFP-clathrin were subjected to photoactivation (Fig. 2 and supplemental Video 6), indicating that under these conditions the two proteins not only colocalize (Fig. S2) but also move together at this level of resolution. Analysis of 15 data sets from PA-GFP-PI3K-C2α-expressing cells revealed a minor fast decay component of about 1.7 s. This may reflect a soluble pool of PA-GFP-PI3K-C2α that contributes a diffuse background signal. The 8-fold greater mass of PA-GFPPI3K-C2α compared with PA-GFP would be expected to exhibit a 2-fold slower diffusion rate. The major PA-GFP-PI3K-C2α fluorescence decay component exhibited a much greater half-time of ∼14.3 ± 1.3s(n = 15 cells), suggesting several possible interpretations. The ∼20-fold decrease in signal decay rate (compared with PA-GFP) could indicate that PA-GFP-PI3K-C2α is incorporated into free particles of more than 108 Da. This would correspond to extremely large coat structures, containing more than 100 clathrin and PI3K-C2α molecules. Alternatively, it could reflect restriction of PI3K-C2α-CCS movement by interaction with cellular components (e.g. the cytoskeleton). It is also possible that the PI3K-C2α-CCSs are present as coated segments on membrane tubules, as implied by recent ultra-structural images (26Gaidarov I. Zhao Y. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40766-40772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This tethering might then be expected to restrict long range movements. Although further ultrastructural work will be required to fully resolve these or other possibilities, we chose here to explore the potential involvement of motor machinery in the movement of the PI3K-C2α-CCS in intact cells. Fast Motility of CCSs Induced by PI3K-C2α Is MT-dependent—The characteristic rapid movement of PI3K-C2α-CCS was greatly inhibited by metabolic poisoning (e.g. 0.3% sodium azide, 10 min). However, incubation of cells with either cytochalasin D (30 μm, 40 min) or latrunculin B (1 μm, 30 min), which both ablated microfilament structure in cells, was without noticeable effect, indicating that actin micro-filaments were not critical to mobility (data not shown). In contrast, the MT-targeted drugs nocodazole (data not shown) and taxol significantly affected the movements of PI3K-C2α-CCS. This is reflected by the sharpening of the maximum projection image of time stacks for GFP-clathrin observed in the same cell before and after treatment for 60 min with taxol (Fig. 3). Similarly, examination of real time GFP-clathrin image sequences also shows a significant inhibition of movement after taxol treatment (compare supplemental Videos 7 and 8). This is consistent with published results indicating taxol inhibition of MT-based vesicle transport, a consequence of MT accumulation and bundling (33Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Kim P.Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 955-966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Alayof B.E. Himmel H.M. Kim P.Y. Crews A.L. Strauss H.C. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the interaction of PI3K-C2α and clathrin with microtubules came from two other lines of experiments. In the course of utilizing an acid wash step to dissociate cell surface receptor-ligand complexes, we serendipitously observed a radical change in the distribution of GFP-PI3K-C2α in intact cells. Remarkably, incubation of cells at pH 5 for 1–2 min, which has been shown to cause cytoplasmic pH to drop to pH ∼6 (37Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), caused the characteristic punctate pattern of PI3KC2α to now be supplemented by a striking filamentous localization (Fig. 4, compare A and B). Immunostaining for tubulin confirmed that these linear structures were indeed MTs and that essentially all were decorated with PI3K-C2α (Fig. 4B). The punctate component of the PI3K-C2α signal, which for the most part continued to colocalize with clathrin, was also often found on MTs, although there was some cell variability in this distribution. Importantly, acidification virtually abolished the rapid movement of PI3K-C2α-CCS (supplemental Video 9). These effects were readily reversible, since replacement of the acidification buffer with neutral medium restored the characteristic rapid movement of PI3K-C2α-CCS within 2–5 min (data not shown). We found further evidence for an interaction of PI3K-C2α and clathrin with MTs upon chilling cells. Although cold treatment largely depolymerized MTs in most COS1 cells and yielded a punctate tubulin staining pattern, some cells retained noticeable filament staining, as often seen in cells of fibroblastic origin (38Denarier E. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Bosc C. Pirollet F. Chapel A. Margo-lis R.L. Job D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6055-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In these cells, GFP-PI3K-C2α underwent a significant redistribution to a largely filamentous pattern, periodically decorated by punctate signal (Fig. 4C). The punctate signal corresponded precisely with clathrin, as revealed by immuno-staining in these cells (Fig. 4C), whereas the filamentous pattern comprised decoration of apparently cold-stable MT along their length with GFP-PI3K-C2α. Together, these experiments reveal a clear interaction of PI3K-C2α with MT and suggest that this interaction is required for the rapid motility of the PI3K-C2α-CCS. Inhibition of this movement is probably a consequence of arrest at a pH- and temperature-sensitive step of a functional complex involving PI3K-C2α and MTs. Dynactin Subunits Associate with PI3K-C2α and Contribute to Motility—It is well known that dynactin is a critical factor in MT-dependent movements (39Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To confirm the dependence of PI3K-C2α-CCS movement on MT and to explore the possible role of dynactin in its rapid motility, we employed several approaches. First, we expressed the p50 subunit of dynactin (also termed dynamitin) and examined its distribution in comparison with endogenous PI3K-C2α. Expression of Glu (epitope-tagged)-p50 yielded a largely punctate pattern, which substantially overlapped with that of endogenous PI3K-C2α (Fig. 4D). Next, we found that a stable interaction of PI3K-C2α with dynactin components could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. When endogenous dynactin p50 was immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of COS1 cells expressing epitope-tagged PI3K-C2α (Fig. 5A), the"
