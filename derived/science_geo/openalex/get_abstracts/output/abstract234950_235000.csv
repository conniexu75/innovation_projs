https://openalex.org/W4231154852,"THAT 2-hydroxypyrimidine, a simple derivative of a much investigated series, should be incorrectly described in the literature is unexpected. Nevertheless, the properties attributed to this substance by Johnson and Joyce1, the only workers who have claimed its synthesis, make it unlikely that it has ever been prepared. As the 2-hydroxy-group is present in the biologically important pyrimidines (cytosine, uracil, thymine), it is important to have authentic 2-hydroxypyrimidine available for the interpretation of spectra and for biochemical and biological comparisons."

https://openalex.org/W2031614321,"OUR knowledge as to the constitution of the coloured compound formed by the interaction of phenol with freshly prepared ferric chloride solution is very meagre. Brode and Wesp1 suggested that the violet-red colour is probably due to an ion of the type [Fe(OPh)6]−3; but they have not presented any evidence in its favour. We have studied the reaction by four different methods: thermometric, conductometric, absorption and transport measurements. Thermometric and conductometric titration curves of phenol with ferric chloride solutions show two breaks corresponding to Fe+3: phenol equal to 1 : 3 and 1 : 6; so these may be supposed to represent the formation of the compounds Fe(OPh)3 and H3[Fe(OPh)6]. By applying Job's method of continued variation, it is found that, for equimolecular solutions, the maxima in the optical density curve against the volume of one of the reactants appear at the point Fe+3: phenol equal to 1:3. The maxima of the curves are found to be independent of the wave-length (490 µ, 550 µ) and the concentration of the reactants used, and so are due to the formation of the compound Fe(OPh)3. Now the compound Fe(OPh)3 may also be formulated as Fe[Fe(OPh)6], in which case also the ratio of Fe+3: phenol is equal to 1:3. When ferric chloride – phenol solutions are shaken with non-polar organic solvents, the coloured compound is not found to be partitioned between the two liquid phases, and this supports the formulation of Fe(OPh)3 as Fe[Fe(OPh)6]. Finally, transport experiments by Duval's apparatus with solutions containing ferric chloride and phenol in the ratio 1:3 show that iron goes to the anode and thus give additional and direct evidence in favour of the formulation Fe[Fe(OPh)6]."

https://openalex.org/W1976671439,"FROM a recent study of geomagnetic ‘sudden commencements’ at seven magnetic observatories, Ferraro and Parkinson1 suggested the possible dependence on magnetic longitude of the occurrence of what they termed “Type II” sudden commencements, that is, the type in which the increase in the horizontal force H is preceded by a smaller preliminary movement in the opposite direction."

https://openalex.org/W2016216722,"IN a recent communication1 with the above title, Davies and Phillipoff have described X-ray diffraction experiments with multilayers of lead stearate on chrome-plated brass, which they interpret as deciding certain controversies regarding the micellar structure of soap solutions and the X-ray diffraction patterns from such solutions. Actually, it appears that their experiments have little bearing upon the soap solution results, because they differ in at least three important ways from the situation in real soap solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2987568176,"THE observational evidence provided in the letters which have appeared under this heading in Nature of April 29 and earlier suggests to a meteorologist that scintillation may be associated with waves at an interface between two currents of air. It is rather unlikely to be associated with turbulence because in a turbulent (that is, well-mixed) atmosphere the light from the star from one moment to another, passing, as it does, through thousands of random eddies, would be most unlikely to vary appreciably or in any systematic manner."

This result was accepted internationally until Nier2 calculated the value 190.2, now accepted as the international value, from mass spectrographic data. The method used by Gilchrist involved the ignition of ammonium hexabrom- and hexachlor-osmate IV in hydrogen to osmium metal. The ammonium hexahalogenates were crystallized several times from 7 or 10 per cent halogen acid."

https://openalex.org/W2127041747,"RECENTLY, Euler et al.1,2 have described a peculiar effect of certain normal, as well as sarcomatous, rat sera on the stainability of tumour cells. When smear preparations of mouse ascites carcinoma or rat Jensen sarcoma were incubated with the sera, a distinct loosening of the internal structure of the nuclei, demonstrated by May-Grünwald and Giemsa stains, and a total loss of Feulgen nucleal reaction, were observed. This effect was termed the ‘karyolytic effect’. It was also noticed when smear preparations of rat liver pulp were incubated with some samples of normal and sarcomatous rat sera. Human and rabbit blood serum, however, did not show the effect. No relationship appeared to exist between the effect observed in the case of certain rat sera and any known physiological, pathological or dietetic factors. Recent attempts3 to provoke ‘karyolysis’ by active immunization have not yet yielded any distinct positive results."

https://openalex.org/W2022773006,"IN considering the self-energy problem on the basis of the multiple-time formalism of quantum electrodynamics, Wentzel1 has obtained the relation where mn(s) is the rest-mass of a field-free particle, mn the corresponding mass in an electromagnetic field and s the particle extension. If we now assume that mn(s) and mn refer to the masses of two fundamental particles M1 and M2 (expressed in terms of the electron mass m) it follows directly from equation (1) that"

In a forthcoming communication5, I propose to examine in the light of these tables a suggestion made by Dadieu and Kohlrausch6 that the ‘mean restoring force’ of a linkage may be used as a measure of bonding strength. The authors found that for C—C, C=C and C≡C linkages the mean restoring forces were closely in the ratio 1:2:3."
