https://openalex.org/W2076407031,"E-cigarettes have generated controversy in the tobacco control field similar to that of Swedish snus, which came to the U.S. market six years earlier. Some argue that e-cigarettes have great potential to help smokers quit regular cigarettes while others contend they should be banned for lack of safety and efficacy data. This study examined population data from the U.S.A U.S. population survey with a national probability sample (N=10,041) was conducted (February 24 to March 8, 2012, before any major paid advertisement of e-cigarettes appeared on television). Survey respondents were asked if they had heard about e-cigarettes, where they had heard about them, whether they had used e-cigarettes or snus, how often they used them, and why they used them. Responses were weighted to represent the entire U.S. population.A high proportion, 75.4%, reported having heard about e-cigarettes. Television ranked as the number one source of information, followed by ""in-person conversation"" and ""Internet."" About 8.1% had tried e-cigarettes, and 1.4% were current users. These rates were twice those of snus (4.3% and 0.8%, respectively). Among current smokers, 32.2% had tried e-cigarettes, and 6.3% were current users. Over 80% of current e-cigarette users were non-daily users. Women were significantly more likely to have tried e-cigarettes than men. Those who had tried e-cigarettes were more likely than those who tried snus to report their products being safer than regular cigarettes (49.9% vs. 10.8%). Almost half (49.5%) of current smokers were susceptible to using e-cigarettes in the future.That e-cigarettes have surpassed snus in adoption rate, even before any promotion by major tobacco companies, suggests that the former have tapped into smokers' intuitive preference for potentially harm-reducing products, probably due to the product design. E-cigarette use is likely to increase in the next few years."
https://openalex.org/W2081829478,"The mammalian protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) has been implicated in roles of transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, RNA splicing, cell differentiation, and metastasis. However, the type of reaction that it catalyzes and its substrate specificity remain controversial. In this study, we purified a recombinant mouse PRMT7 expressed in insect cells that demonstrates a robust methyltransferase activity. Using a variety of substrates, we demonstrate that the enzyme only catalyzes the formation of ω-monomethylarginine residues, and we confirm its activity as the prototype type III protein arginine methyltransferase. This enzyme is active on all recombinant human core histones, but histone H2B is a highly preferred substrate. Analysis of the specific methylation sites within intact histone H2B and within H2B and H4 peptides revealed novel post-translational modification sites and a unique specificity of PRMT7 for methylating arginine residues in lysine- and arginine-rich regions. We demonstrate that a prominent substrate recognition motif consists of a pair of arginine residues separated by one residue (RXR motif). These findings will significantly accelerate substrate profile analysis, biological function study, and inhibitor discovery for PRMT7."
https://openalex.org/W2037170187,"Climate change is likely to have severe effects on water availability in Ethiopia. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of climate change on the Gilgel Abay River, Upper Blue Nile Basin. The Statistical Downscaling Tool (SDSM) was used to downscale the HadCM3 (Hadley centre Climate Model 3) Global Circulation Model (GCM) scenario data into finer scale resolution. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up, calibrated, and validated. SDSM downscaled climate outputs were used as an input to the SWAT model. The climate projection analysis was done by dividing the period 2010-2100 into three time windows with each 30 years of data. The period 1990-2001 was taken as the baseline period against which comparison was made. Results showed that annual mean precipitation may decrease in the first 30-year period but increase in the following two 30-year periods. The decrease in mean monthly precipitation may be as much as about -30% during 2010-2040 but the increase may be more than +30% in 2070-2100. The impact of climate change may cause a decrease in mean monthly flow volume between -40% to -50% during 2010-2040 but may increase by more than the double during 2070-2100. Climate change appears to have negligible effect on low flow conditions of the river. Seasonal mean flow volume, however, may increase by more than the double and +30% to +40% for the Belg (small rainy season) and Kiremit (main rainy season) periods, respectively. Overall, it appears that climate change will result in an annual increase in flow volume for the Gilgel Abay River. The increase in flow is likely to have considerable importance for local small scale irrigation activities. Moreover, it will help harnessing a significant amount of water for ongoing dam projects in the Gilgel Abay River Basin."
https://openalex.org/W2042423282,"Reliable evidence of trends in the illegal ivory trade is important for informing decision making for elephants but it is difficult to obtain due to the covert nature of the trade. The Elephant Trade Information System, a global database of reported seizures of illegal ivory, holds the only extensive information on illicit trade available. However inherent biases in seizure data make it difficult to infer trends; countries differ in their ability to make and report seizures and these differences cannot be directly measured. We developed a new modelling framework to provide quantitative evidence on trends in the illegal ivory trade from seizures data. The framework used Bayesian hierarchical latent variable models to reduce bias in seizures data by identifying proxy variables that describe the variability in seizure and reporting rates between countries and over time. Models produced bias-adjusted smoothed estimates of relative trends in illegal ivory activity for raw and worked ivory in three weight classes. Activity is represented by two indicators describing the number of illegal ivory transactions--Transactions Index--and the total weight of illegal ivory transactions--Weights Index--at global, regional or national levels. Globally, activity was found to be rapidly increasing and at its highest level for 16 years, more than doubling from 2007 to 2011 and tripling from 1998 to 2011. Over 70% of the Transactions Index is from shipments of worked ivory weighing less than 10 kg and the rapid increase since 2007 is mainly due to increased consumption in China. Over 70% of the Weights Index is from shipments of raw ivory weighing at least 100 kg mainly moving from Central and East Africa to Southeast and East Asia. The results tie together recent findings on trends in poaching rates, declining populations and consumption and provide detailed evidence to inform international decision making on elephants."
https://openalex.org/W2035922639,"Insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by hepatic steatosis combined with inflammation, are major sequelae of obesity. Currently, lifestyle modification (i.e., weight loss) is the first-line therapy for NASH. However, weight loss resolves steatosis but not inflammation. In this study, we tested the ability of resolvin D1 (RvD1), an anti-inflammatory and proresolving molecule, to promote the resolution initiated by calorie restriction in obese mice with NASH. Calorie restriction reduced adipose and liver weight (–56 and –13%, respectively; P< 0.001), serum leptin and resistin levels, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. In addition to these, mice receiving RvD1 during the dietary intervention showed increased adiponectin expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and reduced liver macrophage infiltration (–15%, P<0.01). Moreover, RvD1 skewed macrophages from an M1- to an M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotype, induced a specific hepatic miRNA signature (i.e., miR-219-5p and miR-199a-5p), and reduced inflammatory adipokine mRNA and protein expression and macrophage innate immune response. In precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs), which override the influence of circulating factors, RvD1 attenuated hypoxia-induced mRNA and protein expression of COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCR7. Of note, RvD1 anti-inflammatory actions were absent in macrophage-depleted PCLSs. In summary, RvD1 acts as a facilitator of the hepatic resolution process by reducing the inflammatory component of obesity-induced NASH.—Rius, B., Titos, E., Morán-Salvador, E., López-Vicario, C., García-Alonso, V., González-Périz, A., Arroyo, V., Claria, J.

https://openalex.org/W2083160536,"The cellular form of the prion protein (PrP(C)) is found in both full-length and several different cleaved forms in vivo. Although the precise functions of the PrP(C) proteolytic products are not known, cleavage between the unstructured N-terminal domain and the structured C-terminal domain at Lys-109↓His-110 (mouse sequence), termed α-cleavage, has been shown to produce the anti-apoptotic N1 and the scrapie-resistant C1 peptide fragments. β-Cleavage, residing adjacent to the octarepeat domain and N-terminal to the α-cleavage site, is thought to arise from the action of reactive oxygen species produced from redox cycling of coordinated copper. We sought to elucidate the role of key members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) enzyme family, as well as Cu(2+) redox cycling, in recombinant mouse PrP (MoPrP) cleavage through LC/MS analysis. Our findings show that although Cu(2+) redox-generated reactive oxygen species do produce fragmentation corresponding to β-cleavage, ADAM8 also cleaves MoPrP in the octarepeat domain in a Cu(2+)- and Zn(2+)-dependent manner. Additional cleavage by ADAM8 was observed at the previously proposed location of α-cleavage, Lys-109↓His-110 (MoPrP sequencing); however, upon addition of Cu(2+), the location of α-cleavage shifted by several amino acids toward the C terminus. ADAM10 and ADAM17 have also been implicated in α-cleavage at Lys-109↓His-110; however, we observed that they instead cleaved MoPrP at a novel location, Ala-119↓Val-120, with additional cleavage by ADAM10 at Gly-227↓Arg-228 near the C terminus. Together, our results show that MoPrP cleavage is far more complex than previously thought and suggest a mechanism by which PrP(C) fragmentation responds to Cu(2+) and Zn(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W2088309143,"The goal of this work is to introduce new metrics to assess risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which we call AD Pattern Similarity (AD-PS) scores. These metrics are the conditional probabilities modeled by large-scale regularized logistic regression. The AD-PS scores derived from structural MRI and cognitive test data were tested across different situations using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The scores were computed across groups of participants stratified by cognitive status, age and functional status. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations with the distribution of conversion times from mild cognitive impairment to AD. The performances of classifiers developed using data from different types of brain tissue were systematically characterized across cognitive status groups. We also explored the performance of anatomical and cognitive-anatomical composite scores generated by combining the outputs of classifiers developed using different types of data. In addition, we provide the AD-PS scores performance relative to other metrics used in the field including the Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD (SPARE-AD) index and total hippocampal volume for the variables examined."
https://openalex.org/W2122303322,"Monitoring and describing the physical movements and body postures of animals is one of the most fundamental tasks of ethology. The more precise the observations are the more sophisticated the interpretations can be about the biology of a certain individual or species. Animal-borne data loggers have recently contributed much to the collection of motion-data from individuals, however, the problem of translating these measurements to distinct behavioural categories to create an ethogram is not overcome yet. The objective of the present study was to develop a “behaviour tracker”: a system composed of a multiple sensor data-logger device (with a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope) and a supervised learning algorithm as means of automated identification of the behaviour of freely moving dogs. We collected parallel sensor measurements and video recordings of each of our subjects (Belgian Malinois, N=12; Labrador Retrievers, N=12) that were guided through a predetermined series of standard activities. Seven behavioural categories (lay, sit, stand, walk, trot, gallop, canter) were pre-defined and each video recording was tagged accordingly. Evaluation of the measurements was performed by support vector machine (SVM) classification. During the analysis we used different combinations of independent measurements for training and validation (belonging to the same or different individuals or using different training data size) to determine the robustness of the application. We reached an overall accuracy of above 90% perfect identification of all the defined seven categories of behaviour when both training and validation data belonged to the same individual, and over 80% perfect recognition rate using a generalized training data set of multiple subjects. Our results indicate that the present method provides a good model for an easily applicable, fast, automatic behaviour classification system that can be trained with arbitrary motion patterns and potentially be applied to a wide range of species and situations."
https://openalex.org/W1987765437,"Objective To determine the prevalence, associations and management of hypertension in the 25–74-year-old urban black population of Cape Town and examine the change between 1990 and 2008/09 in 25–64-year-olds. Methods In 2008/09, a representative cross-sectional sample, stratified for age and sex, was randomly selected from the same townships sampled in 1990. Cardiovascular disease risk factors were determined by administered questionnaires, clinical measurements and fasting biochemical analyses. Logistic regression models evaluated the associations with hypertension. Results There were 1099 participants, 392 men and 707 women (response rate 86%) in 2008/09. Age-standardised hypertension prevalence was 38.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.6–42.3) with similar rates in men and women. Among 25–64-year-olds, hypertension prevalence was significantly higher in 2008/09 (35.6%, 95% CI: 32.3–39.0) than in 1990 (21.6%, 95% CI: 18.6–24.9). In 2008/09, hypertension odds increased with older age, family history of hypertension, higher body mass index, problematic alcohol intake, physical inactivity and urbanisation. Among hypertensive participants, significantly more women than men were detected (69.5% vs. 32.7%), treated (55.7% vs. 21.9%) and controlled (32.4% vs. 10.4%) in 2008/09. There were minimal changes from 1990 except for improved control in 25–64-year-old women (1990∶14.1% vs. 2008/09∶31.5%). Conclusions The high and rising hypertension burden in this population, its association with modifiable risk factors and the sub-optimal care provided highlight the urgent need to prioritise hypertension management. Innovative solutions with efficient and cost-effective healthcare delivery as well as population-based strategies are required."
https://openalex.org/W2127462036,"Most terrestrial plants interact with diverse clades of mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi in their roots. Through belowground plant–fungal interactions, dominant plants can benefit by interacting with host-specific mutualistic fungi and proliferate in a community based on positive plant–mutualistic fungal feedback. On the other hand, subordinate plant species may persist in the community by sharing other sets (functional groups) of fungal symbionts with each other. Therefore, revealing how diverse clades of root-associated fungi are differentially hosted by dominant and subordinate plant species is essential for understanding plant community structure and dynamics. Based on 454-pyrosequencing, we determined the community composition of root-associated fungi on 36 co-occurring plant species in an oak-dominated forest in northern Japan and statistically evaluated the host preference phenotypes of diverse mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi. An analysis of 278 fungal taxa indicated that an ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete fungus in the genus Lactarius and a possibly endophytic ascomycete fungus in the order Helotiales significantly favored the dominant oak (Quercus) species. In contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were generally shared among subordinate plant species. Although fungi with host preferences contributed to the compartmentalization of belowground plant–fungal associations, diverse clades of ectomycorrhizal fungi and possible root endophytes were associated not only with the dominant Quercus but also with the remaining plant species. Our findings suggest that dominant-ectomycorrhizal and subordinate plant species can host different subsets of root-associated fungi, and diverse clades of generalist fungi can counterbalance the compartmentalization of plant–fungal associations. Such insights into the overall structure of belowground plant–fungal associations will help us understand the mechanisms that facilitate the coexistence of plant species in natural communities."

Tumor cellularity or purity, sub-clonality and copy number changes also confound the identification of true somatic events against a background of germline variants. We have developed a heuristic strategy and software (http://www.qcmg.org/bioinformatics/qsnp/) for somatic mutation calling in samples with low tumor content and we show the superior sensitivity and precision of our approach using a previously sequenced cell line, a series of tumor/normal admixtures, and 3,253 putative somatic SNVs verified on an orthogonal platform."
https://openalex.org/W2031719425,"Autoantibodies to enterocyte antigens harmonin (75 kDa USH1C protein) and villin (actin-binding 95 kDa protein) are associated with the Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. In this study we evaluated the diagnostic value of harmonin and villin autoantibodies in IPEX and IPEX-like syndromes. Harmonin and villin autoantibodies were measured by a novel Luminescent-Immuno-Precipitation-System (LIPS) quantitative assay, in patients with IPEX, IPEX-like syndrome, Primary Immunodeficiencies (PID) with enteropathy, all diagnosed by sequencing of the FOXP3 gene, and in type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease and healthy blood donors as control groups. Harmonin and villin autoantibodies were detected in 12 (92%) and 6 (46%) of 13 IPEX patients, and in none of the IPEX-like, PID, T1D, celiac patients, respectively. All IPEX patients, including one case with late and atypical clinical presentation, had either harmonin and/or villin autoantibodies and tested positive for enterocyte antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. When measured in IPEX patients in remission after immunosuppressive therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, harmonin and villin autoantibodies became undetectable or persisted at low titers in all cases but one in whom harmonin autoantibodies remained constantly high. In one patient, a peak of harmonin antibodies paralleled a relapse phase of enteropathy. Our study demonstrates that harmonin and villin autoantibodies, measured by LIPS, are sensitive and specific markers of IPEX, differentiate IPEX, including atypical cases, from other early childhood disorders associated with enteropathy, and are useful for screening and clinical monitoring of affected children."
https://openalex.org/W1974100686,"Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum × morifolium) is one of the most important ornamental plants in the world. They are typically used as cut flowers or potted plants. Chrysanthemum can exhibit red, purple, pink, yellow and white flowers, but lack bright red and blue flowers. In this study, we identified two chrysanthemum cultivars, C × morifolium ‘LPi’ and C × morifolium ‘LPu’, that only accumulate flavonoids in their ligulate flowers. Next, we isolated seven anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, namely CmCHS, CmF3H, CmF3’H, CmDFR, CmANS, CmCHI and Cm3GT in these cultivars. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analyses showed that CmF3′H was the most important enzyme required for cyanidin biosynthsis. To rebuild the delphinidin pathway, we downregulated CmF3’H using RNAi and overexpressed the Senecio cruentus F3′5′H (PCFH) gene in chrysanthemum. The resultant chrysanthemum demonstrated a significantly increased content of cyanidin and brighter red flower petals but did not accumulate delphinidin. These results indicated that CmF3′H in chrysanthemum is important for anthocyanin accumulation, and Senecio cruentus F3′5′H only exhibited F3′H activity in chrysanthemum but did not rebuild the delphinidin pathway to form blue flower chrysanthemum."
https://openalex.org/W1991389725,"On May 12th 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale struck China, causing a large number of casualties and significant economic losses. By interviewing 2080 survivors of Wenchuan earthquake, the objective of this study is to estimate the role of different types of social support as possible moderating factors between anxiety and depression.A stratified random sampling strategy about the cross-sectional study was adopted. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used. A total of 2080 adult survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake from 19 damaged countries participated in the survey. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed to evaluate the moderating role of social support on the relationship between anxiety and depression.One year after the Wenchuan earthquake, anxiety and depression were found to be 37.6% and 40.7%, respectively. Demographic characteristics were seen as significant in the cases of depression, except for age (p=0.599), while age and education level were not found to be significant for anxiety. The results showed that social support, especially subjective support could moderate the association between anxiety and depression.Social support should be particularly focused on female survivors, those of the Han ethnic group, and those with a lower level of education and a lower income. Psychological intervention and care for survivors should focus on those most disoriented by the disaster."
https://openalex.org/W2146008744,"Acidithiobacillus caldus is a sulfur oxidizing extreme acidophile and the only known mesothermophile within the Acidithiobacillales. As such, it is one of the preferred microbes for mineral bioprocessing at moderately high temperatures. In this study, we explore the genomic diversity of A. caldus strains using a combination of bioinformatic and experimental techniques, thus contributing first insights into the elucidation of the species pangenome.Comparative sequence analysis of A. caldus ATCC 51756 and SM-1 indicate that, despite sharing a conserved and highly syntenic genomic core, both strains have unique gene complements encompassing nearly 20% of their respective genomes. The differential gene complement of each strain is distributed between the chromosomal compartment, one megaplasmid and a variable number of smaller plasmids, and is directly associated to a diverse pool of mobile genetic elements (MGE). These include integrative conjugative and mobilizable elements, genomic islands and insertion sequences. Some of the accessory functions associated to these MGEs have been linked previously to the flexible gene pool in microorganisms inhabiting completely different econiches. Yet, others had not been unambiguously mapped to the flexible gene pool prior to this report and clearly reflect strain-specific adaption to local environmental conditions.For many years, and because of DNA instability at low pH and recurrent failure to genetically transform acidophilic bacteria, gene transfer in acidic environments was considered negligible. Findings presented herein imply that a more or less conserved pool of actively excising MGEs occurs in the A. caldus population and point to a greater frequency of gene exchange in this econiche than previously recognized. Also, the data suggest that these elements endow the species with capacities to withstand the diverse abiotic and biotic stresses of natural environments, in particular those associated with its extreme econiche."
https://openalex.org/W2146759878,"The lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy reproduces in rodents several features of human temporal lobe epilepsy, by inducing an acute status epilepticus (SE) followed by a latency period. It has been proposed that the neuronal network reorganization that occurs during latency determines the subsequent appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures. The aim of this study was to evaluate neuronal and glial responses during the latency period that follows SE. Given the potential role of astrocytes in the post-SE network reorganization, through the secretion of synaptogenic molecules such as thrombospondins, we also studied the effect of treatment with the α2δ1 thrombospondin receptor antagonist gabapentin. Adult male Wistar rats received 3 mEq/kg LiCl, and 20 h later 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. Once SE was achieved, seizures were stopped with 20 mg/kg diazepam. Animals then received 400 mg/kg/day gabapentin or saline for either 4 or 14 days. In vitro experiments were performed in dissociated mixed hippocampal cell culture exposed to glutamate, and subsequently treated with gabapentin or vehicle. During the latency period, the hippocampus and pyriform cortex of SE-animals presented a profuse reactive astrogliosis, with increased GFAP and nestin expression. Gliosis intensity was dependent on the Racine stage attained by the animals and peaked 15 days after SE. Microglia was also reactive after SE, and followed the same pattern. Neuronal degeneration was present in SE-animals, and also depended on the Racine stage and the SE duration. Polysialic-acid NCAM (PSA-NCAM) expression was increased in hippocampal CA-1 and dentate gyrus of SE-animals. Gabapentin treatment was able to reduce reactive gliosis, decrease neuronal loss and normalize PSA-NCAM staining in hippocampal CA-1. In vitro, gabapentin treatment partially prevented the dendritic loss and reactive gliosis caused by glutamate excitotoxicity. Our results show that gabapentin treatment during the latency period after SE protects neurons and normalizes PSA-NCAM probably by direct interaction with neurons and glia."

CXCL8 is a chemotactic cytokine with important functions during acute inflammation as well as in the context of various cancers. The nine genes of the CXCL cluster and the strong VDR binding site close to the CXCL8 gene are insulated from neighboring genes by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites. Only CXCL8, CXCL6 and CXCL1 are expressed in THP-1 cells, but all three are up-regulated primary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) target genes. Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing analysis of the whole CXCL cluster demonstrated 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent chromatin opening exclusively for the VDR binding site. In differentiated THP-1 cells the CXCL8 gene showed a 33-fold higher basal expression, but is together with CXCL6 and CXCL1 still a primary 1,25(OH)2D3 target under the control of the same genomic VDR binding site. In summary, both in undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells the genes CXCL8, CXCL6 and CXCL1 are under the primary control of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor VDR. Our observation provides further evidence for the immune-related functions of vitamin D."
https://openalex.org/W2157359322,"Intertemporal choices - involving decisions which trade off instant and delayed outcomes - are often made under stress. It remains unknown, however, whether and how stress affects intertemporal choice. We subjected 142 healthy male subjects to a laboratory stress or control protocol, and asked them to make a series of intertemporal choices either directly after stress, or 20 minutes later (resulting in four experimental groups). Based on theory and evidence from behavioral economics and cellular neuroscience, we predicted a bidirectional effect of stress on intertemporal choice, with increases in impatience or present bias immediately after stress, but decreases in present bias or impatience when subjects are tested 20 minutes later. However, our results show no effects of stress on intertemporal choice at either time point, and individual differences in stress reactivity (changes in stress hormone levels over time) are not related to individual differences in intertemporal choice. Together, we did not find support for the hypothesis that psychosocial laboratory stressors affect intertemporal choice."
https://openalex.org/W2002678791,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a prevalent mechanism in mammals that promotes proteomic diversity, including expression of cell-type specific protein isoforms. We characterized a role for RBM38 (RNPC1) in regulation of alternative splicing during late erythroid differentiation. We used an Affymetrix human exon junction (HJAY) splicing microarray to identify a panel of RBM38-regulated alternatively spliced transcripts. Using microarray databases, we noted high RBM38 expression levels in CD71+ erythroid cells and thus chose to examine RBM38 expression during erythroid differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells, detecting enhanced RBM38 expression during late erythroid differentiation. In differentiated erythroid cells, we validated a subset of RBM38-regulated splicing events and determined that RBM38 regulates activation of Protein 4.1R (EPB41) exon 16 during late erythroid differentiation. Using Epb41 minigenes, Rbm38 was found to be a robust activator of exon 16 splicing. To further address the mechanism of RBM38-regulated alternative splicing, a novel mammalian protein expression system, followed by SELEX-Seq, was used to identify a GU-rich RBM38 binding motif. Lastly, using a tethering assay, we determined that RBM38 can directly activate splicing when recruited to a downstream intron. Together, our data support the role of RBM38 in regulating alternative splicing during erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2137229471,"The hyaluronan (HA) receptor for endocytosis (HARE; Stab2) clears 14 systemic ligands, including HA and heparin. Here, we used NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase reporter assays to test HARE-mediated intracellular signaling during the uptake of eight ligands, whose binding sites in the HARE ectodomain were mapped by competition studies (Harris, E. N., and Weigel, P. H. (2008) Glycobiology 18, 638-648). Unique intermediate size Select-HA(TM), heparin, dermatan sulfate, and acetylated LDL stimulated dose-dependent HARE-mediated NF-κB activation of luciferase expression, with half-maximal values of 10-25 nM. In contrast, chondroitin sulfate types A, C, D, and E did not stimulate NF-κB activation. Moreover, degradation of endogenous IkB-α (an NF-κB inhibitor) was stimulated only by the signaling ligands. The stimulatory activities of pairwise combinations of the four signaling ligands were additive. The four nonstimulatory chondroitin sulfate types, which compete for HA binding, also effectively blocked HA-stimulated signaling. Clathrin siRNA decreased clathrin expression by ∼50% and completely eliminated NF-κB-mediated signaling by all four ligands, indicating that activation of signaling complexes occurs after endocytosis. These results indicate that HARE not only binds and clears extracellular matrix degradation products (e.g. released normally or during infection, injury, tumorigenesis, or other stress situations) but that a subset of ligands also serves as signaling indicator ligands. HARE may be part of a systemic tissue-stress sensor feedback system that responds to abnormal tissue turnover or damage as a danger signal; the signaling indicator ligands would reflect the homeostatic status, whether normal or pathological, of tissue cells and biomatrix components."

In vitro susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion test and susceptibility profiles were determined using zone diameter interpretive criteria, as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Data on usage of various antimicrobial agents, expressed as defined daily dose (DDD) per 1,000 patients-days developed by WHO Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical (ATC)/DDD index 2011, were collected from hospital pharmacy computer database. Most of 747 strains of P. aeruginosa were collected from respiratory samples (201 isolates, 26.9%), blood (179, 24.0%), secretions and pus (145, 19.4%) over the years. Time series analysis demonstrated a significant increase in resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin, imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin except aminoglycosides over time in the hospital (P<0.001). The rates of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolated from patients with HAIs were 14.3%, 17.1%, 21.1%, 24.6%, 37.0%, 48.8%, 56.4%, 51.2%, and 54.1% over time. A significant increase in usage of anti-pseudomonal carbapenems (P<0.001) was seen. ARIMA models demonstrated that anti-pseudomonal carbapenems usage was strongly correlated with the prevalence of imipenem and meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (P<0.001). Increasing of quarterly CRPA was strongly correlated at one time lag with quarterly use of anti-pseudomonal carbapenems (P<0.001). Our data demonstrated positive correlation between anti-pseudomonal antimicrobial usage and P. aeruginosa resistance to several classes of antibiotics, but not all antimicrobial agents in the hospital."

However, the management of radial nerve injuries associated with humeral fractures is debatable. There was no consensus between observation and early exploration.The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, CINAHL, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, and Social Sciences Citation Index were searched. Two authors independently searched for relevant studies in any language from 1966 to Jan 2013. Thirty studies with 2952 humeral fractures participants were identified. Thirteen studies favored conservative strategy. No significant difference between early exploration and no exploration groups (OR, 1.03, 95% CI 0.61, 1.72; I(2) = 0.0%, p = 0.918 n.s.). Three studies recommend early radial nerve exploration in patients with open fractures of humerus with radial nerve injury. Five studies proposed early exploration was performed in high-energy humeral shaft fractures with radial nerve injury.The conservative strategy was a good choice for patients with low-energy closed fractures of humerus with radial nerve injury. We recommend early radial nerve exploration (within the first 2 weeks) in patients with open fractures or high-energy closed fractures of humerus with radial nerve injury."

The determination of the kinetics of the individual association and dissociation reactions is hampered by the fact that forward and reverse reactions to/from different aggregation states occur simultaneously. Here, we report the kinetics of dissociation of Aβ monomers from protofibrils, prefibrillar high molecular weight oligomers previously shown to possess pronounced neurotoxicity. An engineered binding protein sequestering specifically monomeric Aβ was employed to follow protofibril dissociation by tryptophan fluorescence, precluding confounding effects of reverse or competing reactions. Aβ protofibril dissociation into monomers follows exponential decay kinetics with a time constant of ∼2 h at 25 °C and an activation energy of 80 kJ/mol, values typical for high affinity biomolecular interactions.

Aβ protofibrils are heterogeneous in size (in the range of 50–1500 kDa) and morphology, comprising spherical, annular, and curvilinear assemblies. The protofibrils are in equilibrium with both monomers and fibrils (7Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B.

The dynamics of the monomer-protofibril-fibril equilibrium is crucial for Aβ toxicity, as (i) the different association states exhibit different toxicities (2Skovronsky D.M. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q.

In this study, we determined the off-rate of monomers dissociating from Aβ protofibrils by tryptophan fluorescence using a tryptophan-containing variant of the engineered Aβ-binding protein ZAβ3. ZAβ3, which has been selected previously from an Affibody protein library, specifically binds monomeric Aβ with an affinity of Kd = 17 nm (14Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Lindström S. Gunneriusson E.

ZAβ3 inhibits Aβ oligomerization and aggregation by sequestering the aggregation-prone central and C-terminal sequence regions of monomeric Aβ (15Hoyer W. Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Ståhl S. Härd T.

The addition of an excess of the tryptophan-containing variant ZAβ3W to SEC-purified Aβ protofibrils enabled the detection of monomeric Aβ dissociating from protofibrils while preventing the reverse reaction from monomers to protofibrils as well as the reaction to amyloid fibrils. The temperature-dependent kinetic stability of Aβ protofibrils toward dissociation into monomers could thus be assessed. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by back-to-back primer PCR (17Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J.

The vector was religated, and the mutation was verified by sequencing. Expression and purification were done as described previously (18Hoyer W. Härd T. Interaction of Alzheimer's Aβ peptide with an engineered binding protein–thermodynamics and kinetics of coupled folding-binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 398-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For cell lysis, high pressure (2.9 kilobars; Constant Systems) was used. After affinity chromatography, SEC (Superdex 75 16/60, GE Healthcare) was performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.2). Aβ40 and Aβ42 were produced with an N-terminal methionine by recombinant coexpression with ZAβ3 (19Macao B. Hoyer W. Sandberg A. Brorsson A.C. Dobson C.M. Härd T. Recombinant amyloid β-peptide production by coexpression with an Affibody ligand.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For protein expression, unlabeled M9 medium without Celtone was used. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). For cell disruption, high pressure (2.9 kilobars) was used. Affinity chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA Purifier system using a 5-ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). Aβ was eluted from the ZAβ3-Aβ complex bound on the column with 8 m urea and 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6). The eluted Aβ was washed over a 1-ml HisTrap FF column equilibrated in urea to remove any residual ZAβ3. Buffer exchange to 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was achieved by SEC (Superdex 75 16/60). The pH was adjusted to 10 to prevent aggregation during storage (4 °C) and during concentration (Vivaspin 20 3000 MWCO PES, Sartorius AG). For preparation of protofibrils, the pH was titrated back to 7. At room temperature, Aβ42 was incubated at a concentration of ∼100 μm for 1–4 h, whereas Aβ40 was incubated at a concentration of ∼500 μm for 24 h. The formation of protofibrils was monitored by analytical SEC runs (Superdex 75 10/300; 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)). Protofibrils were purified by SEC and immediately employed in the fluorescence assay. The Aβ concentration of the freshly eluted protofibril fractions was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm. A protofibril batch referred to in this study is defined as one particular protofibril preparation starting from an individual Aβ expression cell pellet. To test fibril dissociation, amyloid fibrils were prepared by incubation of 650 μl of 380 μm Aβ42 in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 0.03% sodium azide for 1 week at 37 °C in a 2-ml glass vial, with stirring at 300 rpm using a micro stir bar. Protofibril dissociation samples with a volume of ∼500 μl were prepared in 5 × 5-mm fluorescence cells (101.016-QS, Hellma) and sealed with Parafilm. An air-water interface was present at the top of the solutions. The samples were equipped with crown magnetic stirring bars (Jasco) and stirred at 500 rpm. Aβ concentrations between 4 and 35 μm were employed in the dissociation assay, and ZAβ3W was added at an excess of ∼25% to ensure removal of dissociated Aβ monomers from the monomer-protofibril equilibrium. The time elapsed between protofibril elution from SEC and the addition of ZAβ3W was ∼15 min. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 330 to 360 nm on a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission bandwidths were 5 and 1 nm, respectively, and the data pitch was 0.2 nm. The fluorescence was repeatedly measured over ∼12 h, during which time the sample temperature was kept constant using external water-jacketed cell holders. For fluorescence measurements, cells were transferred to the spectrofluorometer cell holder, which was thermostatted at 25 °C. The λmax values of the fluorescence emission spectra were determined by fitting the fluorescence intensity to an empirical fitting function (1Querfurth H.W. LaFerla F.M. Alzheimer's disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3703) Google Scholar) using a trust region reflective algorithm implemented in MATLAB 2011 (MathWorks) (Equation 1), F=F0+ΔFe(-e-(λ-lmaxΓ)-λ-λmaxΓ+1)(Eq. 1) where F0 is the fluorescence intensity offset, F0 + ΔF is the fluorescence intensity at λmax, and Γ is the peak width. The fraction of free ZAβ3W was determined from λmax as explained under “Results,” employing the fit shown in Fig. 1D and complying with Equation 2. [ZAβ3Wfree][ZAβ3Wtotal]=1.935-1.1143•1014e-0.09311 λmax(Eq. 2) The fraction of free ZAβ3W dependent on incubation time was plotted, and a monoexponential fit to Equation 3 was employed to obtain individual apparent koff values for each dissociation experiment using OriginPro 8.6 (OriginLab) (Equation 3). [ZAβ3Wfree][ZAβ3Wtotal]=A1e-kofft+y0(Eq. 3) A global fit of all Aβ42 protofibril dissociation data sets recorded at 25 °C to a triexponential decay with individual amplitudes A1, A2, and A3 and offset y0 but shared rate constants koff,1, koff,2, and koff,3 was performed according to Equation 4. [Aβin protofibrils][Aβtotal]=([ZAβ3Wfree][ZAβ3Wtotal]-y0)/(1-y0)(Eq. 4) The fraction of Aβ in protofibrils was calculated according to Equation 5. d(IRins)dt=k1a×insulin×IRm-k1c×IRins(Eq. 5) Aβ samples were diluted to 1 μm and incubated for 3 min on a Formvar/carbon-coated copper grid (S162, Plano). The grid was washed three times with H2O and one time with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate before incubation for 1 min with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for negative staining, followed by drying overnight. The samples were examined with a Libra 120 electron microscope (Zeiss) operating at 120 kV. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was performed in an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with absorbance optics using an An-60 Ti rotor with aluminum 2-channel centerpiece cells. Sedimentation velocity centrifugation was done at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C. The intensity at 230 nm was recorded (radial resolution, 0.03 cm; continuous mode; no replicate; one scan/3 min). The run duration was 5 h for the protofibril sample and 10 h for the samples containing ZAβ3W. Data were fitted using the continuous distribution (c(s)) Lamm equation model with a v̄ of 0.738 cm3/g based on the Aβ42 sequence for the protofibril sample and a v̄ of 0.721 cm3/g based on the ZAβ3W sequence for the ZAβ3W samples in the software package Sedfit. An s-value resolution of 0.3 or 0.025 S was chosen for the fit of the protofibril sample or the ZAβ3W samples, respectively. The quality of the fits was confirmed by low root mean square deviations below A230 = 0.005. Specified amounts of species in the protofibril sample resulted from the c(s) distribution exclusive of the area below 0.6 S, which contains a base-line deconvolution artifact. The s-values determined were corrected for water at 20 °C. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed essentially as described previously (15Hoyer W. Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Ståhl S. Härd T. Stabilization of a β-hairpin in monomeric Alzheimer's amyloid-β peptide inhibits amyloid formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) using an iTC200 calorimeter (GE Healthcare). Binding of ZAβ3 to Aβ is accompanied by a decrease in tyrosine fluorescence (18Hoyer W. Härd T. Interaction of Alzheimer's Aβ peptide with an engineered binding protein–thermodynamics and kinetics of coupled folding-binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 398-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), presumably due to altered fluorescence properties of Tyr-18 in both ZAβ3 subunits, which are located at the binding interface. To exploit the higher extinction coefficient, higher quantum yield, and greater environment sensitivity of tryptophan compared with tyrosine, a ZAβ3 variant termed ZAβ3W was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr-18 to Trp-18 (Fig. 1A). ZAβ3W bound monomeric Aβ40 with an affinity of Kd = 20 nm as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, which is close to the value of Kd = 17 nm obtained for ZAβ3 (15Hoyer W. Grönwall C. Jonsson A. Ståhl S. Härd T. Stabilization of a β-hairpin in monomeric Alzheimer's amyloid-β peptide inhibits amyloid formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, the Y18W mutation did not significantly affect the affinity. The fluorescence emission spectrum of free ZAβ3W had a maximum at 348 nm (Fig. 1C), indicative of water exposure of the tryptophan side chains (20Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Fluorescence and the location of tryptophan residues in protein molecules.Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Upon Aβ binding, the fluorescence intensity increased, and the emission maximum was blue-shifted to a wavelength of λmax = 340 nm, in agreement with a less polar environment of the tryptophan indole groups in the bound state. Because of the spectral differences between its free and bound states, ZAβ3W could be employed to detect and quantify monomeric Aβ by sequestering it into the ZAβ3W-Aβ complex. Both the fluorescence intensity and λmax could in principal be evaluated for this purpose. However, the fluorescence intensity decreased upon repeated measurements of free and bound ZAβ3W, indicative of photobleaching, whereas λmax remained constant. Therefore, λmax was chosen as the spectral property to evaluate for the detection of monomeric Aβ. However, λmax does not linearly depend on the fraction of free/bound ZAβ3W (21Ladokhin A.S. Jayasinghe S. White S.H. How to measure and analyze tryptophan fluorescence in membranes properly, and why bother?.Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To derive the relationship between λmax and the fraction of free/bound ZAβ3W, the simulated spectra of mixtures of free and bound ZAβ3W were calculated from the spectra of free and bound ZAβ3W, and the resulting λmax values dependent on the fraction of free ZAβ3W were plotted (Fig. 1D). A fit to an exponential function was employed for the calculation of the fraction of free ZAβ3W from experimentally determined λmax values. In conclusion, ZAβ3W addition to test solutions permits the detection and quantification of monomeric Aβ. In particular, the concentration of monomeric Aβ in a test solution corresponds to the concentration of bound ZAβ3W if an excess of ZAβ3W is added, ensuring a concentration of free ZAβ3W of [ZAβ3W]free ≫ Kd = 20 nm. ZAβ3W was employed to study the dissociation kinetics of Aβ protofibrils as schematically shown in Fig. 1B. Monomers dissociating from protofibrils were captured by ZAβ3W. The ZAβ3W binding kinetics were sufficiently fast (time constant on the order of seconds (18Hoyer W. Härd T. Interaction of Alzheimer's Aβ peptide with an engineered binding protein–thermodynamics and kinetics of coupled folding-binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 398-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) not to obscure the slow protofibril dissociation kinetics. Sequestration of monomeric Aβ by ZAβ3W effectively inhibited fibril formation, which otherwise is a competing reaction of protofibril dissociation (11Jan A. Adolfsson O. Allaman I. Buccarello A.L. Magistretti P.J. Pfeifer A. Muhs A. Lashuel H.A. Aβ42 neurotoxicity is mediated by ongoing nucleated polymerization process rather than by discrete Aβ42 species.J. Biol.

Under the experimental conditions, the decrease in the fraction of free ZAβ3W was proportional to the decrease in the fraction of Aβ within protofibrils and to the amount of Aβ monomers dissociated from protofibrils. Aβ protofibrils were prepared by SEC of incubated samples of monomeric Aβ as described previously (4Jan A. Hartley D.M. Lashuel H.A.

https://openalex.org/W1990051625,"The soluble cleaved urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (scuPAR) is a circulating protein detected in multiple diseases, including various cancers, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease, where elevated levels of scuPAR have been associated with worsening prognosis and increased disease aggressiveness. We aimed to identify novel genetic and biomolecular mechanisms regulating scuPAR levels. Elevated serum scuPAR levels were identified in asthma (n=514) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=219) cohorts when compared to controls (n=96). In these cohorts, a genome-wide association study of serum scuPAR levels identified a human plasma kallikrein gene (KLKB1) promoter polymorphism (rs4253238) associated with serum scuPAR levels in a control/asthma population (P=1.17 × 10(-7)), which was also observed in a COPD population (combined P=5.04 × 10(-12)). Using a fluorescent assay, we demonstrated that serum KLKB1 enzymatic activity was driven by rs4253238 and is inverse to scuPAR levels. Biochemical analysis identified that KLKB1 cleaves scuPAR and negates scuPAR's effects on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in vitro. Chymotrypsin was used as a proproteolytic control, while basal HBECs were used as a control to define scuPAR-driven effects. In summary, we reveal a novel post-translational regulatory mechanism for scuPAR using a hypothesis-free approach with implications for multiple human diseases."

The results revealed that 7,407 of over 50,000 known Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in 53 phyla were detected in citrus leaf midribs using the PhyloChip™ G3 array, of which five phyla were dominant, Proteobacteria (38.7%), Firmicutes (29.0%), Actinobacteria (16.1%), Bacteroidetes (6.2%) and Cyanobacteria (2.3%). The OTU62806, representing 'Candidatus Liberibacter', was present with a high titer in the plants graft-inoculated with Las-infected scions treated with Gm at 100 mg/L and in the water-treated control (CK1). However, the Las bacterium was not detected in the plants graft-inoculated with Las-infected scions treated with Amp at 1.0 g/L or in plants graft-inoculated with Las-free scions (CK2). The PhyloChip array demonstrated that more OTUs, at a higher abundance, were detected in the Gm-treated plants than in the other treatment and the controls. Pairwise comparisons indicated that 23 OTUs from the Achromobacter spp. and 12 OTUs from the Methylobacterium spp. were more abundant in CK2 and CK1, respectively. Ten abundant OTUs from the Stenotrophomonas spp. were detected only in the Amp-treatment. These results provide new insights into microbial communities that may be associated with the progression of citrus huanglongbing (HLB) and the potential effects of antibiotics on the disease and microbial ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2094691427,"The development of a new vaccine as a substitute for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or to improve its efficacy is one of the many World Health Organization goals to control tuberculosis. Mycobacterial vectors have been used successfully in the development of vaccines against tuberculosis. To enhance the potential utility of Mycobacterium smegmatis as a vaccine, it was transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing the partial sequences of the genes Ag85c, MPT51, and HspX (CMX) from M. tuberculosis. The newly generated recombinant strain mc(2)-CMX was tested in a murine model of infection. The recombinant vaccine induced specific IgG1 or IgG2a responses to CMX. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from the lungs and spleen responded ex vivo to CMX, producing IFN-γ, IL17, TNF-α, and IL2. The vaccine thus induced a significant immune response in mice. Mice vaccinated with mc(2)-CMX and challenged with M. tuberculosis showed better protection than mice immunized with wild-type M. smegmatis or BCG. To increase the safety and immunogenicity of the CMX antigens, we used a recombinant strain of M. smegmatis, IKE (immune killing evasion), to express CMX. The recombinant vaccine IKE-CMX induced a better protective response than mc(2)-CMX. The data presented here suggest that the expression of CMX antigens improves the immune response and the protection induced in mice when M. smegmatis is used as vaccine against tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2125043357,"The literature suggests that a complex relationship exists between the three main skills involved in reading comprehension (decoding, listening comprehension and vocabulary) and that this relationship depends on at least three other factors orthographic transparency, children's grade level and socioeconomic status (SES). This study investigated the relative contribution of the predictors of reading comprehension in a longitudinal design (from beginning to end of the first grade) in 394 French children from low SES families.Reading comprehension was measured at the end of the first grade using two tasks one with short utterances and one with a medium length narrative text. Accuracy in listening comprehension and vocabulary, and fluency of decoding skills, were measured at the beginning and end of the first grade. Accuracy in decoding skills was measured only at the beginning. Regression analyses showed that listening comprehension and decoding skills (accuracy and fluency) always significantly predicted reading comprehension. The contribution of decoding was greater when reading comprehension was assessed via the task using short utterances. Between the two assessments, the contribution of vocabulary, and of decoding skills especially, increased, while that of listening comprehension remained unchanged.These results challenge the 'simple view of reading'. They also have educational implications, since they show that it is possible to assess decoding and reading comprehension very early on in an orthography (i.e., French), which is less deep than the English one even in low SES children. These assessments, associated with those of listening comprehension and vocabulary, may allow early identification of children at risk for reading difficulty, and to set up early remedial training, which is the most effective, for them."
https://openalex.org/W2007915578,"HS3st1 (heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-1) is a critical enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the antithrombin III (AT)-binding site in the biopharmaceutical drug heparin. Heparin is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan that shares a common biosynthetic pathway with heparan sulfate (HS). Although only granulated cells, such as mast cells, biosynthesize heparin, all animal cells are capable of biosynthesizing HS. As part of an effort to bioengineer CHO cells to produce heparin, we previously showed that the introduction of both HS3st1 and NDST2 (N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase isoform-2) afforded HS with a very low level of anticoagulant activity. This study demonstrated that untargeted HS3st1 is broadly distributed throughout CHO cells and forms no detectable AT-binding sites, whereas Golgi-targeted HS3st1 localizes in the Golgi and results in the formation of a single type of AT-binding site and high anti-factor Xa activity (137 ± 36 units/mg). Moreover, stable overexpression of HS3st1 also results in up-regulation of 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfo group-containing disaccharides, further emphasizing a previously unknown concerted interplay between the HS biosynthetic enzymes and suggesting the need to control the expression level of all of the biosynthetic enzymes to produce heparin in CHO cells."
https://openalex.org/W2019324578,"Background Heart failure as recognized and treated in typical practice may represent a complex condition that defies discrete categorizations. To illuminate this complexity, we examined treatment strategies for patients hospitalized and treated for decompensated heart failure. We focused on the receipt of medications appropriate for other acute conditions associated with shortness of breath including acute asthma, pneumonia, and exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods and Results Using Premier Perspective®, we studied adults hospitalized with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure and evidence of acute heart failure treatment from 2009-2010 at 370 US hospitals. We determined treatment with acute respiratory therapies during the initial 2 days of hospitalization and daily during hospital days 3-5. We also calculated adjusted odds of in-hospital death, admission to the intensive care unit, and late intubation (intubation after hospital day 2). Among 164,494 heart failure hospitalizations, 53% received acute respiratory therapies during the first 2 hospital days: 37% received short-acting inhaled bronchodilators, 33% received antibiotics, and 10% received high-dose corticosteroids. Of these 87,319 hospitalizations, over 60% continued receiving respiratory therapies after hospital day 2. Respiratory treatment was more frequent among the 60,690 hospitalizations with chronic lung disease. Treatment with acute respiratory therapy during the first 2 hospital days was associated with higher adjusted odds of all adverse outcomes. Conclusions Acute respiratory therapy is administered to more than half of patients hospitalized with and treated for decompensated heart failure. Heart failure is therefore regularly treated as a broader cardiopulmonary syndrome rather than as a singular cardiac condition."
https://openalex.org/W2077513232,"Climate warming and shifting precipitation regimes are affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Most studies have focused on the influence of warming and altered precipitation on macro-organisms, whereas the responses of soil microbial communities have been neglected. We studied the changes in the abundance, richness, and composition of the entire bacterial kingdom and 16 dominant bacterial phyla/classes in response to increased precipitation, warming, and their combination, by conducting a 5-year experiment in a steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia, China. Watering had a greater effect than warming on almost all the bacterial groups as indicated by changes in all the three attributes (abundance, richness, and composition). The 16 phyla/classes responded differentially to the experimental treatments, with Acidobacteria and Gamma-proteobacteria being the most sensitive. Stepwise regression analyses further revealed that climate changes altered the abundance and richness of bacterial groups primarily through direct routes (e.g., increasing soil water content), and changed the community composition through both direct and indirect routes (e.g., reducing soil total nitrogen content and increasing soil pH). The diverse responses of various bacterial groups could imply some potential shift in their ecosystem functions under climate changes; meanwhile, the indirect routes that are important in altering bacterial composition suggest that specific strategies (e.g., adding NH4NO3 to maintain soil nitrogen content and pH) could be adopted to maintain soil microbial composition under climate changes."
https://openalex.org/W2068363450,"In desertified regions, shrub-dominated patches are important microhabitats for ground arthropod assemblages. As shrub age increases, soil, vegetation and microbiological properties can change remarkably and spontaneously across seasons. However, relatively few studies have analyzed how ground arthropods respond to the microhabitats created by shrubs of different plantation ages across seasons. Using 6, 15, 24 and 36 year-old plantations of re-vegetated shrubs (Caragana koushinskii) in the desert steppe of northwestern China as a model system, we sampled ground arthropod communities using a pitfall trapping method in the microhabitats under shrubs and in the open areas between shrubs, during the spring, summer and autumn. The total ground arthropod assemblage was dominated by Carabidae, Melolonthidae, Curculionidae, Tenebrionidae and Formicidae that were affected by plantation age, seasonal changes, or the interaction between these factors, with the later two groups also influenced by microhabitat. Overall, a facilitative effect was observed, with more arthropods and a greater diversity found under shrubs as compared to open areas, but this was markedly affected by seasonal changes. There was a high degree of similarity in arthropod assemblages and diversity between microhabitats in summer and autumn. Shrub plantation age significantly influenced the distribution of the most abundant groups, and also the diversity indices of the ground arthropods. However, there was not an overall positive relationship between shrub age and arthropod abundance, richness or diversity index. The influence of plantation age on arthropod communities was also affected by seasonal changes. From spring through summer to autumn, community indices of ground arthropods tended to decline, and a high degree of similarity in these indices (with fluctuation) was observed among different ages of shrub plantation in autumn. Altogether the recovery of arthropod communities was markedly affected by seasonal variability, and they demonstrated distinctive communal fingerprints in different microhabitats for each plantation age stage."
https://openalex.org/W2165560454,"Uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing is a unique and vital process in kinetoplastids, required for creation of translatable open reading frames in most mitochondrially-encoded RNAs. Emerging as a key player in this process is the mitochondrial RNA binding 1 (MRB1) complex. MRB1 comprises an RNA-independent core complex of at least six proteins, including the GAP1/2 guide RNA (gRNA) binding proteins. The core interacts in an RNA-enhanced or -dependent manner with imprecisely defined TbRGG2 subcomplexes, Armadillo protein MRB10130, and additional factors that comprise the dynamic MRB1 complex. Towards understanding MRB1 complex function in RNA editing, we present here functional characterization of the pentein domain-containing MRB1 core protein, MRB11870. Inducible RNAi studies demonstrate that MRB11870 is essential for proliferation of both insect vector and human infective stage T. brucei. MRB11870 ablation causes a massive defect in RNA editing, affecting both pan-edited and minimally edited mRNAs, but does not substantially affect mitochondrial RNA stability or processing of precursor transcripts. The editing defect in MRB1-depleted cells occurs at the initiation stage of editing, as pre-edited mRNAs accumulate. However, the gRNAs that direct editing remain abundant in the knockdown cells. To examine the contribution of MRB11870 to MRB1 macromolecular interactions, we tagged core complexes and analyzed their composition and associated proteins in the presence and absence of MRB11870. These studies demonstrated that MRB11870 is essential for association of GAP1/2 with the core, as well as for interaction of the core with other proteins and subcomplexes. Together, these data support a model in which the MRB1 core mediates functional interaction of gRNAs with the editing machinery, having GAP1/2 as its gRNA binding constituents. MRB11870 is a critical component of the core, essential for its structure and function."

However, the mechanisms by which H2O2 increases OPN expression remain poorly defined. OPN protein expression increased in an unusual biphasic pattern in response to H2O2. To investigate whether these increases were mediated through transcriptional and/or translational regulation of OPN, smooth muscle cells stimulated with 50 μm H2O2 were used as an in vitro cell system. Early protein increases at 6 h were not preceded by increased mRNA, whereas later increases (18 h) were, suggesting multiple mechanisms of regulation by H2O2. Polyribosomal fractionation assays established that early increases (6 h) in OPN expression were due to increased translation. This increase in translation occurred through phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at the reactive oxygen species-sensitive Ser-65, which allowed for release and activation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E and subsequent OPN translation. This early increase (6 h) in OPN was blunted in cells expressing a phospho-deficient 4E-BP1 mutant. H2O2 stimulation increased rat OPN promoter activity at 8 and 18 h, and promoter truncation studies established that promoter region −2284 to −795 is crucial for H2O2-dependent OPN transcription. ChIP studies determined that H2O2-dependent transcription is mediated by the reactive oxygen species-sensitive transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1.

https://openalex.org/W2091993766,"In the last ten years, the incidences of metabolic syndrome and supraventricular arrhythmias have greatly increased. The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of alterations, which include obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, that increase the risk of developing, among others, atrial and nodal arrhythmias. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that metabolic syndrome induces electrical remodeling of the sinus node and produces arrhythmias. We induced metabolic syndrome in 2-month-old male Wistar rats by administering 20% sucrose in the drinking water. Eight weeks later, the rats were anesthetized and the electrocardiogram was recorded, revealing the presence of arrhythmias only in treated rats. Using conventional microelectrode and voltage clamp techniques, we analyzed the electrical activity of the sinoatrial node. We observed that in the sinoatrial node of “metabolic syndrome rats”, compared to controls, the spontaneous firing of all cells decreased, while the slope of the diastolic depolarization increased only in latent pacemaker cells. Accordingly, the pacemaker currents If and Ist increased. Furthermore, histological analysis showed a large amount of fat surrounding nodal cardiomyocytes and a rise in the sympathetic innervation. Finally, Poincaré plot denoted irregularity in the R-R and P-P ECG intervals, in agreement with the variability of nodal firing potential recorded in metabolic syndrome rats. We conclude that metabolic syndrome produces a dysfunction SA node by disrupting normal architecture and the electrical activity, which could explain the onset of arrhythmias in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2019159187,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is ubiquitously expressed. Studies in neuronal cells have implicated APP or its fragments as negative regulators of cholesterol metabolism. In the current study, APP acted, via its α-cleavage, as a positive regulator of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) signaling in human astrocytic cells (U251MG), hepatic cells (HepG2), and primary fibroblasts, leading to an approximate 30% increase in SRE-dependent gene expression and, consequently, enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor levels. This effect was mediated via the secretory ectodomain APPsα. The β-cleaved ectodomain, in turn, repressed SRE-dependent gene expression by up to ~30%. This resulted in decreased cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor content, establishing a physiological feedback loop in cholesterol-loaded cells, where APP undergoes preferential β-cleavage. Patients with familial Alzheimer's disease had decreased circulating lathosterol, reflecting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and their fibroblasts had reduced LDL receptor content, which was alleviated by decreasing β-cleavage. These results show that APP regulates cholesterol metabolism in cells relevant for whole-body cholesterol balance and reveal that APP α-and β-cleavages produce opposing paracrine regulators of SREBP2 signaling.—Wang, W., Mutka, A.-L., Zmrzljak, U.

Considering that there are no reports that assess the genetic toxicity of Guttiferone A, the present study was undertaken to investigate the genotoxic potential of this benzophenone isolated from seeds of Garcinia achachairu in terms of DNA damage in different cells of Swiss albino mice using the comet assay, and its clastogenic/aneugenic effects in bone marrow cells in vivo by the micronucleus test. Cytotoxicity was assessed by scoring polychromatic (PCE) and normochromatic (NCE) erythrocytes ratio. Guttiferone A was administered by oral gavage at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg. The results showed that Guttiferone A produced genotoxic effects in leukocytes, liver, bone marrow, brain and testicle cells and clastogenic/aneugenic effects in bone marrow erythrocytes of mice. The PCE/NCE ratio indicated no cytotoxicity. Since guttiferone A is harmful to the genetic material we suggest caution in its use by humans."
https://openalex.org/W2074762482,"The concept of feature selectivity in sensory signal processing can be formalized as dimensionality reduction: in a stimulus space of very high dimensions, neurons respond only to variations within some smaller, relevant subspace. But if neural responses exhibit invariances, then the relevant subspace typically cannot be reached by a Euclidean projection of the original stimulus. We argue that, in several cases, we can make progress by appealing to the simplest nonlinear construction, identifying the relevant variables as quadratic forms, or “stimulus energies.” Natural examples include non–phase–locked cells in the auditory system, complex cells in the visual cortex, and motion–sensitive neurons in the visual system. Generalizing the idea of maximally informative dimensions, we show that one can search for kernels of the relevant quadratic forms by maximizing the mutual information between the stimulus energy and the arrival times of action potentials. Simple implementations of this idea successfully recover the underlying properties of model neurons even when the number of parameters in the kernel is comparable to the number of action potentials and stimuli are completely natural. We explore several generalizations that allow us to incorporate plausible structure into the kernel and thereby restrict the number of parameters. We hope that this approach will add significantly to the set of tools available for the analysis of neural responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli."

Here, we show that both LPA (18:1) and VPC31143 (a synthetic agonist of LPA1–3 receptors) relax intact mouse thoracic aorta with similar Emax values (53.9 and 51.9% of phenylephrine-induced precontraction), although the EC50 of LPA- and VPC31143-induced vasorelaxations were different (400 vs. 15 nM, respectively). Mechanical removal of the endothelium or genetic deletion of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) not only diminished vasorelaxation by LPA or VPC31143 but converted it to vasoconstriction. Freshly isolated mouse aortic endothelial cells expressed LPA1, LPA2, LPA4 and LPA5 transcripts. The LPA1–3 antagonist Ki16425, the LPA1 antagonist AM095, and the genetic deletion of LPA1, but not that of LPA2, abolished LPA-induced vasorelaxation. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase-protein kinase B/Akt pathway by wortmannin or MK-2206 failed to influence the effect of LPA. However, pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) by U73122 or edelfosine, but not genetic deletion of PLCε, abolished LPA-induced vasorelaxation and indicated that a PLC enzyme, other than PLCε, mediates the response.

https://openalex.org/W1998753889,"Despite a vast amount information on the interplay of GroEL, GroES, and ATP in chaperone-assisted folding, the molecular details on the conformational dynamics of folding polypeptide during its GroEL/GroES-assisted folding cycle is quite limited. Practically no such studies have been reported to date on large proteins, which often have difficulty folding in vitro. The effect of the GroEL/GroES chaperonin system on the folding pathway of an 82-kDa slow folding protein, malate synthase G (MSG), was investigated. GroEL bound to the burst phase intermediate of MSG and accelerated the slowest kinetic phase associated with the formation of native topology in the spontaneous folding pathway. GroEL slowly induced conformational changes on the bound burst phase intermediate, which was then transformed into a more folding-compatible form. Subsequent addition of ATP or GroES/ATP to the GroEL-MSG complex led to the formation of the native state via a compact intermediate with the rate several times faster than that of spontaneous refolding. The presence of GroES doubled the ATP-dependent reactivation rate of bound MSG by preventing multiple cycles of its GroEL binding and release. Because GroES bound to the trans side of GroEL-MSG complex, it may be anticipated that confinement of the substrate underneath the co-chaperone is not required for accelerating the rate in the assisted folding pathway. The potential role of GroEL/GroES in assisted folding is most likely to modulate the conformation of MSG intermediates that can fold faster and thereby eliminate the possibility of partial aggregation caused by the slow folding intermediates during its spontaneous refolding pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2029879879,"Background and purpose TRPV1 is expressed in sensory neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to both pain perception and tissue blood distribution. Local desensitization of TRPV1 in sensory neurons by prolonged, high dose stimulation is re-engaged in clinical practice to achieve analgesia, but the effects of such treatments on the vascular TRPV1 are not known. Experimental approach Newborn rats were injected with capsaicin for five days. Sensory activation was measured by eye wiping tests and plasma extravasation. Isolated, pressurized skeletal muscle arterioles were used to characterize TRPV1 mediated vascular responses, while expression of TRPV1 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Key results Capsaicin evoked sensory responses, such as eye wiping (3.6±2.5 versus 15.5±1.4 wipes, p<0.01) or plasma extravasation (evans blue accumulation 10±3 versus 33±7 µg/g, p<0.05) were reduced in desensitized rats. In accordance, the number of TRPV1 positive sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia was also decreased. However, TRPV1 expression in smooth muscle cells was not affected by the treatment. There were no differences in the diameter (192±27 versus 194±8 µm), endothelium mediated dilations (evoked by acetylcholine), norepinephrine mediated constrictions, myogenic response and in the capsaicin evoked constrictions of arterioles isolated from skeletal muscle. Conclusion and implications Systemic capsaicin treatment of juvenile rats evokes anatomical and functional disappearance of the TRPV1-expressing neuronal cells but does not affect the TRPV1-expressing cells of the arterioles, implicating different effects of TRPV1 stimulation on the viability of these cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2019432978,"AIDS, caused by the retrovirus HIV, remains the largest cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa yet almost all genetic studies have focused on cohorts from Western countries. HIV shows high co-morbidity with tuberculosis (TB), as HIV stimulates the reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). Recent clinical trials suggest that an effective anti-HIV response correlates with non-neutralising antibodies. Given that Fcγ receptors are critical in mediating the non-neutralising effects of antibodies, analysis of the extensive variation at Fcγ receptor genes is important. Single nucleotide variation and copy number variation (CNV) of Fcγ receptor genes affects the expression profile, activatory/inhibitory balance, and IgG affinity of the Fcγ receptor repertoire of each individual. In this study we investigated whether CNV of FCGR2C, FCGR3A and FCGR3B as well as the HNA1 allotype of FCGR3B is associated with HIV load, response to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and co-infection with TB. We confirmed an effect of TB-co-infection status on HIV load and response to HAART, but no conclusive effect of the genetic variants we tested. We observed a small effect, in Ethiopians, of FCGR3B copy number, where deletion was more frequent in HIV-TB co-infected patients than those infected with HIV alone."
https://openalex.org/W2154170603,"Apoptosis of lymphocytes governs the response of the immune system to environmental stress and toxic insult. Signaling through the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor, stress-induced glucocorticoid hormones induce apoptosis via mechanisms requiring altered gene expression. Several reports have detailed the changes in gene expression mediating glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. However, few studies have examined the role of non-coding miRNAs in this essential physiological process. Previously, using hybridization-based gene expression analysis and deep sequencing of small RNAs, we described the prevalent post-transcriptional repression of annotated miRNAs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. Here, we describe the development of a customized bioinformatics pipeline that facilitates the deep sequencing-mediated discovery of novel glucocorticoid-responsive miRNAs in apoptotic primary lymphocytes. This analysis identifies the potential presence of over 200 novel glucocorticoid-responsive miRNAs. We have validated the expression of two novel glucocorticoid-responsive miRNAs using small RNA-specific qPCR. Furthermore, through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) we determined that the putative targets of these novel validated miRNAs are predicted to regulate cell death processes. These findings identify two and predict the presence of additional novel glucocorticoid-responsive miRNAs in the rat transcriptome, suggesting a potential role for both annotated and novel miRNAs in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2081712014,"The xanthophyll cycle (Xc), which involves violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) and the zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), is one of the most rapid and efficient responses of plant and algae to high irradiance. High light intensity can activate VDE to convert violaxanthin (Vx) to zeaxanthin (Zx) via antheraxanthin (Ax). However, it remains unclear whether VDE remains active under low light or dark conditions when there is no significant accumulation of Ax and Zx, and if so, how the ΔpH required for activation of VDE is built. In this study, we used salicylaldoxime (SA) to inhibit ZEP activity in the intertidal macro-algae Ulva sp. (Ulvales, Chlorophyta) and then characterized VDE under low light and dark conditions with various metabolic inhibitors. With inhibition of ZEP by SA, VDE remained active under low light and dark conditions, as indicated by large accumulations of Ax and Zx at the expense of Vx. When PSII-mediated linear electron transport systems were completely inhibited by SA and DCMU, alternative electron transport systems (i.e., cyclic electron transport and chlororespiration) could maintain VDE activity. Furthermore, accumulations of Ax and Zx decreased significantly when SA, DCMU, or DBMIB together with an inhibitor of chlororespiration (i.e., propyl gallate (PG)) were applied to Ulva sp. This result suggests that chlororespiration not only participates in the build-up of the necessary ΔpH, but that it also possibly influences VDE activity indirectly by diminishing the oxygen level in the chloroplast."
https://openalex.org/W2075078330,"Single cell techniques permit the analysis of cellular properties that are obscured by studying the average behavior of cell populations. One way to determine how gene expression contributes to phenotypic differences among cells is to combine functional analysis with transcriptional profiling of single cells. Here we describe a microfluidic device for monitoring the responses of single cells to a ligand and then collecting cells of interest for transcriptional profiling or other assays. As a test, cells from the olfactory epithelium of zebrafish were screened by calcium imaging to identify sensory neurons that were responsive to the odorant L-lysine. Single cells were subsequently recovered for transcriptional profiling by qRT-PCR. Responsive cells all expressed TRPC2 but not OMP, consistent with known properties of amino-acid sensitive olfactory neurons. The device can be adapted for other areas in biology where there is a need to sort and analyze cells based on their signaling responses."
https://openalex.org/W2051443312,"In the following, we offer a novel approach to modeling the observed effects currently attributed to the theoretical concepts of “dark energy,” “dark matter,” and “dark flow.” Instead of assuming the existence of these theoretical concepts, we take an alternative route and choose to redefine what we consider to be inertial motion as well as what constitutes an inertial frame of reference in flat space-time. We adopt none of the features of our current cosmological models except for the requirement that special and general relativity be local approximations within our revised definition of inertial systems. Implicit in our ideas is the assumption that at “large enough” scales one can treat objects within these inertial systems as point-particles having an insignificant effect on the curvature of space-time. We then proceed under the assumption that time and space are fundamentally intertwined such that time- and spatial-translational invariance are not inherent symmetries of flat space-time (i.e., observable clock rates depend upon both relative velocity and spatial position within these inertial systems) and take the geodesics of this theory in the radial Rindler chart as the proper characterization of inertial motion. With this commitment, we are able to model solely with inertial motion the observed effects expected to be the result of “dark energy,” “dark matter,” and “dark flow.” In addition, we examine the potential observable implications of our theory in a gravitational system located within a confined region of an inertial reference frame, subsequently interpreting the Pioneer anomaly as support for our redefinition of inertial motion. As well, we extend our analysis into quantum mechanics by quantizing for a real scalar field and find a possible explanation for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter within the framework of these redefined inertial systems."
https://openalex.org/W1965905885,"To minimize feature loss in T1- and T2-weighted MRI by merging multiple MR images acquired at different TR and TE to generate an image with increased dynamic range.High Dynamic Range (HDR) processing techniques from the field of photography were applied to a series of acquired MR images. Specifically, a method to parameterize the algorithm for MRI data was developed and tested. T1- and T2-weighted images of a number of contrast agent phantoms and a live mouse were acquired with varying TR and TE parameters. The images were computationally merged to produce HDR-MR images. All acquisitions were performed on a 7.05 T Bruker PharmaScan with a multi-echo spin echo pulse sequence.HDR-MRI delineated bright and dark features that were either saturated or indistinguishable from background in standard T1- and T2-weighted MRI. The increased dynamic range preserved intensity gradation over a larger range of T1 and T2 in phantoms and revealed more anatomical features in vivo.We have developed and tested a method to apply HDR processing to MR images. The increased dynamic range of HDR-MR images as compared to standard T1- and T2-weighted images minimizes feature loss caused by magnetization recovery or low SNR."
https://openalex.org/W2020396937,"Visual remapping of touch (VRT) is a phenomenon in which seeing a human face being touched enhances detection of tactile stimuli on the observer's own face, especially when the observed face expresses fear. This study tested whether VRT would occur when seeing touch on monkey faces and whether it would be similarly modulated by facial expressions. Human participants detected near-threshold tactile stimulation on their own cheeks while watching fearful, happy, and neutral human or monkey faces being concurrently touched or merely approached by fingers. We predicted minimal VRT for neutral and happy monkey faces but greater VRT for fearful monkey faces. The results with human faces replicated previous findings, demonstrating stronger VRT for fearful expressions than for happy or neutral expressions. However, there was no VRT (i.e. no difference between accuracy in touch and no-touch trials) for any of the monkey faces, regardless of facial expression, suggesting that touch on a non-human face is not remapped onto the somatosensory system of the human observer."
https://openalex.org/W2170805129,"β-blockers are widely used to improve symptoms and prolong life in heart disease primarily by inhibiting the actions of endogenous catecholamines at the β1-adrenoceptor. There are two common naturally occurring polymorphisms within the human β1-adrenoceptor sequence: Ser or Gly at position 49 in the N-terminus and Gly or Arg at position 389 in the C-terminus and some clinical studies have suggested that expression of certain variants may be associated with disease and affect response to treatment with β-blockers. The β1-adrenoceptor also exists in two agonist conformations - a high affinity catecholamine conformation and a low affinity secondary agonist conformation. Receptor-effector coupling and intracellular signalling from the different conformations may be affected by the polymorphic variants. Here, we examine in detail the molecular pharmacology of the β1-adrenoceptor polymorphic variants with respect to ligand affinity, efficacy, activation of the different agonist conformations and signal transduction and determine whether the polymorphic variants do indeed affect this secondary conformation. Stable cell lines expressing the wildtype and polymorphic variants were constructed and receptor pharmacology examined using whole cell binding and intracellular secondary messenger techniques. There was no difference in affinity for agonists and antagonists at the human wildtype β1-adrenoceptor (Ser49/Gly389) and the polymorphic variants Gly49/Gly389 and Ser49/Arg389. Furthermore, the polymorphic variant receptors both have two active agonist conformations with pharmacological properties similar to the wildtype receptor. Although the polymorphism at position 389 is thought to occur in an intracellular domain important for Gs-coupling, the two agonist conformations of the polymorphic variants stimulate intracellular signalling pathways, including Gs-cAMP intracellular signalling, in a manner very similar to that of the wildtype receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2149747452,"Genetic studies often use genomic DNA from whole blood cells, of which the majority are the polymorphonuclear myeloid cells. Those cells undergo dramatic change of nuclear morphology following cellular differentiation. It remains elusive if the nuclear morphological change accompanies sequence alternations from the intact genome. If such event exists, it will cause a serious problem in using such type of genomic DNA for genetic study as the sequences will not represent the intact genome in the host individuals. Using exome sequencing, we compared the coding regions between neutrophil, which is the major type of polymorphonuclear cells, and CD4+ T cell, which has an intact genome, from the same individual. The results show that exon sequences between the two cell types are essentially the same. The minor differences represented by the missed exons and base changes between the two cell types were validated to be mainly caused by experimental errors. Our study concludes that genomic DNA from whole blood cells can be safely used for genetic studies."
