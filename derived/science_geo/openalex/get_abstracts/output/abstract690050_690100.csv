https://openalex.org/W4221036171,"The role of histone modifications in transcription remains incompletely understood. Here, we examine the relationship between histone modifications and transcription using experimental perturbations combined with sensitive machine-learning tools. Transcription predicted the variation in active histone marks and complex chromatin states, like bivalent promoters, down to single-nucleosome resolution and at an accuracy that rivaled the correspondence between independent ChIP-seq experiments. Blocking transcription rapidly removed two punctate marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, from chromatin indicating that transcription is required for active histone modifications. Transcription was also required for maintenance of H3K27me3, consistent with a role for RNA in recruiting PRC2. A subset of DNase-I-hypersensitive sites were refractory to prediction, precluding models where transcription initiates pervasively at any open chromatin. Our results, in combination with past literature, support a model in which active histone modifications serve a supportive, rather than an essential regulatory, role in transcription. A machine-learning tool can predict the distribution of histone post-translational modifications using nascent transcription data. Inhibiting transcription impacts H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W4221127946,"In these times of successive lockdown periods due to the health crisis induced by COVID-19, this paper investigates how the usages of collaborative and communication digital tools (groupware, workflow, instant messaging and web conference) are related to the evolution of teleworkers' subjective well-being (job satisfaction, job stress) and job productivity comparing during and before the first lockdown in spring 2020. Using a sample of 438 employees working for firms located in Luxembourg, this analysis enables, first, to highlight different profiles of teleworkers regarding the evolution of usages of these tools during the lockdown compared to before and the frequency of use during. Second, the analysis highlights that these profiles are linked to the evolution of job satisfaction, job stress and job productivity. Our main results show that (1) the profile that generates an increase in job productivity is the one with a combined mastered daily or weekly use of all of the four studied digital tools but at the expense of job satisfaction. On the contrary, (2) the use of the four digital tools both before and during the lockdown, associated with an increase in the frequency of use, appears to generate too much information flow to deal with and teleworkers may suffer from information overload that increases their stress and reduces their job satisfaction and job productivity. (3) The habit of using the four tools on a daily basis before the lockdown appears to protect teleworkers from most of the adverse effects, except for an increase in their job stress. Our results have theoretical and managerial implications for the future of the digitally transformed home office."
https://openalex.org/W4220694807,"Chronic diseases are the leading causes of disability and premature death among the elderly population in India. The study, using data from the 75 th round of the NSSO survey (N = 44,631), examined the prevalence and determinants of chronic diseases among the population aged 60+ in India by applying bivariate and logistic regression analyses and used a non-linear decomposition technique to understand the urban-rural differences in the prevalence of chronic diseases. About 21% of the elderly in India reportedly have at least one chronic disease. Seventeen percent elderly in rural areas and 29% in urban areas suffer from a chronic disease. Hypertension and diabetes account for about 68% of all chronic diseases. The prevalence of chronic diseases is the highest in Kerala (54%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (43), West Bengal (36), and Goa (32). Those with higher levels of education, staying in urban areas, those who are economically dependent on others, staying alone or without spouse and children, and belonging to wealthy households have a higher likelihood of having a chronic disease. The probability of having a chronic disease is 1.15 times higher among urban residents as compared to their rural counterparts. Elderly rural women, compared to elderly rural men, and never-married, widowed, and divorced elderly urban women, compared to married elderly urban men, are significantly more likely to suffer from chronic ailments. Differences in education, wealth status, and caste are the three most significant contributors to the urban-rural gap in chronic diseases. The high risk of chronic diseases among certain subsets of the elderly population must be recognized as a key public health concern. The findings of our study will likely help promote healthy ageing in India."
https://openalex.org/W4220785468,"Sarcopenia is characterized by the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that develops progressively and plays an important role in the disability of the elderly. It has received growing attention over the last decade and has been implicated as both a cause and consequence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The existence of T2DM could increase the risk of developing sarcopenia through multiple mechanisms including advanced glycation end-product accumulation. Meanwhile, sarcopenia would alter glucose disposal and may contribute to the development and progression of T2DM due to reduced muscle mass.We implemented transcriptomic analysis of skeletal muscle biopsy specimens in sarcopenia patients and proliferating myoblasts or differentiated myotubes from individuals with T2DM. Related microarray data were selected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to screen the genes, which were differentially expressed for sarcopenia and T2DM. Multiple combinatorial statistical methods and bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the common DEGs. Meanwhile, functional enrichment analysis was also carried out. Furthermore, we constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI), as well as transcription factor (TF)-gene interactions network and TF-miRNA coregulatory network. Finally, based on the common DEGs, drug compounds were speculated using the Drug Signatures database (DSigDB).A total of 1765 and 2155 DEGs of sarcopenia and T2DM were screened, respectively. 15 common genes (LXN, CIB2, PEA15, KANK2, FGD1, NMRK1, PLCB1, SEMA4G, ADARB1, UPF3A, CSTB, COL3A1, CD99, ETV3, FJX1) correlated with sarcopenia and T2DM simultaneously were then identified, and 3 genes (UPF3A, CSTB and PEA15) of them were regarded as hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed several shared pathways between two diseases. In addition, according to the TF-gene interactions network and TF-miRNA coregulatory network, part of TF and miRNA may be identified as key regulator in sarcopenia and T2DM at the same time (e.g., CREM and miR-155). Notably, drug compounds for T2DM and sarcopenia were also suggested, such as coenzyme Q10.This study revealed that sarcopenia and T2DM may share similar pathogenesis and provided new biological targets and ideas for early diagnosis and effective treatment of sarcopenia and T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W4220675873,"Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are defined as any procedure releasing airborne particles <5 μm in size from the respiratory tract. There remains uncertainty about which dental procedures constitute AGPs. We quantified the aerosol number concentration generated during a range of periodontal, oral surgery and orthodontic procedures using an aerodynamic particle sizer, which measures aerosol number concentrations and size distribution across the 0.5-20 μm diameter size range. Measurements were conducted in an environment with a sufficiently low background to detect a patient's cough, enabling confident identification of aerosol. Phantom head control experiments for each procedure were performed under the same conditions as a comparison. Where aerosol was detected during a patient procedure, we assessed whether the size distribution could be explained by the non-salivary contaminated instrument source in the respective phantom head control procedure using a two-sided unpaired t-test (comparing the mode widths (log(σ)) and peak positions (DP,C)). The aerosol size distribution provided a robust fingerprint of aerosol emission from a source. 41 patients underwent fifteen different dental procedures. For nine procedures, no aerosol was detected above background. Where aerosol was detected, the percentage of procedure time that aerosol was observed above background ranged from 12.7% for ultrasonic scaling, to 42.9% for 3-in-1 air + water syringe. For ultrasonic scaling, 3-in-1 syringe use and surgical drilling, the aerosol size distribution matched the non-salivary contaminated instrument source, with no unexplained aerosol. High and slow speed drilling produced aerosol from patient procedures with different size distributions to those measured from the phantom head controls (mode widths log(σ)) and peaks (DP,C, p< 0.002) and, therefore, may pose a greater risk of salivary contamination. This study provides evidence for sources of aerosol generation during common dental procedures, enabling more informed evaluation of risk and appropriate mitigation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4220965057,"Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a grain legume commonly grown in Asia and Africa for food and forage. It is a highly nutritious and robust crop, capable of surviving both droughts and floods. However, it produces a neurotoxic compound, β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP), which can cause a severe neurological disorder when consumed as a primary diet component. While the catalytic activity associated with β-ODAP formation was demonstrated more than 50 years ago, the enzyme responsible for this activity has not been identified. Here, we report on the identity, activity, 3D structure, and phylogenesis of this enzyme-β-ODAP synthase (BOS). We show that BOS belongs to the benzylalcohol O-acetyltransferase, anthocyanin O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase, deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase superfamily of acyltransferases and is structurally similar to hydroxycinnamoyl transferase. Using molecular docking, we propose a mechanism for its catalytic activity, and using heterologous expression in tobacco leaves (Nicotiana benthamiana), we demonstrate that expression of BOS in the presence of its substrates is sufficient for β-ODAP production in vivo. The identification of BOS may pave the way toward engineering β-ODAP-free grass pea cultivars, which are safe for human and animal consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4221027829,"Iron is an essential element for nearly all organisms, and under anoxic and/or reducing conditions, Fe2+ is the dominant form of iron available to bacteria. The ferrous iron transport (Feo) system is the primary prokaryotic Fe2+ import machinery, and two constituent proteins (FeoA and FeoB) are conserved across most bacterial species. However, how FeoA and FeoB function relative to one another remains enigmatic. In this work, we explored the distribution of feoAB operons encoding a fusion of FeoA tethered to the N-terminal, G-protein domain of FeoB via a connecting linker region. We hypothesized that this fusion poises FeoA to interact with FeoB to affect function. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the soluble NFeoAB fusion protein from Bacteroides fragilis, a commensal organism implicated in drug-resistant infections. Using X-ray crystallography, we determined the 1.50-Å resolution structure of BfFeoA, which adopts an SH3-like fold implicated in protein-protein interactions. Using a combination of structural modeling, small-angle X-ray scattering, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show that FeoA and NFeoB interact in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and we mapped the protein-protein interaction interface. Finally, using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis assays, we demonstrate that BfNFeoAB exhibits one of the slowest known rates of Feo-mediated GTP hydrolysis that is not potassium-stimulated. Importantly, truncation of FeoA from this fusion demonstrates that FeoA-NFeoB interactions function to stabilize the GTP-bound form of FeoB. Taken together, our work reveals a role for FeoA function in the fused FeoAB system and suggests a function for FeoA among prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W4221078622,"This study profiled the prevalence of extended-spectrum ß-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) in the community and compared their resistome and genomic profiles with isolates from clinical patients through whole-genome sequencing.Fecal samples from 233 community dwellers from Segamat, a town in southern Malaysia, were obtained between May through August 2018. Putative ESBL strains were screened and tested using antibiotic susceptibility tests. Additionally, eight clinical ESBL-EC were obtained from a hospital in the same district between June through October 2020. Whole-genome sequencing was then conducted on selected ESBL-EC from both settings (n = 40) for pan-genome comparison, cluster analysis, and resistome profiling.A mean ESBL-EC carriage rate of 17.82% (95% CI: 10.48%- 24.11%) was observed in the community and was consistent across demographic factors. Whole-genome sequences of the ESBL-EC (n = 40) enabled the detection of multiple plasmid replicon groups (n = 28), resistance genes (n = 34) and virulence factors (n = 335), with no significant difference in the number of genes carried between the community and clinical isolates (plasmid replicon groups, p = 0.13; resistance genes, p = 0.47; virulence factors, p = 0.94). Virulence gene marker analysis detected the presence of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) in both the community and clinical isolates. Multiple blaCTX-M variants were observed, dominated by blaCTX-M-27 (n = 12), blaCTX-M-65 (n = 10), and blaCTX-M-15 (n = 9). The clinical and community isolates did not cluster together based on the pan-genome comparison, suggesting isolates from the two settings were clonally unrelated. However, cluster analysis based on carried plasmids, resistance genes and phenotypic susceptibility profiles identified four distinct clusters, with similar patterns between the community and clinical isolates.ESBL-EC from the clinical and community settings shared similar resistome profiles, suggesting the frequent exchange of genetic materials through horizontal gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W4220727830,"To determine the seroprevalence of the SARS Cov 2 infection among vaccine naive population in a rural district of South India post-second surge.We conducted a cross-sectional study in the five villages of a randomly chosen sub-district in the Bangalore rural district. We did house to house surveys and recruited 831 vaccine naive adults in July 2021. We tested samples for the presence of antibodies (including IgG & IgM) to SARS CoV-2 using the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 -S assay that quantifies antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein.We estimated an overall prevalence of 62.7% (95% CI: 59.3-66.0) and an age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence of 44.9% (95% CI: 42.5-47.4). When adjusted for test performance, the seroprevalence was 74.64% (95% CI: 70.66-78.47). The case-to-undetected-infected ratio (CIR) was 1: 8.65 (95% CI 1:8.1-1:9.1), and the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was 16.27 per 100,00 infections as of 13 July 2021. A history of at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19 or a positive COVID-19 test of self or a family member in the past were significantly associated with seropositivity.We report a high seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection despite the advantages of low population density and well-ventilated landscapes in rural areas. CIR and IFR were higher than the previous serosurvey conducted in the same population during the first surge. The thought of achieving herd immunity comes with relief. However, it's vital to put efforts into building population health and rural health infrastructure to avert future health catastrophes."
https://openalex.org/W4220752460,"Taking the traditional fort-type settlements in Shaanxi as the research object, quantitative research methods such as K-means clustering algorithm, correlation analysis, density analysis, and nearest neighbor index are used to study their spatial distribution, formation causes, and cluster characteristics. The objective of the study is to break through the geographical limitations of fort-type settlements research and to explore the scientific methods of classifying and analyzing traditional fort-type settlements. The conclusions are: (1) The results of cluster analysis show that the fort-type settlements in Shaanxi can be divided into three categories; (2) The overall distribution of fort-type settlements in Shaanxi shows multi-point aggregation, and contains both point and linear aggregation distribution; (3) There are four typical cluster systems among the traditional fort-type settlements in Shaanxi; (4) The factors that have the greatest influence on the distribution of settlements are construction force, wall masonry, age, fortification purpose, and topographic environment. The article innovatively proposes the ""cluster system"" perspective and introduces mathematical algorithms and quantitative research methods to study the cluster system of the fort-type Settlements. This approach is feasible and can be applied to other settlement-related studies. At the same time, the perspective of cluster system could be used in heritage conservation, which can contribute to the restoration of architectural relics and systemic conservation on a larger scale."
https://openalex.org/W4220880455,"How does smartphone use behavior affect quality of life factors? The following work suggests new insights into smartphone use behavior, mainly regarding two contradicting smartphone modes of use that affect quality of life in opposite ways. The Aware smartphone mode of use reflects an active lifestyle, while the Unaware mode of use reflects the use of the smartphone in conjunction with other activities. Using data from 215 individuals who reported their quality of life and smartphone use habits, we show that high levels of smartphone use in the Unaware mode of use have a significant negative effect on the quality of life. However, the results show a mild positive effect when the individual uses the smartphone in an aware mode of use. We identify three latent factors within the quality-of-life construct and measure the effect of the different smartphone modes of use on these quality-of-life factors. We find that (i) The functioning latent factor, which is an individual’s ability to function well in his or her daily life, is not affected by smartphone use behavior. In contrast, (ii) the competence latent factor, which is a lack of negative emotions or pain, and (iii) the positive feelings latent factor both show a clear effect with the smartphone Unaware mode of use. This implies that the unaware use of smartphones, which is its use in conjunction with other activities or late at night, can be related to lower levels of quality of life. Since smartphones currently serve as an interface between the self and the cyber space, as well as an interface between the self and other individuals online, these results need to be considered for social wellbeing in relation to digital human behavior, smartphone addiction and a healthy mode of use."
https://openalex.org/W4220936320,"Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are frequently interconnected due to underlying pathology involving atherosclerosis and thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of clinical interactions among cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases on patient outcomes using a large-scale nationwide claims-based dataset. Cardiovascular diseases were defined as myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic dissection. Cerebrovascular diseases were defined as cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This retrospective study included 2,736,986 inpatient records (1,800,255 patients) at 911 hospitals from 2015 to 2016 from Japanese registry of all cardiac and vascular disease-diagnostic procedure combination dataset. Interactions among comorbidities and complications, rehospitalization, and clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality were investigated. Among hospitalization records that involved cardiovascular disease, 5.9% (32,686 records) had cerebrovascular disease as a comorbidity and 2.1% (11,362 records) included an incident cerebrovascular complication after hospitalization. Cerebrovascular disease as a comorbidity or complication was associated with higher in-hospital mortality than no cerebrovascular disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval]: 1.10 [1.06-1.14], 2.02 [1.91-2.13], respectively). Among 367,904 hospitalization records that involved cerebrovascular disease, 17.7% (63,647 records) had cardiovascular disease listed as comorbidity and 3.3% (11,834 records) as a complication. Only cardiovascular disease as a complication was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR [95% confidence interval]: 1.29 [1.22-1.37]). In addition, in-hospital mortality during rehospitalization due to the other disease was significantly higher than mortality during the hospitalization due to the first disease. In conclusion, substantial associations were observed between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in a large-scale nationwide claims-based dataset; these associations had a significant impact on clinical outcomes. More intensive prevention and management of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease might be crucial."
https://openalex.org/W4220960920,"Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to control the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. Here, we present a protocol to anchor the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-)protein in the cytoplasmic membranes of erythrocyte liposomes. A surfactant was used to stabilize the S-protein's structure in the aqueous environment before insertion and to facilitate reconstitution of the S-proteins in the erythrocyte membranes. The insertion process was studied using coarse grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Liposome formation and S-protein anchoring was studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS), ELV-protein co-sedimentation assays, fluorescent microcopy and cryo-TEM. The Erythro-VLPs (erythrocyte based virus like particles) have a well defined size of ∼200 nm and an average protein density on the outer membrane of up to ∼300 proteins/μm2. The correct insertion and functional conformation of the S-proteins was verified by dose-dependent binding to ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) in biolayer interferometry (BLI) assays. Seroconversion was observed in a pilot mouse trial after 14 days when administered intravenously, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This red blood cell based platform can open novel possibilities for therapeutics for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) including variants, and other viruses in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4220992219,"Poison frogs bioaccumulate alkaloids for chemical defense from their arthropod diet. Although many alkaloids are accumulated without modification, some poison frog species can metabolize pumiliotoxin (PTX 251D) into the more potent allopumiliotoxin (aPTX 267A). Despite extensive research characterizing the chemical arsenal of poison frogs, the physiological mechanisms involved in the sequestration and metabolism of individual alkaloids remain unclear. We first performed a feeding experiment with the Dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) to ask if this species can metabolize PTX 251D into aPTX 267A and what gene expression changes are associated with PTX 251D exposure in the intestines, liver, and skin. We found that D. tinctorius can metabolize PTX 251D into aPTX 267A, and that PTX 251D exposure changed the expression level of genes involved in immune system function and small molecule metabolism and transport. To better understand the functional significance of these changes in gene expression, we then conducted a series of high-throughput screens to determine the molecular targets of PTX 251D and identify potential proteins responsible for metabolism of PTX 251D into aPTX 267A. Although screens of PTX 251D binding human voltage-gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors were inconclusive, we identified human CYP2D6 as a rapid metabolizer of PTX 251D in a cytochrome P450 screen. Furthermore, a CYP2D6-like gene had increased expression in the intestines of animals fed PTX, suggesting this protein may be involved in PTX metabolism. These results show that individual alkaloids can modify gene expression across tissues, including genes involved in alkaloid metabolism. More broadly, this work suggests that specific alkaloid classes in wild diets may induce physiological changes for targeted accumulation and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4220687468,"The objectives of this study were to explore the occurrence and migration of coalbed methane in coals of different ranks and reveal the microscopic reservoir space and the mechanism of coalbed methane. To meet these objectives, this study selected six coal samples of different coal ranks for low-pressure N 2 adsorption experiments, explored the critical pore filling characteristics of packed N 2 molecules in the coals, and analyzed the low-pressure N 2 adsorption/desorption experimental isotherms using the DFT method and DA equation based on the micropore filling theory. Finally, the critical filling pressure and pore size range for micropore filling were determined, and the analysis results were verified by combining the Langmuir, DA, and BET equations. The results showed that, from low to high coal rank, the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the coal samples transition from type Ⅱ to type Ⅰ. The proportion of N 2 molecules in low-rank coals in the form of micropore filling and monolayer adsorption was higher than that in high-rank coals. The critical pressure and critical pore size for micropore filling exhibited U-shaped correlations with the coal rank. Low-rank coals (lignite and long flame coal) were gradually filled in the relative pressure range P/P 0 ≈ 1E-4–0.03, and medium- and high-rank coals (gas coal, 1/3 coking coal, lean coal, and anthracite) were filled in the relative pressure range P/P 0 ≈ 1E-4–0.01; the corresponding critical pore size ranges were 1.7–2.19 and 1.61–2.00 nm, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4220735049,"Considering perinatal transmission and the high rate of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in infants, diagnosis of HBV infection during pregnancy and timely interventions are of great importance. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the prevalence and genotype distribution of HBV infection and the associated risk factors among pregnant women in the northern shores of the Persian Gulf, South of Iran.Serum samples of 1425 pregnant women were tested for the presence of HBsAg and HBcAb by ELISA (HBsAg one-Version ULTRA and HBc Ab ELISA kits, DIA.PRO, Milan, Italy). The seropositive samples were tested for the presence of HBV DNA by nested PCR, targeting S, X, pre-core (pre-C), and basal core promoter (BCP) regions of the HBV genome. The amplified fragments were sequenced by Sanger dideoxy sequencing technology to evaluate the genotype distribution and mutations of HBV infection by using the MEGA 7 software. The HBV seropositive pregnant women were tested for HCV and HIV coinfections by ELISA (HCV Ab and HIV Ab/Ag ELISA kits, DIA.PRO, Milan, Italy).Of 1425 participants, 15 pregnant women (1.05%, 95% CI: 0.64%-1.73%) were positive for HBsAg, 41 women (2.88%, 95% CI: 2.10%-3.88%) were positive for HBcAb, and 5 women (0.35%, 95% CI: 0.15% -0.82%) had HBV viremia with genotype D, sub-genotype D3 and subtype ayw2. One of the viremic samples was positive for HBcAb but negative for HBsAg, which is indicative of an occult HBV infection. HBsAg seroprevalence was higher among pregnant women aged 20 to 29 years, women in the third trimester of pregnancy, residents of Khormuj city, Afghan immigrants, illiterate women, and pregnant women with a history of tattoo and HBV vaccination. The highest rate of HBcAb seroprevalence was observed in residents of Borazjan city, Turk ethnicity, the age group >39 years, and those women with more parities and a history of abortion. Nevertheless, HBV seroprevalence among pregnant women was not statistically associated with these variables. In contrast, HBcAb seropositivity was significantly associated with the history of tattoo (P = 0.018). According to mutations analyses, seven amino acid substitutions in the HBsAg, one point mutation in the pre-C region, and five points mutations in the BCP region were detected. Besides, the BCP mutations caused amino acid substitutions in the X protein. Of note, the conversion of Ala → Val at amino acid 168 (A168V) and Thr → Pro at amino acid 127 (T127P) were detected in HBsAg of the occult HBV strain.These results indicate a relatively low prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women in the South of Iran, while tattooing is a risk factor for exposure to HBV infection. Moreover, all of the HBV-positive pregnant women were asymptomatic and unaware of their infection. Therefore, routine screening for HBV markers during pregnancy, appropriate treatment of HBV-infected women, and HBV vaccination are recommended to decrease mother-to-child transmission of HBV."
https://openalex.org/W4220818447,"Military personnel are required to train and operate in challenging multi-stressor environments, which can affect hormonal levels, and subsequently compromise performance and recovery. The aims of this project were to 1) assess the impact of an eight-day military training exercise on salivary cortisol and testosterone, 2) track the recovery of these hormones during a period of reduced training.This was a prospective study whereby 30 soldiers (n = 27 men, n = 3 women) undergoing the Australian Army combat engineer 'Initial Employment Training' course were recruited and tracked over a 16-day study period which included an eight-day military training exercise. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected at waking, 30 min post waking, and bedtime on days 1, 5, 9, 13, 15; measures of subjective load were collected on the same days. Sleep was measured continuously via actigraphy, across four sequential study periods; 1) baseline (PRE: days 1-4), 2) field training with total sleep deprivation (EX-FIELD: days 5-8), 3) training at simulated base camp with sleep restriction (EX-BASE: days 9-12), and 4) a three-day recovery period (REC: days 13-15).Morning cortisol concentrations were lower following EX-FIELD (p<0.05) compared to the end of REC. Training in the field diminished testosterone concentrations (p<0.05), but levels recovered within four days. Bedtime testosterone/cortisol ratios decreased following EX-FIELD and did not return to pre-training levels.The sensitivity of testosterone levels and the testosterone/cortisol ratio to the period of field training suggests they may be useful indicators of a soldier's state of physiological strain, or capacity, however inter-individual differences in response to a multi-stressor environment need to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4220914095,"Traditional body measurement techniques are commonly used to assess physical health; however, these approaches do not fully represent the complex shape of the human body. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging systems capture rich point cloud data that provides a representation of the surface of 3D objects and have been shown to be a potential anthropometric tool for use within health applications. Previous studies utilising 3D imaging have only assessed body shape based on combinations and relative proportions of traditional body measures, such as lengths, widths and girths. Geometric morphometrics (GM) is an established framework used for the statistical analysis of biological shape variation. These methods quantify biological shape variation after the effects of non-shape variation–location, rotation and scale–have been mathematically held constant, otherwise known as the Procrustes paradigm. The aim of this study was to determine whether shape measures, identified using geometric morphometrics, can provide additional information about the complexity of human morphology and underlying mass distribution compared to traditional body measures. Scale-invariant features of torso shape were extracted from 3D imaging data of 9,209 participants form the LIFE-Adult study. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were created to determine the extent to which variations in human torso shape are explained by existing techniques. The results of this investigation suggest that linear combinations of body measures can explain 49.92% and 47.46% of the total variation in male and female body shape features, respectively. However, there are also significant amounts of variation in human morphology which cannot be identified by current methods. These results indicate that Geometric morphometric methods can identify measures of human body shape which provide complementary information about the human body. The aim of future studies will be to investigate the utility of these measures in clinical epidemiology and the assessment of health risk."
https://openalex.org/W4220920149,"Point-of-care tests (POCTs) to diagnose sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have potential to positively impact patient management and patient perceptions of clinical services. Yet there remains a disconnect between development of new technologies and their implementation into clinical care. With the advent of new STI POCTs arriving to the global market, guidance for their successful adoption and implementation into clinical services is urgently needed. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with professionals prior to and post-implementation of a Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae POCT into clinical services in England to define key stakeholder roles and explore the process of POCT integration. Participants self-identified themselves as key stakeholders in the STI POCT adoption and/or implementation processes. Data consisted of interview transcripts, which were analysed thematically using NVIVO 11. Six sexual health services were included in the study; three of which have implemented POCTs. We conducted 40 total interviews: 31 prior to POCT implementation and 9 follow-up post-implementation. Post-implementation data showed that implementation plans required little or no change during service evaluation. Lead clinicians and managers self-identified as key stakeholders for the decision to purchase, while nurses self-identified as ""change champions"" for implementation. Many identified senior clinical staff as those most likely to introduce and drive change. However, participants stressed the importance of engaging all clinical staff in implementation. While the accuracy of the POCT, its positive impact on patient management and the ease of its integration within existing pathways were considered essential, costs of purchasing and utilising the technology were identified as central to the decision to purchase. Our study shows that key decision-makers for adoption and implementation require STI POCTs to have laboratory-comparable accuracy and be affordable for purchase and ongoing use. Further, successful integration of POCTs into sexual health services relies on supportive interpersonal relationships between all levels of staff."
https://openalex.org/W4221061473,"Under the condition of sufficient resources, there are many factors affecting the realization of extremely short construction period of engineering construction projects. Based on literature review and questionnaire survey, this paper firstly selected 17 influencing factors from the five dimensions of design, management, technology, policy and environment. And the factor analytic hierarchy process model was established based on Grey-DEMATEL-ISM. The model introduced the improved grey system theory and combined decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with interpretative structural modeling method (ISM). In addition, the model can not only identify the critical factors in the system, but also present the internal logical relationship between the influencing factors through the multi-level hierarchical structure diagram. Finally, through the analysis of the influencing factors of extremely short construction period under the sufficient resources, it defined that the key factor is the natural environment and second is the structure type. The methodology implemented in this paper helps decision makers and managers of construction projects to understand the interrelationship and degree of influence among factors affecting the duration under the condition of sufficient resources, to effectively grasp key factors, and to effectively achieve project success."
https://openalex.org/W4221092077,"With the development of the takeaway industry, the demand for disposable cutlery is increasing, posing a heavy burden on the environment. Helping reusable tableware increase market share is important because it helps preserve the natural environment while making commercial gains. Given the additional cost to consumers of using reusable tableware in many settings, this article examines the impact of incorporating environmental propaganda into packaging design on consumer behaviour. The results show that the new packaging with high environmental propaganda satisfaction improves consumers' brand loyalty, purchase intention and continuance intention. The packaging of low environmental propaganda satisfaction may have negative effects and should be used with caution."
https://openalex.org/W4221105903,"In this paper we present the first results of an interdisciplinary research project focused on Late Bronze Age metallurgy in the western and central Balkans. The comprehensive chemical and lead isotope analysis, and a strict consideration of archaeological criteria, has provided a deeper insight into supra regional metal exchange networks between the 14th and 9th century BC in this part of Europe. Particularly interesting and surprising are results regarding the provenance of raw materials for copper production, which have a chemical composition and lead isotope ratios that closely correspond to ore deposits in the southern Alps (North Italy). Based on the examination of 57 objects of different functions, chronology and distribution, it becomes apparent that copper from the southern Alps was almost an omnipresent raw material in the territories of the western and central Balkans with only a few finds from North Macedonia to indicate alternative sources. The analyses demonstrate that the reuse of fahlore-based copper is attested for the first time in the regions under study. The remarkable fact that other archaeological parameters do not indicate such an intensive connection between the Balkan area and Northern Italy raises a number of questions. The sustained and long-lasting networks of raw material procurement stand in contrast to the expected cultural interaction between metal producing and metal consuming prehistoric societies. The results of this work also highlight the currently underestimated role of the southern Alps as one of the main copper producing areas in Bronze Age Europe, and demonstrate for the first time that the region of western and central Balkans was one of the major recipients."
https://openalex.org/W4220689454,"Dwelling in a specific habitat requires adaptation to the habitat physical and biological properties in order to maximize fitness. Adaptations that are manifested in the organization of behavior in time and space reflect how the environment is perceived and utilized. Testing species from different habitats in the same laboratory environment can uncover the differences in their behavior and their adaptations to specific habitats. The question posed in this study is that of how two rodent species, one occupying flatlands (Tristram's jird; Meriones tristrami) and the other occupying structured rocky habitats (common spiny mouse; Acomys dimidiatus), differ in the way that they explore the same three-dimensional laboratory environment. Individuals of these two species were introduced into an arena with a five-level ziggurat in the center, and their behavior was followed for 60 min. We found that both species preserved the typical spatiotemporal rodents' behavior of establishing a home-base-a location that is a terminal from which they set out to explore the environment. However, the jirds, which live in flatlands, mainly travelled on the arena floor and the lower levels of the ziggurat; while, in contrast, the spiny mice, which live in rocky habitats and are used to climbing, mostly remained and travelled on the ziggurat, with some of them hardly descending to the arena floor. We suggest that the distinction in spatial behavior between the two species reflects their different motor abilities, different depth perception, and different umvelt (perceived world), in accordance with their different natural habitats."
https://openalex.org/W4220766793,"The study presents the analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y isolates collected in the Czech Republic and their comparison to other countries. The aim of the study was to determine whether there are lineages of N. meningitidis serogroup Y in the Czech Republic genetically related to foreign ones that have been causing an increase of the morbidity and the mortality of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) world-wide recently.The WGS data of 43 Czech N. meningitidis Y isolates, 35 from IMD and 8 from healthy carriers were analysed. Due to the potential of meningococcal B vaccines to induce protection against non-B serogroups, the coverage of Czech isolates of N. meningitidis Y by these vaccines was studied. The WGS data of Czech, European and non-European isolates of N. meningitidis serogroup Y were compared.WGS assigned 36 isolates of N. meningitidis Y to five clonal complexes: cc23, cc92, cc167, cc103, and cc174, while seven isolates remained unassigned to any clonal complexes (ccUA). Eighteen invasive isolates belonged to clonal complex cc23, which was detected throughout the studied years. The occurrence of cc23 was recorded in all age groups of IMD patients, with the highest found in those aged 15-19 years. On the phylogenetic network isolates of cc23 form a separate lineage, distinct from all other isolates of N. meningitidis Y. The remaining isolates were assigned to other clonal complexes and have very low relatedness to cc23 isolates and to each other. The comparison with foreign WGS data showed that within the main genetic lineages, which are defined by clonal complexes, Czech isolates of N. meningitidis Y, similar to European ones, mostly cluster together and form geographical sublineages.WGS analysis showed the population of Czech N. meningitidis Y isolates as relatively heterogeneous, containing a large number of genetic lineages. The Czech isolates of N. meningitidis Y follow the trend observed for European isolates. Our result was one of the bases for updating the recommended vaccination strategy in the Czech Republic."
https://openalex.org/W4220796228,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a commonly diagnosed disease in elderly men, but elderly men with benign prostatic hyperplasia are more likely to have a lower quality of life and depressive symptoms. This study aims to examine the association benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with suicide death relative to a control group comprising individuals without benign prostatic hyperplasia. We used the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2006 to 2015 comprising of 193,785 Korean adults ≥40 years old, and followed-up for suicide death during the 8.7 years period. Cox-proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios for suicide among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. From 2006 to 2010, a total of 32,215 people were newly diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The suicide rate of people without benign prostatic hyperplasia was 61.6 per 100,000 person-years, whereas that of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia was 97.3 per 100,000 person-years, 1.58 times higher than the control group (p<0.01). After adjusting for covariates, the hazard ratio for suicide among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia was 1.47 (95% C.I. = 1.21 to 1.78; p<0.01) compared to people without benign prostatic hyperplasia. For men without mental disorders, the hazard ratio for suicide among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia was 1.36 (95% CI = 1.05 to 1.76) compared to control group after adjusting for multiple covariates. Our study suggests that men with benign prostatic hyperplasia had a higher probability of suicide compared to men without benign prostatic hyperplasia in South Korea. This study suggests that physicians may be aware that men newly diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia had high probability of suicide."
https://openalex.org/W4220802100,"The existing literature on internal branding has often adopted a managerial-based approach and seldom considered employees’ perceptions. Therefore, there is a need to understand the perspective of frontline and non-managerial employees. In this context, the current study investigates the impact of internal brand management on brand commitment, brand citizenship behavior, and sustainable competitive advantage for the hotel industry. A survey-based quantitative data was gathered from 390 non-managerial frontline staff working in 3-, 4-, and 5-star hotels of Pakistan. The results revealed that internal brand management positively impacts brand commitment, brand citizenship behavior, and sustainable competitive advantage. Besides, brand commitment has a positive impact on brand citizenship behavior and sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, brand citizenship behavior has a positive impact on sustainable competitive advantage. In addition, the mediating roles of brand commitment and brand citizenship behavior exist between internal brand management and sustainable competitive advantage. The research implications, together with research limitations, have also been discussed."

This study validates the Arabic version of the fear of COVID-19 scale and suggests a new cutoff score to measure fear of COVID-19 among the Syrian Population. A total of 3989 participants filled an online survey consisting of socio-demographic information, the fear of COVID-19 scale, the patient health questionnaire 9-item, and the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to define cutoff scores for the fear of COVID-19 scale in relation to generalized anxiety disorder 7-item and the patient health questionnaire 9-item. The Cronbach α value of the Arabic fear of COVID-19 scale was 0.896, revealing good stability and internal consistency. The inter-item correlations were between [0.420-0.868] and the corrected item-total correlations were between [0.614-0.768]. A cutoff point of 17.5 was deduced from the analysis. According to the deduced cutoff point, 2111(52.9%) were categorized as extreme fear cases. This cutoff score deduced from this study can be used for screening purposes to distinguish community members that may be prone to developing extreme fear of COVID-19. Therefore, early preventive and supportive measures can then be delivered."
https://openalex.org/W4220977462,"Mental disorders are associated with markedly reduced life expectancy, in part due to an increased risk of death due to infection, likely reflecting sepsis-associated mortality. Patients with mental disorders are at an increased risk of sepsis, but data on the prognostic impact of mental disorders in sepsis are sparse, showing conflicting findings.We used statewide data to identify hospitalizations aged ≥18 years with sepsis in Texas during 2014-2017. Mental disorders, including mood, anxiety, psychosis, and personality disorders were identified using Clinical Classification Software codes. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression with propensity adjustment (primary model), with propensity score matching, and multivariable logistic regression as alternative models, were used to estimate the association between mental disorders and short-term mortality (defined as in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice). Additional models were fitted for sensitivity analyses and to estimate the prognostic associations of individual categories of mental disorders.Among 283,025 hospitalizations with sepsis, 56,904 (20.1%) had mental disorders. Hospitalizations with vs without mental disorders were younger (age 18-44 years 12.2% vs 10.6%), more commonly white (61.0% vs 49.8%), with lower burden of comorbidities (mean [SD] Deyo comorbidity index 2.53 [2.27] vs 2.73 [2.47]), and with lower need for organ support (mechanical ventilation 32.8% vs 36.0%); p<0.0001 for all comparisons. Crude short-term mortality among sepsis hospitalizations with and without mental disorders was 25.0% vs 32.8%, respectively. On adjusted analyses, mental disorders remained associated with lower odds of short-term mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.792 [95% CI 0.772-0.812]). This finding was consistent on the alternative modeling approaches, sensitivity analyses, and examination of individual categories of mental disorders.Mental disorders were associated, unexpectedly, with markedly lower risk of short-term mortality in sepsis. Further studies to examine the mechanisms underlying these findings may inform future efforts to improve sepsis outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4221039631,"Amel, the gene encoding the amelogenin protein involved in enamel formation, is highly alternatively spliced. When exon4 is excised, it can form a mature miRNA (miR-exon4) that has previously been suggested to indirectly regulate expression of the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) involved in bone development in ameloblasts and osteoblasts. However, the precise mechanism of this regulation is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify direct targets of miR-exon4. The transcription factor family nuclear factor I/A (NFI/A) is known to negatively regulate expression of Runx2 and is among the most highly predicted direct targets of miR-exon4 that link to Runx2. Immunostaining detected NFI/A in osteoblasts and ameloblasts in vivo, and reporter assays confirmed direct interaction of the Nfia 3'-UTR and miR-exon4. In addition, silencing of Nfia in MC3T3-E1-M14 osteoblasts resulted in subsequent downregulation of Runx2. In a monoclonal subclone (mi2) of MC3T3-E1 cells wherein mature miR-exon4 was functionally inhibited, we observed significantly downregulated Runx2 expression. We showed that NFI/A was significantly upregulated in mi2 cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics and pathway analysis of gene expression in mi2 cells suggested that miR-exon4 could directly target Prkch (protein kinase C-eta), possibly leading to RUNX2 regulation through mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase activation. Reporter assays also confirmed the direct interaction of miR-exon4 and the 3'-UTR of Prkch, and Western blot analysis confirmed significantly upregulated mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase phosphorylation in mi2 cells. Taken together, we conclude that Nfia and Prkch expression negatively correlates with miR-exon4-mediated Runx2 regulation in vivo and in vitro, suggesting miR-exon4 directly targets Nfia and Prkch to regulate Runx2."
https://openalex.org/W4221071817,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) has a C-terminal globular domain and a disordered N-terminal region encompassing five octarepeats (ORs). Encounters between Cu(II) ions and four OR sites produce interchangeable binding geometries; however, the significance of Cu(II) binding to ORs in different combinations is unclear. To understand the impact of specific binding geometries, OR variants were designed that interact with multiple or single Cu(II) ions in specific locked coordinations. Unexpectedly, we found that one mutant produced detergent-insoluble, protease-resistant species in cells in the absence of exposure to the infectious prion protein isoform, scrapie-associated prion protein (PrPSc). Formation of these assemblies, visible as puncta, was reversible and dependent upon medium formulation. Cobalamin (Cbl), a dietary cofactor containing a corrin ring that coordinates a Co3+ ion, was identified as a key medium component, and its effect was validated by reconstitution experiments. Although we failed to find evidence that Cbl interacts with Cu-binding OR regions, we instead noted interactions of Cbl with the PrPC C-terminal domain. We found that some interactions occurred at a binding site of planar tetrapyrrole compounds on the isolated globular domain, but others did not, and N-terminal sequences additionally had a marked effect on their presence and position. Our studies define a conditional effect of Cbl wherein a mutant OR region can act in cis to destabilize a globular domain with a wild type sequence. The unexpected intersection between the properties of PrPSc's disordered region, Cbl, and conformational remodeling events may have implications for understanding sporadic prion disease that does not involve exposure to PrPSc."
https://openalex.org/W4221116282,"Background and aims The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in adults younger than 50, and early screening remains challenging due to cost and under-utilization. To identify individuals aged 35–50 years who may benefit from early screening, we developed a prediction model using machine learning and electronic health record (EHR)-derived factors. Methods We enrolled 3,116 adults aged 35–50 at average-risk for CRC and underwent colonoscopy between 2017–2020 at a single center. Prediction outcomes were (1) CRC and (2) CRC or high-risk polyps. We derived our predictors from EHRs (e.g., demographics, obesity, laboratory values, medications, and zip code-derived factors). We constructed four machine learning-based models using a training set (random sample of 70% of participants): regularized discriminant analysis, random forest, neural network, and gradient boosting decision tree. In the testing set (remaining 30% of participants), we measured predictive performance by comparing C-statistics to a reference model (logistic regression). Results The study sample was 55.1% female, 32.8% non-white, and included 16 (0.05%) CRC cases and 478 (15.3%) cases of CRC or high-risk polyps. All machine learning models predicted CRC with higher discriminative ability compared to the reference model [e.g., C-statistics (95%CI); neural network: 0.75 (0.48–1.00) vs. reference: 0.43 (0.18–0.67); P = 0.07] Furthermore, all machine learning approaches, except for gradient boosting, predicted CRC or high-risk polyps significantly better than the reference model [e.g., C-statistics (95%CI); regularized discriminant analysis: 0.64 (0.59–0.69) vs. reference: 0.55 (0.50–0.59); P&lt;0.0015]. The most important predictive variables in the regularized discriminant analysis model for CRC or high-risk polyps were income per zip code, the colonoscopy indication, and body mass index quartiles. Discussion Machine learning can predict CRC risk in adults aged 35–50 using EHR with improved discrimination. Further development of our model is needed, followed by validation in a primary-care setting, before clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W4220751422,"Introduction The aim of this study was to examine the internalized stigma of mental illness in patients with schizophrenia visiting psychiatry outpatient in a tertiary level hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, and to explore the associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, where participants were selected by purposive sampling from the outpatient department of psychiatry in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. One hundred and fourteen patients were selected and given the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale to complete to assess the level of stigma. A semi-structured sociodemographic form was used to get information on sociodemographic and clinical factors. Simple descriptive analysis was done followed by multivariate analysis to explore the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of stigma in these patients. Results A total of 114 patients were included in the study. Moderate to high levels of internalized stigma was reported in almost 90% of patients with schizophrenia. The subscale with the highest mean score was stereotype endorsement and that with the lowest mean score was stigma resistance. Duration of illness was the only clinical variable associated with stigma while occupation was the only sociodemographic variable related to stigma. Conclusion Moderate to high levels of internalized stigma were reported across all subscales of stigma in patients with schizophrenia and the prevalence was high. Further, duration of illness was associated with stigma. Stigma reduction should therefore be a component of the overall management of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia."

Although the development of systemic therapies for advanced HCC has been remarkable, the role of PIVKA-II is unclear. This prospective study aimed to verify Elecsys PIVKA-II compared with Lumipulse PIVKA-II in a cohort with advanced HCC undergoing systemic therapy.A total of 62 HCC patients who were treated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab (ATZ+BEV) and molecular targeted agents (MTAs) were prospectively enrolled at Musashino Red Cross Hospital from January 2020 to December 2020. A total of 208 serum samples from 52 patients were tested using Elecsys PIVKA-II and Lumipulse PIVKA-II assays. Furthermore, the relationship of Elecsys PIVKA-II and progression-free survival (PFS) was investigated with 48 patients (24 ATZ+BEV and 24 MTAs) whose Lumipulse PIVKA-II levels were >40 mAU/mL.In the test accuracy analysis, the Elecsys assay has a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92 compared with that of the Lumipulse assay (ATZ+BEV, 0.95; MTAs, 0.91). In the PFS analysis, the number of patients who received ATZ+BEV and MTAs as first- and late-line therapy were 9 and 13, and 15 and 11, respectively. The PIVKA-II response was defined for patients who had a reduction in the Elecsys PIVKA-II level on the first month of treatment evaluation. The PFS of patients with Elecsys PIVKA-II response was significantly longer than that of nonresponse patients (5.8 months vs 3.8 months, p = 0.0205).The Elecsys PIVKA-II was not only as useful as the Lumipulse PIVKA-II but also for stratifying the PFS of patients with advanced HCC."
https://openalex.org/W4220840671,"Claudin-1 (CL-1) is responsible for the paracellular barrier function of glomerular parietal epithelial cells (PEC) in kidneys, but the role of CL-1 in proximal tubules remains to be elucidated. In this study, to evaluate CL-1 as a potential therapeutic drug target for chronic kidney disease, we investigated change of CL-1 expression in the proximal tubules of diseased kidney and elucidated the factors that induced this change. We established Alport mice as a kidney disease model and investigated the expression of CL-1 in diseased kidney using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Compared to wild type mice, Alport mice showed significant increases in plasma creatinine, urea nitrogen and urinary albumin excretion. CL-1 mRNA was increased significantly in the kidney cortex and CL-1 was localized on the adjacent cell surfaces of PECs and proximal tubular epithelial cells. The infiltration of inflammatory cells around proximal tubules and a significant increase in TNF-α mRNA were observed in diseased kidneys. To reveal factors that induce CL-1, we analyzed the induction of CL-1 by albumin or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in human proximal tubular cells (RPTEC/TERT1) using quantitative PCR and Western blotting. TNF-α increased CL-1 expression dose-dependently, though albumin did not affect CL-1 expression in RPTEC/TERT1. In addition, both CL-1 and TNF-α expression were significantly increased in UUO mice, which are commonly used as a model of tubulointerstitial inflammation without albuminuria. These results indicate that CL-1 expression is induced by inflammation, not by albuminuria in diseased proximal tubules. Moreover, we examined the localization of CL-1 in the kidney of IgA nephropathy patients by IHC and found CL-1 expression was also elevated in the proximal tubular cells. Taken together, CL-1 expression is increased in the proximal tubular epithelial cells of diseased kidney. Inflammatory cells around the tubular epithelium may produce TNF-α which in turn induces CL-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W4220936267,"The degradation of SARS-CoV-2 specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) was investigated by a numerical modeling approach based on nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results utilizing the SmartAmp technique. The precision of the measurement was verified by the relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeated measurements at each calibration point. The precision and detection limits were found to be 6% RSD (seven repeated measurements) and 94 copies/tube, respectively, at the lowest calibration point. RNA degradation curves obtained from NAAT data on four different temperatures were in good agreement with the first-order reaction model. By referring to rate constants derived from the results, the Arrhenius model was applied to predict RNA degradation behavior. If the initial RNA concentration was high enough, such as in samples taken from infected bodies, the NAAT results were expected to be positive during testing. On the other hand, if initial RNA concentrations were relatively low, such as RNA in residual viruses on environmental surfaces, special attention should be paid to avoid false-negative results. The results obtained in this study provide a practical guide for RNA sample management in the NAAT of non-human samples."
https://openalex.org/W4220952793,"Background Due to the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), most malaria-endemic countries resort to free distributions in the population with particular attention to pregnant women, a more vulnerable group. However, the mere issuance of ITNs does not usually translate to proper utilization. This study aimed to examine the utilization of ITNs and its associated factors among pregnant women in Myanmar. Methods The data analyzed in this cross-sectional study were extracted from available survey datasets of the 2015–16 Myanmar Demographic Health Survey. The secondary data were presented using a chart, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics including simple and multiple logistic regression models. All analyses were performed using STATA, Version 15. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of 466 currently pregnant women, the majority (96%) possessed bed nets for sleeping. Among them, 15.9% slept without a bed net the night before the survey, while 65.7% slept with untreated nets. Only about 1 in 5 (18.4%) slept under ITNs. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, pregnant women residing in delta and lowland regions [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.62, 16.38], plains (aOR = 7.09, 95%CI: 3.09, 16.25) or hilly areas (aOR = 4.26, 95%CI: 1.91, 9.52) were more likely to report non-utilization of ITNs than those residing in coastal regions. Conclusion Relatively poor ITN utilization was observed among pregnant women in Myanmar. Health promotion activities for ITN utilization should be implemented especially for pregnant women residing in the delta, lowland, plain and hilly regions. Other social-behavioral factors including perceived susceptibility to malaria, knowledge of ITNs, and attitude towards ITN that might favor the non-utilization of ITNs need to be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W4221011139,"Psychosomatic syndromes have emerged as an important source of comorbidity in cardiac patients and have been associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Understanding of the mechanisms underlying this connection is limited, however immune activity represents a possible pathway. While there have been numerous studies connecting immune activity to psychosomatic psychopathology, there is a lack of research on patients with HF. We examined forty-one consecutive outpatients affected by HF. We assessed psychosomatic psychopathology using the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15). The Psychosocial Index (PSI) was used for assessing stress and psychosocial dimensions. Depression was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha were ascertained. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to test for associations between inflammatory cytokines and psychosomatic psychopathology (i.e., DCPR syndromes, PHQ-15) and psychological dimensions (i.e., BDI-II, PSI). A significant positive correlation was found between IL-6 levels and psychosomatic psychopathology even when controlling for any confounding variables (i.e., Body-mass index (BMI), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, statin use, aspirin use, beta blockers use, age, and gender). In contrast, the associations between TNF-alpha levels were non-significant. These findings can contribute to research in support of a psychoneuroimmune connection between psychosomatic psychopathology and HF. Findings also suggest the possibility that elevated IL-6 levels are more relevant for the pathogenesis of psychosomatic syndromes than for depression in patients with HF."
https://openalex.org/W4221018588,"A large number of aerospace practices have confirmed that the aerospace microgravity environment can lead to cognitive function decline. Mitochondria are the most important energy metabolism organelles, and some studies demonstrate that the areospace microgravity environment can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the relationships between cognitive function decline and mitochondrial dysfunction in the microgravity environment have not been elucidated. In this study, we simulated the microgravity environment in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by -30° tail suspension for 28 days. We then investigated the changes of mitochondrial morphology and proteomics in the hippocampus. The electron microscopy results showed that the 28-day tail suspension increased the mitochondria number and size of rat hippocampal neuronal soma. Using TMT-based proteomics analysis, we identified 163 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between tail suspension and control samples, and among them, 128 proteins were upregulated and 35 proteins were downregulated. Functional and network analyses of the DEPs indicated that several of mitochondrial metabolic processes including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were altered by simulating microgravity (SM). We verified 3 upregulated proteins, aconitate hydratase (ACO2), dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST), and citrate synthase (CS), in the TCA cycle process by western blotting and confirmed their differential expressions between tail suspension and control samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 28-day tail suspension can cause changes in the morphology and metabolic function of hippocampus mitochondria, which might represent a mechanism of cognitive disorder caused by aerospace microgravity."
https://openalex.org/W4221059329,"Theoretical work in evolutionary psychology have proposed that conspiracy theories may serve a coalitional function. Specifically, fringe and offensive statements such as conspiracy theories are expected to send a highly credible signal of coalition membership by clearly distinguishing the speaker's group from other groups. A key implication of this theory is that cognitive systems designed for alliance detection should intuitively interpret the endorsement of conspiracy theories as coalitional cues. To our knowledge, no previous studies have empirically investigated this claim. Taking the domain of environmental policy as our case, we examine the hypothesis that beliefs framed in a conspiratorial manner act as more efficient coalitional markers of environmental position than similar but non-conspiratorial beliefs. To test this prediction, quota sampled American participants (total N = 2462) completed two pre-registered Who-Said-What experiments where we measured if participants spontaneously categorize targets based on their environmental position, and if this categorization process is enhanced by the use of a conspiratorial frame. We find firm evidence that participants categorize by environmental position, but no evidence that the use of conspiratorial statements increases categorization strength and thus serves a coalitional function."
https://openalex.org/W4220763798,"Complex socio-economic, political and demographic factors have driven the increased conversion of Europe’s semi-natural grasslands to intensive pastures. This trend is particularly strong in some of the most biodiverse regions of the continent, such as Central and Eastern Europe. Intensive grazing is known to decrease species diversity and alter the composition of plant and insect communities. Comparatively little is known, however, about how intensive grazing influences plant functional traits related to pollination and the structure of plant-pollinator interactions. In traditional hay meadows and intensive pastures in Central Europe, we contrasted the taxonomic and functional group diversity and composition, the structure of plant-pollinator interactions and the roles of individual species in networks. We found mostly lower taxonomic and functional diversity of plants and insects in intensive pastures, as well as strong compositional differences among the two grassland management types. Intensive pastures were dominated by a single plant with a specialized flower structure that is only accessible to a few pollinator groups. As a result, intensive pastures have lower diversity and specificity of interactions, higher amount of resource overlap, more uniform interaction strength and lower network modularity. These findings stand in contrast to studies in which plants with more generalized flower traits dominated pastures. Our results thus highlight the importance of the functional traits of dominant species in mediating the consequences of intensive pasture management on plant-pollinator networks. These findings could further contribute to strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of intensive grazing on plant and pollinator communities."

As such, to facilitate tourists and provide them with maximum experience while economizing on time and cost is essential. One approach toward achieving this is the optimization of tourism routes. However, so far the studies on this approach have focused primarily on inland tourist sites and have lacked a geographic perspective. Therefore, this study undertook the tourism resource data of Lushunkou District of 2020, used the ArcGIS accessibility evaluation model to analyze tourism resources, and finally used the Vehicle Routing Problem of network analysis technology to optimize the tourism route of Lushunkou District and obtain the general overall intellectual framework and technical methods for tourism route optimization. The results showed that the ArcGIS accessibility evaluation model could be used to integrate resources in the tourism area before using the Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the analysis of tourism routes, thereby enabling the separation of different types of tourism. These divisions were based on the Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize routes for one-day and two-day tours. A new method and model for optimization for tourism routes was constructed to provide a basis and reference for the optimization of tourism routes in similar cities. The observations and results of the present study can facilitate the government in developing the tourism industry and maximizing the benefits obtained from them. Further, travel agencies and tourists will have the provision of designing optimum tourism routes."

This study aims to investigate the influencing factors of the public’s willingness to donate to critical illness crowdfunding projects on Internet platforms. From a perspective combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, a complex and comprehensive structural equation model is proposed. We randomly selected 1,000 members of the public in China and empirically verified the study framework through structural equation modeling (SEM) based on 710 valid questionnaires. The results show that the public’s donation willingness and the social distance to a critical illness crowdfunding project on an online platform positively affect the public’s donation behavior, and donation attitude positively affect donation willingness; perceived usefulness and empathic concern positively affect the public’s donation attitude, which in turn affects its donation willingness. This study confirms that members of the public are more likely to help people who have similar demographic factors or people who are similar to themselves and have the same values, i.e., people who have a close social distance. It innovatively proposes and verifies the hypothesis that empathic concern can significantly positively affect users’ perceived usefulness and donation attitude. Strong empathic concern triggers donation willingness and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4221116275,"Francisella tularensis is the etiologic agent of tularemia and a Tier I Select Agent. Subspecies tularensis (Type A) is the most virulent of the four subspecies and inhalation of as few as 10 cells can cause severe disease in humans. Due to its niche as a facultative intracellular pathogen, a successful tularemia vaccine must induce a robust cellular immune response, which is best achieved by a live, attenuated strain. F. tularensis strains lacking lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen are highly attenuated, but do not persist in the host long enough to induce protective immunity. Increasing the persistence of an O-antigen mutant may help stimulate protective immunity. Alginate encapsulation is frequently used with probiotics to increase persistence of bacteria within the gastrointestinal system, and was used to encapsulate the highly attenuated LVS O-antigen mutant WbtIG191V. Encapsulation with alginate followed by a poly-L-lysine/alginate coating increased survival of WbtIG191V in complement-active serum. In addition, BALB/c mice immunized intraperitoneally with encapsulated WbtIG191V combined with purified LPS survived longer than mock-immunized mice following intranasal challenge. Alginate encapsulation of the bacteria also increased antibody titers compared to non-encapsulated bacteria. These data suggest that alginate encapsulation provides a slow-release vehicle for bacterial deposits, as evidenced by the increased antibody titer and increased persistence in serum compared to freely suspended cells. Survival of mice against high-dose intranasal challenge with the LVS wildtype was similar between mice immunized within alginate capsules or with LVS, possibly due to the low number of animals used, but bacterial loads in the liver and spleen were the lowest in mice immunized with WbtIG191V and LPS in beads. However, an analysis of the immune response of surviving mice indicated that those vaccinated with the alginate vehicle upregulated cell-mediated immune pathways to a lesser extent than LVS-vaccinated mice. In summary, this vehicle, as formulated, may be more effective for pathogens that require predominately antibody-mediated immunity."

In the past, model parameters were usually obtained from statistics of massive historical cumulative data, but the results were mostly historical analysis and static data, which obviously could not meet the needs of pilots who wish to master the ship domain in real time. To obtain and update the ship domain parameter online in time and meet the real-time needs of maritime applications, this paper obtains CRI as the weight coefficient-based PSO-LSSVM method and proposes to use short-term AIS data accumulation through the risk-weighted least squares method online rolling identification method, which can filter nonhazardous targets and improve the identification accuracy and real-time performance of nonlinear models in the ship domain. The experimental examples show that the method can generate the ship domain dynamically in real time. At the same time, the method can be used to study the dynamic evolution characteristics of the ship domain over the course of navigation, which provides a reference for navigation safety decisions and the analysis of ship navigation behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4220727150,"In frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, 1-bit compressed sensing (CS)-based superimposed channel state information (CSI) feedback has shown many advantages, while still faces many challenges, such as low accuracy of the downlink CSI recovery and large processing delays. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL) scheme to improve the 1-bit compressed sensing-based superimposed CSI feedback. On the user side, the downlink CSI is compressed with the 1-bit CS technique, superimposed on the uplink user data sequences (UL-US), and then sent back to the base station (BS). At the BS, based on the model-driven approach and assisted by the superimposition-interference cancellation technology, a multi-task detection network is first constructed for detecting both the UL-US and downlink CSI. In particular, this detection network is jointly trained to detect the UL-US and downlink CSI simultaneously, capturing a globally optimized network parameter. Then, with the recovered bits for the downlink CSI, a lightweight reconstruction scheme, which consists of an initial feature extraction of the downlink CSI with the simplified traditional method and a single hidden layer network, is utilized to reconstruct the downlink CSI with low processing delay. Compared with the 1-bit CS-based superimposed CSI feedback scheme, the proposed scheme improves the recovery accuracy of the UL-US and downlink CSI with lower processing delay and possesses robustness against parameter variations."
https://openalex.org/W4220739468,"Sarcopenia is a progressive age-related skeletal muscle disorder characterized by decreased muscle mass and loss of muscle function. Recent studies have shown that sarcopenia is able to predict a variety of clinical outcomes after spinal surgery. Controversy still exists among previous reports in terms of the definition and measurement of sarcopenia, these findings are heterogeneous so far. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the up-to-date evidence of sarcopenia for postoperative outcomes among people undergoing spinal surgery.This protocol was carried out based on the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. It has been pre-registered in PROSPERO with the registration number of CRD42021260459. Three databases (including Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) will be searched from inception through May 10, 2021 to determine related cohort studies examining sarcopenia on multidimensional outcomes in patients undergoing spinal surgery. Major outcomes will be involved including mortality, morbidity, length of stay, postoperative complications or adverse events. DerSimonian & Laird random-effects meta-analysis will be used to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) for binary data and pooled weighted mean differences (WMDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Narrative synthesis will be carried out if a pooled analysis is not possible.Ethical approval is not required for this study as the data involved are from the published literatures. We intend to disseminate or share the results of the study in a peer-reviewed journal or at relevant conferences.CRD42021260459."
https://openalex.org/W4220872491,"The authors sought to compare simultaneous and sequential tympanoplasty and adenoidectomy surgery in pediatric patients.This retrospective single-center study included 65 children (36 males, 29 females; mean age 9.16 ± 3.82 years; range 3-17 years) requiring both tympanoplasty and adenoidectomy. Simultaneous surgeries were performed on the same day, during single general anesthesia, whereas sequential surgeries were separated at least 12 weeks. The groups were compared with regard to restoration of hearing, tympanic membrane status, and utilization of medical resources. All study participants had a 12-months follow-up period after surgery.No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups regarding pre- and post-operative ABG values and average hearing gains. However, the post-operative ABG was significantly lower than the pre-operative ABG in both groups (p<0.001). There were no significant differences between simultaneous and sequential groups with respect to complete healing rates and complications (all p>0.355). Simultaneous tympanoplasty and adenoidectomy surgery management is associated with a significantly decreased cumulative hospital stay, cumulative operating room time, and cumulative pure surgical time (all p≤0.016).The results of first comparative study of simultaneous versus sequential tympanoplasty and adenoidectomy surgery managements demonstrate no advantages for the sequential approach. The same-day surgery can show the clinical outcomes comparable to those in the sequential group. The simultaneous surgery approach appears to be associated with reduced medical resources consumption. Therefore, simultaneous surgery management is an effective and safe option for children with chronic otitis media and adenoid hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4220890738,"The photoreactivity of anthracene has been previously verified for a range of its derivatives. 9,10-Dibutoxyanthracene is commonly used as an electron transfer sensitizer for photopolymerization because of its favorable optical properties. This study experimentally demonstrated that 9,10-dibutoxyanthracene produces an endoperoxide species upon reaction with the oxygen present in air. A secondary decomposition product formed during the photodecomposition of the endoperoxide species was also isolated and identified. The proposed reaction pathway is supported by singlet oxygen scavenger studies and calculations of the singlet–triplet transition energies. Our findings suggest that 9,10-dibutoxyanthracene can be used as a photo-induced oxygen scavenger."
https://openalex.org/W4220924814,"Background As foot constitutes the base of support for the whole body, the pregnancy-related anthropometric changes can result in adaptive plantar pressure alterations. The present study aimed to investigate how pregnancy affects foot loading pattern in gait, and if it is related to body adjustments to growing foetus that occur in the course of pregnancy. Methods A prospective longitudinal study included 30 women. Three experimental sessions in accordance with the same procedure were carried out in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy. First, the anthropometric measures of the body mass and waist circumference were taken. Then walking trials at a self-selected speed along a ~6-m walkway were registered with the FreeMED force platform (Sensor Medica, Italy). Vertical foot pressure was recorded by the force plate located in the middle of the walkway. Findings The correlation of individual foot loading parameters across different trimesters was relatively high. Nevertheless, our results revealed a longitudinal foot arch flattening with the strongest effect in late pregnancy ( P = 0.01). The anthropometric characteristics also influenced the foot loading pattern depending on the phase of pregnancy. In particular, arch flattening correlated with the body mass in all trimesters (r≥0.44, P ≤0.006) while the medial-lateral loading index correlated only in the first (r = 0.45, P = 0.005) and second (r = 0.36, P = 0.03) trimesters. Waist circumference changes significantly influenced dynamic arch flattening but only in the late pregnancy (r≥0.46, P ≤0.004). In the third trimester, a small though significant increase in the right foot angle was observed ( P = 0.01). Interpretation The findings provided the characteristics of the relative foot areas loading throughout pregnancy. Growing abdominal size increases the risk of medial arch flattening, which can result in less stable gait. The observed increase in foot angle in late pregnancy may constitute a strategy to enhance gait stability."
