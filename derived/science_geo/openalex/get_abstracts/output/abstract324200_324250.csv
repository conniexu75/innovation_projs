https://openalex.org/W2013159231,"The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is a natural feature of the earth's environment. It performs several important functions, including shielding the earth from damaging solar ultraviolet radiation. Far from being static, ozone concentrations rise and fall under the forces of photochemical production, catalytic chemical destruction, and fluid dynamical transport. Human activities are projected to deplete substantially stratospheric ozone through anthropogenic increases in the global concentrations of key atmospheric chemicals. Human-induced perturbations may be occurring already."
https://openalex.org/W2012468705,"Both interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and meteorites may contain material that is similar to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The Raman spectra of IDPs and meteorites show features that are similar in position and relative strength to interstellar infrared emission features that have been attributed to vibrational transitions in free, molecular-sized PAHs. The Raman spectra of some IDPs also show red photoluminescence that is similar to the excess red emission seen in some astronomical objects and that has also been attributed to PAHs and hydrogenated amorphous carbon. Moreover, a part of the carbonaceous phase in IDPs and meteorites contains deuterium to hydrogen ratios that are greater than those for terrestrial samples. Deuterium enrichment is expected in small free PAHs that are exposed to ultraviolet radiation in the interstellar medium. Taken together, these observations suggest that some of the carbonaceous material in IDPs and meteorites may have been produced in circumstellar dust shells and only slightly modified in interstellar space."
https://openalex.org/W2030162762,"Crystals of a high-pressure form of benzene (benzene 11) were grown in the diamond-anvil pressure cell at elevated temperature and pressure from the transition of solid I to solid II. X-ray precession data were obtained from a single-crystal in the high-pressure cell. At 21 degrees C and about 25 kilobars, benzene II crystallizes in the monoclinic system with a = 5.417 +/- 0.005 angstroms (S.D.), b = 5.376 +/- 0.019 angstroms, c = 7.532 +/- 0.007 angstroms, beta = 110.00 degrees +/- 0.08 degrees , space group P2(1)/ c, Pc= 1.26 grams per cubic centimeter. The crystal structure was solved by generating all possible molecular packing configurations and calculating structure factors, reliability factors, and packing energies for each configuration. This procedure produced a unique solution for the molecular packing of benzene II."

Nor are many of the improvements in technologically complex new products. Econometric studies underestimate, therefore, the full contribution of R&D, especially since it is difficult to trace its spillover effects. Nevertheless, a recent study finds a significant contribution of R&D to productivity growth in the largest U.S. manufacturing corporations, with no evidence of a major decline in it, and a larger role for basic research and a smaller one for federally financed R&D expenditures than is implied by their relative importance in total R&D expenditures."
https://openalex.org/W2148010552,"Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae are significant in the physiology and ecology of extant vascular plants, and they may also have played a major role in the origin of the vascular land flora. The case for fossil vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae rests upon hyphae and chlamydospore-like bodies in several Paleozoic taxa, but fossil arbuscles are unknown to date. Specimens from the Triassic of Antarctica represent the first known occurrence of arbuscles in the fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W2035226594,The Nimbus III satellite carries the satellite infrared spectrometer (SIRS). It measures the radiance of the earth and the atmosphere in seven narrow spectral intervals in the 15-micrometer carbon dioxide band and in one interval of minimum absorption at 11.1 micrometers. Seven simultaneous equations are solved to obtain the vertical temperature profile; the eighth measurement is used to determine the boundary condition (cloud or surface temperature). Results agree with those obtained from conventional radiosondes.
https://openalex.org/W2078622132,"Deep-water sampling of the Orinoco River main channel resulted in the collection of an unexpectedly high abundance and diversity of specialized fishes. Twenty-eight of the more than 60 species collected belong to the Gymnotiformes(New World electric or knife fishes). One of the more numerous of these, a recently described species of the genus Rhabdolichops, consumes large numbers of very small planktonic Crustacea and insect larvae. These items are captured in the very swift, turbid, and deep waters of the Orinoco. Although the strong dependence of the river food web on terrestrial and floodplain food sources is well known, the specialized capabilities of Rhabdolichops and of other fishes that occur with it indicate a significant extension of the river food web into the main channel."
https://openalex.org/W2034901772,The ant Iridomyrmex pruinosus utilizes 2-heptanone as an alarm pheromone. The activities of 49 ketones and 35 nonketones as alarm pheromones for this species were determined. The molecular shapes of these compounds were assessed by submitting silhouette photographs of their molecular models to a pattern recognition machine. A highly significant correlation exists between molecular shape and alarm activity.
https://openalex.org/W2095474579,"A Michelson interferometer spectrometer carried aboard the Nimbus 3 satellite, launched 14 April 1969, measured the spectrum between 400 and 2000 wave numbers with a resolution of 5 wave numbers. High-quality spectra have been obtained on a global scale, and preliminary results indicate that the absorption bands of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone can be used to obtain vertical distributions of temperature, water vapor, and ozone."
https://openalex.org/W2072052807,Underground nuclear explosions trigger significant earthquake activity for at least 32 hours afterward and to distances up to at least 860 kilometers. The proposed Amchitka test may be used to study the feasibility of employing high-yield underground nuclear explosions to release stresses accumulating in the lithosphere. Periodical explosions along active fault zones may be used to prevent disastrous earthquakes.

Marx on ""Human trials of new cancer therapy begin"" (Research News, 15 May, p. 778) should have noted that the Sloan-Kettering group collaborated with Ronald Breslow of Columbia University on the discovery that the drug hexamethylene bisacetamide induces the differentiation of mouse leukemia cells, and that it is Breslow who is currently trying to redesign the drug to decrease its side effects in human patients without diminishing its effectiveness."
