There is evidence that CRP may also play a direct role in atherogenesis. Here we determined whether the proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-17 stimulates CRP expression in hepatocytes (Hep3B cell line and primary hepatocytes) and coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC). Our results demonstrate that IL-17 potently induces CRP expression in Hep3B cells independent of IL-1β and IL-6. IL-17 induced CRP promoter-driven reporter gene activity that could be attenuated by dominant negative IκBα or C/EBPβ knockdown and stimulated both NF-κB and C/EBP DNA binding and reporter gene activities. Targeting NF-κB and C/EBPβ activation by pharmacological inhibitors, small interfering RNA interference and adenoviral transduction of dominant negative expression vectors blocked IL-17-mediated CRP induction. Overexpression of wild type p50, p65, and C/EBPβ stimulated CRP transcription. IL-17 stimulated p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 activation, and SB203580 and PD98059 blunted IL-17-mediated NF-κB and C/EBP activation and CRP transcription. These results, confirmed in primary human hepatocytes and CASMC, demonstrate for the first time that IL-17 is a potent inducer of CRP expression via p38 MAPK and ERK1/2-dependent NF-κB and C/EBPβ activation and suggest that IL-17 may mediate chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis.

CRP can be detected in human atherosclerotic plaques co-localized with modified low density lipoprotein (13Torzewski J. Torzewski M. Bowyer D.E. Frohlich M. Koenig W. Waltenberger J. Fitzsimmons C.

It can also associate with the terminal complex of complement in the arterial wall, inducing its activation in plaques. CRP promotes the uptake of low density lipoprotein by macrophages (15Zwaka T.P. Hombach V. Torzewski J. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) and exerts a mitogenic effect on vascular smooth muscle cells (16Hattori Y. Matsumura M. Kasai K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). CRP stimulates chemokine and adhesion molecule expression in vascular endothelial cells and enhances platelet adhesion to endothelial cells (17Pasceri V. Willerson J.T. Yeh E.T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2165-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). These data suggest that CRP is not just a marker of cardiovascular risk but is a risk factor in its own right, and CRP plays a causal role in atherosclerosis and thrombosis. In fact, transgenic overexpression of human CRP has been shown to promote atherosclerosis in apoE-/- mice (18Paul A. Ko K.W. Li L. Yechoor V. McCrory M.A. Szalai A.J. Chan L. Circulation. 2004; 109: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), as does chronic administration (19Griselli M. Herbert J. Hutchinson W.L. Taylor K.M. Sohail M. Krausz T. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1733-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These data support an hypothesis that CRP is a proinflammatory and pro-atherogenic factor. Inflammation is an important component in all stages of atherosclerosis, with proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines playing critical roles. IL-17 is a member of a novel group of proinflammatory cytokines that is composed of six major isoforms, IL-17A, -B, -C, -D, -E (also known as IL-25), and -F (20Moseley T.A. Haudenschild D.R. Rose L. Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). These isoforms are encoded by unique genes and share little homology with other interleukins. IL-17 signals via IL-17 receptors, products of unique genes, and includes IL-17RA, -B (also known as IL-25R), -C, -D, and -E (20Moseley T.A. Haudenschild D.R. Rose L. Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). IL-17A is the most widely studied cytokine of the IL-17 family. It signals via IL-17RA and exerts proinflammatory, pro-apoptotic, and pro-mitogenic effects. Unlike IL-17, which is considered a T-cell-specific cytokine (21Yao Z. Painter S.L. Fanslow W.C. Ulrich D. Macduff B.M. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5483-5486PubMed Google Scholar), many cell types in the body express the receptors and are therefore targets of IL-17 (22Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated whether IL-17 stimulates CRP expression in human hepatocytes and CASMC, and we determined the signal transduction pathways involved in IL-17-mediated CRP induction. Our data show for the first time that IL-17 stimulates CRP expression in hepatocytes and coronary artery smooth muscle cells, independently of IL-1β and IL-6, and mediates CRP induction via p38 MAPK and ERK1/2-dependent NF-κB and C/EBPβ activation. These results suggest that IL-17-CRP signaling may play a role in chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis. Materials—Recombinant human (rh) IL-1ra (280-RA/CF), IL-6 (206-IL-010), rhIL-17 (317-IL-050), IL-17R-Fc chimera (177-IR), Fc (110-HG), anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies (AB-206-NA), IL-6 ELISA kit (D6050), and normal goat IgG (AB-108-C) were purchased from R&D Systems. rhIL-1β (200-01B) was purchased from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Functional grade purified anti-human IL-17 antibodies (16-7178) and normal mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against C/EBPα (sc-61X), C/EBPβ (sc-150X), TRAF2 (sc-877), TRAF6 (sc-7221), and actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p38, phospho-p38 (PhosphoPlus® p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) antibody kit), ERK1/2 (9102), phospho-ERK1/2 (9101S), and anti-phospho-C/EBPβ (3084S) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). SN-50 (cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of NF-κB, 50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), SN-50M (SN-50 mutant, 50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), MG-132 (a proteasomal inhibitor, 5 μm in Me2SO for 1 h), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor, 1 μm in Me2SO for 30 min), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor, 10 μm in Me2SO for 1 h), and genistein (induces ER stress and mitochondrial insult, 100 μm in Me2SO for 48 h) and Me2SO were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma Hep3B cells (HB-8064; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum at 10% (complete media). At ∼70% confluency, the complete medium was replaced with media containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After overnight incubation to achieve quiescence, rhIL-17 was added and cultured for the indicated time periods. Culture supernatants were then collected and snap-frozen. Cells were harvested, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Primary human hepatocytes (PHH; CellzDirect, Inc., Austin, TX) were treated as described for Hep3B cells. Normal human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) were described previously (23Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Mahimainathan L. Patel D.N. Bailey S.R. Imam S.Z. Greene W.C. Valente A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15099-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and were treated as described for Hep3B cells. Because IL-17 stimulates IL-6 expression (24Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2559-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and IL-6 is a potent inducer of CRP (25Ganapathi M.K. Rzewnicki D. Samols D. Jiang S.L. Kushner I. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1261-1265PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether IL-17-stimulates IL-6 expression in hepatocytes and whether IL-17-mediated CRP expression is dependent on IL-6. Therefore, hepatocytes were treated with IL-17, IL-6 (10 ng/ml), or IL-17 + IL-6. IL-6 expression was targeted by siRNA (sense, 5′-CUCACCUCUUCAGAACGAATT-3′, 100 nm (26Labbozzetta M. Notarbartolo M. Poma P. Giannitrapani L. Cervello M. Montalto G. D'Alessandro N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1089: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) or anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies (10 μg/ml for 1 h) prior to IL-17 addition. Normal goat/mouse IgG served as a control. Knockdown of IL-6 was confirmed by RT-qPCR (IL-6 qPCR was performed using a Cytoxpress kit, BIOSOURCE). IL-17 is also known to induce IL-1β expression (27Jovanovic D.V. Di Battista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J. Jolicoeur F.C. He Y. Zhang M. Mineau F. Pelletier J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3513-3521PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been reported previously that IL-1β fails to stimulate CRP expression in Hep3B cells but potentiates IL-6-mediated CRP expression (25Ganapathi M.K. Rzewnicki D. Samols D. Jiang S.L. Kushner I. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1261-1265PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether IL-1ra blocks IL-1β, IL-6, IL-1β+IL-6, or IL-17-mediated CRP secretion. Quiescent Hep3B cells were treated with IL-1ra simultaneously with IL-1β (10 ng/ml), IL-6 (10 ng/ml), IL-1β+IL-6 (10 ng each/ml), or IL-17 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Hep3B cells were not pretreated with IL-1ra, and at these concentrations these cytokines did not affect cell viability (data not shown). CRP levels in culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA. Adenoviral Vectors, Propagation, and Infection—Recombinant, replication-deficient adenoviral vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-CMV-GFP), dominant negative (dn) IKKβ, and dnIκB-α (S32A/S36A) have been described (28Patel D.N. Bailey S.R. Gresham J.K. Schuchman D.B. Shelhamer J.H. Goldstein B.J. Foxwell B.M. Stemerman M.B. Maranchie J.K. Valente A.J. Mummidi S. Chandrasekar B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were infected at 100 m.o.i. as described previously (28Patel D.N. Bailey S.R. Gresham J.K. Schuchman D.B. Shelhamer J.H. Goldstein B.J. Foxwell B.M. Stemerman M.B. Maranchie J.K. Valente A.J. Mummidi S. Chandrasekar B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transient Cell Transfections and Reporter Assays—A DNA fragment containing human CRP promoter (-300/19) was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA (Promega) using the primers sense, 5′-aga tct AGAGCTACCTCCTCCTGCCTGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-acgcgtACCCAGATGGCCACTCGTTTAATATGTTACC-3′, cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and subcloned into the MluI/BglII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (29Voleti B. Agrawal A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3386-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutation of the NF-κB-binding site was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The κB site was mutated by converting -72AAAATT-67 to -72TTAATA-67 using the primers 5′-GCGCCACTATGTAAATTATTAACCAACATTGCTTGTTGGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCCCAACAAGCAATGTTGGTTAATAATTTACATAGTGGCGC-3′. Mutation of the C/EBP site was performed using the primers 5′-GGAAAATTATTTACATAGTGTAGCTTACTCCCTTACTGCTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAAGCAGTAAGGGAGTAAGCTACACTATGTAAATAATTTTCC-3′. All constructs were verified by restriction mapping and bidirectional sequencing. Cell Transfection and Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with 3 μg of the CRP reporter constructs and 100 ng of the control Renilla luciferase vector pRL-TK (Promega) using Lipofectamine®. Luciferase activity was determined using the Promega Biotech™ dual-luciferase reporter assay system (23Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Mahimainathan L. Patel D.N. Bailey S.R. Imam S.Z. Greene W.C. Valente A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15099-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase data were normalized with the corresponding Renilla luciferase and expressed as mean relative stimulation ±S.E. for a representative experiment from three to six separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Transfection efficiency of hepatocytes was determined using pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and was found to be 34.3%. To investigate pathways involved in IL-17-mediated CRP expression, hepatocytes were transiently transfected with wild type or dominant negative expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Wild type (CMV-C/EBPβ) and dnC/EBP-β (CMV-dnC/EBP-β) were generous gifts from Richard M. Pope (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago). dnTRAF6 (pRK5-TRAF6-(289–522)-FLAG), dnTRAF2 (pRK5-TRAF2-(87–501)-FLAG), kdNIK (pRK7-NIK(K429A/K430A)-FLAG) were described previously (30Chandrasekar B.

To compensate for variations in transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with pRL-Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-TK vector; Promega, Madison, WI). C/EBPβ expression was also targeted by C/EBPβ siRNA duplex (sense, 5′-GAAGACCGUGGACAAGCACdTT-3′; 100 nm). TRAF2 expression was targeted by two siRNA duplexes (sense, 5′-AUACGAGAGCUGCCACGAAdTdT-3′, and sense, 5′-AGAGGCCAGUCAACGACAUdTdT-3′; 50 nm each) and TRAF6 by a siRNA duplex (5′-CUGUGCUGCAUCAAUGGCAdTdT-3′) as described previously (32Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As negative control, siRNA that does not target any genes in the human genome (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′; catalog number 1022076, Qiagen Inc.; 100 nm) was used. Gel Shift, Supershift, ELISA, and Reporter Assays—NF-κB and C/EBP DNA binding activities were assessed by EMSA. Double-stranded consensus wild type (NF-κB, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′; C/EBP, 5′-TGC AGA TTG CGC AAT CTG CA-3′) and mutant (NF-κB, 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′; C/EBP, 5′-TGC AGA GAC TAG TCT CTG CA-3′) oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used as before (23Chandrasekar B.

Activation and subunit composition were determined by supershift (C/EBP) and TransAM™ NF-κB (catalog number 43296) and C/EBP α/β (catalog number 44196) transcription factor ELISA (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Activation of NF-κB and C/EBP was also confirmed by reporter gene assays. Adenoviral NF-κB-luciferase vector (Ad.NFκB-Luc) was generously provided by John F.

CRP mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. DNA-free total RNA was extracted using RNAqueous®-4PCR kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). All RNA samples used for quantitative PCR had RNA integrity numbers greater than 9.1 (scale = 1–10), as assigned by default parameters of the Expert 2100 Bioanalyzer software package (version 2.02). Real time quantitative PCR was performed as described previously by Ivashchenko et al. (34Ivashchenko Y. Kramer F. Schafer S. Bucher A. Veit K. Hombach V. Busch A. Ritzeler O. Dedio J. Torzewski J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using Quanti-Tect SYBR-Green Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Each sample was assayed in triplicate. For relative quantification, the Ct method (ratio = 2 - (Ct(CRP) - Ct(GAPDH))) was used with GAPDH as a control. For copy number determination, a calibration curve was obtained using serial dilutions of linearized GAPDH cDNA as template and the GAPDH primers 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′: human CRP primer pair 1 (product size 133 bp), forward, 5′-ACTTCCTATGTATCCCTCAAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTCATTGTCTTGTCTCTTGGT-3′; human CRP primer pair 2 (product size 440 bp), forward, 5′-TCGTATGCCACCAAGAGAAGACA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AACACTTCGCCTTGCACTTCATACT-3′. Primer pair 3 distinguishes between mRNA and genomic DNA (expected product size 196 bp for mRNA and 481 bp for genomic DNA): forward, 5′-TCTCATGCTTTTGGCCAGAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTCATTGTCTTGTCTCTTGGT-3′. ELISA—CRP levels in culture supernatants were quantified by an ELISA (IMUCLONE® High Sensitivity CRP ELISA test kit, product ID 660; American Diagnostica, Inc., Stamford, CT).

IL-17 Stimulates CRP Expression in Hep3B Cells—IL-17 functions as a proinflammatory cytokine in various models of inflammation (20Moseley T.A. Haudenschild D.R. Rose L. Reddi A.H.

Quiescent Hep3B cells were treated with rhIL-17 for 24 h, and CRP mRNA expression was quantified by RT-qPCR. IL-17 stimulated CRP mRNA expression dose-dependently with significant stimulation in CRP expression detectable at 10 ng/ml and peak levels at 100 ng/ml. Time course studies revealed that IL-17 at 100 ng/ml increased CRP expression at 24 h, with no further increases detected at 48 h (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in all subsequent experiments IL-17 was used at 100 ng/ml. IL-17 at this dose stimulated CRP secretion (6-fold, p < 0.001; Fig. 1C), and treatment with anti-IL-17 neutralizing antibodies or IL-17Fc-chimera blocked this expression (Fig. 1D). Although IL-17 is known to induce pro-apoptotic gene expression (24Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol.

However, genistein, a known inducer of ER stress and mitochondrial insult in hepatocytes (36Yeh T.C. Chiang P.C. Li T.K. Hsu J.L. Lin C.J. Wang S.W. Peng C.Y. Guh J.H. Biochem.

These results indicate that IL-17 is a potent inducer of CRP expression in Hep3B cells (Fig. 1). IL-17-mediated CRP Expression Is Independent of IL-1β and IL-6 in Hep3B Cells—IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine whose expression is increased in both subclinical and overt inflammation and potently induces CRP expression (25Ganapathi M.K. Rzewnicki D. Samols D. Jiang S.L. Kushner I. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1261-1265PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-17 is known to stimulate IL-6 expression (24Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H.

IL-17 stimulated IL-6 mRNA expression and protein secretion (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, IL-6 stimulated CRP expression (Fig. 2C), and this was enhanced when combined with IL-17 (Fig. 2D). However, siRNA-mediated IL-6 knockdown or pretreatment with anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies failed to block IL-17-mediated CRP expression (Fig. 2E). Knockdown of IL-6 was confirmed by ELISA (Fig. 2F). IL-17 is also known to induce IL-1β expression (27Jovanovic D.V. Di Battista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J. Jolicoeur F.C. He Y. Zhang M. Mineau F.

https://openalex.org/W1991253015,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to the development of several human cancers including the endemic form of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). In culture, EBV induces the continuous proliferation of primary B cells as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and if EBV-negative BL-derived cells are infected with EBV, latency-associated viral factors confer resistance to various inducers of apoptosis. Nuclear proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3C (but not EBNA3B) are necessary to establish LCLs and their expression may be involved in the resistance of BL cells to cytotoxic agents. We have therefore created recombinant EBVs from which each of the EBNA3 genes has been independently deleted, and revertant viruses in which the genes have been re-introduced into the viral genome. Infection of EBV-negative BL cells with this panel of EBVs and challenge with various cytotoxic drugs showed that EBNA3A and EBNA3C cooperate as the main determinants of both drug resistance and the downregulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2-family member Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). The regulation of Bim is predominantly at the level of RNA, with little evidence of post-translational Bim stabilization by EBV. In the absence of Bim, EBNA3A and EBNA3C appear to provide no survival advantage. The level of Bim is a critical regulator of B cell survival and reduced expression is a major determinant of lymphoproliferative disease in mice and humans; moreover, Bim is uniquely important in the pathogenesis of BL. By targeting this tumour-suppressor for repression, EBV significantly increases the likelihood of B lymphomagenesis in general, and BL in particular. Our results may also explain the selection pressure that gives rise to a subset of BL that retain expression of the EBNA3 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1976004857,"We recently demonstrated that yeast actively import lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PtdEtn) through the action of plasma membrane P-type ATPases and rapidly acylate it to form PtdEtn.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a valuable model system for understanding the structural and regulatory aspects of eukaryotic membrane biogenesis. As a consequence, our knowledge of the central pathways of glycerolipid synthesis, transport, and degradation in this organism is quite extensive. However, gaps still remain in the identification of genes encoding proteins that execute key enzymatic steps in yeast lipid metabolism. The lysophospholipid acyltransferases are an example of one such set of enzymes. In eukaryotic systems these activities are critical for remodeling of membrane lipids for specific purposes, such as the synthesis of dipalmitoyl-PtdCho 2The abbreviations used are: PtdChophosphatidyl (Ptd) cholineELMexogenous lysolipid metabolism pathwayEtnethanolaminelyso-PtdEtn1-acyl-2-hydroxyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-EtnLPEATlyso-PtdEtn acyltransferaseMBOATmembrane-bound O-acyltransferaseP-Etnphosphoryl-EtnPtdInsphosphatidylinositolPtdSerphosphatidylserineERendoplasmic reticulumMAMmitochondria-associated ER membraneORFopen reading frameLPAATlyso-PtdOH acyltransferase. for lung surfactant (1Chen X.

A specific lyso-PtdEtn acyltransferase (LPEAT) protein has not been identified at the molecular level from any organism. However, recent work from our laboratory has revealed a role for LPEAT as part of a new pathway for PtdEtn biosynthesis, which we henceforth refer to as the exogenous lysolipid metabolism (ELM) pathway (8Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this pathway lyso-PtdEtn is imported by P-type ATPases at the plasma membrane followed by trafficking of this lipid to the site(s) of LPEAT action. The PtdEtn, thus, formed is capable of fully supplying both the structural requirements of the mitochondria for respiratory growth and the structural and biosynthetic requirements of the endoplasmic reticulum for PtdCho synthesis. Furthermore, the flux through the ELM pathway and quantities of PtdEtn and PtdCho thus produced are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of rapidly dividing cells for membrane biogenesis, even in the absence of all other PtdEtn synthesis pathways. In this report we have focused upon 1) identifying the gene encoding the major LPEAT in yeast, 2) characterizing the biochemical properties of the enzyme, 3) determining the subcellular localization of the enzyme, and 4) elucidating the conditions under which the LPEAT activity is essential for growth. We now present data showing that an uncharacterized yeast gene, YOR175C, which we name ALE1, encodes the major LPEAT activity in yeast. Deletion of this gene abolished essentially all LPEAT activity in cell extracts. Ale1p enzymatic activity is enriched in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), and the kinetic properties of this enzyme led to the preferential placement of an unsaturated fatty acid at the sn-2 position of lyso-PtdEtn. The LPEAT activity of Ale1p is also required for efficient Kennedy pathway-independent utilization of lyso-PtdEtn. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals, solvents, and amino acids for media were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Yeast extract, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were from Difco. Silica-60 TLC plates were from EM Sciences. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), except acyl-CoA substrates, which were from Sigma. Lyso-Ptd-Etn (Avanti) was purchased as a 20 mg/ml chloroform solution, and this solvent was removed under vacuum followed by repeated addition and evaporation of methanol to eliminate traces of chloroform. The dried lyso-PtdEtn was dissolved in 10% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40, filter-sterilized, and stored at -20 °C until use. Synthesis of radiolabeled lyso-PtdEtn was as previously described (8Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Yeast Culture and Genetic Manipulations—Yeast strains and their associated genotypes are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Yeast strains with deletions of specific open reading frames (ORFs) were constructed by standard methods involving one-step gene replacement (9Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Gene replacements were carried out by transformation of PCR fragments containing an appropriate marker gene (as indicated in Table 1) flanked by at least 40 base pairs of DNA identical to the 5′ and 3′ regions outside the start and stop codons of the ORF of interest. The eviction of target genes from the resultant drug-resistant or prototrophic colonies was confirmed by PCR amplification of the 5′ and 3′ recombination junctions using appropriate combinations of marker gene and target gene-specific primers. Strains were routinely maintained on standard 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone (YP) medium containing either 2% lactate (YPL) or 2% glucose (YPD) as a carbon source with the addition of 40 mg/liter adenine, 40 mg/liter uracil, and 2 mm Etn (YPDAUE or YPLAUE media). For media containing lyso-PtdEtn, 1% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40 was included, and lyso-PtdEtn was added to the desired concentration from a sterile 25 mm stock solution in 10% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40. In some experiments defined media were used consisting of yeast nitrogen base (Difco) at 6.7 g/liter, complete amino acid mix, and either glucose to give SCG media or lactate to give SCL. In the lysolipid uptake experiments, 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 was included, and this medium is denoted SCGT. For determination of growth requirements, 5-fold serial dilutions of yeast cultures were spotted onto plates as described previously (8Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Culture of these mutant strains, preparation of homogenates, and LPEAT assays were conducted as previously described (8Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Labeling of Wild-type and ale1Δ Mutant Cells with Radioactive Lyso-PtdEtn—We carried out lyso-PtdEtn supplementation studies with strains PTY44 (ALE1) and JWY89 (ale1Δ). The strains were initially grown overnight in 5 ml of YPDAUE, and a 2-ml aliquot of culture was diluted into 50 ml of fresh YPDAUE medium. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.5, the cultures were centrifuged, and the cells were washed twice with SCGT media and suspended in 10 ml of SCGT (final A600 = 2.5). 2 ml of this cell preparation was incubated with 100,000 cpm of 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxyl-3-sn-glycerophospho-[U-14C]Etn (diluted with unlabeled compound to 250 μm) for 2 h. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice in SCGT and once in water. An aliquot of the washed cells was taken for liquid scintillation spectrometry before lipid extraction to determine the total amount of radioactivity taken up by the cells. Another aliquot of the cells was subjected to lipid extraction by the addition of 200 μl of water and 300 μl of ethanol in a sealed tube, incubation in a boiling water bath for 45 min, and followed by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and 1.6 ml of water. The tubes were vigorously mixed and centrifuged to separate the phases, and the upper aqueous phase was removed to a separate tube and lyophilized. This material was dissolved in 0.2 ml of water, and the radioactivity of an aliquot of the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The remainder of this aqueous fraction was resolved by TLC on Silica 60 plates (EM Sciences) in the solvent 0.5% (w/v) aqueous NaCl, ethanol, n-butanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (10:5:5:1, v/v/v/v). Excess unlabeled Etn, phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn), CDP-Etn, and sn-glycero-3-P-Etn were added as carrier to facilitate the identification of radiolabeled compounds, and the bands were identified by staining with ninhydrin reagent (0.2% w/v in acetone.) The radioactive products in the organic phase were resolved by Silica-60 TLC in the system chloroform, methanol, isopropanol, 0.25% (w/v) aqueous KCl, triethylamine (30:9:25:6:18, v/v/v/v/v) and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cell Fractionation and Enzyme Assays—Mitochondria, MAM, and microsomes were isolated by published methods (10Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) from cultures of the appropriate strains (1.5 liters, final A600 = 0.5–0.6). The protein concentration of the subcellular fractions was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Ptd-Ser synthase and PtdIns synthase activities were determined by published methods (11Carman G.M. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Acyltransferase activity was determined in 200-μl reactions containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxyl-3-sn-glycerophospho-[U-14C]Etn (5 × 104 cpm), 0–20 μm acyl-CoA, and 5–20 μg of protein from the appropriate subcellular fraction. Assays were conducted for 10 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 μl of methanol and 250 μl of chloroform followed by vigorous vortexing and centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube to separate the phases. Radioactive PtdEtn was identified by thin-layer chromatography on silica-60 TLC plates in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/water (65/25/4, v/v/v) and quantified as described above. Lyso-PtdOH acyltransferase assays were conducted using the same buffer compositions as for the LPEAT, with 100 μm lyso-PtdOH (Avanti) and 100,000 cpm of 1-[14C]oleoyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). LPEAT Kinetic Assays—Data for pH dependence and acyl-CoA kinetics were generated using a 100,000 × g microsomal membrane fraction isolated from PTY44 cells after lysis by bead-beating in a Bio-Spec apparatus as described previously (8Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Homogenization buffer and assay conditions were the same as those used for the determination of LPEAT activity in subcellular fractions. Calculation of the Km and Vmax for the acyl-CoA substrates was carried out by direct fitting of a hyperbola to the kinetic data with the program Hyper. YOR175C (ALE1) Encodes the Major Lyso-PtdEtn Acyltransferase Activity in Yeast—Our recent work examining the uptake and metabolism of lyso-PtdEtn by yeast (8Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the acyl-CoA-dependent LPEAT activity of yeast cells. We took a reverse-genetic, candidate-gene-based approach toward finding the gene(s) specifying the LPEAT activity. Our candidate genes were selected on the basis of similarity to the known acyltransferases Taz1p, Gup1p, Slc1p, Dga1p, and Are1p, and the complete list of knock-out strains and corresponding ORF designations that were tested for loss of LPEAT activity are listed in Table 1. Homogenates of these yeast strains harboring deletions in the candidate ORFs were tested for LPEAT activity, and as shown in Fig. 1, deletion of the uncharacterized membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family member, YOR175C produces a >95% depletion in the LPEAT activity of the homogenate relative to the wild-type BY4742 strain. All of the other candidates we tested had LPEAT activities comparable with the wild-type (not shown). This led us to designate the YOR175C gene as ALE1 due to its activity as an acyltransferase for lyso-PtdEtn. We next constructed a strain for functional analysis of the ALE1 gene by introducing an ale1Δ allele into the PTY44 background (psd1Δ psd2Δ) to give strain JWY89 (psd1Δ psd2Δ ale1Δ). The LPEAT activity of PTY44 was essentially identical to that of BY4742 (Fig. 1), and as with the BY4742 background, deletion of the ALE1 gene in the psd1Δ psd2Δ mutant essentially abolished the LPEAT activity of the extract. This series of experiments also revealed that, when an acyl-CoA generating system is used to drive the reaction, the SEY6210 wild-type background has a 2–3-fold higher LPEAT-specific activity relative to the BY4742 background and that the PTY44 (psd1Δ psd2Δ) background was slightly higher still (data not shown), perhaps indicating an increased expression of acyl-CoA synthetase activity. For this reason, further experiments were conducted in strains derived from the PTY44 background, except where noted. PTY44 also serves as the Etn/lyso-PtdEtn auxotrophic background for the genetic and physiological studies of lyso-PtdEtn metabolism that are described below. In Silico and Genome-scale Analyses of Ale1p—After establishing that YOR175C (ALE1) encodes the major LPEAT activity in yeast, we examined its primary sequence using various prediction algorithms to gain information about its putative localization and function. TargetP (13Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar) failed to predict a secretory signal peptide or a mitochondrial targeting sequence; however, the genome-scale GFP tagging localization analysis of Huh et al. (14Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar) indicated that Ale1p is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This preliminary localization analysis was corroborated by the highly sensitive TM-HMM algorithm that predicts at least seven transmembrane helices and by the presence of a di-lysine motif at the C terminus of Ale1p, which typically acts as a Golgi-retrieval and ER retention signal for membrane proteins through interaction with the coatomer complex (15Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These data as well as a multiple sequence alignment with other acyltransferases are given in Fig. 2. Additional evidence regarding the function of Ale1p comes from the epistatic mini-array profiling data of Schuldiner et al. (16Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. Weissman J.S. Krogan N.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). This study detected a profound growth defect in the ale1Δ slc1Δ double mutant, the implications of which are described below. Biochemical Properties of ALE1—We characterized the basic biochemical and kinetic parameters of the enzyme with lyso-PtdEtn as substrate, including a pH versus activity profile and determination of the Km and Vmax for various acyl-CoA substrates. As shown in Fig. 3A, the enzymatic activity is relatively insensitive to changes in pH, and the rate versus pH profile shows a broad maximum between 6.5 and 7.5. We next examined the acyl-CoA substrate preference of Ale1p by conducting kinetic assays with various acyl-CoA species. We determined the Km and Vmax for the acyl donors by varying the substrate concentrations and measuring initial rates of the conversion of lyso-PtdEtn to PtdEtn using the most active microsomal fraction as a source of enzyme. We examined oleoyl (18:1)-, palmitoleoyl (16:1)-, palmitoyl (16:0)-, and myristoyl (14:0)-CoA substrates, given that these are the most abundant fatty-acyl species in yeast phopholipids (17Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the Km values for the saturated acyl-CoA substrates were significantly lower than the unsaturated substrates. For palmitoyl- and myristoyl-CoA, these values were 0.9 and 0.4 μm, respectively, and for oleoyl- and palmitoleoyl-CoA species, the Km values were 10 and 17 μm, respectively. Conversely, the Vmax values were much higher for the unsaturated species (38 and 44 nmol/min/mg of protein for oleoyl- and palmitoleoyl-CoA versus 3.7 and 1.2 nmol/min/mg of protein for palmitoyl- and myristoyl-CoA. The figure clearly shows that, at any given acyl-CoA concentration, the initial rate with the unsaturated substrates was significantly higher than the saturated substrates. Although the specificity constant (Km/Vmax) for all substrates was similar, the kinetic data clearly indicate that, given equivalent concentrations of the different acyl-CoA species, Ale1p preferentially esterifies an unsaturated acyl chain at the sn-2 position of lyso-PtdEtn. Ale1p Acts as the Major Lyso-PtdOH Acyltransferase in Yeast—The product of the SLC1 gene has been shown to act as a lyso-PtdOH acyltransferase (LPAAT) (4Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, haploid slc1Δ mutants are viable, which necessitates that another, redundant LPAAT activity be present in the cell. The epistatic mini-array profile of Schuldiner et al. (16Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. Weissman J.S. Krogan N.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) revealed a synthetic-lethal interaction between the ale1Δ and slc1Δ mutations. One explanation for this result is that Ale1p provides the redundant lyso-PtdOH acyltransferase activity in the slc1Δ mutant, thus rendering the double mutant incapable of making PtdOH. To test this hypothesis, we assayed LPAAT activity in the BY4742 wild type and the isogenic slc1Δ and ale1Δ mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, relative to the wild-type parent, the ale1Δ mutant shows a ∼85% decrease in the total LPAAT activity of a cellular homogenate. Surprisingly, we detected no loss of LPAAT activity in the slc1Δ mutant, which may indicate that the Ale1p LPAAT activity is up-regulated in the absence of the Slc1p activity. Taken together with the synthetic lethality data (16Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. Weissman J.S. Krogan N.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), this result strongly suggests that Ale1p and Slc1p act as redundant LPAAT activities, with Ale1p accounting for the majority of the catalytic units. Subcellular Distribution of Ale1p Activity—The TM-HMM prediction described above indicated the presence of at least seven transmembrane helices, indicating an extremely high probability that Ale1p is a membrane-bound enzyme. Analysis with the localization prediction algorithm TargetP (13Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar) indicated the lack of either a canonical mitochondrial or secretory targeting signal, whereas the presence of a C-terminal di-basic motif was indicative of an endoplasmic reticulum protein (15Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Ale1p activity might be associated with an ER-derived microsomal fraction. Given the ability of PtdEtn derived from lyso-PtdEtn to preferentially replenish the mitochondrial PtdEtn pool, we also entertained the possibility that Ale1p, like some other enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis, would be enriched in the ER-derived MAM. To test this hypothesis, we prepared sucrose-gradient-purified mitochondria, MAM, microsomes, and cytosol and measured the specific activity of the Ale1p LPEAT in these fractions. Data from fractions isolated from isogenic wild-type and ale1Δ mutant strains were compared, and in these purified fractions the LPEAT activity of the ale1Δ mutant was <2% that of the wild-type level. This level of activity is at the limit of detection under our assay conditions; hence, only data for fractions from the wild-type strain are given. Fig. 5C shows that the MAM fraction is the most highly enriched for LPEAT activity and gives 2–3-fold higher specific activity than the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions, which are similar in their LPEAT specific activity. Essentially no activity was detectable in the cytosolic fraction. To verify the purity of the respective preparations, the purified membrane fractions were also assayed for PtdSer and PtdIns synthase activities, and these results are also presented in Fig. 5. PtdSer and PtdIns synthase activities are known to be enriched in the MAM fraction (19Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), with the remaining activity present in microsomes and only traces of activity in gradient-purified mitochondria. Our data recapitulate these published activity profiles for PtdSer and PtdIns synthases (Fig. 5, A and B) and, thus, establish the relative purity of our subcellular fractions. Given that there is substantial LPEAT activity in the purified mitochondrial fraction, the PtdSer and PtdIns synthase data also show that the Ale1p LPEAT activity that we detect in the mitochondrial fraction does not arise from contaminating microsomes. This fact provides strong evidence that the Ale1p enzyme is preferentially localized in a subfraction of the MAM that is tightly bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane such that it co-purifies with mitochondria on sucrose gradients. In the Absence of Ale1p, Lyso-PtdEtn Is Degraded to Water-soluble Products—The data presented in Fig. 6 demonstrate the catabolism of lyso-PtdEtn in the absence of Ale1p. PtdSer decarboxylase-deficient yeast strains either containing (PTY44) or lacking (JWY89) the Ale1p acyltransferase were incubated for 2 h with labeled lyso-Ptd[14C]Etn. The cells were harvested and washed extensively followed by lipid extraction and partitioning of the radiolabeled products between aqueous and organic phases. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, the ale1Δ mutation results in a 4–5-fold higher proportion of the imported label being present in the aqueous fraction. For the ALE1 wild-type strain, only about 6–7% of the total label associated with the cells was present in the aqueous fraction compared with ∼30–35% in the ale1Δ mutant. These findings are consistent with lyso-PtdEtn entering either of two pathways after internalization (see Fig. 8); s"
https://openalex.org/W2048509801,"Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Mechanisms of resistance to Bortezomib are undefined. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an antiapoptotic protein, which protects tumor cells against spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In MM, specific downregulation of Mcl-1 induces apoptosis. Here, we examined the role of Mcl-1 in Bortezomib- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that Bortezomib, but not doxorubicin, triggers caspase-dependent generation of a 28 kDa Mcl-1-fragment, in several MM cell lines, including MM.1S cells. Conversely, transient transfection of MM.1S cells with a previously reported 28 kDa Mcl-1128–350 fragment, but not with the Mcl-11–127 fragment, induces apoptosis. Therefore, both downregulation of full-length antiapoptotic Mcl-1, as well as Bortezomib-induced generation of Mcl-1128–350 cleaved protein, contribute to MM cell apoptosis. To verify further these findings, we next compared effects triggered by Bortezomib, doxorubicin and melphalan in Mcl-1wt/wt and Mcl-1Δ/null murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our results show that Bortezomib, but not doxorubicin or melphalan, triggers Mcl-1 cleavage in Mcl-1wt/wt, but not Mcl-1Δ/null MEFs and induces sub-G1 phase cells; caspase-3 and -9, and PARP cleavage as well as morphological signs of apoptosis. Taken together, these results support an important role of Mcl-1 and a Mcl-1 fragment in Bortezomib-induced cell death in general, and in MM in particular. To prevent relapse of MM in patients treated with Bortezomib, we therefore recommend the combination of Bortezomib with agents that induce MM cell death independent of Mcl-1."

In this study we have molecularly and functionally characterized aegyptin, a member of the family of 30-kDa salivary allergens from Aedes aegypti, whose function remained elusive thus far. Aegyptin displays a unique sequence characterized by glycine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid repeats and was shown to specifically block collagen-induced human platelet aggregation and granule secretion. Plasmon resonance experiments demonstrate that aegyptin binds to collagen types I–V (Kd ≈ 1 nm) but does not interact with vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor (vWf). In addition, aegyptin attenuates platelet adhesion to soluble or fibrillar collagen. Furthermore, aegyptin inhibits vWf interaction with collagen type III under static conditions and completely blocks platelet adhesion to collagen under flow conditions at high shear rates. Notably, aegyptin prevents collagen but not convulxin binding to recombinant glycoprotein VI. These findings suggest that aegyptin recognizes specific binding sites for glycoprotein VI, integrin α2β1, and vWf, thereby preventing collagen interaction with its three major ligands. Aegyptin is a novel tool to study collagen-platelet interaction and a prototype for development of molecules with antithrombotic properties.

In this study we show that a member of this family, herein named aegyptin, is a specific ligand of collagen. Collagen is a matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in the process of primary hemostasis; at sites of vascular injury, it initiates recruitment of circulating platelets and triggers platelet activation cascade required to stimulate thrombus growth (23Nieswandt B.

Aegyptin binds to collagens (I–V) and interferes with its interaction with major physiological ligands as follows: GPVI, integrin α2β1, and vWf. Notably, aegyptin blocks GPVI interaction with collagen and inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion. This study is the first to identify a collagen-binding protein in the saliva of a blood-sucking arthropod. Horse tendon insoluble fibrillar (quaternary, polymeric structure) Horm collagen (Chrono-Log Corp., Haverstown, PA) composed of collagen I (95%) and III (5%) was used because this microscopically visible collagen is routinely employed in platelet aggregation studies and in shear-controlled perfusion studies. Pepsin-digested, soluble nonfibrillar (tertiary structure, triple helical) collagen type III was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). ADP and phorbol myristate acetate were obtained from Sigma. Ristocetin, arachidonic acid, and ChronoLumi-reagent were from Chronolog. 9,11-Dideoxy-9α,11α-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F2α (U46619) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) was from EMD (San Diego, CA), and thrombin was from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Convulxin was purified as described (36Francischetti I.M. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and GPVI was prepared as published (37Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T.

A. aegypti Collection of Saliva and Salivary Gland Dissection—Saliva from female A. aegypti mosquitoes was collected by oilinduced salivation (38Ribeiro J.M. Sarkis J.J. Rossignol P.A. Spielman A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1984; 79: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and salivary glands were dissected as indicated (17Ribeiro J.M. Arca B. Lombardo F. Calvo E. Phan V.M. Chandra P.K. Wikel S.K. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Aegyptin—Salivary glands of 20 female mosquitoes (nonblood-fed) were dissected. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and specific cDNA was amplified using One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and the gene-specific primers aegyptin forward (5′-AGGCCCATGCCCGAAGATGAAGAACCAG-3′) and aegyptin reverse (5′-TTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACGTCCTTTGGATGAAACAC-3′). These two primers were designed based on aegyptin sequence (gi 94468546) to amplify the DNA fragment encoding the mature protein and a His6 tag before the stop codon. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into VR2001-TOPO vector (modified version of the VR1020 vector; Vical Inc., San Diego), and sequence and orientation were verified by DNA sequencing. Approximately 1 mg of plasmid DNA (VR2001-aegyptin construct) was obtained using GeneElute™ HP endotoxin-free plasmid MEGA prep kit (Sigma). The plasmid was purified through a 0.22-μm filter, and recombinant protein was produced by transfecting Free-Style™ 293-F cells (Invitrogen) with 240 μg of purified VR2001-aegyptin plasmid, following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). After 72 h, transfected cell culture was harvested. Supernatant containing the secreted recombinant protein was centrifuged (100 × g, 15 min), frozen, and stored at –30 °C until use. Recombinant Aegyptin Purification—293-F cells supernatant containing the recombinant protein was loaded onto a Ni2+ column (5-ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's directions. Fractions were eluted with 10, 40, and 300 mm imidazole (in 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and the fraction eluted at 300 mm was pooled and concentrated in an Amicon (10-kDa molecular weight cutoff) to 1 ml and then loaded onto a size-exclusion column (Superdex 75 HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences) using the AKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Purified recombinant protein was submitted to automated Edman degradation for N-terminal sequencing. To detect purity of aegyptin, 5 μg of purified protein was loaded in a 4–12% NU-PAGE gel (MES buffer), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Sequence Analysis and Estimate of Aegyptin Concentration—Concentration of purified aegyptin was estimated by its absorbance at 280 nm using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and corrected according to the molar extinction coefficient ϵ280 nm = 5600 m–1·cm–1; A280 nm/cm (1 mg/ml) = 0.220. Other calculated parameters are as follows: Mr, 27038.09; pI 3.96. Other protein parameters were obtained on line. Salivary Gland Fractionation—One hundred pairs of salivary gland homogenates were loaded onto a size-exclusion column (Superdex 75 HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences) using the AKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in HBS-N (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The active fraction (detected by surface plasmon resonance, see below) containing the collagen-binding protein was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a MonoQ column HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluted proteins were again tested for collagen binding activity as described below. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—All SPR experiments were carried out in a T100 instrument (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) following the manufacturer's instructions. This instrument features an integrated degasser, allowing problem-free kinetic measurements at temperatures up to 45 °C, as well as a temperature-controlled flow cell and sample compartment. The Biacore T100 evaluation software was utilized for kinetic and thermodynamic evaluation. Sensor CM5, amine coupling reagents, and buffers were also purchased from Biacore Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant) was used as the running buffer for all SPR experiments. All SPR experiments were carried out three times. Immobilization and Kinetic Analysis—Soluble collagen type I or type III (30 μg/ml) in acetate buffer, pH 4.5, was immobilized over a CM5 sensor via amine coupling. The immobilization target was aimed to 1500 resonance units (RU), resulting in a final immobilization of 1737.5 RU for collagen type I and 1613.3 RU for collagen type III. Blank flow cells were used to subtract the buffer effect on sensorgrams. Kinetic experiments were carried out with a contact time of 180 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C. Aegyptin-collagen I/III complex dissociation was monitored for 1800 s, and the sensor surface was regenerated by a pulse of 20 s of 10 mm HCl at 40 μl/min. Sensorgrams were fitted using the two-state reaction (conformational change) interaction model, and a linked reactions control experiment was carried out to confirm the multiphase binding kinetics of aegyptin-collagen I interaction. Solution Competition Assays—Experiments were performed in an attempt to detect whether aegyptin blocks collagen interaction with GPVI. Recombinant GPVI (25 μg/ml) in acetate buffer, pH 4.5, buffer was immobilized on a CM5 sensor with a final surface density of 1753.2 RU. A blank flow cell was used to subtract any effect of buffer in the refractory index change. Then different concentrations (3.175, 6.125, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/ml) of soluble collagen I alone (control) or previously incubated (15 min at room temperature) with 500 nm of aegyptin in HBS-P buffer were injected over immobilized GPVI for 120 s at 20 μl/min. Complex dissociation was monitored for 400 s. Sensor surface was regenerated between runs with by a 30-s pulse of glycine solution, pH 1.5. To verify that immobilized GPVI was still active after all the injection-regeneration cycles, 50 μg/ml of collagen I was injected for 120 s at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and the resulting sensorgram was compared with the one obtained before. Additionally, a control experiment was carried out using convulxin at different concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 nm) incubated with buffer or saturating concentrations of aegyptin (500 nm) followed by injection of the mixture over immobilized GPVI, as described above. Identification of Collagen-binding Protein from Salivary Gland Homogenate and Saliva—An aliquot of 10 μl obtained after size-exclusion or anion-exchange chromatographies was dissolved in 100 μl of HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P-20) and injected over collagen type I and III immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip for 120 s at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Complex dissociation was monitored for 400 s, and the sensor chip surface was regenerated with a 10-s pulse of 10 mm HCl at 30 μl/min. In some experiments, saliva was used as an analyte. Thermodynamic Analysis—Thermodynamic parameters for aegyptin-collagen type I interaction were obtained from independent kinetic experiments using the Thermo Wizard assay program. Briefly, different concentrations of recombinant aegyptin (0.1–3 nm) were injected over immobilized soluble collagen type I at 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C. The sample compartment was kept at 25 °C. Contact time, dissociation time, and regeneration of the sensor surface were done as described above. Resulting sensorgrams were fitted to the two-state reaction (conformational change) interaction model with local Rmax. The association (Ka) and dissociation (Kd) rate constants, as well as the affinity constant (KD), were obtained and fitted to a linear form of the van't Hoff and Eyring equations to estimate the ΔH and ΔS as well as ΔH0‡ and ΔS0‡, respectively. Production of Aegyptin Polyclonal Antibodies and Western Blot—Female Swiss Webster mice, 8–12 weeks old, were purchased from the Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Mice were maintained in the NIAID Animal Care Facility under pathogen-free conditions. Three mice were anesthetized with 100 μl of 20 mg/ml ketamine HCl (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and immunized with DNA plasmids intradermally in the right ear using a 29.5-gauge needle. DNA plasmids (1 μg/μl) were injected in a 10-μl volume, three times at 2-week intervals. Two weeks after the last DNA immunization, sera were collected and stored at –30 °C until use. Western blot was performed using anti-aegyptin antibodies at 1:200 dilution. Platelet Preparation and ATP Release—Blood collection, platelet aggregation, and ATP release were performed as described (8Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). vWf Binding to Collagen—Polystyrene plates were coated with 100 μl of soluble collagen type III (3 μg/ml) or a 2% (w/v) solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 37°C. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound protein, residual binding sites were blocked by adding 5 mg/ml denatured BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBS-T), increasing concentrations of recombinant aegyptin (ranging from 0.0015 to 1.5 μm) was added to the well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Wells were washed again and incubated with 3 nm of vWf factor VIII-free (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) in TBS-T supplemented with 2% (w/v) BSA. After 1 h at 37°C, wells were washed three times with TBS-T, and a polyclonal rabbit anti-human vWf (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) was added (1:500 in TBS-T) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with TBS-T, an alkaline phosphatase conjugate anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule; Sigma) was added (1:10,000) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Before adding the stabilized p-nitrophenyl phosphate liquid substrate (Sigma), wells were washed six times with TBS-T. After 30 min of substrate conversion, the reaction was stopped with 3 n NaOH, and absorbance was read at 405 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Net specific binding was obtained by subtracting optical density values from wells coated only with BSA from the total binding measured as described above. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Platelet Adhesion Assay under Static Conditions—Coverslips (22 × 22 mm, number 0) were treated with H2SO4/H2O2 (4:1) for 20 min to remove contaminants (39Tokumasu F. Dvorak J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2003; 211: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) followed by ultrasonic washing with deionized water and ultraviolet cleaning. Coverslips were coated with fibrillar (100 μg/ml) or soluble collagen type I (100 μg/ml) for 10 min, rinsed in deionized water, and incubated overnight with denatured BSA (5 mg/ml). Coverslips were treated with 100 μl of aegyptin (0–3 μm) for 15 min, and inhibitor was removed by inverting and touching the borders of coverslips with precision wipes (Kimberly-Clark, Ontario, Canada). Platelets (200 μl, 2 × 105/ml) were mixed with aegyptin (0–3 μm) and applied to coverslips for 45 min at room temperature followed by washing in Tyrode/BSA, and mounted for imaging. Differential interference contrast images were obtained with a Leica DMI6000 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) using ×100 objective with NA = 1.30, and an ORCA ER digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonic Systems, Bridgewater, NJ). Image acquisition and the digital camera were controlled by ImagePro 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Extent of platelet adhesion was expressed as percent area covered by platelets. Platelet Adhesion under Flow Conditions—Glass slides were coated with fibrillar collagen (300 μl, 100 μg/ml) for 10 min, washed in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated overnight with denatured BSA (5 mg/ml). Coated slides were treated with aegyptin (300 μl in Tyrode/BSA; 0–3 μm) for 15 min, and the excess was removed by inversion. The slides was placed in the bottom of the parallel plate flow chamber (Glycotech, Rockville, MD), and a silicone rubber gasket determined the flow path height of 254 μm as described (40Cruz M.A. Chen J. Whitelock J.L. Morales L.D. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Anticoagulated blood (50 μm d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride) was mixed with aegyptin (0–3 μm) and aspirated using an infusion/withdrawal pump with multispeed transmission (model 940; Harvard Apparatus, Dover, MA) through the flow chamber at a flow rate of 0.65 ml/min, producing a shear rate of 1,500 s–1 (40Cruz M.A. Chen J.

A natural carbohydrate decorated form of PSM (Fd-PSM) containing 40% of the core 1 blood group type A tetrasaccharide, and 58% peptide-linked GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr residues, with 45% of the peptide-linked α-GalNAc residues linked α-(2,6) to N-glycolylneuraminic acid, shows ∼104 enhanced affinity for SBA. Vatairea macrocarpa lectin (VML), which is also a GalNAc binding lectin, displays a similar pattern of binding to the four forms of PSM, although there are quantitative differences in its affinities as compared with SBA. The higher affinities of SBA and VML for Tn-PSM relative to Fd-PSM indicate the importance of carbohydrate composition and epitope density of mucins on their affinities for lectins. The higher affinities of SBA and VML for Tn-PSM relative to its two shorter chain analogs demonstrate that the length of a mucin polypeptide and hence total carbohydrate valence determines the affinities of the three Tn-PSM analogs. The results suggest a binding model in which lectin molecules “bind and jump” from α-GalNAc residue to α-GalNAc residue along the polypeptide chain of Tn-PSM before dissociating.

Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The galectin-1 counter receptors in these cells include several different glycoproteins including globular and linear mucin-type glycoproteins. For example, CD45 RO, a counter receptor for galectin-1 on T cells (3Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed as a globular transmembrane glycoprotein that possesses multiple N-linked glycosylation chains with Lac-NAc epitopes. CD43, another galectin-1 counter receptor on T cells (3Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein that possesses ∼80 O-linked chains with terminal LacNAc epitopes (4Daniels M.A. Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple carbohydrate epitopes is known to facilitate cross-linking of these glycoproteins with lectins including galectin-1 (3Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of multiple carbohydrate epitopes in CD43 and CD45 on their mechanisms of binding to galectin-1 and other lectins is not well understood. Details of the mechanisms of binding of multivalent globular and linear glycoproteins to lectins in general have been lacking until recently. d-galactose soybean agglutinin V. macrocarpa lectin concanavalin A D. grandiflora lectin porcine submaxillary mucin fully carbohydrate-decorated porcine submaxillary mucin porcine submaxillary mucin containing GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr residues 81-residue amino acid repeat of domain of porcine submaxillary mucin containing GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr residues 38/40-residue amino acid cleavage product of 81-mer Tn-PSM containing only GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr residues GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr asialofetuin N-acetyl-d-galactosamine l-fucose N-glycoloylneuraminic acid or sialic acid N-acetyl-d-lactosamine isothermal titration microcalorimetry nuclear magnetic resonance. Recently, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) has been used to investigate the binding of asialofetuin (ASF), a globular glycoprotein that possesses nine LacNAc epitopes on three N-linked triantennary chains, to a number of galectins including galectin-1 (5Dam T.K. Gabius H.-J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Lensch M. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12564-12571Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The observed Ka values for ASF binding to the galectins are 50-80-fold greater than that of monovalent LacNAc. These results are similar to the increases in observed Ka values obtained by ITC for binding of a synthetic tetravalent carbohydrate to the lectins concanavalin A (Con A) and Dioclea grandiflora (DGL) relative to monovalent carbohydrate binding (6Dam T.K. Roy R. Pagé D. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hill plots of the ITC data for the binding of synthetic di-, tri-, and tetravalent carbohydrates to ConA and DGL showed evidence for large gradients of microscopic binding constants of the different epitopes of the carbohydrates to the two lectins (6Dam T.K. Roy R. Pagé D. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar observations were observed in the Hill plots of ASF binding to the galectins (5Dam T.K. Gabius H.-J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Lensch M. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12564-12571Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The latter study indicates that galectins bind to the nine Lac-NAc epitopes of ASF with a gradient of microscopic affinity constants ranging from 3000-6000-fold for the first to the ninth galectin molecule. Thus, the observed macroscopic Ka values for the galectins are derived from the average free energy of binding of the microscopic binding constants of the nine LacNAc epitopes of ASF (5Dam T.K. Gabius H.-J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Lensch M. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12564-12571Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These observations serve as models for the mechanisms of binding and affinity enhancements of multivalent synthetic carbohydrates and a nonavalent globular glycoprotein to lectins. However, little information is known about the mechanisms of binding of mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins to lectins.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possess mucin domains with large number of glycan epitopes. Mucins are heavily O-glycosylated glycoproteins that are secreted by higher organisms to protect and lubricate epithelia cell surfaces from biological, chemical, and mechanical insults. Mucin and mucin-type molecules exist as soluble and membrane-attached molecules that are involved in modulating immune response, inflammation, adhesion, and tumorigenesis (9Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar, 10Byrd J.C. Bresalier R.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004; 23: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 11Fukuda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The O-glycosylated domains of mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins contain 50-80% carbohydrate and possess expanded conformations. Polypeptide tandem repeats are found in mucins that contain clusters of Ser and Thr residues in high content. The O-linked carbohydrate chains in these domains are attached via α-GalNAc residues to Ser and Thr residues which have been shown to induce a 3-fold expansion of the polypeptide chain of these molecules (12Shogren R.L. Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5526-5536Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Studies of porcine submaxillary gland mucins demonstrate that their O-glycans make up ∼60-70% of their masses. The cDNA sequence of porcine submaxillary mucin (PSM) has been determined (13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33204-33210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), along with the composition of carbohydrate chains of PSM as determined by chemical (14Carlson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and NMR techniques (15Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gerken and Jentoft (15Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have isolated the O-glycosylated domain of PSM that possesses a molecular mass of ∼106 daltons and is fully decorated with naturally occurring carbohydrates (Fd-PSM). The O-glycosylated domain of PSM possessing only α-GalNAc residues (Tn-PSM) has also been obtained using chemical and enzymatic treatments (16Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr residue(s) in Tn-PSM is the pancarcinoma carbohydrate antigen Tn that is aberrantly expressed in mucins such as MUC1 in adenocarcinomas (17Sorensen A.L. Reis C.A. Tarp M.A. Sankaranarayanan V. Schwientek T. Graham R. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Binding of galectin-3, a member of the galectin family of β-Gal binding animal lectins, to cancer-associated MUC1 causes increased endothelial cancer cell adhesion (18Yu L.-G. Andrews N. Zhao Z. McKean D. Williams J.F. Connor L.J. Gerasimenko O.V. Hilkens J. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Rhodes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 773-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunization of mice with desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin, which expresses large amounts of Tn, protected mice against TA3-Ha tumor challenge and produced a high-antibody titer (19Singhal A. Fohn M. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1406-1411PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to compare the binding properties of Tn-PSM with the naturally occurring fully decorated PSM (Fd-PSM) containing core 1 blood group type A oligosaccharides. The 81-mer tandem repeat domain of Tn-PSM (81-mer TnPSM) and the 38/40-mer digest of this domain (38/40-mer Tn-PSM) also have been obtained using enzymatic digests (16Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These shorter fragments of Tn-PSM allow investigation of altering the length of Tn-PSM on its binding interactions with lectins. The present study reports ITC and hemagglutination inhibition studies of the binding of soybean agglutinin (SBA) and V. macrocarpa lectin (VML), which are both tetrameric Gal-NAc-specific lectins (20Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar, 21Ramos M.V. Cavada B.S. Calvete J.J. Sampaio A.H. Mazard A.M. Barre A. Grangeiro T.B. Freitas B.T. Leite K.B. Rougé P. Prot. Pept. Lett. 1999; 6: 163-171Google Scholar), to Fd-PSM, Tn-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms of binding of α-GalNAc-specific lectins to PSM, and the effects of the Tn antigen and the length of the Tn-PSM polypeptide chain on these interactions. Materials—SBA was obtained from EY Biochemicals, Inc. The concentration of SBA was determined spectrophotometrically using A1%, 1 cm = 12.8 (20Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar) and expressed in terms of monomer. VML was purified by affinity chromatography on a guar gum column (22Cavada B.S. Santos C.F. Grangeiro T.B. Nunes E.P. Sales P.V. P. Ramos R.L. Sousa F.A. M. Crisostomo C.V. Calvete J.J. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The concentration of VML was determined spectrophotometrically using A1%, 1 cm = 13.0 and expressed in terms of monomer. The preparations of Fd-PSM, Tn-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM have been previously described (16Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 81-mer Tn-PSM was obtained by trypsin digestion of Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM obtained by GluC digestion of 81-mer PSM. GalNAcα1-O-Ser was obtained from Sigma Company. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay—The assay was performed at 22 °C using a 2-fold serial dilution technique (23Osawa T. Matsumoto I. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 323-327Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and 3% (v/v) rabbit erythrocytes in Hepes buffer (0.1 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.2). The minimum concentration of saccharide required for complete inhibition of four hemagglutination doses was determined. Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC instrument from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). Injections of 4 μl of carbohydrate solution were added from a computer-controlled micro syringe at an interval of 4 min into the sample solution of lectin (cell volume = 1.43 ml) with stirring at 350 rpm. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in (Fig. 1) for Tn-PSM and SBA at 27 °C. Control experiments were performed by injections of the mucin into a cell containing only buffer. The concentration range of the lectins was 5-100 μm and the mucins 0.6 μm to 0.50 mm based on the dry weight of the latter molecules. Concentration of the mucins was based on their molecular weights. Titrations were done at pH 7.2 using 20 mm PBS buffer. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH (binding enthalpy in kcal mol-1) (lectin monomer units), Ka (association constant) and n (number of binding sites per monomer), as adjustable parameters. Kd (dissociation constant) was calculated from 1/Ka. The quantity c = Ka Mt (0), where Mt (0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (24Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with c values 1 < c < 500. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cytidine 2′-monophosphate (2′-CMP) supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the Gibbs Free Energy equation, ΔG =ΔH - TΔS =-RT ln (Ka), where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively. T is the absolute temperature and r = 1.98 cal mol-1 K-1. Structures of Fd-PSM, Tn-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM—The structure of PSM is composed of a very large central O-glycosylated domain flanked by small Cys-rich globular domains at both the N and C termini (13Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33204-33210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The O-glycosylated domain consists of ∼100 81-residue tandem repeats with the sequence shown in Fig. 2A (25Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 272: 1081-1087Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Each tandem repeat contains 31 Ser/Thr O-glycosylation sites, and about 75% or more of the Ser and Thr residues are glycosylated to varying extents (15Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, there are ∼2300 carbohydrate chains in the O-glycosylated domain of PSM. The carbohydrate side chains described for PSM range from the monosaccharide Gal-NAcα1-O-Ser/Thr, the pancarcinoma carbohydrate antigen Tn, to the core 1 blood group A tetrasaccharide α-GalNAc (1-3)[α-Fuc (1-2)]-β-Gal (1-3)-α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr (14Carlson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the mono-through tetrasaccharides is potentially glycosylated by an NeuNGl residue attached α (2-6) to the peptide-linked GalNAc and therefore up to eight possible oligosaccharides are found in PSM. Carbon-13 NMR (15Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indicates that the oligosaccharide side chain composition of the present sample of Fd-PSM consist of 58% mono α-GalNAc residues, 2% of the trisaccharide and 40% of the tetrasaccharide. The percentage of α-NeuNGl was determined to be 45% in Fd-PSM, and thus ∼45% of the peptide-linked α-GalNAc residues in Fd-PSM have NeuNGl attached to them (illustrated in Fig. 2B). The structures of Tn-PSM possessing ∼2300 α-GalNAc residues (Fig. 2C), 81-mer Tn-PSM possessing ∼23 α-GalNAc residues (Fig. 2D), and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM possessing ∼11-12 α-GalNAc residues (Fig. 2E) that were obtained by chemical and/or enzymatic digests were confirmed by NMR and column chromatography (16Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hemagglutination Inhibition Data—Hemagglutination inhibition data in Table 1 show that SBA possesses different affinities for Fd-PSM, Tn-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM. For comparison, the concentration for 50% inhibition by GalNAcα1-O-Ser is given a relative inhibition value of 1.0. SBA is inhibited by Tn-PSM at 0.3 nm which is 3 × 106 lower concentration than GalNAcα1-O-Ser. 81-mer Tn-PSM inhibits SBA at 0.15 μm which is 7 × 103 lower concentration than GalNAcα1-O-Ser, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM inhibits at 5.6 μm, which is ∼600 times lower concentration than GalNAcα1-O-Ser. Thus, Tn-PSM is a more effective inhibitor than 81-mer Tn-PSM, which, in turn, is more effective than 38/40-mer Tn-PSM. SBA is inhibited by Fd-PSM at 0.08 μm that is a 104 lower concentration than GalNAcα1-O-Ser.TABLE 1Hemagglutination inhibition data for SBA and VML at pH 7.2 27 °CLigandSBAK(rel)aInhibition concentration relative to GalNAcα1-O-Ser.VMLK(rel)aInhibition concentration relative to GalNAcα1-O-Ser.μMμMGalNAcα1-O-Ser1000bErrors are ±50%.1600138/40-mer Tn-PSM5.61801.250081-mer Tn-PSM0.1570000.0230,000Tn-PSM0.00033,000,0000.00023,000,000Fd-PSM0.0810,0000.002300,000a Inhibition concentration relative to GalNAcα1-O-Ser.b Errors are ±50%.

VLM is inhibited by Fd-PSM at 2 nm, which is a 3 × 104 lower concentration than GalNAcα1-O-Ser. ITC Data—ITC data for the binding of SBA to Tn-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, 38/40-mer Tn-PSM, and Fd-PSM are shown in Table 2. Kd values for Tn-PSM, Fd-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM binding to SBA are 0.2 × 10-9 m, 2.4 × 10-8 m, 6.0 × 10-8 m, and 1.4 × 10-6 m, respectively. The results show that SBA possesses the highest affinities for Fd-PSM and Tn-PSM, and decreasing affinities for 81-mer Tn-PSM and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM. The free energy of binding (ΔG), enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and entropy of binding (TΔS) for the four forms of PSM to SBA are also shown in Table 2 as well as the respective value of n, the number of binding sites per subunit of SBA.

Open table in a new tab ITC data for the binding of VML to Tn-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, 38/40-mer Tn-PSM, and Fd-PSM are also shown in Table 2. The observed Kd values for Tn-PSM, Fd-PSM, 81-mer Tn-PSM, and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM are 0.1 × 10-9 m, 1.4 × 10-9 m, 1.2 × 10-8 m, and 0.2 × 10-6 m, respectively. These values are similar to the respective inhibition constants found by hemagglutination inhibition in Table 1. The results show that VLM possesses the highest affinities for Fd-PSM and Tn-PSM, and decreasing affinities for 81-mer Tn-PSM and 38/40-mer Tn-PSM. The ΔG, ΔH, and TΔS values for the four forms of PSM are also shown in Table 2, as well as the respective values of n. ITC data for GalNAcα1-O-Ser are also shown in Table 2. Hemagglutination Inhibition Data for SBA and VML Binding to Tn-PSM, 81-mer PSM, 38/40-mer PSM, and Fd-PSM—The hemagglutination inhibition data in Table 1 indicate that SBA and VML bind to Tn-PSM with affinities greater than the other three forms of PSM. The difference in affinities between Tn-PSM and Fd-PSM may be due to the masking of GalNAc residues in the latter by the presence of NeuNGl residues that are linked α-(2,6) to 45% of the total peptide-linked GalNAc residues. As a consequence, the structural valence of GalNAc residues in Fd-PSM may be ∼1300 as compared with ∼2300 in Tn-PSM. The lower affinities of SBA and VML for Fd-PSM may also reflect differences in the presentation of the nonreducing terminal α-GalNAc residue in the blood group type A tetrasaccharide compared with the peptide-linked α-GalNAc residue. Both SBA and VML bind with greater affinities to Tn-PSM and Fd-PSM as compared with 81-mer Tn-PSM. In turn, both lectins bind to 81-mer Tn-PSM with greater affinities than to 38/40-mer Tn-PSM. This indicates that the longer polypeptide chain forms of PSM bind with higher affinities to the two lectins, and that the total number of free GalNAc residues in Tn-PSM and Fd-PSM are important for binding to the lectins. The hemagglutination inhibition data also suggest differences in the specificities of SBA and VML for the four forms of PSM. These differences are examined in detail by ITC measurements described below. ITC Data for SBA Binding to Tn-PSM—ITC data for SBA binding to Tn-PSM (Table 2) show a Kd value of 0.2 nm that agrees well with the hemagglutination inhibition concentration of 0.3 nm in Table 1. The ITC-derived K(rel) for Tn-PSM is 850,00-fold greater than that of GalNAcα1-O-Ser, which can be compared with the K(rel) of 3 × 106 obtained by hemagglutination inhibition. The n value for SBA binding to Tn-PSM, which is the binding stoichiometry expressed as number of binding sites per subunit of lectin, is 0.0018 (Table 2). We previously demonstrated that 1/n provides the functional valence of multivalent carbohydrates and glycoproteins binding to lectins (5Dam T.K. Gabius H.-J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Lensch M. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12564-12571Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26Dam T.K. Roy R. Das S.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14223-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The 1/n value for Tn-PSM binding of SBA is 540, which indicates that 540 α-GalNAc residues of the ∼2300 α-GalNAc residues of Tn-PSM bind to 540 monomers of SBA because each monomer of SBA binds one GalNAcα1-O-Ser molecule (Table 2). The 1/n value indicates that the functional valence of Tn-PSM for SBA is less than the structural valence of Tn-PSM. The reason for the fractional binding of SBA to the carbohydrate epitopes in Tn-PSM appears to be the size of the SBA tetramer, which possesses a molecular mass of 120 kDa and one N-linked Man-9 oligomannose chain per monomer (27Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8518-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabesan S. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4933-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Kiessling and co-workers (29Gestwicki J.E. Strong L.E. Cairo C.W. Boehm F.J. Kiessling L.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 163-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have reported similar fractional occupancies for the binding of ConA, a tetrameric Man-specific lectin similar in size to SBA, to synthetic polymers containing α-mannose residues. Fractional occupancy has also been reported for SBA binding to the nine LacNAc epitopes of ASF (30Mandal D.K. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SBA binding to Tn-PSM yields a ΔH of -4310 kcal/mol as compared with -7.9 kcal/mol for GalNAcα1-O-Ser (Table 2). If the ΔH for SBA binding to Tn-PSM is divided by the 1/n value of 540 α-GalNAc residues on Tn-PSM that bind to the lectin, the resulting ΔH per α-GalNAc residue of Tn-PSM is -7.98 kcal/mol, which is very similar to the ΔH of -7.9 kcal/mol for GalNAcα1-O-Ser. This indicates that each α-GalNAc residue of Tn-PSM that binds to SBA possesses the same enthalpy of binding as that of GalNAcα1-O-Ser. The observed ΔH for SBA binding to Tn-PSM is thus the sum of the individual ΔH values of the α-GalNAc binding residues of the mucin. Similar observations have been made for the binding of"

In eukaryotic cells, genetic information is complexed with histone proteins in a highly organized structure known as chromatin. The nucleosome, the fundamental structural unit of chromatin, contains an octamer formed by two copies of each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, about which is wrapped 146 bp of DNA (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6908) Google Scholar). The dynamics of chromatin structure directly influence the accessibility of DNA, which in turn affects gene transcription, replication, and recombination (2Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Core histone proteins are evolutionarily conserved and have flexible N-terminal tails protruding from the nucleosome.

Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7654) Google Scholar). Different combinations of covalent modifications form the essence of what has been termed the histone code (5Strahl B.D.

Acetylation is perhaps the best characterized PTM on histones and generally is associated with increased DNA accessibility not only by the neutralization of the positive charges on lysine residues but also as interaction sites capable of recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes (6Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that particular histones and particular sites within histones become acetylated under distinct physiological conditions (7Chicoine L.G. Schulman I.G. Richman R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1071-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selection of acetylation sites could be accomplished either by a set of different histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or by the fine tuning of HAT specificity by additional factors. So far, a variety of proteins with HAT activity have been discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 8Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), but their in vivo substrate specificities have only been partially investigated by antibodies against some of the known acetylation sites (9Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It is still a major challenge to define the global impact on each histone's PTM pattern upon cellular perturbation (e.g. a HAT knock-out). A study of HAT deletion effects using a method with less bias (i.e. one that can visualize all abundant PTMs simultaneously in an unbiased fashion) and still provide site-specific PTM information will help our understanding of how HATs work together in vivo and illuminate the interplay between acetylation and other PTMs. Gcn5 was first shown to be required for transcriptional activation and later recognized to have HAT activity (10Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). To date, it is one of the best characterized HATs both structurally and functionally. Recombinant Gcn5 acetylates free H3 at Lys14 preferentially and H4 at Lys8 and Lys16 weakly in vitro, confirming the selectivity of Gcn5 for certain lysine residues within specific histones (11Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For histone H3, this specificity is extended to other sites (Lys9, Lys14, Lys18, and Lys23) when Gcn5-containing complexes, such as SAGA and ADA, are used with nucleosome substrates in vitro (12Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), indicating that its HAT activity is regulated by interacting proteins. Later, the Grunstein laboratory used highly specific antibodies to reexamine the substrate specificity of Gcn5 in vivo (9Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Their study demonstrated that Gcn5 is required for acetylation at Lys11 and Lys16 of H2B and Lys9, Lys18, Lys23, and Lys27 of H3 with the exception of Lys14. In the course of these studies, almost no effect on H4 (9Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 13Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) was found, whereas others support that Gcn5 deletion can affect acetylation of H4 in addition to H3 (14Zhang W.Z. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These results are informative but do not reveal if the acetylation sites affected by Gcn5 are on the same histone molecule or whether they are affected equivalently, because antibodies can only detect one PTM at a time and different antibodies have different affinities. Even when antibodies showed no change of modification at one site, there could be change of combinations of modifications. Due to the limitations of antibodies, a more informative and precise method is necessary to fully understand the substrate specificity of Gcn5. Previous studies have shown a direct correlation between Gcn5 HAT activity and activation of specific model genes, including HIS3, PHO5, and HO (15Kuo M.H. Zhou J.X. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Lui L. Berger S.L. Horz W. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A more comprehensive understanding of Gcn5 HAT activity utilized microarray analysis to show expression differences for over 60% of genes in yeast (18Kurdistani S.K. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 19Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A combination of serial analysis of gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation methods has shown that Gcn5 plays a global role in regulating histone H3 and H4 acetylation (20Roh T.Y. Ngau W.C. Cui K.R. Landsman D. Zhao K.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, direct measurements of the effect of Gcn5 on the global levels of PTMs on all core histone proteins have not been described. Here, we used top down mass spectrometry (21Meng F.Y. Cargile B.J. Patrie S.M. Johnson J.R. McLoughlin S.M. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 2923-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Pesavento J.J. Kim Y.B. Taylor G.K. Kelleher N.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3386-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to examine the global effects of Gcn5 and eight other mutants on the expression and modification of all four core histone proteins. We first established the “basis set” of all abundant PTM combinations on intact histones in wild type cells, including site-specific PTM localization, using electron capture dissociation (ECD) for tandem mass spectrometry (23Zubarev R.A. Horn D.M. Fridriksson E.K. Kelleher N.L. Kruger N.A. Lewis M.A. Carpenter B.K. McLafferty F.W. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 24Zubarev R.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, this general approach has been demonstrated on diverse forms of human histones (25Boyne M.T. Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Siuti N. Roth M.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Pesavento J.J. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Thomas C.E. Kelleher N.L. Mizzen C.A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), with quantitative determination of specific combinations of modifications and PTM occupancy at specific sites (including the ability to resolve “positional isomers” of acetylation for H4) (28Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Besides characterizing all core histones, ECD analysis of the H3 tail from wild-type chromatin also revealed a correlation between methylation and acetylation; there is a wide swing from 10 to 80% Lys4 trimethylation levels on the species with 0 and 3 acetylation states, respectively. With the top down perspective, global alteration of histone modification in gcn5Δ cells was striking and readily apparent; levels of hyperacetylated forms of H2B and H3 were greatly diminished, whereas acetylation of H4 and H2A was only slightly affected. gcn5Δ cells showed reduced acetylation at specific sites in H3 and a 30% decrease in the overall trimethylation level on Lys4, underscoring the reciprocity between these two chromatin marks. Set1 mutants also showed the loss of acetylation at Lys14 and Lys18 or Lys23 on the same molecules where Lys4 trimethylation was also lost. Results from eight other mutants are also presented and highlight the potential to profile a large number of conditions for their effects on bulk chromatin. Yeast Cell Culture-S288C S. cerevisiae cells (MATa his3Δ leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ) with the interruption of Gcn5, Ahc1, Rtg2, Ada1, Spt7, Ard1, Nat1, or Nat4, respectively, were purchased from Open Biosystems. All of the strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, pH 7) at 30 °C to midlog phase until A600 = 0.6 units. Growth curves of wild type and gcn5Δ cells were established by recording cell density at A600 every 1.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 1000 × g and washed twice with sterile water before storage of the cell pellets at -80 °C. Set1 mutant MBY1217 (MATα his3Δ200 ade2::hisG leu2Δ ura2Δ0 met15Δ0 trp1Δ63 Ty1his3AI-236r, Ty1ade2AI515 set1Δ::TRP1) and the parental strain were obtained from the laboratory of Scott Briggs (Purdue University). Construction of plasmids expressing full length Set1-(1-1080) and the N-terminal truncated Set1-(829-1080) were described in previous studies (29Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 28761-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on SC medium (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base supplemented with amino acids, 2% glucose) lacking uracil to midlog phase until an A600 of 0.6 units. Cells were harvested as described above. Histone Extraction and Separation-Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and extracted three times with 2.5 volumes of yeast protein purification reagent (Yper; Pierce), 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 5 nm microcysteine (Sigma), 500 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) and 100 mm sodium butyrate. Briefly, resuspended cells were incubated on ice for about 30 min, lysates were clarified by 5 min of centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. Following two additional repetitions, the cytoplasm-reduced cell pellet was then washed three times with sterile water to remove excess Yper. Histone extraction was performed twice by incubation of the cell pellet with 2.5 volumes of 8 m deionized urea and 0.4 n sulfuric acid for 30 min on ice. The sample was spun down again, and clarified supernatants were pooled and immediately loaded onto an equilibrated disposable C4 column (J. T. Baker Inc. BAKERBOND spt™ wide pore butyl (C4) disposable extraction column). After washing the column with 10 volumes of buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in distilled H2O), histones were eluted with buffer B (60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Acetonitrile was then removed from the collected fractions using a SpeedVac. Before further separation by RPLC, the sample was oxidized by incubating at room temperature in 3% formic acid and H2O2 for 4 h (31Pesavento J.J. Garcia B.A. Streeky J.A. Kelleher N.L. Mizzen C.A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized protein was loaded onto a 4.6-mm × 250-mm C8 or C18 Vydac column. Proteins were fractionated in 100 min from 30 to 60% B (A, 5% CH3CN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B, 90% CH3CN with 0.094% trifluoroacetic acid) and detected by absorbance at 214 nm. Histone proteins were eluted between 55 and 95 min (Fig. 1A). Every fraction was subsequently concentrated in a SpeedVac. Different acetylation states of H3 were further separated by acid urea gel electrophoresis using gels composed of 15% Triton X-100, acetic acid, urea (typically 1.5-mm thick and 13 × 14 cm2) according to Mullen et al. (32Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), except that gels were run at 250 V for 20 h to obtain better resolution of H3. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. A duplicate gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and probed with anti-Lys4 trimethylation antibodies (Abcam). H3 Glu-C Digestion and RPLC Separation-H3 purified from RPLC was dried down and resuspended in 50 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 4). Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) was added at a ratio of Glu-C/H3 of 1:10 (w/w) and incubated at room temperature for 4-5 h. The reaction was stopped by freezing the sample. H3 digests were loaded to a 4.6 mm × 250 mm C18 Vydac column pre-equilibrated with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were fractionated in 60 min from 0 to 60% B (90% acetonitrile with 0.188% trifluoroacetic acid) and detected by absorbance at 214 nm (Fig. 3A). Mass Spectrometry: ESI/Quadrupole-FTMS-Purified and dried histone samples were resuspended in 50 μl of ESI solution (50% acetonitrile, 49% H2O, and 1% formic acid), and 10 μl was loaded to a nanospray robot (Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY). The system used in this study was a custom 8.5 T quadrupole-FTMS hybrid described elsewhere (24Zubarev R.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Ions from ESI were directed through a heated metal capillary and multiple ion guides into the ion cell (∼10-10 torr) of the FTMS system. Theoretical isotopic distributions were generated using IsoPro version 3.0 and fit to experimental data by least squares to assign the most abundant isotopic peak. Typically, 10-50 scans were used to collect broadband data. Samples were also analyzed using a quadrupole-based selection strategy. In short, targeted peaks were selected by a quadrupole filter before accumulation (1-2 s) in an external octupole and transfer to the ion cell. Ions were fragmented by ECD (23Zubarev R.A. Horn D.M. Fridriksson E.K. Kelleher N.L. Kruger N.A. Lewis M.A. Carpenter B.K. McLafferty F.W. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Most spectra were stored as 512,000 data points and processed using zero or one truncation, no zero fill, and Hanning apodization. MS/MS data were analyzed by a modified version of the THRASH algorithm. Individual histone proteins were identified and characterized by uploading data onto the prosightptm World Wide Web server to search the yeast data base. Statistical Comparison with ChIP-on-chip Data-To cross-validate our findings, we compared our results with publicly available data. In a recently published paper, genome-wide histone acetylation levels of H3 at Lys9 and Lys14 and methylation levels of H3 at Lys4 of wild type yeast in rich medium (YPD) were measured using ChIP-on-chip (33Pokholok D.K. Harbison C.T. Levine S. Cole M. Hannett N.M. Lee T.I. Bell G.W. Walker K. Rolfe P.A. Herbolsheimer E. Zeitlinger J. Lewitter F. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The average expression ratios of immunoprecipitated DNA to control DNA across experimental replicates were downloaded from the World Wide Web. After a log2 transformation of Lys9 and Lys14 acetylation level and Lys4 trimethylation level, a plot comparing the acetylation (Lys9 and Lys14) and methylation (Lys4) levels at 3,581 intergenic regions was obtained for subsequent analysis (34Yuan G.Z. Ma P. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 70Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Histone Extraction and Purification-Extraction of histones from yeast cells is widely known to be more problematic than from mammalian cells. Waterborg and colleagues (35Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have described a quick method for yeast histone preparation, but in our hands the yield is less than 50% of expected (data not shown). To address this limitation, we designed a simplified procedure that relies on the observation that yeast chromatin is not readily solubilized when the cell wall is intact. Thus, we used a mixture of nonionic detergents to deplete cells of the nonhistone proteins and then used conventional acid extraction in the presence of 8 m urea to prepare crude histone from the residual cell pellet. By using this method, more than 95% histone recovery histone was confirmed through Western blot analysis using an antibody to hyperacetylated H4 (data not shown). Oxidation of samples before RPLC separation helped to resolve each histone to a single chromatographic peak (Fig. 1A), with H3 giving two peaks later during the RPLC run (see below). The PTM profiles obtained from intact histones did not change appreciably upon repeated sampling, confirming that differentially modified forms of intact histones co-elute during reversed phase separation (35Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); this enables quantitative determination of PTM profiles using top down MS (25Boyne M.T. Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Siuti N. Roth M.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Pesavento J.J. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Thomas C.E. Kelleher N.L. Mizzen C.A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For WT and mutant cells described below, results are presented for intact profiles first, followed by site-specific PTM localization using MS/MS. Effects of Gcn5 Deletion on H4 Acetylation-To date, there have been inconsistent results when assessing the effect of Gcn5 on histone H4. By using antibodies specific for each acetylated site, Roth and co-workers (14Zhang W.Z. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of Gcn5 caused a diminution of acetylation at each of the four acetylation sites in H4. Other studies have shown that Gcn5 does not acetylate H4 in vivo and in vitro (9Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 13Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In order to clarify these issues, we compared H4 modification forms from wild type and gcn5Δ cells. To begin, we acquired high resolution, intact mass spectra of histone H4 (Fig. 1B). The H4 modification profile showed that the majority of H4 (>85%) is acetylated with di- and triacetylated forms as the dominant modification forms, which is consistent with a much larger fraction of the yeast genome actively being transcribed versus mammalian histone H4 (22Pesavento J.J. Kim Y.B. Taylor G.K. Kelleher N.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3386-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Gcn5 deletion results in very slight reduction in global H4 acetylation (Fig. 1, B versus D). This result is consistently reproducible (n = 5) and appears to be near the limit of the FTMS-based assay to reliably detect changes in PTM patterns. These results indicate that Gcn5 deletion has only a marginal effect on the global H4 acetylation pattern in vivo. To determine which lysine sites were acetylated, we performed ECD on each acetylation state (states 1-5) from WT and gcn5Δ cells. In WT cells, the 1 Ac form was N-terminally acetylated (data not shown). Modifications on the 2 Ac form were localized to the N terminus and Lys16. For the 3 Ac form, Lys12 was acetylated in addition to the initial two acetylations (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). The 4 Ac form was acetylated at Lys8 in addition to acetylation sites in the 3 Ac form (supplemental Fig. S1C). In the 5 Ac form, N terminus, Lys16, Lys12, Lys8, and Lys5 were all acetylated (data not shown). All acetylation forms were found to be pure species; no acetylation isomers were detected (28Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The directionality of acetylation is rigorously a C→/N-terminal zipper (i.e. Lys16 →/Lys12 →/Lys8 →/Lys5) in both WT and gcn5Δ cells. We conclude that Gcn5 deletion only slightly reduces the relative abundance of each acetylation form on H4 and does not affect residue specificity of acetylation. Gcn5 Deletion: Effect on H2A-There are two H2A gene products, H2A.1 and H2A.2, and one H2A.Z variant in yeast cells. H2A.1 and H2A.2 have exactly the same mass and the same protein sequence, apart from a C-terminal switch of an Ala-Thr in H2A.1 to a Thr-Ala in H2A.2. Combining the intact protein profile (Fig. 1C) and ECD data of each form reveals that the most abundant form is N-terminally acetylated, followed by the form with N-terminal and Lys7 acetylation. The form with three acetylations is present at very low abundance, and after digestion with Glu-C, the site was localized to Lys4 (data not shown). Most studies suggest that Gcn5 has no effect on H2A acetylation, but others have suggested that Gcn5 may have some role in H2A acetylation (9Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Our data show no detectable changes in the acetylation level of H2A upon Gcn5 disruption (Fig. 1, C versus E). H2A.Z was shown to be present in two adjacent nucleosomes in most yeast gene promoters (36Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), but H2A.Z levels are too low for detection by the MS approach employed here. However, Millar et al. have shown that Gcn5 affects acetylation on Lys14 of H2A.Z (37Millar C.B. Xu F. Zhang K.L. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). H2B from WT and gcn5Δ Cells-There are two H2B forms present in yeast, H2B.1 and H2B.2, with a mass difference of 15 Da. Previous studies revealed that 6 lysines can be acetylated on each gene product, with the specific HATs responsible for individual acetylations not yet all known. Using top down MS, up to five acetylations were observed on H2B.1 and H2B.2 (Fig. 2A). Due to the low abundance of the forms with six acetylations, they were not obvious in the “broadband” FT mass spectrum. However, after signal enhancement using selected ion accumulation, which increases the dynamic range by ∼50-fold (21Meng F.Y. Cargile B.J. Patrie S.M. Johnson J.R. McLoughlin S.M. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 2923-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 38Senko M.W. Canterbury J.D. Guan S. Marshall A.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1839-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), these species were detectable (data not shown). For both H2B.1 and H2B.2, monoacetylation was the most abundant form, and the abundance of other forms decreased with increasing acetylation. Using top down MS to monitor the relative abundance of all forms at once, a spectrum of H2B from gcn5Δ cells showed strikingly that all forms with >1 acetylation were undetectable (Fig. 2B) except for a minor amount of 2 Ac forms, even when selected ion accumulation was used (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that Lys6, Lys11, Lys16, Lys17, Lys21, Lys22, and the N terminus of H2B can be acetylated. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using electrons for ion dissociat"
https://openalex.org/W2090544616,"Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that plays an important role in limb development. Haploinsufficiency of Twist1 results in polydactyly via the inability of Twist1 to antagonistically regulate the related factor Hand2. The mechanism modulating Twist1-Hand2 antagonism is via phosphoregulation of conserved threonine and serine residues in helix I of the bHLH domain. Phosphoregulation alters the dimerization affinities for both proteins. Here we show that the expression of Twist1 and Twist1 phosphoregulation mutants results in distinct limb phenotypes in mice. In addition to dimer regulation, Twist1 phosphoregulation affects the DNA binding affinities of Twist1 in a partner-dependent and cis-element-dependent manner. In order to gain a better understanding of the specific Twist1 transcriptional complexes that function during limb morphogensis, we employ a series of Twist1-tethered dimers that include the known Twist1 partners, E12 and Hand2, as well as a tethered Twist1 homodimer. We show that these dimers behave in a manner similar to monomerically expressed bHLH factors and result in distinct limb phenotypes that correlate well with those observed from the limb expression of Twist1 and Twist1 phosphoregulation mutants. Taken together, this study shows that the Twist1 dimer affinity for a given partner can modulate the DNA binding affinity and that Twist1 dimer choice determines phenotypic outcome during limb development. Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that plays an important role in limb development. Haploinsufficiency of Twist1 results in polydactyly via the inability of Twist1 to antagonistically regulate the related factor Hand2. The mechanism modulating Twist1-Hand2 antagonism is via phosphoregulation of conserved threonine and serine residues in helix I of the bHLH domain. Phosphoregulation alters the dimerization affinities for both proteins. Here we show that the expression of Twist1 and Twist1 phosphoregulation mutants results in distinct limb phenotypes in mice. In addition to dimer regulation, Twist1 phosphoregulation affects the DNA binding affinities of Twist1 in a partner-dependent and cis-element-dependent manner. In order to gain a better understanding of the specific Twist1 transcriptional complexes that function during limb morphogensis, we employ a series of Twist1-tethered dimers that include the known Twist1 partners, E12 and Hand2, as well as a tethered Twist1 homodimer. We show that these dimers behave in a manner similar to monomerically expressed bHLH factors and result in distinct limb phenotypes that correlate well with those observed from the limb expression of Twist1 and Twist1 phosphoregulation mutants. Taken together, this study shows that the Twist1 dimer affinity for a given partner can modulate the DNA binding affinity and that Twist1 dimer choice determines phenotypic outcome during limb development.

Although bHLH/helix-loop-helix proteins can be organized into five groups, bHLH factors can be generally classified into two groups: the ubiquitously expressed E-proteins (class A) and the tissue-specific/restricted bHLH factors (class B) (for a review, see Ref. 4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The classic model for bHLH function is that a heterodimer containing a member from class A and a member from class B interacts via the amphipathic α-helices. This interaction juxtaposes the basic domains of both proteins, such that a DNA binding domain is formed that recognizes a DNA cis-element termed an E-box (CANNTG) (4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The requirement for class A/class B heterodimerization for many bHLH factors is well established, and in the case of the skeletal myogenic bHLH factors (MyoD1, Myogenin, Myf5, and Mrf4), heterodimerization is critical for proper biological function (4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 5Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Other class B factors, such as members of the Twist family of bHLH proteins, not only function as heterodimers with E-proteins but can also form homodimers and heterodimers with other class B bHLH proteins (1Firulli A.B.

Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Mol.

Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Altering the charge on these conserved residues affects the dimerization affinities that Twist family members have for their potential bHLH partners. In the case of Twist1, these partners include itself, E12/E47, and Hand2 (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat.

Our working hypothesis is that the phosphoregulation of Twist family members alters the dimerization affinities, allowing for new bHLH complexes to form within a cell, thus driving or changing the identity program of the cells (2Firulli B. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Mol.

Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this model involves dimer choice and access and/or ability of the dimer complex to bind DNA and thus regulate transcription. Support for this hypothesis can be seen in the autosomal dominant disease Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS). There are over 70 documented mutations within human TWIST1 that are associated with the causation of SCS (7Jabs E.W. Epstein C.J. Erickson R.P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Inborn Errors of Development. Oxford University Press, New York2004: 401-409Google Scholar). We recently showed that a subpopulation of these TWIST1 mutations disrupts the evolutionarily conserved consensus protein kinase A site, and consequently these mutations are poorly phosphorylated. Moreover, phosphorylation mutants of Twist1 affect the dimerization characteristics of Twist1 with itself, E-proteins, and the related co-expressed Hand2 (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Through both gain-of-function and loss-of-function analysis, we show that during limb development Twist1 and Hand2 function antagonistically; moreover, we show that a hypophosphorylation mutation in Twist1 that correlates to the phosphorylation state of Twist1 in patients with SCS cannot antagonize the actions of Hand2, supporting our idea that the bHLH dimer choice is a critical regulatory step in driving the phenotype of a cell (for a review, see Ref. 8Cai J. Jabs E.W. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The functional role of Twist1 in the developing limb is 2-fold. First, Twist1 maintains an Fgf8-Fgf10-FgfR2 autoregulatory signaling loop, which promotes the development of the apical ectodermal ridge, facilitating limb outgrowth (9O'Rourke M.P. Tam P.P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 401-413PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Twist1 also regulates the expression of Gli2 and Gli3, which are key positive and negative regulators of Shh (Sonic Hedgehog) activity. Shh activity defines anterior-posterior limb patterning via the zone of polarizing activity. Twist probably activates or maintains a graded pattern of Gli3 activity, which then suppresses Shh signaling within the anterior mesenchyme (9O'Rourke M.P. Tam P.P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 401-413PubMed Google Scholar). When the physiological ratio of Hand2/Twist1 expression is perturbed by either Twist1 haploinsufficiency or by Hand2 overexpression, shh expression is expanded. This results in polydactyly via the formation of an additional/expanded zone of polarizing activity in the anterior of the forming limb (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9O'Rourke M.P. Tam P.P. Int. J. Dev.

Biol. 2001; 45: 707-713PubMed Google Scholar). Hand2-induced expression of shh is also associated with a direct antagonistic relationship with the shh repressor Gli3 (13te Welscher P. Fernandez-Teran M. Ros M.A. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), suggesting that a precise transcriptional balance of both Twist1 and Hand2 is essential for both normal limb outgrowth and patterning. Also involved but not currently understood is the role that E-protein expression has on modulating Twist1 and Hand2 regulation of limb formation. In this study, we set out to investigate the consequences of Twist1 gain-of-function analysis using wild type and phosphoregulation mutants of Twist1 in the developing limb and explore the effects of Twist1 phosphoregulation on DNA binding affinities to a representative set of E-box cis-elements. We show that the expression of wild type Twist1, hypophosporylated Twist1 (Twist1T125;S127A), and phosphorylation mimic Twist1 (Twist1T125;S127D) indeed results in distinct phenotypes within the developing mouse limb, and, in addition to changes in dimerization affinity, altering the charge of helix I can affect DNA binding in a cis-element-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of tethered Twist1 dimers (Twist1-Twist1, Twist1-E12, and Twist1-Hand2), where the partner choice is dictated by expressing the dimer pair as a single polypeptide, show specific phenotypic effects on limb morphogenesis that correlate to those observed when expressing the monomeric wild type and phosphorylation mutant Twist1 proteins. Plasmids—Expression plasmids for Twist1, Twist1T125; S127A, and Twist1T125;S127D were described previously (2Firulli B. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1225-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tethered dimer constructs were generated by cloning cDNAs for wild type Twist1, Hand2, and E12 into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) modified to include a glycine-rich linker G(SGGG)3SGG that joins the two cDNAs (6Castanon I. Von Stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ cDNAs were PCR-amplified as HindIII-BamHI fragments with the stop codon removed to allow for translation of both cDNAs as a single protein. The 3′ cDNAs were PCR-amplified as KpnI-XbaI fragments. The glycine linker had HindIII and BamHI sites at the 5′ end and KpnI and XbaI sites at the 3′ end for cloning purposes. CATCTG E-box and CGTCTG D-box reporter constructs were previously described (14Knofler M. Meinhardt G. Bauer S. Loregger T. Vasicek R. Bloor D.J. Kimber S.J. Husslein P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The CATATG E-box reporter was made similarly by inserting three copies head-to-tail into the SacI and BglII sites of the luciferase vector pGL3P (Promega). Prx transgenic constructs were generated as follows. For all clones containing a Hand2 cDNA, an internal BglII site within the coding region was first mutated to destroy the site while maintaining the amino acid sequence (5′-GG AAG AAA GAG CTG AAT GAA ATC TTG AAA AGC ACA GTG AGC-3′) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. BglII sites were then added to the 5′ end of the clones and 3′ of the poly(A) signal via PCR. Sequences were verified to be free of PCR-generated mutations by sequence analysis of both strands. Verified inserts were then cloned into the BglII cloning site of the Prx promoter-containing construct. Orientation was determined by sequence analysis. Prx promoter sequence plus cDNA monomer or tethered inserts were liberated by SalI digestion and given to the IU transgenic core for gel purification and F0 production. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The various bHLH and tethered bHLH proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated using the Promega TNT system as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Three probes were used for electro-phoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA): a Hand E-box (5′-gga ttc cat tgc atc tgg att cca gag-3′), a degenerate E-box sequence shown to bind Hand1 and Hand2 termed a D-box (5′-cat tgc att ggc gtc tgg cat tgc att-3′) (14Knofler M.

Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded sense probes were 5′ end-labeled and then annealed to cold antisense to generate double-stranded DNA. EMSAs were performed as described using a binding buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 12% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (15Firulli B.A. Hadzic D.B. McDaid J.R. Firulli A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33567-33573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Competitors used in the assay are the unlabeled oligonucleotides used for probes as specific competitors and oligonucleotides with the sequences in italic type substituted for the binding target sequences (5′-gga ttc cat tgt gct acg att cca gag-3′;5′-cat tgc att ggg cag agg cat tgc att-3′;5′-gat ccc tcg tga ttg ttg aa-3′) as nonspecific competitors. EMSA experiments were repeated five times using new programmed lysates, in which protein expression was verified via immunoblotting prior to EMSA analysis. Individual experiments employed a single batch of programmed lysates for each probe, and the EMSA reactions and gels were run on the same day. Immunoblotting—In vitro programmed reticulocyte lysates were collected, and 5 μl of lysates were run through 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted, and incubated with the indicated antibody as described (2Firulli B. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1225-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using the Super Signal luminescent detection protocol (Pierce). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were plated and transfected as described (16Firulli B.A. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with the indicated constructs using a CaPO4 procedure. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were read using a 96-well microtiter plate luminometer (Forma). Data represent six independent experiments, and error bars denote S.E. Generation and Analysis of Transgenic Animals—Transgenic DNA was purified using resin columns (Qiagen), digested, and given to the IU transgenic facility for gel purification and microinjection into mice. Southern blotting of yolk sac DNA identified E17.5 F0 animals carrying the transgenes of interest. Skeletal preparations were performed exactly as described (17Dickman E.D. Rogers R. Conway S.J. Anat. Rec. 1999; 255: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Is Altered in Twist1 Helix I Phosphoregulation Mutants—As shown in Fig. 1A, Thr125 and Ser127 are positioned at the boundary between the basic DNA-binding domain and helix I of the bHLH. Our earlier findings show that the alteration of charge at Thr125 and Ser127 results in changes of the dimerization affinities between Twist1 and its bHLH partners, but in no case have we shown that these alterations result in the complete loss of Twist1 dimerization with another bHLH partner (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Considering this, we sought to determine if DNA-binding was also affected in Twist1 phosphoregulation mutants. We thus performed EMSAs using in vitro transcribed and translated Twist1, Twist1T125; S127A, and Twist1T125;S127D alone and co-translated with E12 from cytomegalovirus-driven expression vectors containing an SP6 promoter sequence for in vitro transcription and translation. To control for input protein, all proteins were tagged with the Myc epitope and were in vitro transcribed and translated. Immunoblot analysis of the input protein shows that equivalent amounts of the protein were added to all binding reactions using each DNA probe; thus, differences in the intensity of the shifted probe reflect differences in the DNA binding affinity (Fig. 1B). We first looked at DNA binding to an CATCTG E-box core, which binds the related Hand factors (18Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 19Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). No DNA binding was observed from the reticulocyte lysates programmed to express Twist1, Twist1T125;S127A, or Twist1T125; S127D, indicating that the homodimers were not binding at detectable levels (Fig. 1C). Twist1 homodimer formation has been demonstrated previously (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and is discussed below. In contrast, lysates programmed to express E12 showed a strong probe shift, indicating that E12 homodimers can bind the Hand E-box. Lysates programmed to express both Twist1 and E12 also showed a smaller DNA mobility shift than that of the E12 homodimer, which was not competed away by the addition of excess nonspecific (NS) competitor but was competed by excess unlabeled competitor (SC) (Fig. 1C). When Twist1 was replaced with Twist1T125;S127A and co-translated with E12, a similar complex was able to form; however, the amount of shifted probe was significantly less, indicating that DNA binding affinity was diminished. Of note, we did not observe any E12 homodimer-shifted probe based on the migration pattern of the mobility shifts, indicating that the majority of the stable dimer complexes formed were indeed Twist1T125;S127A-E12 heterodimers. Conversely, lysates programmed with Twist1T125;S127D and E12 failed to shift this Hand E-box at any detectable level under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1C). What we did observe is a higher mobility shift that, based on its migration pattern, corresponds to an E12 homodimer and was not competed by NS but was competed by SC. Given this observation and previous FRET analysis (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we feel that both homodimer and heterodimer complexes are able to form under these conditions and that the E12 homodimer has a stronger DNA binding affinity and/or is more stable and therefore competes out the binding of Twist1T125;S127D and E12 for the Hand E-box (Fig. 1C). The next probe that we employed in our analysis was a degenerate E-box that has been termed a D-box and contains a CG in place of the CA of the CANNTG motif, which can be transactivated by Hand1 in trophoblasts (14Knofler M. Meinhardt G. Bauer S. Loregger T. Vasicek R. Bloor D.J. Kimber S.J. Husslein P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). EMSA analysis showed no homodimer DNA binding of singly translated Twist1 or helix I mutant proteins; however, we were surprised to observe that E12 homodimers shifted this degenerate sequence weakly (Fig. 1D). Lysates programmed with both Twist1 wild type and E12 proteins also shifted the D-box sequence, resulting in a protein-DNA complex that migrates at a slightly faster mobility than the E12 homodimer (Fig. 1D). The observation that Twist1 can bind this degenerate sequence known to bind Hand factors is reasonable, given the evolutionary conservation within the Twist family of factors. We were surprised to observe that lysates programmed with both Twist1T125;S127A and E12 were able to shift the D-box probe as efficiently as that of Twist1 wild type + E12. This suggests that hypophosphorylation of Twist1 does not affect DNA binding to this specific cis-element. Similar to what we observed using the Hand E-box probe, lysates programmed with Twist1T125;S127D and E12 failed to show any significant DNA binding to the D-box probe. Finally, we tested a CATATG E-box sequence that was previously identified as binding Drosophila Twist both as a homo- and heterodimer (6Castanon I. Von Stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Drosophila Twist has been shown to bind this sequence as a homodimer (6Castanon I. Von Stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lysates programmed for mouse Twist1 and Twist1 helix I mutants failed to show any observable homodimer DNA/protein mobility shifts using this single cis-element as an EMSA probe (Fig. 1E). Similar to what we observed using the D-box, lysates programmed with E12 shifted this E-box weakly. Once again, lysates programmed with both Twist1 and E12 shifted the probe strongly (Fig. 1E); in contrast, neither the hypophosphorylation nor phosphorylation mimic of Twist1 shifted this probe when cotranslated with E12. Of note, translated Hand2 as well as Hand2 co-translated Twist1 failed to shift any of the employed cis-elements; however, Hand2 co-translated with E12 shifted all three cis-elements (data not shown; see Fig. 2). Together, these data show that in addition to alterations in dimerization affinities, Twist1 phosphoregulation can influence DNA binding in a cis-element-dependent manner. In addition to DNA binding, we employed luciferase analysis using a luciferase reporter driven by three copies of the above mentioned cis-elements to determine if transcriptional activity in vitro is affected (Fig. 2A). Transactivation of the CATCTG E-box showed that Twist1 increases luciferase activity ∼3-fold, whereas Twist1 T125;S127A and T125;S127D showed diminished transactivation. Transactivation of the CATCTG E-box with E12 alone showed a 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). Consistent with EMSA results, co-expression of Twist1 + E12 resulted in a 6-7-fold increase in luciferase activity. Twist1T125;S127A, which can bind to this sequence when co-expressed with E12 in EMSA (albeit with less affinity than wild type Twist1), transactivated less efficiently than wild type (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of Twist1T125;S127D + E12 showed levels of transactivation that were nearly identical to that observed when Twist1T125;S127D was expressed alone (Figs. 1C and 2). Expression of Hand2 alone and when coexpressed with E12 also showed activation of the multimerized cis-element-driven reporter. Transactivation of the CGTCTG D-box shows Twist1 increased luciferase activity 2.5-fold. Although the alanine point mutant showed similar transactivation, the aspartic acid mutant exhibited less transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B). When coexpressed with E12, there was no difference in transcriptional activity between Twist1 + E12 and Twist1T125;S127A + E12, consistent with the equivalent DNA binding affinities shown previously (Figs. 1D and 2B). Co-expression of Twist1T125;S127D + E12 did not enhance the transactivation of the D-box, reflecting the observed poor DNA binding in the EMSA analysis (Figs. 1D and 2B). Although Hand2 DNA binding was not detectable on the single D-box cis-element, significant activity was observed when Hand2 was expressed with the multimerized D-box reporter. This transcriptional activation was further increased when Hand2 was coexpressed with E12, correlating with its ability to bind the single D-box probe in EMSA (data not shown). Transactivation of the Drosophila Twist CATATG E-box was the weakest of the tested cis-elements; nevertheless, the luciferase activity correlates with the observed DNA binding (Fig. 2C). Expression of the Twist1 and the Twist1 phosphorylation mutants resulted in 1.5-fold or less transactivation, which is not considered significant. Similar findings were observed when expressing Hand2. Although Twist1 + E12 showed a modest 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity, neither of the Twist1 phosphorylation mutants resulted in any significant transactivation, directly correlating with the observed DNA binding with this cis-element in our EMSA analysis (Figs. 1E and 2C). Hand2 expressed with E12 exhibited the strongest transactivation of this reporter construct (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data show that alterations in the charge on helix I can affect both dimerization affinities (3Firulli B.A. Krawchuk D. Centonze V.E. Virshup D.E. Conway S.J. Cserjesi P. Laufer E. Firulli A.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and DNA binding affinities for Twist1 in a cis-element-dependent manner. These differences are reflected by the transcriptional activation of these cis-elements in tissue culture. Given that Drosophila Twist has been shown to bind as a homodimer (6Castanon I. Von Stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development. 2001; 128: 3145-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and our observed transcriptional activity shown above with Twist1 (Fig. 2), we were puzzled as to why the homodimers were not binding in our EMSA analysis. It was pointed out in review that the transcriptional assays were performed on multimerized cis-elements, whereas the EMSA analysis employed a single copy of the cis-element. Therefore, we repeated our EMSA analysis employing the same multimerized cis-element sequences used in the transcriptional assays. To our surprise, the EMSA analysis performed using the multimerized E-boxes increased DNA binding affinities, revealing homodimer binding (Fig. 2D). The use of the (CATATG)3 probe showed that Hand2 and Twist1 can each specifically bind as homodimer complexes that are faster in mobility then Hand2 + E12, which was used as a control. Interestingly, neither of the Twist1 helix I point mut"

Although they share little sequence homology, proteins implicated in polyQ disorders have common properties beyond their characteristic polyQ tract. These include the production of proteolytic fragments, nuclear accumulation, and processing by caspases. Here we report that ataxin-7 is cleaved by caspase-7, and we map two putative caspase-7 cleavage sites to Asp residues at positions 266 and 344 of the ataxin-7 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of these two caspase-7 cleavage sites in the polyQ-expanded form of ataxin-7 produces an ataxin-7 D266N/D344N protein that is resistant to caspase cleavage. Although ataxin-7 displays toxicity, forms nuclear aggregates, and represses transcription in human embryonic kidney 293T cells in a polyQ length-dependent manner, expression of the non-cleavable D266N/D344N form of polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 attenuated cell death, aggregate formation, and transcriptional interference. Expression of the caspase-7 truncation product of ataxin-7-69Q or -92Q, which removes the putative nuclear export signal and nuclear localization signals of ataxin-7, showed increased cellular toxicity. We also detected N-terminal polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 cleavage products in SCA7 transgenic mice similar in size to those generated by caspase-7 cleavage. In a SCA7 transgenic mouse model, recruitment of caspase-7 into the nucleus by polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 correlated with its activation. Our results, thus, suggest that proteolytic processing of ataxin-7 by caspase-7 may contribute to SCA7 disease pathogenesis.

Particularly of note is that the selective retinal dysfunction can be correlated with transcriptional dysregulation via an abnormal interaction of the polyQ-expanded form of ataxin-7 with the cone-rod homeobox protein (Crx) (25Chen S.

Although polyQ diseases have similar characteristics and pathogenicity aside from their polyQ tract, their proteins share little discernable sequence or functional homology. However, several clues suggest that shared pathways of toxicity exist. First, the diseases all have a highly cell-specific neurodegenerative phenotype despite widespread expression of the proteins. Second, cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions are present in all of these diseases (34Ross C.A.

Fourth, many bio-chemical studies have shown that the gene products of Huntington disease (huntingtin), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (androgen receptor), SCA2 (ataxin-2), SCA3 (ataxin-3), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (atrophin-1) are proteolytically cleaved in vivo and are substrates for the cell death proteases (44Hackam A.S.

The significance of this may lie in the associated observation that caspase cleavage of at least four of these gene products (androgen receptor, ataxin-3, atrophin-1, and huntingtin) is a critical event in polyQ protein-mediated apoptosis, the formation of inclusions, and disease pathogenesis (13Ellerby L.M.

Immuno-reactivity to neo-epitope antibodies reactive to the caspase-mediated huntingtin cleavage products ending at amino acid 552 were abundant in cortical projection neurons in a presymptomatic individual as well as in an early neuropathological grade (Vonsattel grade I) where gross neurodegeneration is not yet observed and in yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice (47Wellington C.L.

Current data suggest a pathway whereby polyQ-containing proteins are cleaved by caspases and possibly other proteases to generate cytotoxic fragments. In many polyQ diseases, these fragments are hypothesized to exert their toxic effect in the nucleus, leading to intranuclear inclusions; whether these inclusions are directly toxic or represent an ameliorating or sequestering response by cells is uncertain. Other evidence suggests a feedback role for polyQ proteins not only as caspase substrates but as effectors or amplifiers of caspase- and non-caspase-mediated apoptotic death (13Ellerby L.M.

Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and COS-7 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections of 293T cells were performed using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 293T cells according to manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by scraping and centrifugation at 500 × g. Plasmids—Ataxin-7 constructs are shown in Fig. 1B and were cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), or pSecTagA (Invitrogen) vectors. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenesis was performed using PCR primers D266N, 5′-ggagctttccagaatctgttccaggccgtgcgcgaagtgatccag-3′, and D344N, 5′-agagagtttgatcctaacatccactgtggggtt-3′. Primers were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA). All constructs utilized for our studies were sequenced. Western Blot Analysis—Ataxin-7 was extracted with Nonidet P-40 or modified radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40). Cells from a 10-cm dish were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor Minicomplete (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. Alternatively, ataxin-7 was extracted in modified radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved on Nupage Bis/Tris 10% precast gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 300 mA. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and probed with primary polyclonal antibodies to ataxin-7, antibody A (RAADDVRGEPC), corresponding amino acids in the N terminus (1:1000) or polyclonal antibody K (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature or 18 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, monoclonal 1C2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used to the polyQ tract of ataxin-7 (1:2000) or polyclonal ataxin-7 (1:1000, Affinity BioReagents, PA1-749). Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:3000, Amersham Biosciences) was applied for 45 min at room temperature, and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cells were transiently transfected in 6-well dishes and treated with tamoxifen (35 μm, 4 h) to induce cell death. After 48 h cells were harvested by scraping and centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. Cells were lysed (Apoalert kit lysis buffer, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for 10 min, and the membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min. Lysate containing 60 μg of total protein in a final volume of 20 μl was added to 100 μl of caspase reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm DTT) and 100 μm DEVD-aminofluoromethylcoumarin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) in a 96-well dish. Reactions were followed using a Gemini SpectraMax fluorimeter plate reader using 400/505-nm excitation/emission wavelengths and SoftMAxPro analysis software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The activity level of caspase-3 was taken from the linear portion of the reaction curve. To verify consistent expression levels, 20 μg of lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% Bis/Tris precast gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed using the ataxin-7 antibody K or Affinity BioReagents polyclonal ataxin-7 antibody (PA1-749; 1:500). Alternatively, 293T cells were transiently transfected to 8-well poly-D lysine- or collagen-coated slides (BD Biosciences). Cells were counter-stained with Hoechst dye, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and coverslipped. Cell death was quantified by counting transfected cells and taking the percentage of dead cells per 200 transfected cells. Cell death was noted by nuclear fragmentation and condensation seen with the Hoechst stain. Student's t tests were performed. Subcellular Fractionation—293T or COS-7 cells were transiently transfected and harvested at 48 h by scraping, and subcellular fractionation was performed using the NE-PER kit (Pierce). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionations were verified by immunoblotting with anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody (1:2500, Biomol) and monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (1:500, Sigma). Coimmunoprecipitation—293T cells were transiently transfected with ataxin-7 constructs and FLAG-tagged caspase-7, harvested at 48 h, and fractionated. Each lysate was pre-cleared with mouse IgG-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 25 μl ANTI-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Proteins bound to the FLAG beads were washed 5 times (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) eluted with NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and resolved using 10% Bis/Tris precast gels (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed, and blots were probed with ataxin-7 antibody K (1:500), polyclonal anti-caspase-7 9492 antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (1:500, Sigma). In Vitro Translation and Caspase Cleavage—Ataxin-7 constructs were in vitro translated using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions in the presence of [35S] Methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 5 μl of in vitro translated reaction was incubated with caspases (gift from the laboratory of Guy Salvesen) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were resolved using 10% Bis/Tris precast gels (Invitrogen). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Confocal and Fluorescence Microscopy—293T and COS-7 cells transfected with ataxin-7 constructs were mounted on poly d-lysine- or collagen-coated slides (BD Biosciences), fixed, and coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The slides were then visualized by confocal microscopy using a Nikon PCM-2000 laser confocal scanning microscope. Primary rat cerebellar granule neurons were transfected, fixed, and mounted. The cells were stained using ataxin-7 antibody “A” (1:100) and anti-β-tubulin (1:100, Sigma). The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. Images were taken with an Optronics digital camera and MagnaFire Software (Optronics MagnaFire, Goleta, CA). Polyclonal activated anti-caspase-7 (9491S) from Cell Signaling (1:100) and polyclonal anti-ataxin-7 antibody K (1:500) were used for staining paraffin-embedded retinal transgenic tissue. Nucleofection of Primary Cerebellar Cultures—Primary cerebellar cultures were prepared from 6-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as previously described (51Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M.

Briefly, cerebella from 6-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were digested with 0.25% trypsin (Cell Grow). After neutralization with 10% serum, cells were triturated and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer. After washing the cells 3 times with the same media, the cells were resusp"
https://openalex.org/W2028517598,"Therapy resistance represents a major problem for disease management in oncology. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown to modulate the cell cycle, to induce apoptosis and to sensitize cancer cells for other chemotherapeutics. Our study shows that the HDACi valproic acid (VPA) and the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects of each other towards several cancer cell lines. This correlates with the HU-induced degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) p21 and p27, mediated by the proteasome or caspase-3. Moreover, we found that caspase-3 activation is required for VPA-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, p21 and p27 can confer resistance against VPA and HU. Both CDKI interact with caspase-3 and compete with other caspase-3 substrates. Hence, p21 and p27 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance as apoptosis inhibitors. Since the biological effects of VPA and HU could be achieved at concentrations used in current treatment protocols, the combined application of these compounds might be considered as a potential strategy for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2075107349,"Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors (ITIs) are protease inhibitors stabilizing the extracellular matrix. ITIs consist of one light (bikunin) and two heavy chains (ITIHs). We have recently characterized ITIH5, a novel member of the ITIH gene family, and showed that its messenger RNA is lost in a high proportion of breast tumours. In the present study, an ITIH5-specific polyclonal antibody was generated, validated with western blot and used for immunohistochemical analysis on a tissue microarray; ITIH5 was strongly expressed in epithelial cells of normal breast (n=11/15), while it was lost or strongly reduced in 42% (92/217) of invasive breast cancers. ITIH5 expression in invasive carcinomas was associated with positive expression of oestrogen receptor (P=0.008) and histological grade (P=0.024). Correlation of ITIH5 expression with clinical outcome revealed that patients with primary tumours retaining abundant ITIH5 expression had longer recurrence-free survival (RFS; P=0.037) and overall survival (OS; P=0.044), compared to those with reduced expression (mean RFS: 102 vs 78 months; mean OS: 120 vs 105 months). Methylation-specific PCR analysis frequently showed strong methylation of the ITIH5 promoter in primary breast tumours (41%, n=109) and breast cancer cell lines (n=6). Methylation was significantly associated with mRNA loss (P<0.001; n=39), and ITIH5 expression was induced after treatment of tumour cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, ITIH5 promoter methylation was significantly associated with reduced OS (P=0.008). The cellular function of ITIH5 was evaluated by forced expression of a full-length ITIH5 complementary DNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which does not endogenously express ITIH5. ITIH5-expressing clones showed a 40% reduced proliferation rate compared to mock-transfected cells. Overall, these data show that promoter methylation-mediated loss of ITIH5 expression is associated with unfavourable outcome in breast cancer patients, and thus ITIH5 could be used as a prognostic marker, although this marker is not multivariate independent due to its close association with ER expression. Our data indicate that ITIH5 is a candidate class II tumour suppressor gene and could be involved in tumour progression, invasion and metastasis, as its absence is associated with increased proliferation rates and a prognostic value indicating poor clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1989674463,"c-Jun and c-Fos are major components of the transcriptional complex AP-1. Here, we investigate the nuclear import pathway(s) of the transcription factor c-Jun. c-Jun bound specifically to the nuclear import receptors importin beta, transportin, importin 5, importin 7, importin 9, and importin 13. In digitonin-permeabilized cells, importin beta, transportin, importin 7, and importin 9 promoted efficient import of c-Jun into the nucleus. Importin alpha, by contrast, inhibited nuclear import of c-Jun in vitro. A single basic region preceding the leucine zipper of c-Jun functions as a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and was required for interaction with all tested import receptors. In vivo, nuclear import of a c-Jun reporter protein lacking the leucine zipper strictly depended on this NLS. In a leucine zipper-dependent manner, c-Jun with mutations in its NLS was still imported into the nucleus in a complex with endogenous leucine zipper proteins or, for example, with cotransfected c-Fos. Together, these results explain the highly efficient nuclear import of the transcription factor c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W2020404456,"Highly pathogenic strains of Bacillus sphaericus produce the mosquitocidal Bin proteins, but resistance to this toxin can be produced under laboratory and field conditions. Analysis of strains able to overcome this resistance revealed the presence of a previously undescribed type of two-component toxin. One subunit, Cry48Aa1, is related to the 3-domain crystal toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis. Uniquely for this type of protein, insect toxicity is only achieved in the presence of a second, accessory protein, Cry49Aa1. This protein is itself related to both the binary toxin of B. sphaericus and to Cry35 and Cry36 of B. thuringiensis, none of which require interaction with Cry48Aa1-like proteins for their activity. The necessity for both Cry48Aa1 and Cry49Aa1 components for pathogenicity, therefore, indicates an unprecedented interaction to generate toxicity. Despite high potency for purified Cry48Aa1/Cry49Aa1 proteins (LC50 for third instar Culex quinquefasciatus larvae: 15.9 ng/ml and 6.3 ng/ml respectively), bacteria producing them show suboptimal mosquitocidal activity due to low-level Cry48Aa1 production. This new toxin combination may indicate a fortuitous combination of members of the gene families that encode 3-domain Cry toxins and Binary-like toxins, permitting the ""mix-and-match"" evolution of a new component in the mosquitocidal armoury."

To understand the overall kinetic processes operating in CYP3A4, we documented the kinetics of autoxidation of the oxy-ferrous intermediate of CYP3A4 as a function of testosterone concentration. The rate of autoxidation in the presence of testosterone was significantly lower than that observed with no substrate present. Stability of the oxy-ferrous complex in CYP3A4 and the amplitude of the geminate CO rebinding increased significantly as a result of binding of just one testosterone molecule. In contrast, the slow phase in the kinetics of cyanide binding to the ferric CYP3A4 correlated with a shift of the heme iron spin state, which is only caused by the association of a second molecule of testosterone. Our results show that the first substrate binding event prevents the escape of diatomic ligands from the distal heme binding pocket, stabilizes the oxy-ferrous complex, and thus serves as an important modulator of the uncoupling channel in the cytochromes P450.

Most cytochromes P450 operate via a catalytic cycle wherein atmospheric dioxygen is ligated to the ferrous heme of the P450 protein and is reduced through electron input from pyridine nucleotide oxidation as provided by an associated electron transfer chain. In the case of CYP3A4 this is an 80-kDa reductase molecule containing both FAD and FMN prosthetic groups. A central intermediate in this reaction cycle is the ferrous-dioxygen adduct generated through ferric-ferrous reduction of the heme center and dioxygen binding. This intermediate, the “oxy complex” can either decay via release of superoxide and regeneration of the ferric heme (3Sligar S. Lipscomb J. Debrunner P. Gunsalus I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The former autoxidation pathway represents the first branching point between productive and unproductive pathways in P450 catalysis wherein reducing equivalents leak into the production of unwanted reduced oxygen species (4Oprian D.D.

We have shown that the autoxidation rate of the substrate-free CYP3A4 is extremely rapid, notably much faster than the steady-state NADPH consumption rates that are measured under the same turnover conditions (14Denisov I.G.

Saturation with various substrates was found to reduce the rate of autoxidation by almost 2 orders of magnitude, thus inhibiting the unproductive decomposition of the oxy-ferrous intermediate and production of reduced oxygen species. This work provided important information in terms of the overall efficiency of redox equivalent consumption or coupling ratio determined as the ratio of the steady-state rates of product formation and NADPH consumption. Analysis of the functional properties of the stoichiometric complex of CYP3A4 with the cytochrome P450 reductase in these steady-state experiments of testosterone hydroxylation revealed the distinct fractional contributions of CYP3A4 with different numbers of testosterone molecules bound to metabolism and all uncoupling pathways (15Denisov I.G. Baas B.J. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7066-7076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In particular, the rates of NADPH consumption and product formation were shown to be very different for the CYP3A4 with one and two testosterone (TS) molecules bound. The rapid rate of autoxidation of the ferrous-oxy complex suggested that this pathway was a predominate means for uncoupling in this human hepatic enzyme. To better understand the mechanism of the allosteric regulation of CYP3A4 catalysis and the significance of simultaneous binding of multiple substrate molecules, we studied the autoxidation of CYP3A4 as a function of substrate concentration. This allowed determination of the fundamental one-electron autoxidation rate for each of the functional states of the enzyme with one, two, and three molecules of substrate bound. These results demonstrate that although the state with a single testosterone bound is not able to effectively catalyze substrate hydroxylation it is responsible for a dramatic slowing of the one-electron autoxidation rate, thus improving the overall coupling of pyridine nucleotide reducing equivalents. This suggests that the first substrate binding event induces a critical conformational change in the protein that stabilizes the ferrous-oxy complex and could block a superoxide exit pathway from the heme center. To explore the possibility of a steric block to ligand egress, we also measured the amplitude of CO geminate rebinding from the carbonmonoxy-ferrous complex in CYP3A4, which is a measure of ligand escape after photolysis, as well as the kinetics of cyanide binding to ferric CYP3A4. These experiments provide additional information on the role of the first and second substrate molecules in the modulation of diatomic ligand interactions with the heme iron and provide a consistent picture for the role of substrate binding in the efficient channeling of reducing equivalents to monooxygenation chemistry versus unproductive autoxidation.

Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The result of this self-assembly reaction is a monomer of CYP3A4 contained in a discoidal POPC bilayer ∼10 nm in diameter stabilized by the encircling amphipathic membrane scaffold protein belt. CYP3A4 Nanodiscs were prepared in substrate-free form and kept at 4 °C. Substrate Binding—Formation and decay of the oxy-ferrous complex, geminate rebinding of carbon monoxide, and binding of cyanide was studied with CYP3A4 in the presence of different testosterone concentrations as well as in the substrate-free form. Testosterone was added using stock solutions in methanol with the final concentration of methanol always less than 1%. Spectral titration data were analyzed using the Hill equation F = A·Sn/(SDn + Sn) where A is the spectroscopic amplitude, S is the substrate concentration, and SD is the spectral dissociation constant. For autoxidation and geminate rebinding experiments solutions of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs were deoxygenated under the flow of argon gas and reduced by addition of a small excess of anaerobically prepared dithionite solution with the known concentration determined using a molar absorption coefficient of ϵ315 = 8.05 mm–1 cm–1 (25McKenna C.E. Gutheil W.G. Song W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1075: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Experiments—All kinetic experiments utilized an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer using typical mixing volumes of 150 μl in each syringe with a dead time of 1.5 ms at the temperature 6 °C. For autoxidation studies, anaerobic solutions of reduced CYP3A4 Nanodiscs (with or without substrate) in one syringe were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with buffer saturated with pure oxygen gas containing the same concentration of substrate if present. The resulting high oxygen concentration (∼690 μm after mixing) was chosen to accelerate formation of the oxy complex. Kinetics of cyanide binding was studied by mixing the solution of ferric CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs with a solution of KCN (final concentration after mixing, 20 mm) with the same concentrations of testosterone present in both syringes. A high concentration of KCN was chosen based on the results of equilibrium titration experiments to ensure the pseudo-first order binding. In each kinetic experiment from 400 to 800 spectra were collected on a logarithmic time scale for the slow reactions (total collection time, 50 s) or a linear time scale for faster processes (collection time, up to 2.3 s). Data Analysis—The data on autoxidation kinetics were analyzed according to the following reaction scheme. Fe2++O2→k1Fe2+O2→k2Fe3++O2·¯SCHEME 1 Here Fe2+ and Fe3+ denote the reduced (ferrous) and oxidized (ferric) state of CYP3A4 heme iron, respectively; k1 is the apparent pseudo-first order rate constant of oxygen binding to ferrous cytochrome P450; and k2 is the rate constant for autoxidation, i.e. formation of ferric CYP3A4 and release of superoxide. Spectra collected in each kinetic experiment were arranged into a matrix with each column vector representing the spectra and rows representing the absorption at each wavelength as a function of time. The number of independent spectrally distinguishable components and their time-dependent concentrations were determined using singular value decomposition (26Henry E.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 652-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The data analysis for substrate-free and substrate-saturated CYP3A4 was accomplished as described previously (14Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For intermediate concentrations of TS the method was modified due to the presence of two spectral components originating from the high spin and low spin fractions of the final oxidized CYP3A4. Because of this, two spectral processes were observed simultaneously, namely the transition of the oxy-ferrous CYP3A4 to the high spin CYP3A4 and the same oxy-ferrous CYP3A4 to the low spin CYP3A4, each with the characteristic difference spectrum and total amplitude corresponding to the fractions of high spin and low spin states under experimental conditions and at the given TS concentration. After fast formation within 10–20 ms, the oxy-ferrous CYP3A4 in the presence of intermediate TS concentrations autoxidized through a biphasic process with the typical apparent first-order rates of ∼20 and ∼0.5 s–1. In most cases the slower phase could be better represented as a biexponential decay. Because of the large difference between the rates of the fast and slow phases, these two processes could be analyzed separately with the goal to minimize the number of fitted parameters and improve the precision. Calculations of the total fraction of CYP3A4 autoxidized at each kinetic phase was done based on the absolute difference spectra obtained by subtraction of the spectra of pure low spin and high spin CYP3A4 from the corresponding spectra of oxy-ferrous CYP3A4 in the absence of substrate and in the presence of 200 μm TS (14Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Amplitudes of fast and slow phases of cyanide binding to CYP3A4 at different TS concentrations were analyzed in a similar way using molar absorption spectra of substrate-free, substrate-bound, and cyanide-bound CYP3A4 measured under the same conditions. For the analysis of the fast phase with the rate 200 s–1, the first 16 spectra collected at 2–24 ms were used to calculate the fraction of CYP3A4 that binds cyanide within this time frame. The slow phase amplitude was obtained from the spectra collected between 25 ms and 6 s. The total concentration of CYP3A4 was measured from the end point of each run using the known spectrum of cyanide complex of CYP3A4. The fraction of the slow phase was determined as the ratio of the total amplitude of the slow phase and the total CYP3A4 concentration. Carbon Monoxide Photolysis and Rebinding—Flash photolysis of the CO-bound form of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs was accomplished using the system described previously (27McLean M.A. Yeom H. Sligar S.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the indicated modifications. Photolysis was initiated by a 200-mJ pulse of 532 nm light from a tripled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (Spectra Physics model GCR 150). The probe beam was from a Cermax 500-watt xenon light source (ILC Technologies) that was heat-filtered. For these experiments a monochromator was placed in front of the sample to produce a monochromatic probe light source at the probe wavelength indicated in the text. A second monochromator between the sample and the photomultiplier tube reduced the noise due to scattered laser light. Signals from the Oriel model 77341 photomultiplier were amplified using a Stanford Research Systems SR445 fast preamplifier (300-MHz bandwidth) and digitized using a LeCroy model 9350 oscilloscope (1 gigasample/s). Signals were continuously averaged at a flash repetition rate of 0.5 Hz until an acceptable signal to noise was obtained, usually 60–75 transients. Samples of 1–2 μm ferrous CYP3A4 were prepared in 0.8 ml of deoxygenated buffer containing 200 μm sodium dithionite. The ferrous-CO complex was generated by the addition of 0.1 ml of CO-saturated buffer. Testosterone was added from stock solutions made in methanol. Absorbance values were typically measured at 450 nm and normalized to the expected change in absorbance obtained from the CO difference spectra from an individually run ferrous-CO minus ferrous CYP3A4 spectrum. The normalization results in a plot of fraction dissociated versus time. Samples were maintained at 6 °C for all experiments, and the observed transients were fit to a sum of two exponentials. The resultant geminate yields were obtained from the value of the fit at times >4 μs. The dependence of geminate yield on substrate concentration was fit to the following quadratic equation (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 72-74Google Scholar). Y=Y0+(Ymax-Y0)×(b-b2-4EtSt)2Et(Eq. 1) where b=(St+Et+Kd)(Eq. 2) and we assume the following. ESEt=Y-Y0Ymax-Y0(Eq. 3) Here Y is geminate yield, Y0 is geminate yield of substrate-free CYP3A4, Ymax is the geminate yield of substrate saturated enzyme, ES is concentration of enzyme substrate complex, Et is the total enzyme concentration, and St is the total substrate concentration. Testosterone Binding—Testosterone binding to CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs was monitored at a temperature of 279 K (6 °C) using absorption spectroscopy (300–700 nm). The resulting optical spectra of CYP3A4 in the presence of different testosterone concentrations are shown in Fig. 1 and indicate the gradual shift of the heme iron spin state from predominantly low spin in the absence of the substrate to ∼90% high spin at the highest TS concentration, 270 μm. Analysis of the fraction of the spin shift as a function of TS concentration using the Hill equation returned a spectral dissociation constant of SD = 56 μm and a Hill coefficient of n = 1.9 consistent with earlier reported data (18Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The high apparent cooperativity of the spin shift is manifested through the relatively minor spectral changes initiated by the first TS binding event while exhibiting an almost complete spin shift following binding of the second TS molecule as was discussed previously (15Denisov I.G. Baas B.J. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7066-7076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Autoxidation Rates—Our previous results (14Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) indicate that the rate of autoxidation of CYP3A4 strongly depends on the presence of substrates. For substrate-free CYP3A4 the autoxidation is very fast with an apparent first order rate of ∼20 s–1 at 278 K. At a near saturating concentration of testosterone, the autoxidation rate is slowed to ∼0.37 s–1, i.e. ∼50 times lower (14Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To better understand the substrate-dependent stability of the oxy-ferrous intermediate in the CYP3A4 catalytic cycle we measured the autoxidation rate at different TS concentrations at low temperatures. Rapid mixing of an anaerobic solution of the reduced CYP3A4 Nanodiscs with oxygen-saturated buffer with identical concentrations of TS present in both syringes resulted in fast (within several milliseconds) formation of oxy-ferrous complex of CYP3A4 with a broad absorption band at 424 nm as described previously (14Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The kinetics of subsequent decomposition of this complex was monitored using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy at 279 K. Experimental results showing the autoxidation kinetics in the presence of different TS concentrations are shown in Fig. 2. Even in the presence of 7 μm TS, the kinetics is clearly biphasic with an apparent first order rate of the slow phase of 1.5 s–1 and an amplitude of ∼20%. A further increase of TS concentration resulted in gradual elimination of the fast phase, which even at lower TS concentrations (60 μm) was resolved only as a minor component (<5%) and was not observed at all at higher concentrations of this substrate. These data are summarized and compared with the equilibrium spectral titration of the ferric CYP3A4 with testosterone under identical conditions at 279 K in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Fraction of the slow phase observed in the autoxidation kinetics (circles) and the high spin fraction of CYP3A4 (triangles) as a function of testosterone concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CYP3A4 can bind up to three molecules of testosterone, and the first binding event produces only a minor spin shift (15Denisov I.G. Baas B.J. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7066-7076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, the total high spin fraction of CYP3A4 is due to the contributions from the enzyme with two and three molecules bound. This is reflected in the spectral dissociation constant of SD = 56 μm obtained by the Hill analysis. However, from the data in Fig. 3 it is clear that the rate of autoxidation becomes significantly slower even at low TS concentrations. Thus, the presence of the first TS molecule bound to the enzyme has a profound effect on the stability of the oxy-ferrous complex, dramatically decreasing the rate of its irreversible decomposition into the ferric CYP3A4 and superoxide. The effect of substrate binding on the autoxidation of heme enzymes has been observed previously (Ref. 14Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23313-23318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and references therein) and can be attributed to the structural and/or dynamic restrictions on the escape of superoxide from the distal binding pocket of the protein caused by the presence of the substrate and/or an increased stability due to conformational change or alteration of the local dielectric around the heme. In some cases this effect is correlated with the spin shift and redox potential of the heme iron as described previously (30Clark J.P. Miles C.S. Mowat C.G. Walkinshaw M.D. Reid G.A. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 1075-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Ost T.W. Clark J. Mowat C.G. Miles C.S. Walkinshaw M.D. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15010-15020Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); this effect can also be rationalized through a destabilization of the water ligand to the ferric heme iron (32Fisher M.T. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6696-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Fisher M.T. Sligar S.G.

However, in the case of CYP3A4 binding testosterone, such a significant effect could not be predicted from the substrate-dependent spin shift and reveals the presence of a distinct mechanism controlling the overall stability"
https://openalex.org/W1968905630,"Weight control by exercise and dietary calorie restriction (DCR) has been associated with reduced cancer risk, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study was designed to compare the effects of weight loss by increasing physical activity or decreasing calorie intake on tumor promoter-induced Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways. SENCAR mice were randomly assigned to one of the following five groups: ad libitum-fed sedentary control, ad libitum-fed exercise (AL+Exe), exercise but pair-fed at the amount as controls (PF+Exe), 20% DCR, and 20% DCR plus exercise (DCR+Exe). After 10 weeks, body weight and body fat significantly decreased in the groups of DCR, DCR+Exe, and PF+Exe when compared with the controls. AL+Exe did not induce weight loss due to, at least in part, increased food intake. Plasma IGF-1 levels reduced significantly in DCR and DCR+Exe but not PF+Exe. The protein H-Ras and activated Ras-GTP significantly decreased in TPA-induced skin tissues of DCR-fed mice but not exercised mice. PI3K protein, phosphoserine Akt, and p42/p44-MAPK were reduced, however, in both DCR and PF+Exe groups. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the significantly reduced H-Ras occurred in subcutaneous fat cells, while the reduced PI3K and PCNA took place only in the epidermis. Plasma leptin decreased in PF+Exe, DCR, and DCR+Exe, while the caspase-3 activity increased in DCR+Exe only. Genomic microarray analysis further indicated that the expression of 34 genes relevant to PI3K and 31 genes to the MAPK pathway were significantly regulated by either DCR or PF+Exe treatments. The reduced PI3K in PF+Exe mice was partially reversed by IGF-1 treatment. The overall results of this study demonstrated that DCR abrogated both Ras and PI3K signaling, which might inhibit TPA-induced proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Selective inhibition of PI3K by PF+Exe but not AL+Exe seems more attributable to the magnitude of the caloric deficit and/or body fat loss than diet versus exercise comparison.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicates growing rates of obesity in American adults and overweight children over the past 20 years (1Hedley A.A. Ogden C.L. Johnson C.L.

Numerous prospective and case-control studies associated with weight control and physical activity estimate that excess body weight and sedentary life style account for about 39% endometrial, 25% kidney, 11% colon, 9% postmenopausal breast cancer, and 5% total cancer incidence (2Bergstrom A.

Cancer. 2001; 91: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 3International Agency for Research on CancerIARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention. 2002; 6 (Lyon, IARC)Google Scholar). It has been suggested that those 25% over normal weight have a 33% greater cancer risk than those who maintain ideal body weight (4Kritchevsky D. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 3827S-3829SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, for many individuals, it would be advisable to maintain weight within the normal range to reduce their risk of cancer. Overweight/obesity is recognized as a reflection of a positive energy state that results from either over-consumption of energy or low energy expenditure. There is ample evidence that weight control via decreasing calorie intake and/or increasing physical activity reduces cancer risk in animal models. For almost a century, dietary calorie restriction (DCR) 2The abbreviations used are: DCRdietary calorie restrictionALad libitumDXAdual-energy X-ray absorptiometryPFpair-fedERKextracellular signal-regulated protein kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePKCprotein kinase CTPA12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateRIAradioimmunoassayMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. has been shown to inhibit the development of spontaneous, transplanted, chemically, and virally induced cancer in animal models (5Weindruch R.

Many types of cancers, including mammary, liver, colon, skin, pancreas, bladder, and leukemia, have been shown to be prevented by 20–40% DCR (7Pollard M. Luckert P.H. Pan G.Y. Cancer Treat.

Alternatively, exercise, an effective method for energy expenditure, has been also shown to reduce both the incidence of DMBA-induced colon tumors and the growth of transplanted tumors in rats (4Kritchevsky D.

There are several hypotheses proposed to describe mechanisms by which weight control may reduce tumor development, including decreased oncogene expression, assisted DNA repair, scavenged reactive oxygen species, and altered levels of cancer-related hormones. Hormone alteration seems to be a critical factor for cancer prevention by weight control due to the significant role of hormones in regulating cellular growth.

It has been suggested that the role of IGF-1 in mitogenesis is triggered through cellular signaling cascades leading to the activation of both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (24Benito M. Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

TPA can induce ras gene expression via the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP). RasGRP is a family of guanyl nucleotide exchange factors and has been reported to be expressed in mouse epidermal keratinocytes in response to phorbol ester treatment (27Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A.

The activation of RasGRP by TPA is usually accompanied by subsequent Ras-mediated downstream regulation, especially of the MAPK pathway (28Rambaratsingh R.A. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Lorenzo P.S. J.

Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar, 30Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). H-ras is highly expressed in the skin and skeletal muscles, K-ras is mostly expressed in the colon and thymus, and N-ras is expressed in male germinal tissue and thymus (30Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). H-Ras and K-Ras are reported to be more responsive to the Raf-1/MAPK pathway. Ras becomes activated as a result of extracellular signals by the effect of its interaction with guanine exchange factors such as SOS. The combination of SOS and Ras stimulates GDP release. GTP then shifts from SOS to Ras (31Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit M.S. Bar-Sagi D. Kuiyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Activated GTP-bound Ras further initiates the MAPK cascade. Previous studies demonstrated that DCR treatment inhibited TPA-promoted skin carcinogenesis by reducing certain isoforms of PKC (32Birt D.F. Duysen E. Wang W. Yaktine A. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark Prev. 2001; 10: 679-685PubMed Google Scholar) down to the ERK pathway (33Liu Y. Wang W. Hawley J. Birt D.F. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark Prev. 2002; 11: 299-304PubMed Google Scholar), and then repressing transcriptional regulation of AP-1 (34Przybyszewski J. Yaktine A.L. Duysen E. Blackwood D. Wang W. Au A. Birt D.F. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PI3K contains the p85 regulatory subunit (which has two SH2 domains) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (35Fresno Vara J.A. Casado E. de Castro J. Cejas P. Belda-Iniesta C. Gonzalez-Baron M. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2004; 30: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). The PI3K constitute a family of eight distinct PI3K isoforms divided into three classes according to their sequence homology and substrate preference. Class Ia, including p110α, p110β, and p110δ, is associated with a p85 regulatory subunit to form a heterodimeric complex. The p85 subunit has a binding site for both insulin and IGF-1 receptors. Thus, PI3Kα, -β, and -δ can be drawn the membrane and activated upon the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues of IGF-1 receptor (36Dent P. Yacoub A. Contessa J. Caron R. Amorino G. Valerie K. Hagan M.P. Grant S. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In addition, Class Ia PI3K also can be activated by Ras-GTP via direct interaction with the catalytic subunit (37Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Class Ib has only one member, p110γ, which is triggered by activated α, β, and γ heterotrimeric G-protein (37Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 38Kishimoto H. Hamada K. Saunders M. Backman S. Sasaki T. Nakano T. Mak T.W. Suzuki A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PI3K down to Akt may modulate the function of numerous substrates involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell cycle progression, and cellular anti-apoptosis (39West K.A. Castillo S.S. Dennis P.A. Drug Resist. Update. 2002; 5: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This study was designed to compare the effects of weight loss by DCR-fed or exercise-trained mice on Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades. We provide novel evidence that these signaling pathways are potential targets by DCR and/or exercise for the inhibition of phorbol ester-induced skin tumor promotion. This is of particular interest because the key role of DCR- or exercise-induced weight control for these signal pathways in cancer promotion by which IGF-1 and/or other hormones such as insulin and leptin may be involved is largely unknown. Better understanding the relationship between body weight status, endocrine hormone changes, and hormone-dependent signal pathway activation may lead to a novel approach for cancer prevention. Animals and Treatments—Female SENCAR mice were purchased from National Institutes of Health (Frederick, MD) at 8 weeks of age (30 ± 2 g). The SENCAR mouse was developed by a special breeding of CD-1 with skin tumor-sensitive mice for enhanced susceptibility to TPA-promoted skin carcinogenesis as originally described by Routwell (40Boutwell R.K. Progr. Exptl. Tumor Res. 1964; 4: 207-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The averaged body weight was reduced (27.6 ± 2.8 g) after 1-week acclimation to new facility and diet change from rodent chow to AIN-93 purified diet. Mice were then randomly divided into one of the five groups: ad libitum sedentary (Control), ad libitum exercise (AL+Exe), Pair-fed plus exercise (PF+Exe), 20% DCR (DCR), and 20% DCR plus exercise (DCR+Exe). The PF+Exe group was paired-fed at the same amount as the control group. The mice were fed either a basal diet (AIN-93) or a 20% DCR diet for 12 weeks. The 20% DCR diet was formulated and provided by Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). Briefly, the DCR diet consisted of 20% less total calories from carbohydrates and fat in comparison with the basal AIN-93 diet, while the levels of protein and essential micronutrients were kept as same as the basal diet. The amount of food that each mouse consumed was recorded daily and averaged to determine the amount for the following week of the DCR and pair-fed consumption. A zero-grade adjustable-speed rodent treadmill (Boston Gears, Boston, MA) was used to exercise the mice. After a 2-week training period, mice performed treadmill exercise at 13.4 m/min for 60 min/day, 5 day/wk for 10 weeks. Mice were housed individually in an environmentally controlled room maintained at 75 ± 1°C and 80% relative humidity with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. To take into account the biological clocks of nocturnal rodents, the light cycle was adjusted for mice to run night-time exercise. Body weights were recorded weekly. In the last 2 weeks, some mice in PF+Exe group were received intraperitoneal injection of either saline (sham) or IGF-1 (Novozymes GroPep, Australia) at 10 μg/g B.W. twice per week for IGF-1 treatment. The mice were fed until the last day, but exercise was stopped 24 h after the last bout. In the end of experiment, the dorsal skin of the mice was shaved and topically treated once with TPA at 3.2 nmol. Mice were sacrificed 2 h after TPA treatment. The dorsal skin samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C until further analyses. Body Fat Analysis—Total body composition and bone mineral density were measured with a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer scan (DXA) using small animal software (v5.6, Prodigy, Lunar-General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Mice at the final week were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital prior to scanning. Body fat and bone mineral density were recorded from the DXA and presented as a percentage of the controls. Assessment of Plasma IGF-1 and Leptin Levels—Blood samples were obtained directly by decapitation and collected in heparin-coated tubes. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total IGF-1 in plasma was extracted by Acid-ETOH method and was then measured by a RIA kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostic, San Clemente, CA). Plasma leptin levels were determined using a commercial murine leptin RIA kit (Linco Diagnostics, St. Charles, MO). Assessment of Protein Levels by Western Blotting—Western analysis was performed as described previously (41Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse skin tissues were homogenized in Triton lysis buffer. Protein concentration was measured in the supernatant and 50 μg of whole cell protein was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then the transferred bands of H-Ras (21 kDa), K-Ras (21 kDa), PI3K (110 kDa), and β-actin (internal control, 43 kDa) were, respectively, bound to their monoclonal antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibodies against IGF-1Rβ (98 kDa) was provided by Upstate Inc. (Waltham, MA). Antibodies for p42/p44-MAPK (42/44 kDa), Akt (62 kDa), and p473-Akt (62 kDa) were provided by Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). The bound proteins were treated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and visualized by the FluorChem™ 8800 Advanced Imaging System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The expression levels of the proteins were qualified by a same imaging system. The relative density of the target band was normalized to the loading control β-actin and then expressed as a percentage of the controls. Assessment of Activated Ras-GTP Protein Levels by Pull-down Assay—Total activated Ras was determined by a pull-down assay kit from Upstate Inc. (Waltham, MA). Briefly, the whole skin cell lysate was prepared in Triton lysis buffer. The activated Ras in each 100 μg of cell lysate was then pelleted with 10 μl of Raf-1 RBD-agarose beads (Upstate Inc.) at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed in washing buffer three times. Pelleted samples were eluted in 2× loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then loaded onto an 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The level of target protein was determined by anti-Ras IgG2aκ, specifically recognizing p21 H-, K- and N-Ras, followed by a goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The level of the activated GTP-bound Ras was visualized by the FluorChem™ 8800 Advanced Imaging System as described before. Assessment of Local Protein Expression in Skin Tissue Cells by Immunohistochemistry—The flash-frozen dorsal skin tissues of mice were fixed in absolute ethanol overnight at -70 °C, followed by 70% ethanol at 4 °C, 50% ethanol at room temperature, and then rinsed with PBS before adding 10% formaldehyde. Then the skin tissues were set on edge in paraffin blocks to best demonstrate full skin thickness. Five micrometer sections of each skin sample were cut and mounted on positive precharged slides to ensure optimal adhesion. The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through three xylene incubations, twice with absolute ethanol, twice with 70% ethanol wash, and one PBS rinse. After endogenous peroxidase quenching (0.3% H2O2 in PBS for 20 min), antigens were retrieved by steaming at 95 °C for 30 min with a commercial antigen retrieval solution (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Following PBS washes, sections were incubated with 1:200 dilution of either one of the primary monoclonal antibodies that recognized mouse H-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PI3K (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PCNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), caspase-3 (Sigma), and leptin (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), respectively. The incubation was kept for 2 h at room temperature in Tris-HCl buffer with 1% goat serum. Negative control slides were incubated with goat IgG only and without primary antibodies. Immunochemistry was performed using a biotin-streptavidin peroxidase technique (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Staining was developed with diaminobenzidine chromogen (BioGenex). Staining density in epidermis, dermis, follicles, and subcutaneous fat of each section was blindly graded by the internal medicine residents using computer standards under guidance of a pathologist without knowledge of tissue treatment. The standards of staining intensity were respectively established at 400× by grading up to 40 cells in 5-unit increments from 3–5 mice per group. Data were statistically calculated and group difference scores with p ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—The activity of caspase-3 was measured using the fluorogenic substrate method (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA). Briefly, mouse skin tissue was homogenized in HEPES lysis buffer. The cell lysate at 500 μg of total protein content was incubated with the freshly prepared colorimetric substrate (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin) at 5 μm, 37 °C for 30 min. The release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was then measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission. Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was performed by the Microarray Core of the Mental Retardation Research Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Four samples from four groups including the control, AL+Exe, PF+Exe, and DCR groups were analyzed as follows. 10 μg of total RNA was annealed with 100 pmol of T7(dT)24 at 70 °C for 10 min. Then the annealed mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript Choice System kit (Invitrogen). Biotinylated antisense cRNA was prepared using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). After purification of labeled cRNA using Rneasy RNA Purification Mini kit (Qiagen), 20 μg of biotin-labeled cRNA was incubated in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm magnesium acetate) at 94 °C for 35 min. The labeled cDNA then was applied to an Affymetrix oligonucleotide array, a GeneChipR Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing 39,000 transcripts with 45,101 probe sets. The genechip was hybridized, washed, and scanned using Affymetrix equipment and protocols (Affymetrix). Image data were quantified using genechip operating software 1.0 (GCOS 1.0). The detection calls of probe sets were determined using default settings (α1, 0.04; α2, 0.06; δ, 0.015; scale factor, 1.0; norm factor, 1.0). If a particular probe set was marked as absent, the probe set was removed from further analysis. To detect the differentially expressed genes between treatment and control, a nonparametric bootstrap method (42Efron B. Tibshirani R.J. Stat. Sci. 1986; 1: 54-77Crossref Scopus (4509) Google Scholar) was used to compute the raw p value for each gene. The eight chips from both the treatment groups and the control groups were re-sampled for 9,999 times with nonparametric bootstrapping, and t statistics of each gene was calculated for each re-sampling,. The raw p value for each gene was obtained by ranking the original t statistics value in the 9,999 re-sampling t statistics values. The differentially expressed genes were then determined by controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR) at the 1% level (43Benjamini Y. Hochberg T. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). From the total data pool, 48 genes relevant to IGF-1 signaling were found to be significantly impacted and reported in this study. Gene Expression Confirmation by RT-PCR—RT-PCR was carried out by using purified total RNA obtained as described above. The cDNA was synthesized by RT-PCR using one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers are derived from published gene sequences as follows: MAPK1: sense primer 5′-TCT CCC GCA CAA AAA TAA GG-3′, antisense primer 5′-TCG TCC AAC TCC ATG TCA AA-3′; H-ras: sense primer 5′-TGT TAC CAA CTG GGA CGA CA-3′, antisense primer 5′-TCT CAG CTG TGG TGG TGA AG-3′; PI3Kca: sense primer 5′-TGT TTG CAA AGA AGC TGT GG-3′, antisense primer 5′-TAT GAC CCA GAG GGA TTT CG-3′; IGFBP3: sense primer 5′-AAG TTC CAT CCA CTC CAT GC-3′, antisense primer 5′-AGC TCT GCT TTC TGC CTT TG-3′; lepr: sense primer 5′-AGG CCC AGA CAT TTT TCC TT-3′, antisense primer 5′-TCC TGG AGG ATC CTG ATG TC-3′; β-actin: sense primer 5′-TGT TAC CAA CTG GGA CGA CA-3′, antisense primer 5′-TCT CAG CTG TGG TGG TGA AG-3′.50 μl of PCR reaction were run with a final concentration of 200 μm dNTP mix, 1× PCR buffer, 1 μm of each primer, and 1.0 units of Taq polymerase. Thermal cycling conditions, following an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, were as follows: 30 s at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Then samples were incubated at 72 °C for 7 min. Amplified products at 8 μl were loaded and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. The RT-PCR products were visualized under UV light by the FluorChem™ 8800 Advanced Imaging System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The relative density of the target band was normalized to the loading control β-actin and then expressed as a percentage of the controls. Statistic Analysis—The overall effects of treatments on body weight, body fat, and IGF-1 levels were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and then the least significant difference method (Fisher's LSD) was used to compare each of the treatment groups and the control group. Each set of comparisons for a given variable will be conducted at the overall 0.05 level of significance by applying Dunnett's adjustment. In the experiments of RT-PCR, activated Ras-GTP, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, a complete randomized block design was used with each running gel as a block effect and analyzed by ANOVA and contrast analysis. All the statistical processes were carried out with SAS software.

https://openalex.org/W2111159182,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are potentially serious chromosomal lesions. However, cells sometimes deliberately cleave their own DNA to facilitate certain chromosomal processes, and there is much interest in how such self-inflicted breaks are effectively managed. Eukaryotic DSBs occur in the context of chromatin and the RSC chromatin-remodeling ATPase complex has been shown to promote DSB repair at the budding yeast MAT locus DSB, created by the HO endonuclease during mating type switching. We show that the role of RSC at MAT is highly specialized. The Rsc1p subunit of RSC directs nucleosome sliding immediately after DSB creation at both MAT and generally and is required for efficient DNA damage-induced histone H2A phosphorylation and strand resection during repair by homologous recombination. However, the Rsc2p and Rsc7p subunits are additionally required to set up a basal MAT locus structure. This RSC-dependent chromatin structure at MAT ensures accessibility to the HO endonuclease. The RSC complex therefore has chromatin remodeling roles both before and after DSB induction at MAT, promoting both DNA cleavage and subsequent repair."

This study tested the hypotheses that Brca1 loss in mammary epithelium alters the estrogenic growth response and that exposure to increased estrogen or ERα collaborates with Brca1 deficiency to accelerate preneoplasia and cancer development. Longer ductal extension was found in mammary glands of Brca1f/f;MMTV-Cre mice during puberty as compared to wild-type mice. Terminal end bud differentiation was impaired in Brca1 mutant mice with preservation of prolactin-induced alveolar differentiation. Exogenous estrogen stimulated an abnormal sustained increase in mammary epithelial cell proliferation and the appearance of ERα-negative preneoplasia in postpubertal Brca1 mutant mice. Carcinogenesis was investigated using Brca1f/f;MMTV-Cre mice hemizygous for p53. Exogenous estrogen increased the percentage of mice with multiple hyperplastic alveolar nodules. Targeted conditional ERα overexpression in mammary epithelial cells of mice that were Brca1 mutant and hemizygous for p53 increased the percentage of mice exhibiting multiple hyperplastic nodules, invasive mammary cancers and cancer multiplicity. Significantly more than half of the preneoplasia and cancers were ERα negative even as their initiation was promoted by ERα overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W1581259003,"Recently, we identified a lung adenocarcinoma signature that segregated tumors into three clades distinguished by histological invasiveness. Among the genes differentially expressed was the type II transforming growth factor-β receptor (TGFβRII), which was lower in adenocarcinoma mixed subtype and solid invasive subtype tumors compared with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. We used a tumor cell invasion system to identify the chemokine CCL5 (RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted) as a potential downstream mediator of TGF-β signaling important for lung adenocarcinoma invasion. We specifically hypothesized that RANTES is required for lung cancer invasion and progression in TGFβRII-repressed cells. We examined invasion in TGFβRII-deficient cells treated with two inhibitors of RANTES activity, Met-RANTES and a CCR5 receptor-blocking antibody. Both treatments blocked invasion induced by TGFβRII knockdown. In addition, we examined the clinical relevance of the RANTES–CCR5 pathway by establishing an association of RANTES and CCR5 immunostaining with invasion and outcome in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Moderate or high expression of both RANTES and CCR5 was associated with an increased risk for death, P=0.014 and 0.002, respectively. In conclusion, our studies indicate RANTES signaling is required for invasion in TGFβRII-deficient cells and suggest a role for CCR5 inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2023059507,"UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase) mediates the first step in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on acid hydrolases. The transferase exists as anα2β2γ2 hexameric complex with the α- and β-subunits derived from a single precursor molecule. The catalytic function of the transferase is attributed to the α- and β-subunits, whereas the γ-subunit is believed to be involved in the recognition of a conformation-dependent protein determinant common to acid hydrolases. Using knock-out mice with mutations in either the α/β gene or the γ gene, we show that disruption of the α/β gene completely abolishes phosphorylation of high mannose oligosaccharides on acid hydrolases whereas knock-out of the γ gene results in only a partial loss of phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that the α/β-subunits, in addition to their catalytic function, have some ability to recognize acid hydrolases as specific substrates. This process is enhanced by the γ-subunit.

This process is enhanced by the γ-subunit. In many cell types the targeting of newly synthesized acid hydrolases to lysosomes requires the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) 2The abbreviations used are:Man-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateESmouse embryonic stem cellsGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamine 2The abbreviations used are:Man-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateESmouse embryonic stem cellsGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamine residues on the N-linked high mannose glycans of these enzymes (1Kornfeld S. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification is mediated by the sequential action of two enzymes, UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase) and phosphodiester glycosidase (“uncovering” enzyme). The first enzyme binds to a conformation-dependent protein determinant on the acid hydrolases and then transfers GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to selected mannose residues on the oligosaccharide. This is followed by removal of the outer GlcNAc residue by uncovering enzyme to produce the Man-6-P monoester, which serves as a high affinity ligand for binding to Man-6-P receptors in the trans-Golgi network. The ligand-receptor complex is packaged into clathrin-coated transport vesicles for delivery to endosomes and lysosomes. Mutations in GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase give rise to the autosomal recessive disorders termed mucolipidosis II (I-cell disease) and mucolipidosis III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) with the former being the more severe of the two (2Kornfeld S. Sly W.S. Scriver The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3469-3483Google Scholar). The deficiency of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity results in decreased Man-6-P formation on the newly synthesized acid hydrolases leading to impaired lysosomal targeting and hypersecretion of these enzymes into the plasma and other fluids.GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase exists as a hexameric complex containing three distinct subunits (α2, β2, γ2) (3Bao M. Elmendorf B.J. Booth J.L. Drake R.R. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The α/β-subunits, encoded by a single gene, contain the catalytic activity of the enzyme (4Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H. Poe B. Canfield W.M. J. Biol.

The γ-subunit, encoded by a separate gene, is involved in the selective recognition of lysosomal acid hydrolases. The evidence for the role of the γ-subunit has come from studies of a subset of patients with ML III. It was initially shown that the fibroblasts of these individuals contained a GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase that exhibited normal activity toward the simple sugar acceptor α-methylmannoside, but greatly reduced activity toward lysosomal acid hydrolases (5Varki A.

This indicated that the mutation impaired recognition of the protein determinant shared by acid hydrolases but did not alter the catalytic function of the enzyme. Subsequently it was demonstrated that these patients had a mutation in the gene encoding the γ-subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, thereby linking this subunit to substrate recognition with the α- and β-subunits containing the catalytic portion of the enzyme (8Raas-Rothschild A. Cormier-Daire V. Bao M. Genin E. Salomon R. Brewer K. Zeigler M. Mandel H. Toth S. Roe B. Munnich A. Canfield W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, these findings did not exclude a role for the α/β-subunits in substrate recognition.Analysis of a large number of patients with ML II and ML III has revealed that individuals with mutations in the γ-subunit gene always exhibit the milder clinical disorder (ML III) whereas those with mutations in the α/β gene may have either ML II or ML III (8Raas-Rothschild A.

One explanation for this is that while the γ-subunit facilitates recognition of acid hydrolase substrates, it is not absolutely required for this function. Thus, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase lacking the γ-subunit may be able to exhibit sufficient activity toward acid hydrolases to ameliorate the symptoms to some extent. However, this has not been directly analyzed.In this study we characterize the extent of phosphorylation of the lysosomal acid hydrolases in mice lacking either the α/β gene or the γ gene. Our data show that loss of the α/β-subunits completely abolishes formation of the Man-6-P recognition marker whereas reduced but significant synthesis occurs in the absence of the γ-subunit. These findings indicate that the α/β-subunits have some ability to recognize lysosomal enzyme substrates, but this function is enhanced by the γ-subunit. Our result provides an explanation for why mutations in the γ-subunit produce a milder phenotype than α/β mutations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted.

The gene-trapping retroviral vector was shown to insert in intron 1 of the GNPTAB gene, resulting in truncation of the α/β precursor after 39 amino acids of a total of 1256 residues. The ES cells with a mutation in the GNPTG gene (GenBank™ accession number AK078230) were obtained with a directed gene deletion approach that deleted exons 4–11 of the gene. This resulted in truncation of the γ-subunit after 59 amino acids (including 24 amino acids that comprise the signal sequence) of a total of 305 residues. These ES cells were used to generate mice heterozygous for the mutations using standard methods (20Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England2000Google Scholar). Mating between the heterozygous mice gave rise to homozygous animals.

Acid β-glucosidase was assayed with 5 mm 4-MU-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma M3633) in a buffer containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, 0.2 m Na2HPO4, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.25% sodium taurocholate (pH 5.2). The assay mixtures containing 90 μl of 5 mm substrate solution and 10 μl of sample were incubated for 1 to 5 h at 37 °C and then quenched with 900 μl of 0.4 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 10.8. The fluorescence was measured in a TURNER Model 450 Fluorometer (Barnstead Thermolyne Corporation, Dubuque, Iowa) using excitation and emission wave lengths of 360 and 450 nm, respectively.Man-6-P Receptor Affinity Chromatography—Brain tissue was obtained from mice that had been perfused with phosphate-buffered saline buffer to remove contaminating blood and immediately frozen on dry ice. 100 mg of the frozen tissue was resuspended in 250 μl of buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 4.5), homogenized in a 1.5-ml tube (catalog number 749510-1590, KONTES) using a Pellet Pestle Motor Homogenizer (KONTES), and sonicated for 5 s using Model 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific). The homogenate was centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant fluid, which contained more than 90% of the acid hydrolase activity, was collected.50 μl of the homogenate was diluted 10-fold with Buffer A (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.25, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and loaded onto a 1-ml CI-MPR-Sepharose column (0.86 mg/ml). The column was washed with 7 ml of Buffer A, then with 7 ml of 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate in Buffer A, and eluted with 5 ml of 10 mm mannose 6-phosphate in Buffer A (25Do H. Lee W. Ghosh P.

Irvine, CA) and chased for 1 h. Cells were harvested and extracted sequentially with 2 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) × 2, 2 ml of EtOH:dH2O (1:1) × 1, and CHCl3:MeOH:dH2O (10:10: 3) × 1.The residual protein pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS by boiling and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 2 units of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) following addition of citrate buffer, pH 5.5. Endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides were separated from resistant material using a Centricon10 filtration unit. The filtrate, containing the released high mannose oligosaccharides, was subjected to mild acid hydrolysis (pH 2.0, 100 °C for 30 min) to release any covering GlcNAc residues. The samples were diluted 10 times with 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0 and applied to a 2 ml of QAE-Sephadex column equilibrated with the same buffer. The neutral high mannose oligosaccharides passed through the column, oligosaccharides with one uncovered phosphate bound to the column and were eluted with 70 mm NaCl in 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and oligosaccharides with two uncovered phosphates were eluted with 140 mm NaCl in 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The Centricon retentate, containing the Endo H-resistant complex-type oligosaccharides, was digested with Pronase, and the glycans were fractionated in Con A-Sepharose as previously described (26Dustin M. Baranski T. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in all of the fractions was determined.The percent phosphorylation was calculated as cpm recovered in Endo H-released oligosaccharides with one or two phosphates ÷ total cpm in Endo H-released oligosaccharides (phosphorylated plus neutral) + 2 (endo H-resistant complex-type oligosaccharides). The values of the complex oligosaccharides were multiplied by 2 to correct for the fact that they contain 3 mannose residues versus an average of 6 mannose residues per high mannose oligosaccharide (26Dustin M. Baranski T. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).RESULTSCathepsin D Targeting in Fibroblasts—In our initial experiment, we followed the sorting of newly synthesized cathepsin D, a typical lysosomal protease, in fibroblasts obtained from wild-type, α/β gene knock-out, and γ gene knock-out mice. The cells were incubated with [35S]Met/Cys for 2 h and then chased for 4 h. The cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated from the cells and media followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1, almost all the cathepsin D synthesized by the wild-type cells remained intracellular where it migrated as a 43-kDa species, indicative of processing of the precursor form to the single chain intermediate species. This processing occurs in endosomes and lysosomes (27Hasilik A. Experientia. 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, over 60% of the cathepsin D was secreted by the α/β gene knock-out fibroblasts, demonstrating that sorting is greatly impaired. The cathepsin D that remained intracellular was processed to the intermediate form, showing that some of the enzyme does reach the endosome/lysosome compartments. Of note, the cathepsin D that is retained in the α/β gene knock-out fibroblasts had a slower electrophoretic mobility than the cathepsin D retained by the wild-type cells. This is the result of processing of the two N-linked glycans to complex-type species whereas the glycans remain as high mannose units in the wild-type cells. The processed form seen in the α/β gene knock-out cells resembles the unusual processed forms in ML II cells.The cathepsin D sorting by the γ gene knock-out fibroblasts was much more efficient than that observed in the α/β gene knock-out cells, although not quite equivalent to the wild-type cells. These results indicate that cathepsin D phosphorylation is considerably more impaired in the α/β gene knock-out fibroblasts than in the γ gene knock-out cells.Binding of Brain Acid Hydrolases to CI-MPR-Affinity Column—Whereas a number of cell types in ML II and ML III patients are deficient in multiple lysosomal acid hydrolases, some organs, including the brain, have been found to contain normal levels of these enzymes (28Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Elsen V.A. Leroy G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Owada M. Neufeld E. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1982; 105: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this observation in the α/β and γ gene knock-out mice (Table 1). It also has been reported that brain cells dephosphorylate the Man-6-P-containing oligosaccharides of their acid hydrolases considerably slower than occurs in other tissues (30Sleat E. Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In view of this, we used brain extracts from wild-type and knock-out mice to evaluate the degree of phosphorylation of a number of acid hydrolases. Aliquots of the extracts were passed over a CI-MPR-affinity column which selectively binds hydrolases containing phosphorylated high mannose units. The column was washed first with Buffer A, then with 5 mm Glc-6-P and finally with 10 mm Man-6-P to elute the phosphorylated forms of the acid hydrolases. The fractions were assayed for a number of acid hydrolase activities, and the percent of each enzyme that bound to the column and was selectively eluted with Man-6-P was calculated (Table 1). Between 40.7 and 82.1% of each of the acid hydrolases present in the wild-type brain extract bound specifically to the CI-MPR-affinity column. The exception was acid β-glucosidase (<2% binding) which is one of the few acid hydrolases that is not acted upon by GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (31Aerts J. Schram A. Strijland A. van Weely S. Jonsson L. Tager J. Sorell S. Ginns E. Barranger J. Murray G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The failure of the acid β-glucosidase to bind to the CI-MPR-affinity column validates the specificity of the procedure.TABLE 1Binding of acid hydrolases in brain tissue to CI-MPR-affinity columnEnzymeActivityWild typeγ-PT KOα,β-PT KOAverage ± S.D.

This represents the lower limit of detection in this assay. Strikingly, substantial binding of all the acid hydrolases occurred with the γ gene knock-out samples, with the exception of the acid β-glucosidase. The highest binding was observed with α-mannosidase (40% versus 50.1% with wild type) and β-glucuronidase (41.6% versus 57.9% with wild type). β-Mannosidase bound at 25% of the wild type level whereas β-hexosaminidase and β-galactosidase bound at 16 and 14% of their respective wild type levels. The lack of acid β-glucosidase binding indicates that the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase maintains its specificity for selected acid hydrolases in the absence of the γ-subunit.Analysis of [2-3H] Mannose-labeled Oligosaccharides—To obtain a more quantitative measure of the effect of the α/β and γ gene knockouts on the phosphorylation of the acid hydrolase oligosaccharides, we determined the total synthesis of phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharides in the various fibroblasts cell lines. Prior studies have established that GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase accounts for all of the synthesis of this type of oligosaccharides in fibroblasts (9Steet R. Hullin R. Kudo M. Martinelli M. Bosshard N.U. Schaffner T. Kornfeld S. Steinmann B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 132A: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with [2-3H]mannose for 4 h followed by a 1-h chase. The lipid-linked oligosaccharides were then extracted, leaving a glycoprotein residue that contained the total cellular content of N-linked glycans, both high mannose and complex type. These glycoproteins were treated with endo H to release the high mannose glycans, including those derived from the acid hydrolases. The high mannose oligosaccharides were then separated into neutral, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated species by QAE-Sephadex chromatography. These fractions were quantified along with the endo H-resistant complex-type species, allowing the determination of the total content of phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharides in fibroblasts from the wild-type and the two knock-out lines. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 2. On average, 1.34% of the total N-linked glycans of wild-type fibroblasts contained Man-6-P residues, the bulk of which were present on oligosaccharides with two Man-6-Ps. The γ gene knock-out fibroblasts had 0.28% phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharides (21% wild-type level) while the α/β gene knock-out fibroblasts had only 0.009% of these species (<1% of wild type level). In fact, the amount of radioactivity recovered in the phosphorylated oligosaccharide fractions of the α/β-subunits knock-out cells was so low that it may just reflect variation in background counting. Interestingly, the majority of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides recovered from the γ gene knock-out fibroblasts contained two Man-6-P residues, similar to the finding with the wild-type fibroblasts.TABLE 2Analysis of [2-3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharidesFibroblast typeTotal cpmOligosaccharide species% Oligosaccharide phosphorylationAverage phosphorylationComplexNHMaNHM, neutral high mannose-type oligosaccharides1-PMb1-PM, high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing one phosphomonoester2-PMc2-PM, high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing two phosphomonoesters% total%Wt 402298,18344.254.60.410.771.181.34Wt 4027,76244.853.60.011.61.61Wt 402377,71844.653.80.111.421.53Wt 40542,73443.455.60.240.811.05γ-KO 208180,22048.351.40.100.240.340.28γ-KO 403553,29850.349.50.050.170.22γ-KO 403270,48449.849.90.0580.2550.31γ-KO 403353,26847.652.20.0160.2130.23α,β-KO 953144,44954.745.30.0070.0090.0160.01α,β-KO 953232,49750.949.10.0020.0000.002a NHM, neutral high mannose-type oligosaccharidesb 1-PM, high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing one phosphomonoesterc 2-PM, high mannose-type oligosaccharides containing two phosphomonoesters Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe findings presented in this study show that loss of the α/β gene of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase decreases phosphorylation of lysosomal acid hydrolases to undetectable levels. This would be expected in view of the data implicating the α/β-subunits as the catalytic components of phosphotransferase (4Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H. Poe B. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36141-36149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, knock-out of the γ gene resulted in only a partial loss of lysosomal enzyme phosphorylation. These results are consistent with the fact that the γ gene knock-out mice have a significantly milder phenotype than the α/β gene knock-out mice. While both types of knock-out mice have striking elevations of their serum acid hydrolases, the α/β gene knock-out mice are small and develop severe retinal degeneration that leads to blindness by 5 months of age whereas the γ gene knockout mice are of normal size and do not exhibit retinal degeneration (21Gelfman C. Vogel P. Issa T. Turner A. Lee W. Kornfeld S. Rice D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The findings are also in line with the genetic analysis of patients with ML II and ML III showing that mutations of the γ gene result in the milder ML III phenotype whereas mutations of the α/β gene can lead to either ML II or ML III (8Raas-Rothschild A.

https://openalex.org/W2084788365,"The TRM5 gene encodes a tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase (Trm5p) that methylates guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) in cytoplasmic tRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that Trm5p is also responsible for m1G37 methylation of mitochondrial tRNAs. The TRM5 open reading frame encodes 499 amino acids containing four potential initiator codons within the first 48 codons. Full-length Trm5p, purified as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein, exhibited robust methyltransferase activity with tRNA isolated from a Δtrm5 mutant strain, as well as with a synthetic mitochondrial initiator tRNA (tRNAMetf). Primer extension demonstrated that the site of methylation was guanosine 37 in both mitochondrial tRNAMetf and tRNAPhe. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed the methylated product to be m1G. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting of a strain expressing a green fluorescent protein-tagged version of the TRM5 gene revealed that the enzyme was localized to both cytoplasm and mitochondria. The slightly larger mitochondrial form was protected from protease digestion, indicating a matrix localization. Analysis of N-terminal truncation mutants revealed that a Trm5p active in the cytoplasm could be obtained with a construct lacking amino acids 1–33 (Δ1–33), whereas production of a Trm5p active in the mitochondria required these first 33 amino acids. Yeast expressing the Δ1–33 construct exhibited a significantly lower rate of oxygen consumption, indicating that efficiency or accuracy of mitochondrial protein synthesis is decreased in cells lacking m1G37 methylation of mitochondrial tRNAs.

Yeast expressing the Δ1–33 construct exhibited a significantly lower rate of oxygen consumption, indicating that efficiency or accuracy of mitochondrial protein synthesis is decreased in cells lacking m1G37 methylation of mitochondrial tRNAs. These data suggest that this tRNA modification plays an important role in reading frame maintenance in mitochondrial protein synthesis. One of the most ancient tRNA modifications, present in all organisms as well as mitochondria and chloroplasts, is methylation of the N1 atom of guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) 3The abbreviations used are: m1GN1-methylguanosineAdoMetS-adenosyl-l-methionineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMBPmaltose-binding proteinMBP-Trm5MBP-Trm5 fusion proteinORFopen reading frameUTRuntranslated regionRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends.

The m1G37 modification is catalyzed by a tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.31) encoded by trmD in bacteria or TRM5 in archaea and eukaryotes (1Björk G.R. Jacobsson K. Nilsson K.

Remarkably, the bacterial trmD gene is not homologous to TRM5; thus, the m1G37-modifying enzyme evolved twice. Trm5p has been shown to be responsible for m1G37 methylation of at least eight cytoplasmic tRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Björk G.R. Jacobsson K. Nilsson K. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S.

S. cerevisiae also has at least eight mitochondrially encoded tRNAs that carry the m1G37 modification (6Dunin-Horkawicz S. Czerwoniec A. Gajda M.J. Feder M. Grosjean H. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), including the initiator tRNA (tRNAMetf) (7Canaday J. Dirheimer G. Martin R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and tRNAPhe (8Martin R.P. Sibler A.P. Schneller J.M. Keith G. Stahl A.J. Dirheimer G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4579-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The enzyme(s) responsible for modifying these mitochondrial tRNAs has not been identified. There is no apparent homolog of bacterial trmD in eukaryotic or mitochondrial genomes, so it has been proposed (1Björk G.R. Jacobsson K. Nilsson K. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S. Persson O.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9Brulè H. Elliott M. Redlak M. Zehner Z.E. Holmes W.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9243-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that Trm5p might also be responsible for methylation of mitochondrial tRNAs. To date, however, only cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of Trm5p has been reported (10Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that yeast encode a separate mitochondrial m1G37 methyltransferase enzyme. To address this question, we have cloned, purified, and characterized the S. cerevisiae TRM5-encoded protein. We show that it possesses tRNA methyltransferase activity on both natural and synthetic mitochondrial tRNA substrates and is specific for methylation of the N1 atom of guanosine at position 37. Furthermore, we show that Trm5p is localized to both the cytoplasm and mitochondria in yeast. Thus, the protein encoded by the TRM5 gene in yeast represents yet another example of dual protein localization from a single gene (11Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Karniely S. Pines O. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Chemicals, Reagents, and Strains-Reagent grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, or VWR and used without further purification. Geneticin (G-418 sulfate) was obtained from American Bioanalytical. SUPERase-in, RPA III ribonuclease protection assay kit, and RNA marker templates were from Ambion. The commercially produced enzymes (and their distributors) were ribonuclease P1 (Sigma), phosphodiesterase I (Worthington), bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas), T7 RNA polymerase Plus (Ambion), Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion), T4 DNA ligase (Epicentre), T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen, WI), and proteinase K (Fisher Biotech). The radiochemicals were [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and [methyl-3H]S-adenosyl-l-methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences or MP Biomedicals). S. cerevisiae total tRNA (Type X) was purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized either by Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX) or by Sigma-Genosys. Antibodies against GFP were purchased from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA). The Escherichia coli expression vectors pMALc2H10T (13Kristelly R. Gao G. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol.

Recombinant plasmids with inserts were sequenced at the DNA Core Facilities of the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology at The University of Texas at Austin. E. coli Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) and E. coli JM109 (Promega) cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. The S. cerevisiae strains are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose), YPEG (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% ethanol, and 3% glycerol), or yeast minimal medium (YMD) as described previously (15Tibbetts A.S.

Yeast genomic DNA was isolated from DAY4 cells. Haploid Δtrm5 cells (DLY1) were obtained from Y21898 (Table 1) by sporulation and tetrad dissection as described previously (16Chan S.Y. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43051-43059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DLY1 was typically maintained with a plasmid (pRS416-TRM5) encoding the wild-type TRM5 gene because trm5 deletion mutants grow so poorly on glucose.TABLE 1Yeast strains and plasmid constructsRelevant genotypeSourceYeast strains Y21898a/α his3/his3 leu2/leu2 lys2/LYS2 MET15/met15 ura3/ura3trm5::KanMX4/TRM5EUROSCARF DLY1aMaintained with plasmid pRS416-TRM5 complementing the trm5 deletion.α his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 trm5::KanMX4This work EY0986/TRM5-GFPa his3 leu2 met15 ura3 TRM5-GFPInvitrogen and Ref. 10Huh W.K.

Open table in a new tab Oxygen Consumption Assays-Oxygen consumption rates were measured using a standard Clark-type electrode (model 5300A; YSI Inc.). 5-ml cultures were grown in YMD to mid-log phase (A600 =∼0.5) and transferred to the airtight chamber, and oxygen consumption was measured at 30 °C for at least 10 min. Rates (nmol oxygen min–1) were normalized to the A600 of each culture. Preparation of Yeast Mitochondria-The cells were grown aerobically in a semisynthetic galactose medium containing (per liter):3 g of yeast extract, 10 g of galactose, 0.8 g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.7 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g of NaCl,1 g of KH2PO4, 0.4 g of CaCl2, and 5 mg of FeCl3·6H2O. Mitochondria were isolated by spheroplasting and differential centrifugation according to Daum et al. (17Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning Yeast TRM5 for Protein Expression in E. coli-The wild-type TRM5 (YHR070w) ORF was amplified from genomic DAY4 DNA using primers TRM5-F and TRM5-R, containing XbaI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively (supplemental Table S1). The resulting PCR product was digested with XbaI and HindIII, ligated into the same sites in the vector pMALc2H10T, and transformed into E. coli JM109. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells to express the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and decahistidine tag fused to the full-length Trm5 protein (MBP-Trm5). Heterologous protein was expressed in these cells after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 29 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested and washed. Purification of MBP-Trm5-Cells from a 2-liter culture of E. coli expressing MBP-Trm5 were lysed by sonication in 15 ml of binding buffer to which benzamidine (1 mm) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) were added. After low speed centrifugation (20 min at 16,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor, Sorvall centrifuge), the supernatant was applied to a His-bind matrix (5-ml bed volume; Novagen) equilibrated in 1× binding buffer, which contains 5 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) with 500 mm NaCl. After extensive washing, loosely adsorbed protein was eluted with “wash buffer” (60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl in Tris buffer), and then 250 mm imidazole in the same Tris-HCl/NaCl solution was applied to elute tightly bound protein. The protein fractions eluted with 250 mm imidazole were dialyzed against 500 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for about 4 h, then dithiothreitol was added to give 1 mm, and the protein was frozen in small aliquots at –80 °C. Analysis by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) showed nearly pure protein of the expected size. The maltose-binding protein alone was expressed from pMALc2H10T and purified as described above to serve as a control in the methyltransferase assays. Tobacco etch virus protease was purified as described (19Walkup A.S. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 442: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). tRNA Preparations-Mitochondrial tRNA was isolated from mitochondria prepared from S. cerevisiae DAY4 cells. RNA was extracted using 2 ml of TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) for mitochondria from 4 liters of yeast cells. The manufacturer's instructions were followed up to the phase separation step, and then a high salt precipitation was added to eliminate ribosomal RNA. Isopropanol (0.5 ml) was added to the aqueous phase followed by 0.5 ml of 0.8 m sodium citrate, 1.2 m NaCl. After 10 min at room temperature, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Isopropanol (0.7 volumes) was added to the supernatant to precipitate the tRNA. After 10 min at room temperature, tRNA was collected by centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C). The tRNA pellet was washed with 70% cold ethanol and then resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5). About 50 μg of yeast mitochondrial tRNA was obtained. Low molecular weight RNA containing both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA was isolated from haploid Δtrm5 cells (strain DLY1). Haploid spores were first grown on a YPD agar plate for 9 days at 30 °C; then the cells were grown in YPD broth in the presence of 300 μgml–1 geneticin for at least 48 h followed by growth in YPD without geneticin for 48 h. Cells from a 200-ml culture were harvested and extracted with TRI reagent (8 ml of TRI reagent was used for 4–5 ml of packed cell pellet). The mixture was kept at 37 °C for 5 min before chloroform was added. Then the manufacturer's procedure was followed with no high salt precipitation step. This procedure gave mainly tRNA (analyzed by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis) with a yield of 2.3 mg. For further purification, a second ethanol precipitation was carried out. The tRNA was resuspended in sterile 10 mm ammonium acetate and stored frozen in aliquots. The same method was used to isolate total tRNA from DLY1 harboring various TRM5 plasmids. Methyltransferase Assay-Methyl group incorporation from [3H]methyl-S-adenosyl methionine ([3H]AdoMet) into tRNA was measured by determining radioactivity in acid-precipitable product (20Graham D.E. Kramer G. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out in a total volume of 30 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 600–700 pmol of Δtrm5 tRNA, or 20–30 pmol synthetic tRNAMetf unless otherwise stated, various amounts of enzyme, and 52 μm [3H]AdoMet, (300–500 Ci mol–1). The synthetic tRNAMetf was heated for 5 min at 70 °C and cooled at room temperature before being added to the reaction mixture. Incubation was at 37 °C for the indicated time, usually 30 min. Then 25 μlof the reaction mixture were added to 40 μg of bovine serum albumin in a glass tube. Protein was precipitated with 2 ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The tube was kept in ice for 10 min before the precipitate was collected on a 34 glass fiber filter (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Millipore manifold. The filters were washed three times with 3 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and dried for 15 min at 150 °C, and the bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. A reaction mixture without tRNA was included as negative control. Synthesis of 1-Methylguanosine-Methyl iodide was used to methylate guanosine, producing m1G as described by Broom et al. (21Broom A.D. Townsend L.B. Jones J.W. Robins R.K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The structure of the synthetic product was confirmed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Austin. Negative ionization mode identified the molecular ion [M – H]– at m/z 296 and the chloride adduct [M + Cl]– at m/z 332. Tandem mass spectrometry production analysis of the peak at m/z 296 produced the 1-methylguanine base fragment ion [B – H]– at m/z 164 and the ribosyl fragment ion [Ribose – H]– at m/z 133. Subsequent fragmentation of the ion at m/z 164 produced characteristic fragment ions [B – NH2]– at m/z 149 and [B – NH2 – CO]– at m/z 121. The UV absorbance spectrum of the purified m1G dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) showed absorbance maxima at 256 and 270 nm, consistent with the previously reported spectrum (22Smith J.D. Dunn D.B. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of Nucleosides-The reversed phase HPLC protocol used to separate nucleosides was modified from one described by Pomerantz and McCloskey (23Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Buffer A contained 250 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0), and buffer B contained 60% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Samples (20 μl) were applied to a reversed phase C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm; Axxium) with a Security Guard ODS cartridge (4 × 3 mm; Phenomenex) that was equilibrated in mobile phase containing 8% buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 at 35 °C. After 10 min, a gradient from 8 to 15% buffer B was applied. UV absorbance was monitored using a System Gold 168 photodiode array detector (Beckman). The data were collected, and chromatograms were integrated using the 32 Karat software (Beckman). For the analysis of radioisotopes, fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and diluted with 3 ml of ScintiVerse scintillation fluid (Fisher). Radioactivity measurements were made using a LS 6000SC liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). Using this HPLC method, nucleosides eluted with the following retention times: cytidine (3.4 min), uridine (3.5 min), 5-methylcytidine (4.7 min), 7-methylguanosine (4.7 min), guanosine (4.7 min), 1-methylguanosine (6.7 min), 2-methylguanosine (7.4 min), and adenosine (8.9 min). Incompletely hydrolyzed nucleotides and oligonucleotides eluted before 3 min. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting-Yeast mitochondria were isolated from strain EY0986/TRM5-GFP. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and immunoblotting was performed as described (24Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K. Shane B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43178-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using anti-GFP primary antibodies (1:500 dilution) or anti-Hsp60 antibodies (1:50,000 dilution). For proteinase K treatment, 50-μg aliquots of mitochondria were resuspended in 100 μl of isotonic buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). Five μl of proteinase K (1 mg ml–1) was added to samples and incubated for 15 min on ice. In some digestions, the membranes were solubilized by addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.5%) during the 10-min proteinase K treatment. Digestion was stopped by addition of 1 μlof100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in ethanol followed by a further 10-min incubation on ice. Mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and protein was analyzed by immunoblotting. TRM5 Transcript Mapping-The 5′ end of the TRM5 transcript was mapped by a primer extension-based method (RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)) using the FirstChoice RNA ligase-mediated RACE kit from Ambion. Total RNA was isolated from yeast strain DAY4 using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA contamination was eliminated using a Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). Nested antisense primers specific to the TRM5 transcript were designed for use with the two nested 5′-RACE primers provided in the kit. The TRM5-specific inner primer (5R_AGA_IP; supplemental Table S1) was complementary to nucleotides +183 to +161. The TRM5-specific outer primer (5R_AGA_OP; supplemental Table S1) was complementary to nucleotides +283 to +264. The 5′-RACE inner primer and the TRM5-specific inner primer had BamHI and HindIII sites, respectively, at their 5′ ends to facilitate cloning. PCR fragments generated in the “inner” PCRs were cloned and sequenced as described previously (24Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K. Shane B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43178-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Construction and Expression of TRM5 Truncation Mutants in Yeast-The complete sequence of the yeast TRM5 gene including 300 base pairs 5′ of the first AUG codon was amplified from yeast genomic DNA (strain DAY4) by PCR using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase and primers TRM5_FOR and TRM5_REV containing HindIII and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (supplemental Table S1). The resulting PCR product was gel-purified, digested, and ligated into the yeast low copy vectors, URA3-containing pRS416 and LEU2-containing pRS415 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to produce the pRS416-TRM5 and pRS415-TRM5 wild-type constructs (Table 1). SLIC (sequence and ligation-independent cloning) (26Li M.Z. Elledge S.J. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) was used to generate the construct with codons 1–19 deleted, using T7 forward primer versus T5_1/20_2 and T5_1/20_3 versus T3 reverse primer (supplemental Table S1). The two PCR products and the linearized pRS415 vector (digested with HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes) were gel-purified and treated with 0.5 unit of T4 DNA polymerase. The two PCR products and the vector were annealed together at a 2:2:1 molar ratio with 20 ng of RecA protein at room temperature for 30 min, and the recombined plasmid (pRS415-Δ1–19TRM5; Table 1) was recovered from transformed E. coli cells. Splice overlap extension PCR (27Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was used to generate the other truncations. For the construct with codons 1–33 deleted (pRS415-Δ1–33TRM5; Table 1), the TRM5 gene containing 300 bp of 5′-UTR in pRS416-TRM5 was amplified with primers T7 forward primer (upstream vector primer) and T5_1/34_2 (supplemental Table S1). The DNA including the region between codon 34 and the stop codon of TRM5 was PCR-amplified using primers T5_1/34_3 and T3 reverse (downstream vector primer). Primers T5_1/34_3 and T5_1/34_2 contain 18 bp of complementarity at their 5′ ends for the second splice overlap extension PCR. The resulting PCR products from two separate reactions were purified by a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and combined together for second PCR with T7 forward primer and T3 reverse primer. This product was gel-purified, digested with HindIII and BamHI, and cloned into pRS415 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct with codons 1–47 deleted was constructed similarly using primers T7 forward versus T5_1/48_2 and T5_1/48_3 versus T3 reverse for the first PCR. Primers T5_1/48_3 and T5_1/48_2 contain 18 bp of complementarity at their 5′ ends for the second splice overlap extension PCR. The procedure described above was used for the second PCR, followed by cloning into pRS415. These truncation constructs were transformed into DLY1 harboring pRS416-TRM5 for subsequent analysis. Expression of Trm5p as a Fusion Protein-Attempts to express S. cerevisiae Trm5p in E. coli fused to N- or C-terminal polyhistidine tags produced mostly insoluble protein (data not shown). Therefore the full-length TRM5 ORF (499 amino acids) was cloned into the vector pMALc2H10T to express N-terminal maltose-binding protein, decahistidine tag, and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site fused to Trm5p (MBP-Trm5). E. coli cells expressed this fusion protein at high levels in soluble form. MBP-Trm5 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, resulting in nearly homogeneous preparation of fusion protein that had an apparent mass of 97 kDa, similar to its calculated mass of 101.4 kDa (data not shown). Methyltransferase Activity of the MBP-Trm5 Fusion Protein and Its Cleavage Product-The fusion protein could be partially cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease to generate Trm5p and MBP polypeptides. The Trm5p fragment migrated on an SDS-PAGE gel with an apparent mass of 61 kDa, close to its predicted mass of 57.2 kDa, whereas the MBP fragment had an apparent mass of 42 kDa, similar to its predicted mass of 44.2 kDa. The MBP-Trm5 protein had substantial methyltransferase activity in assays using Δtrm5 tRNA as substrate (supplemental Table S2). However, preincubation with buffer alone or tobacco etch virus protease reduced the activity considerably; this appears to be due to the inherent instability of the enzyme. Thus, all subsequent experiments described here were carried out with the uncleaved fusion protein (MBP-Trm5). As a control experiment, maltose-binding protein alone was purified from empty pMALc2H10T vector. The MBP protein had no methyltransferase activity when incubated with Δtrm5 tRNA and AdoMet (data not shown). A linear relationship was observed between the amount of substrate (Δtrm5 tRNA) and the incorporation of methyl groups when a saturating amount of enzyme and 50 μm [3H]AdoMet were used in the assay (Fig. 1A). From initial rate conditions with a small amount of enzyme and saturating concentrations of the substrates, a specific enzymatic activity of 30 ± 1.3 nmol of methyl incorporated per min per mg fusion protein was calculated. MBP-Trm5 did not catalyze the methylation of wild-type S. cerevisiae total tRNA (data not shown), presumably because it was already fully methylated.

Here we report the crystal structure of VIP36 exoplasmic/luminal domain comprising a carbohydrate recognition domain and a stalk domain. The structures of VIP36 in complex with Ca2+ and mannosyl ligands are also described. The carbohydrate recognition domain is composed of a 17-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich and binds one Ca2+ adjoining the carbohydrate-binding site. The structure reveals that a coordinated Ca2+ ion orients the side chains of Asp131, Asn166, and His190 for carbohydrate binding. This result explains the Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding of this protein. The Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,2-Man, which corresponds to the D1 arm of high mannose type glycan, is recognized by eight residues through extensive hydrogen bonds. The complex structures reveal the structural basis for high mannose type glycoprotein recognition by VIP36 in a Ca2+-dependent and D1 arm-specific manner.

In eukaryotic cells, post-translational modification of secreted proteins and intracellular protein transport between organelles are ubiquitous features. One of the most studied systems is the N-linked glycosylation pathway in the synthesis of secreted glycoproteins (1Fiedler K. Simons K.

The N-linked glycoproteins are subjected to diverse modifications and are transported through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumERGICER-Golgi intermediate compartmentCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseSPRsurface plasmon resonanceMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidConAconcanavalin A.3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumERGICER-Golgi intermediate compartmentCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseSPRsurface plasmon resonanceMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidConAconcanavalin A. via the Golgi apparatus to their final destinations inside and outside of the cell. Incorporation of the cargo glycoproteins into the transport vesicles is mediated by transmembrane cargo receptors, which have been identified as intracellular lectins. For example, mannose 6-phosphate receptor (4Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Korfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

VIP36, vesicular-integral protein of 36 kDa, was originally isolated from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as a component of detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched complexes containing apical marker (8Fiedler K. White J. Grill S. Füllekrug J. Stelzer E.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Confocal and immunoelectron microscopic experiments have suggested that VIP36 is distributed by either the pre-Golgi secretory pathway (9Füllekrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J.

Cytochem. 2003; 51: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore we showed that VIP36 is involved in intracellular transport, in the secretion of glycoproteins (e.g. clusterin) from polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (13Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Ideo H. Shimada O. Atsumi S. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16332-16339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and in the secretion of α-amylase from rat parotid glands (14Hara-Kuge S. Seko A. Shimada O. Tosaka-Shimada H. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Taken together, VIP36 appears to play significant roles not only in vesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi complex but also from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. The exoplasmic/luminal domain of VIP36 as well as the luminal domain of ERGIC-53 and Emp46/47p share homology with L (leguminous)-type lectins and are thus identified as carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). It has been shown that ERGIC-53 interacts with glycoproteins carrying high mannose type glycan by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment (15Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 16Moussalli M. Pipe S.W. Hauri H.P. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12943-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have previously found that VIP36 has high affinity for high mannose type glycans containing Man-α-1,2-Man residues in Man7-9(GlcNAc)2-Asn peptides (19Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Kamiya et al. (20Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. Kato K. J.

This work suggested the Ca2+ dependence of carbohydrate binding and the specificity for the D1 arm, Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,2-Man residues, of high mannose type glycans (corresponding to Man(D1)-Man(C)-Man(4); Fig. 1). In addition, using a flow cytometry-based method, it was also demonstrated that VIP36 binds glycoproteins carrying high mannose type glycans (21Kawasaki N. Matsuo I. Totani K. Nawa D. Suzuki N. Yamaguchi D. Matsumoto N. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that VIP36 is involved in the transport of glycoproteins via high mannose type glycans. Crystal structures of the CRD of rat ERGIC-53 in the absence and presence of Ca2+ have been determined, confirming its structural similarity to the L-type lectins (22Velloso L.M. Svensson K.

Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these reports, it was shown that the putative ligand-binding site of ERGIC-53 is similar to the mannose-binding site of the L-type lectins. Very recently, we reported the crystal structures of the CRD of Ca2+-independent K+-bound Emp46p and the metal-free form of Emp47p (24Satoh T. Sato K. Kanoh A. Yamashita K. Yamada Y. Igarashi N. Kato R. Nakano A. Wakatsuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10410-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To date, however, no structures of transport lectins in complex with high mannose type glycans have been determined. To investigate the structural basis of the mechanism of high mannose type glycoprotein recognition by VIP36, we determined crystal structures of the exoplasmic/luminal domain of VIP36 alone and in complex with Ca2+ and mannose, Man-α-1,2-Man (termed Man2, which corresponds to Man(D1)-Man(C), Man(C)-Man(4), Man(D2)-Man(A), or Man(D3)-Man(B) of Man9(GlcNAc)2; Fig. 1), and Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,3-Man-β-1,4-GlcNAc (termed Man3GlcNAc, which corresponds to Man(C)-Man(4)-Man(3)-GlcNAc(2); Fig. 1).

Finally complete deprotection of synthesized mannotriose derivatives (xii, xiii, and xiv) afforded α-d-mannopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-d-mannopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-d-mannopyranose, α-d-mannopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-d-mannopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-d-mannopyranose, and α-d-mannopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-d-mannopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-mannopyranose, respectively. These mannotrioses were isolated on a COSMOSIL Sugar-D column (Nacalai Tesque) using an isocratic solvent composed of 65% MeCN and 35% H2O. NMR and MS spectra of these compounds were in good agreement with those reported for closely related compounds (29Allerhand A. Berman E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 2412-2420Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Tanimoto T. Ikuta A. Sugiyama M. Koizumi K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 2002; 50: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Preparation of Man3GlcNAc and Man6(GlcNAc)2-Asn—Man3GlcNAc was prepared from urine of a mannosidosis patient as described previously (31Yamashita K. Tachibana Y. Mihara K. Okada S. Yabuuchi H. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5126-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 10 ml of urine containing 10 mg of creatinine was concentrated to 1 ml and centrifuged for 20 min at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant was subjected to Bio-Gel P-4 (200-400 mesh) column chromatography (2.6 × 97 cm). The column was eluted with water containing 0.002% phenylmercuric nitrate, and the hexose content in each fraction was analyzed with phenol-sulfuric acid reagent. Fractions between Man2GlcNAc and Man4GlcNAc were pooled, sequentially subjected to Bio-Gel P-4 (under 400 mesh) column chromatography (2 × 100 cm) at 55 °C, and eluted with distilled water by monitoring with a refractometer. The fraction corresponding to Man3GlcNAc was collected, and the structure of Man3GlcNAc was identified as Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,3-Man-β-1,4-GlcNAc by methylation analysis and sequential exoglycosidase digestion using Manα1→2-specific Aspergillus saitoi α-mannosidase, jack bean α-mannosidase, and snail β-mannosidase. The yield was 1100 nmol. Man6(GlcNAc)2-Asn was prepared from ovalbumin as described previously (32Tai T. Yamashita K. Ogata-Arakawa M. Koide N. Muramatsu T. Iwashita S. Inoue Y. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8569-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA fragment for residues 51-301, which correspond to the CRD and part of the stalk domain of canine VIP36, was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX4T-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare). The recombinant VIP36 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were harvested after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Wako) for 15 h at 20 °C and lysed by sonication in phosphate buffered saline buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2. The cell lysate was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was eluted by glutathione (Wako) and cleaved by thrombin protease (GE Healthcare). The cleaved proteins were passed through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column to remove GST protein and further purified by a benzamidine-Sepharose 4FF column (GE Healthcare) to remove the thrombin protease. The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm MES (pH 6.5) and 2 mm CaCl2. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were screened using the Large Scale Protein Crystallization and Monitoring System (PXS) (33Hiraki M. Kato R. Nagai M. Satoh T. Hirano S. Ihara K. Kudo N. Nagae M. Kobayashi M. Inoue M. Uejima T. Oda S. Chavas L.M. Akutsu M. Yamada Y. Kawasaki M. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Wakatsuki S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The crystallization conditions of VIP36 in its Ca2+-bound form were obtained in a buffer containing 18 mg ml-1 protein, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 1.5 m NaCl, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5) with incubation at 277 K for 4 days. For the metal free-form, the Ca2+-bound crystal was soaked with this buffer containing 10 mm EDTA to remove Ca2+. The crystal of Ca2+.Man-bound VIP36 was obtained by soaking the Ca2+-bound crystal with the buffer containing 50 mmd-mannose (Sigma). The Ca2+.Man2-bound VIP36 was co-crystallized in a buffer containing 10 mg ml-1 protein, 3.4 mm 2α-mannobiose (Sigma), 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.3 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5) with incubation at 277 K for 1 week. On the other hand, the Ca2+.Man3GlcNAc-bound VIP36 was co-crystallized in a buffer containing 10 mg ml-1 protein, 3.4 mm Man3GlcNAc, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.4 m imidazole malate (pH 6.0) with incubation at 277 K for 3 weeks. Despite the extensive co-crystallization with Man3GlcNAc the electron density map did not show any interaction with the GlcNAc moiety; only the Man3 portion was recognized by VIP36. Data sets of the metal-free and Ca2+.Man2 - and Ca2+. Man3GlcNAc-bound forms were collected under cryogenic conditions with crystals soaked with a cryoprotectant buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The Ca2+-, Ca2+.Man-bound crystals were soaked with a buffer containing 2.5 m LiCl instead of 1.5 m NaCl for data collection under cryogenic conditions. The diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The metal-free and Ca2+-, Ca2+.Man-, and Ca2+.Man2-bound crystals belong to space group C2 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. In contrast, the Ca2+.Man3GlcNAc-bound crystal belongs to space group P212121 with five molecules per asymmetric unit.

Computer-aided Model Building—The model of VIP36·Man8(GlcNAc)2-Asn complex was built using coordinates of well ordered high mannose type glycans on glycoprotein crystal structures (human pancreatic α-amylase (Protein Data Bank code 1BSI), Erythrina corallodendron lectin (Protein Data Bank code 1LTE), and exo-(1,3)-β-glucanase (Protein Data Bank code 1H4P)) and mannosyl ligand-bound VIP36 structures. The corresponding glycan residues were superimposed on each other, and appropriate coordinates were used as follows: Asn-GlcNAc(1), Protein Data Bank code 1BSI; GlcNAc(2), Protein Data Bank code 1LTE; Man(3)-Man(4)-Man(C), Man3GlcNAc-bound VIP36; Man(D1), Man2-bound VIP36; Man(4′)-(Man(A))-Man(B)-Man(D3), Protein Data Bank code 1H4P; VIP36, Man2-bound form. Based on the above model and human salivary α-amylase (Protein Data Bank code 1SMD) structures, the complex model of VIP36·rat salivary α-amylase carrying Man8(GlcNAc)2 was built. The salivary α-amylase was docked onto the VIP36·Man8(GlcNAc)2-Asn complex model through super-imposition with an N-glycosylation site (Asn461) of the salivary α-amylase and the asparagine residue of the high mannose type glycan bound with VIP36. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a Biacore 2000 (Biacore) equipped with a CM5 sensor chip. GST-VIP36 (residues 51-322) was purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and benzamidine-Sepharose 4FF columns. The purified protein was immobilized on the flow cell using the amine coupling method. Various concentrations of mannotrioses (Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,2-Man, Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,3-Man, and Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,6-Man) and Man6(GlcNAc)2-Asn in sample buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 6.0) and 1 mm CaCl2) were injected over the flow cells at a flow rate of 20 μl/min using HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20) as the running buffer. Crystallization and Overall Structure of Exoplasmic/Luminal Domain of VIP36—The exoplasmic/luminal domain (residues 51-301) of VIP36, corresponding to the CRD and part of the short stalk domain, was crystallized. Despite extensive crystallization screening, diffraction quality crystals of the CRD (residues 51-278) alone could not be produced. The crystal structure of the exoplasmic/luminal domain of Ca2+-bound VIP36 was solved by the molecular replacement method using the Ca2+-bound ERGIC-53 CRD (Protein Data Bank code 1R1Z) (23Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as a search model. The crystal belongs to space group C2 with two molecules (A and B) per asymmetric unit. Both VIP36 molecules are related by ∼2-fold symmetry, forming a pseudo-homodimer. However, gel filtration data demonstrate that this protein is monomeric in solution (supplemental Fig. 1). To obtain crystals of mannose-bound VIP36, the Ca2+-bound crystals were soaked in a solution containing mannose in molar excess. The Man2-bound form was obtained by co-crystallization. To obtain the metal-free form, the Ca2+-bound crystal was soaked with buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. Crystallization of VIP36 in the absence of Ca2+ was not successful. Following treatment with EDTA the Ca2+ is completely absent from molecule B, whereas approximately half of the Ca2+ ions are removed from molecule A. In the C2 crystal form, crystallization of VIP36 in complex with longer oligomannoses was not successful due to the crystal packing around the ligand-binding site. To find other crystal forms, we therefore carried out crystallization screening in the presence of Ca2+ and longer oligomannoses, Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,2-Man, Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,3-Man, Man3GlcNAc, and Man6(GlcNAc)2-Asn. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained from co-crystallization with the Man3GlcNAc alone. The crystal belongs to space group P212121 with five molecules (A, B, C, D, and E) per asymmetric unit. The structure has the Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,3-Man moiety in molecules A and B, whereas the GlcNAc moiety is disordered. In contrast, only one mannose residue is ordered in molecule C, and all the carbohydrate residues are disordered in molecules D and E. The dimer interfaces of the P212121 crystal form are different from that of the C2 crystal form, suggesting that VIP36 is monomeric. The CRD of VIP36 has an overall globular shape composed of a β-sandwich of two antiparallel β-sheets and is composed of 17 β-strands and three 310 helices, each with a single turn (Fig. 2A). The β-sandwich comprises a seven-stranded (β2-β5-β14-β7-β8-β9-β10) concave β-sheet and a six-stranded (β1a,b-β15-β6-β11-β12-β13a) convex β-sheet in a variation of the jelly roll fold. The β-strands are numbered according to the secondary structure numbering scheme of ERGIC-53 (22Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A β-hairpin (strands β3 and β4) is inserted between β2 and β5. Residues Cys202 (strand β10) and Cys239 (strand β13a) form a disulfide bond. The stalk domain is composed of a β-strand (β16), a short α-helix (H4), and one turn of a 310 helix (H5). The β16 forms a β-sheet with β13b on the face of the protein opposite to the ligand-binding site between the concave and convex β-sheets. The stalk domain (residues 289-301) contributes to an extensive crystal contact (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 2) that explains the successful crystallization of this construct. Ca2+-binding Site and Its Structural Changes in VIP36 CRD—The Fo - Fc electron density map of VIP36 shows one prominent peak corresponding to a Ca2+ ion coordinated between two loops, which are termed Loop 1 (between β8 and β9) and Loop 2 (between β9 and β10). The side-chain oxygen atom of Asp162 (Oδ-1 and Oδ-2), Asn166 (Oδ-1), and Asp193 (Oδ-2); main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Tyr164 (O); and two water molecules termed W1 and W2 (O) are coordinated to the Ca2+ with distances of 2.4-2.5 Å (Fig. 3). Upon Ca2+ binding, significant conformational changes occur around Loops 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Large movements of the Ca2+-coordinating and neighboring atoms are observed for the Oδ-2 of Asp131, Oδ-1 of Asn166, and Nδ-1 of His190. The distances are 1.7, 1.6, and 4.0 Å, respectively. The Oδ-2 of Asp131 and Nδ-1 atom of His190 form hydrogen bonds with Ca2+-coordinating water molecules W1 and W2, respectively, whereas the Oδ-1 of Asn166 is directly coordinated with Ca2+. As we will describe further below, these residues bind the carbohydrate moiety in the presence of Ca2+ suggesting a mechanism for the Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding of VIP36. Specific Binding of VIP36 to D1 Arm of High Mannose Type Glycan—Previous studies have suggested that VIP36 CRD recognizes D1 arm, Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,2-Man residues of high mannose type glycans (19Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Ito Y.

In fact, we observed using SPR analysis that VIP36 has higher affinity for Man-α-1,2-Man-α-1,2-M"

The ability of these species to traverse the epithelium of the airway mucosa was modeled in vitro using polarized respiratory epithelial cells in culture. Migration across the epithelial barrier was preceded by loss of transepithelial resistance. Membrane products of S. pneumoniae that included lipoteichoic acid induced disruption of the epithelial barrier in a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent manner. This result correlates with a recent genetic study that associates increased TLR2 signaling with increased rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in humans. Loss of transepithelial resistance by the TLR2 ligand correlated with activation of p38 MAP kinase and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. Activation of p38 MAPK and TGF-β signaling in epithelial cells upon nasal infection with S. pneumoniae was also demonstrated in vivo. Inhibition of either p38 MAPK or TGF-β signaling was sufficient to inhibit the migration of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Our data shows that diverse bacteria utilize common mechanisms, including MAPK and TGF-β signaling pathways to disrupt epithelial barriers and promote invasion.

Our data shows that diverse bacteria utilize common mechanisms, including MAPK and TGF-β signaling pathways to disrupt epithelial barriers and promote invasion. Epithelial surfaces form tight barriers that are highly effective at blocking penetration by most microbes. Mucosal surfaces in particular are constantly exposed to a variety of microbial species, yet few of these species are proficient in causing invasive infection from this niche. Invasion from the mucosa requires attachment to the epithelial surface, transepithelial migration, and evasion of immune mechanisms that target penetrating organisms. In the case of bacterial pathogens of the human respiratory tract, two of the members of the microbial flora commonly associated with invasive infection are the Gram-positive species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the Gram-negative species Haemophilus influenzae. Although distantly related, both share the ability to colonize the mucosal surface of the upper airway and directly invade host barriers at this site. For S. pneumoniae this event is particularly common during infancy and is referred to as occult bacteremia. When isolates of either of these species express a capsular polysaccharide, which inhibits clearance by complement, antibody and phagocytes, they are capable of surviving in the bloodstream and causing life-threatening diseases including septicemia and meningitis. Encapsulated S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain among the leading causes of infectious diseases with an estimated annual worldwide mortality in children of 1.0 and 0.4 million, respectively (www.who.int).Host and bacterial processes that allow for adherence to epithelial surfaces and survival in the bloodstream have been studied in detail. In contrast, it is not understood how these pathogens pass through the epithelial cell barrier. Many invasive pathogens are thought to transit from the apical to basolateral surface through an intracellular route. The expression of a thick capsular polysaccharide layer, however, inhibits invasion into host cells (1Hammerschmidt S. Wolff S. Hocke A. Rosseau S. Muller E. Rohde M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4653-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Ring A. Weiser J.N. Tuomanen E.I. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been suggested that expression of tissue-damaging toxins, such as the pore-forming, cholesterol binding cytotoxin, pneumolysin, expressed by S. pneumoniae facilitates passage through tissue barriers (3Rayner C.F. Jackson A.D. Rutman A. Dewar A. Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Cole P.J. Wilson R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 442-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Another possibility is that the inflammatory responses to these organisms contribute to the breakdown of epithelial defenses and its barrier function. Innate immune response of human epithelial cells in culture to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae has been examined. H. influenzae has been reported to induce responses through pattern recognition receptors, Tolllike receptors (TLR) 2The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseLTAlipoteichoic acidTERtransepithelial resistancecfucolony forming unitPBSphosphate-buffered salineILinterleukinsiRNAsmall interfering RNATGFtransforming growth factor. 2The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseLTAlipoteichoic acidTERtransepithelial resistancecfucolony forming unitPBSphosphate-buffered salineILinterleukinsiRNAsmall interfering RNATGFtransforming growth factor. 2 and 4, which bind its lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide, respectively (4Shuto T.

Mice lacking TLR2, for example, are more susceptible to overwhelming infection with S. pneumoniae (12Echchannaoui H. Frei K. Schnell C. Leib S.L. Zimmerli W. Landmann R. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, both species express phosphorylcholine on their surface and can bind and initiate signaling through mimicry of platelet activating factor and ligation of its receptor (2Ring A.

For instance, a recent clinical study of >6000 individuals with invasive infection, including patients with S. pneumoniae, examined the effect of polymorphisms in the adaptor protein Mal (also known as TIRAP), which mediates downstream signaling of TLRs including TLR2 (14Khor C.C. Chapman S.J. Vannberg F.O. Dunne A. Murphy C. Ling E.Y. Frodsham A.J. Walley A.J. Kyrieleis O. Khan A. Aucan C. Segal S. Moore C.E. Knox K. Campbell S.J. Lienhardt C. Scott A. Aaby P. Sow O.Y.

This study showed that the Mal S180L variant attenuated TLR2 signal transduction and was associated with a lower rather than higher incidence of pneumococcal and other invasive infections (14Khor C.C.

These events were modeled using polarized human respiratory tract epithelial cells in culture. We demonstrate that bacterial recognition by TLR2 leads to p38 MAPK and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling that induces a disruption of the barrier function and allows for transepithelial migration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Products—An encapsulated strain of S. pneumoniae D39, as well as its unencapsulated and unencapsulated pneumolysin-deficient derivatives, were grown as described (16Ratner A.J. Lysenko E.S. Paul M.N. Weiser J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3429-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A clinical isolate of nontypeable H. influenzae, H233, was grown in brain heart infusion media supplemented with 2% Fildes enrichment and 2 μg/ml NAD (sBHI; Difco Laboratories). Phosphorylcholine expressing and non-expressing variants were previously described (17Gould J.M. Weiser J.N. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was obtained from W. Fischer and isolated as described (18Klein R.A. Hartmann R. Egge H. Behr T. Fischer W. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 256: 189-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus LTA, Pam3CSK4, and Pam2CSK4 were purchased from InvivoGen.Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—16HBE14o- (19Ehrhardt C. Kneuer C. Fiegel J. Hanes J. Schaefer U.F. Kim K.J. Lehr C.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 308: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), HEK293 and Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Polarized epithelial cell layers were grown as liquid-liquid interface cultures. 16HBE and Caco-2 cells were plated in 6.5-mm, 0.4-μm pore size transwell inserts for stimulation assays or in 24-mm, 3-μm pore size inserts for migration assays (Costa). The cells were cultured for at least 5 days and used for experiments when confluent and a transepithelial resistance (TER) of at least 300 Ohm cm2 was reached. TER measurements were performed using an ohmmeter (EVOM; World Precision Instruments). Lactic dehydrogenase release was measured using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche).Migration Assay—S. pneumoniae was grown to mid-log phase (A620 = 0.2) and diluted in tissue culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum) without antibiotics. At time 0, the media on the apical side of the transwell inserts (24-mm, 3-μm pore size) was replaced with bacterial suspension (2 × 104 colony forming units (cfu)/ml), and replaced with culture media after 10 and 14 h. During this period the bacterial density in the apical compartment expanded by ∼100-fold. Every 2 h, 100 μl of media was removed from the basolateral compartment and plated for quantitative culture and 100 μl of fresh media was replaced in the basolateral compartment. A transwell was considered to be passed by bacteria at the initial time point that one or more organisms could be detected in the basolateral media. To investigate the effect of SB203580 (BIOSOURCE) and SB431542 (BIOSOURCE) on migration time, transwells were preincubated with 10 μm of the inhibitors for 1 h before inoculation of bacteria (4 × 105 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae, 106 cfu/ml H. influenzae). To confirm that differences in migration time were not due to differential bacterial growth, aliquots of the apical compartment were cultured at different time points and plated at appropriate dilutions.Fractionation of Bacteria—Unencapsulated S. pneumoniae (D39) were grown as a 400-ml culture to an A620 of 0.4, harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Bacteria were lysed using a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet containing the cell wall and membrane fraction (referred as membrane fraction) was resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, diluted 1/40 in culture media, and applied to 16HBE on transwells. For further studies, the membrane fraction was treated for 60 min, with or without 400 μg/ml Proteinase K or for 12 h at 4 °C, or with or without 0.05 m periodate (Sigma) in sodium acetate buffer, 50 mm, pH 4.2. The fractions were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS before addition to cells. Efficient digestion of proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Where indicated, the membrane fraction was treated for 120 min with or without 0.2 m NaOH at 37 °C and neutralized with HCl.Stimulation of Cells with Bacteria and Bacterial Factors—16HBE and HEK293 cells cultured as submersed cultures or on transwells as described above were incubated with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, LTA from S. aureus, Pam3CSK4, Pam2CSK4, the membrane fractions of S. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae LTA, and TGF-β1 (BIOSOURCE) at the indicated densities and concentrations. TER was measured at the indicated time points and supernatants were collected to measure interleukin (IL) 8 release. To investigate the effect of the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 (BIOSOURCE) and SB202190 (BIOSOURCE) and the TGF-βR1 inhibitor SB431542 (BIOSOURCE) on TER, the cells were preincubated for 30 min with the inhibitor (each at a final concentration of 10 μm) before different stimuli were applied.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—16HBE cells plated on collagen-coated chamber slides or cultured on transwells were washed with PBS, fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed again, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies against E-cadherin (Zymed Laboratories) or with an antiserum against whole S. pneumoniae or p-Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed, incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at room temperature, washed again, and mounted with mounting media. Image analysis was carried out using an Olympus fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser-scanning microscope.Mouse Model of Nasopharyngeal Colonization and Immunohistochemistry—Six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Taconic and housed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. The mouse model of nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae was previously described (20McCool T.L. Cate T.R. Moy G. Weiser J.N. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 × 107 cfu of PBS-washed, mid-log phase S. pneumoniae in 10 μl of PBS applied equally to both nares; mock-colonized animals were inoculated with an equivalent volume of PBS suspension. At the times indicated post-inoculation, the animals were sacrificed.Animal tissues were obtained after decapitation, and fixed and decalcified by serial overnight incubations in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and Decal decalcification agent (Decal Corporation). Tissue to be embedded in paraffin was dehydrated with a series of ethanols and xylene, embedded in paraffin, and 7-μm sections were cut. Sections were rehydrated through xylene and ethanols and stained with hematoxilin. For immunohistochemical studies, slides were microwaved in 10 mm citric acid buffer, pH 6.0, and then endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Endogenous biotin was blocked with an Avidin-Biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by peptide blocking with protein blocking reagent (Coulter/Immunotech, Miami, FL). p-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling) and p-Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were detected with primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100. A biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary or anti-goat secondary (Vector Laboratories) was added followed by avidin-horseradish peroxidase ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). Signal was developed using the DAB kit (Vector Laboratories). Imaging was performed on a Nikon E600 Eclipse microscope equipped with a high-resolution CCD digital camera (CoolSnap CF, Roper Scientific) with Nomarski optics.Western Blotting—16HBE cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and aliquots with equivalent total protein concentrations were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed for phosphorylated p38 MAPK using the PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK antibody kit (Cell Signaling). Afterward, blots were stripped and reprobed for total p38 MAPK.Enzyme-linked Imunosorbent Assay—Concentrations of IL-8 and TGF-β1 were determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pharmingen OptEIA). Conditions were compared by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey test for multiple comparisons (Prism GraphPad software).RNA-mediated Interference—Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides against TLR2 (ID111285) and a control siRNA with no similarity to any human gene sequence were designed and synthesized by Ambion. Transfection of Caco-2 cells with siRNA was performed using the Nucleofector System (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well on collagen-coated transwells (6.5-mm, 0.4-μm pore size). 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with Pam2CSK4 or S. aureus LTA. TER was measured at the indicated time points. 72 h after transfection, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis as described using a monoclonal antibody to human TLR2 (InvivoGen) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam).Statistical Analysis—Comparisons between experimental groups were performed using Student's t test or the analysis of variance as appropriate. Differences in the migration time were compared using a log rank test. Results were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05.RESULTSS. pneumoniae Migrates between Polarized Respiratory Epithelial Cells—To investigate mechanisms involved in the migration of bacteria through polarized respiratory epithelial cells, we used an in vitro model consisting of the bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE maintained as liquid-liquid interface cultures. 16HBE cells formed a polarized cell layer with a TER of 300-400 Ohm cm2.S. pneumoniae isolate D39 and genetically defined unencapsulated mutants of this strain expressing or not expressing the cytotoxin pneumolysin were used to examine bacterial passage through the cell barrier. Fig. 1A shows the earliest time point when bacteria were detected in the basolateral compartment after addition of S. pneumoniae to the apical compartment of polarized 16HBE. All strains tested were eventually able to gain access to the basolateral compartment. However, the average migration time was higher for bacteria with capsule compared with bacteria without capsule, whereas the lack of pneumolysin did not significantly influence the migration time. Differences in migration time were not due to different bacterial growth rates as the numbers of bacteria were similar among the different strains in the apical compartments at all time points (data not shown). To investigate the effect of S. pneumoniae on barrier function, TER of polarized 16HBE was measured 8 and 20 h after infection with S. pneumoniae. Fig. 1B shows that migration of the bacteria through the barrier was associated with a loss of TER. Bacteria without capsule induced a significantly higher loss of TER compared with bacteria with capsule. There was only a slight and not significant difference between the loss of TER induced by the pneumolysin mutant and the unencapsulated D39. The decline in TER could not be attributed to cell death because at 8 h after infection no rise in lactic dehydrogenase levels in the culture media was detected (data not shown).The decrease in TER consistently occurred prior to detection of bacteria in the basolateral compartment. This suggested that S. pneumoniae might be passing between cells following the disruption of the barrier formed by tight junctions. Further evidence in support of paracellular spread was demonstrated by bacterial co-localization with cell junctions. 12 h after inoculation, the tissue was fixed and co-localization of S. pneumoniae with E-cadherin, located at intercellular junctions, was shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2A, S. pneumoniae co-localize with intercellular junctions. 12 h after inoculation of differentiated 16HBE cells with bacteria the tissue was fixed and co-localization of S. pneumoniae (red) with E-cadherin (green) was shown by confocal microscopy (arrows).

S. pneumoniae were lysed and the membrane fraction was separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by ultracentrifugation. The membrane fraction was sufficient to induce a loss of TER in polarized 16HBE cells (Fig. 3A) without leading to a release of LDH (data not shown). Interestingly, there was no loss of TER when the membrane fraction was applied basolaterally (data not shown). To further analyze the bacterial factors involved, the membrane fraction was digested with proteinase K. Fig. 3A shows that proteinase K digestion of the membrane fraction had minimal impact on the TER reducing activity, showing that factors other than proteins contributed to the loss of TER. The efficiency of proteinase K treatment was shown by silver staining of a polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). To examine if factors containing carbohydrates were involved in the loss of TER, the membrane fraction was treated with periodate. Periodate treatment resulted in a complete loss of activity of the membrane fraction (Fig. 3A). A prominent non-proteinaceous membrane-associated structure of Gram-positive bacteria that contains carbohydrate is LTA. LTA also contains acyl chains and can be deacylated by mild NaOH treatment. Mild NaOH treatment resulted in a complete loss of activity of the membrane fraction. Together these findings indicated that LTA was necessary to cause the loss of TER by the S. pneumoniae membrane fraction. Next, we investigated if LTA was sufficient to induce loss of TER in our polarized epithelial cell model. Polarized 16HBE were incubated with highly purified LTA from S. pneumoniae or commercially obtained LTA from S. aureus. Both LTA preparations induced a loss of TER and were as potent as the synthetic TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 3Cell membrane-associated factors of S. pneumoniae induce disruption of polarized epithelial cells. A, differentiated 16HBE cells were inoculated apically with the purified membrane fraction of S. pneumoniae for 24 h. TER was measured and is shown as the percentage of the initial TER (0 h). Untreated and proteinase K-treated, but not NaOH- or periodate-treated membrane fractions induced loss of TER.

Stimulation with the membrane fraction or a synthetic ligand of TLR2 resulted in release of IL-8 by TLR2-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, periodate and NaOH treatment of the membrane fraction resulted in a loss of activity (Fig. 3B). HEK293 cells carrying a control plasmid did not release any IL-8 after stimulation with the membrane fraction or synthetic ligand (data not shown). The preparation of purified S. pneumoniae LTA was also sufficient to induce IL-8 secretion by HEK293 cells overexpressing TLR2 but had no effect on control cells (Fig. 4B).To further determine whether activation of TLR2 induces loss of TER, Caco-2 epithelial cells were transfected with siRNA against TLR2 or a control siRNA. siRNA studies were performed with the Caco-2 cell line because differentiated 16HBE cells were resistant to transfection with siRNA. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells with the synthetic TLR2 ligand Pam2CSK4 and LTA from S. aureus resulted in loss of TER (Fig. 5, A and B). Transfection of Caco-2 cells with siRNA directed against TLR2 blunted the reduction of TER in response to both TLR2 ligands compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Reduced expression of TLR2 after siRNA transfection was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5TLR2 mediates loss of barrier in polarized Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were transfected with siRNA directed against TLR2 or control siRNA. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with S. aureus LTA (Sa LTA, A) or Pam2CSK4 (B) for 6 and 3 h, respectively. TER was measured and is shown as percentage of the initial TER (0 h). Values represent the mean of four determinations ± S.D. *, p < 0.001.

Kim C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). APs are synthesized as single chain preproenzymes and, upon activation, converted to mature two-chain enzymes. A characteristic feature of “typical” plant AP precursors is the presence of a protein domain of ∼100 amino acids known as the plant-specific insert, which is highly similar to saposin-like proteins and is removed from the precursors upon activation into the mature form of the enzymes (1Simoes I. Kim C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).

Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) have triggered a redefinition of the classification of plant APs. Faro and Gal have recently proposed a new classification that takes into account the diversity of plant APs by grouping them into typical, nucellin-like, and atypical members, with the latter group comprising the majority of the newly identified Arabidopsis APs (11Faro C. Kim S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite having low sequence identity, these atypical and nucellin-like APs share several common features such as 1) the absence of the internal segment plant-specific insert in their sequence, 2) an unusually high number of cysteines, 3) the type of amino acids preceding the first catalytic triad, and 4) unexpected localizations, which clearly differentiate them from the well studied typical plant APs. Thus far, only a rather small number of atypical and nucellin-like APs have been studied (2Ge X. Kim C. Matsuno M. Li G. Berg H. Xia Y.

Biol. 1997; 35: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggest functional specialization of these particular set of plant APs as found e.g. in mammalian renin as well as tight activity regulation, in contrast to the rather unspecific housekeeping role normally ascribed to typical plant APs. Therefore, there is an increasing interest on the structure and function of atypical and nucellin-like APs. Arabidopsis CDR1 is a member of the larger group of the atypical APs and was first identified by Xia and co-workers (7Xia Y. Kim H. Borevitz J. Blount J. Guo Z. Patel K. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) while screening for gain-of-function mutants displaying enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens. CDR1 is an extracellular AP, and this was the first time a phenotype was associated with the gain-of-function of a gene coding for a plant AP. The enhanced resistance of the CDR1 gain-of-function mutant is likely due to the proteolytic generation of an endogenous peptide elicitor, which might be involved in the activation of salicylic acid-dependent local and systemic defense responses. The systemic acquired resistance is an inducible plant defense response, conferring long lasting protection against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Given the controversy on the nature of the systemic signal for systemic acquired resistance (13Durrant W.E. Kim X. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 14Kunkel B.N. Kim D.M. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 2002; 419: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), an extensive characterization of CDR1 could give insights into the mechanism by which this atypical AP exerts its function in disease resistance signaling. Here, we report the characterization of recombinant CDR1 overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme displays unique enzymatic properties if compared with other plant APs and unprecedented structure-function relationships. The results herein described, in combination with the very specific plant phenotype previously reported, strongly support the concept that CDR1 exerts precise, limited, and highly regulated proteolytic functions. Plant Material—Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia were seeded and grown in a climatic room, under continuous light at 25 °C. Seedlings were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C until use. cDNA Cloning of Arabidopsis CDR1—Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and its quality was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with a first strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for reverse transcription-PCR (Roche Applied Science) using 1 μg of total RNA. The resulting first strand cDNA was then used as a PCR template with A. thaliana CDR1-specific primers for the 5′-ATGGCCTCTCTATTCTCTTCAGT (forward) and 3′-CTACATCTTTGCACAATCTGTTG (reverse) ends of the open reading frame of CDR1. These primers were synthesized according to the mRNA sequence deposited in the EBI Data Bank with the accession number AY243479. Full-length CDR1-amplified cDNA was cloned, and both stands were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing. Expression, Refolding, and Purification of Recombinant CDR1 and Active-site Mutant in E. coli—CDR1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers that include restriction sites for NheI 5′-GCTAGCAAGCCAAAACTAGGCTTCACCGCGG and BamHI 5′-GGATCCCTACATCTTTGCACAATCTGTTGG. The resulting PCR-amplified product, without the putative signal sequence, was subcloned in pET-23d expression vector (Novagen). The positive clones selected by restriction analysis were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the active-site mutant CDR1(D108A) in the vector pET23d using the primers 5′-ATCATGGCCATCGCCGCCACCGGAAGTGATCTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GAGATCACTTCCGGTGGCGGCGATGGCCATGAT-3′ (reverse primer) (mutation underlined). The positive mutant clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both constructs, CDR1 wild-type (wtCDR1) and the mutant CDR1(D108A), were transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The method of recombinant protein purification was adapted from Castanheira et al. (16Castanheira P. Kim B. Sergeant K. Clemente J.C. Dunn B.M. Pires E. Van B.J. Faro C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, after growth of the cells at 37 °C to D600 of 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration). After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), and lysed with lysozyme (100 μg/ml). After freezing and thawing, DNase (100 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (100 mm) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell lysate was then diluted into 1 liter of 50 mm Tris/50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and washed overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Then, the material was centrifuged at 10,000 × g and washed again overnight with 50 mm Tris/50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the purified inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea, with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The protein was refolded by rapid dilution (20-fold) into 20 mm Tris, and the pH was slowly adjusted to pH 8.0. The recombinant protein was then concentrated in a tangential flow ultrafiltration system (Pellicon 2, Millipore), ultracentrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant applied to an S-300 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/0.4 m urea, pH 8.0, buffer. The protein fractions corresponding to the non-aggregated forms of wild-type or mutant recombinant CDR1 were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography with a High Q (Bio-Rad) column followed by a Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) column in an fast-protein liquid chromatography system using the same buffer used for S-300 chromatography. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min or 0.75 ml/min, respectively. Protease Activity Screening Assays—Fluorescein isothiocarbamoyl casein (FTC-casein, Pierce) was used as a substrate to measure purified recombinant CDR1 proteolytic activity. Activity was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a stock solution of FTC-casein was diluted in 25 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.4, and the reaction was started by adding recombinant wtCDR1. The assay mixture was incubated for 5 h at room temperature. Relative fluorescence was measured in a spectrofluorometer, and an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm were used to monitor proteolytic activity. The effect of the selective inhibitor pepstatin was also tested by preincubating the inhibitor for 15 min at 37 °C with the enzyme before adding the substrate FTC-casein. The activity toward hemoglobin was tested as follows; a solution of acid-denatured hemoglobin in 0.1 m formate buffer, pH 3.0, was incubated with the purified recombinant wtCDR1 for 3 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 280 nm. Digestion of Oxidized Insulin B Chain—Digestion of oxidized insulin B chain by purified recombinant wtCDR1 was carried out overnight at 37 °C in the following buffers: 0.1 m formate buffer, pH 3.0; 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.0; 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0; 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 and pH 7.0; 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Reaction was stopped with 0.6% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration). After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 2 min), the fragments were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography in a C18 column, using a Merck Hitachi system with a Hi-Pore RP-318 250 × 4.6 mm column (Bio-Rad). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient (0–80%) of acetonitrile in 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. The isolated peptides were collected, freeze-dried, and submitted to automated amino acid sequencing. Enzyme Assays—Proteolytic activity of purified recombinant wtCDR1 was tested against several model substrates. Activity assays with the fluorogenic substrates (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (MCA)Lys-Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe-Ala-Leu-Lys-2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) (2 μm) and (MCA)Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys(DNP) (2 μm) were performed at different pH values. The following buffers between pH 3 and 8 containing 0.1 m NaCl and 8% (v/v) Me2SO were used: 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0; 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0–5.5; 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.5–7.0; 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The enzyme was incubated with each buffer at 37 °C, and the rate of hydrolysis was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 328 nm and an emission wavelength of 393 nm. In the case of the renin substrate tetradecapeptide porcine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-Ser), activity of purified recombinant wtCDR1 was tested by incubation with 0.1 mg of substrate for 5 h at 37 °C and at different pH values. After digestion, the fragments were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography in a C18 column, using a Merck Hitachi system with a Hi-Pore RP-318 250 × 4.6 mm column (Bio-Rad) as described in the previous section. Due to the lack of activity toward the model substrates tested, a new peptide substrate was designed for CDR1. The proteolytic activities of purified recombinant wtCDR1 and CDR1(D108A) were then assayed using this synthetic fluorogenic substrate (2 μm) (MCA)Lys-Leu-His-Pro-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe-Val-Leu-Glu-Lys(DNP) synthesized by Genosphere Biotechnologies (France). The increase of fluorescence intensity produced by substrate hydrolysis was monitored in a spectrofluorometer. An excitation wavelength of 328 nm and an emission wavelength of 393 nm were used to monitor the hydrolysis of this substrate. The relationship between fluorescence change and peptide concentration was determined by measuring the total fluorescence change that occurred upon complete hydrolysis of the peptide with pepsin. For activity studies at different pH, the following buffers between pH 3 and 8 containing 0.1 m NaCl and 8% (v/v) Me2SO were used: 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0; 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0–5.5; 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.5–7.0; 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For activity studies at different temperatures, wtCDR1 was incubated in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 8% (v/v) Me2SO buffer at temperatures between 10 ° and 70 °C. The same assay conditions were used to assay the activity of the mutant CDR1(D108A), and the fractions were collected from size-exclusion chromatography as well as to study the effect of various compounds on the proteolytic activity of recombinant wtCDR1. In this case, the enzyme was preincubated with each compound for 15 min at 37 °C before determination of proteolytic activity. The kinetic parameters were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using appropriate software. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Native molecular weight of purified recombinant wtCDR1 and CDR1(D108A) was estimated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) column connected to a fast-protein liquid chromatography system. The column was equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% glycerol and calibrated with Gel Filtration LMW and HMW calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass markers used for calibration were aldolase, 158 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; chymotrypsinogen, 25 kDa; and ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa. Gel Electrophoresis—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean III electrophoresis apparatus. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). Protein samples for chemical N-terminal sequence analysis were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting in 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11, at 500 mA for 1 h and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Molecular Modeling—Model building was performed on a structure of Mucor pusillus aspartic proteinase (PDB code: 1mpp). A sequence alignment of CDR1 deduced amino acid sequence (accession number AY243479) and M. pusillus aspartic proteinase (sequence from PDB file) yielded sequence identity of 22%. Modeling calculations were done on an SGI Octane workstation with dual R12000 processors using the program Moloc (17Gerber P.R. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1998; 12: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An initial C-alpha model of CDR1 was built by fitting its aligned sequence on the M. pusillus template C-alpha structure followed by optimization of newly introduced loops. A number of new disulfide bridges were introduced between adjacent Cys amino acids in the structure. Subsequently a full atom model was generated, and newly inserted loops were optimized with the rest of the protein kept stationary. Refinement of the full model with manual removal of repulsive van der Waals interactions followed and was divided in three parts. First, only amino acid side chains were allowed to move; in a second step all atoms except alpha carbons were optimized; and finally, positional constraints were put on alpha carbons only. Quality checks were made with Moloc internal programs and with a program by Luthy et al. (18Luthy R. Kim J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Expression, Refolding, and Purification of Recombinant CDR1—The atypical AP CDR1 (Fig. 1) was first identified by T-DNA activation tagging, and it was shown that its function in the activation of inducible resistance mechanisms required protease activity (7Xia Y. Kim H. Borevitz J. Blount J. Guo Z. Patel K. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To characterize the structural and enzymatic properties of this plant AP we have cloned its full-length cDNA (nucleotide sequence available in the EBI Data Bank under the accession number AY243479) from Arabidopsis seedlings. An expression plasmid construct was subsequently generated containing the cDNA encoding CDR1 without the first 25 amino acid residues, which were assumed to correspond to the putative signal peptide (predicted by SignalP (19Bendtsen J.D. Kim H. von H.G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar)). The CDR1-pET-23d (wtCDR1) construct was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and resulted in accumulation of the protein in inclusion bodies. They were purified by a freeze/thaw and detergent-washing procedure and subsequently dissolved in urea. Protein refolding was induced by a rapid dilution step followed by pH adjustment. After refolding the protein was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column, and the protein fractions corresponding to the non-aggregated forms of the enzyme were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography with High Q and Mono Q columns. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified protein fractions confirmed the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 2). Because the predicted mass of the non-glycosylated form of wtCDR1 is 45 kDa, the identity of the purified protein was subsequently determined by Edman degradation. The results on N-terminal sequencing of the electroblotted purified protein confirmed the expected N-terminal sequence of wtCDR1 (underlined), ASKPKLG, with AS being encoded by the pET-23d sequence. Proteolytic Activity of Recombinant wtCDR1—Despite a relatively low amino acid sequence identity with typical plant APs, the CDR1 sequence contains the typical hallmarks of aspartic proteinases. This includes the active site consensus sequence motifs (DTG/DSG) and the two hydrophobic-hydrophobic-Gly motifs of the Psi-loops. Moreover, the fact that the active-site mutant failed to recapitulate the CDR1-D-like phenotype (7Xia Y. Kim H. Borevitz J. Blount J. Guo Z. Patel K. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) further support the assignment of CDR1 as an aspartic protease with novel features. The purified recombinant wtCDR1 was tested for proteolytic activity against several model substrates (Table 1). The synthetic fluorogenic substrate (MCA)Lys-Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe-Ala-Leu-Lys(DNP), whose chromogenic version with a p-nitrophenylalanine group in the P1 position (20Dunn B.M. Kim M. Parten B.F. Valler M.J. Rolph C.E. Kay J. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) has been successfully hydrolyzed by a wide variety of aspartic proteinases from animal, microbial, or plant origins, was not cleaved by recombinant wtCDR1, and therefore no activity was observed at a pH range from 3 to 8. This result provided the first evidence that wtCDR1 prefers different substrates from those cleaved by plant APs studied thus far. Moreover, neither the fluorogenic BACE1 substrate (MCA)Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys(DNP) (21Ermolieff J. Kim J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) nor the known renin substrate Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-Ser (Sigma-Aldrich) were cleaved by wtCDR1 in any of our activity assays. When hemoglobin, bovine serum albumin, or FTC-casein were probed as substrates, wtCDR1 processed only the latter. In fact, purified recombinant wtCDR1 displayed a narrow pH tolerance for this substrate with a pH optimum at 6.4. Moreover, pepstatin A, a widely used inhibitor of aspartic proteinases, inhibited this FTC-casein processing very weakly (data not shown).TABLE 1Proteolytic activity of recombinant wtCDR1 Proteolytic activity of purified recombinant wtCDR1 was tested against several model substrates. The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No activity was observed for the majority of peptides or protein substrates used. The exceptions were oxidized insulin B chain (cleaved at Leu15-Tyr16) and FTC-casein.SubstrateSequenceEfficiency of cleavagePeptide substrates Typical AP substrate(MCA) KKPAEFFALK (DNP)n.c.an.c., not cleaved BACE1 substrate(MCA) KSEVNLDAEFK (DNP)n.c.

FTC-caseinPoorly cleaveda n.c., not cleaved Open table in a new tab This narrow substrate specificity together with the observed low sensitivity toward pepstatin A and an unusually high optimal pH prompted us to further investigate the catalytic properties of CDR1. Rather unexpectedly, and in contrast to other aspartic proteinases, wtCDR1 cleaved the Leu15-Phe16 bond of the insulin B chain in a selective manner at an optimal pH of 6.0. Under these conditions, addition of pepstatin A only partially inhibited this cleavage activity. Design of a New Fluorogenic Substrate for CDR1 Characterization—Due to the unusual specificity requirements displayed by wtCDR1 a new substrate was required. Therefore, a three-dimensional model of CDR1 was generated (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Scrutinizing the active site yielded no surprises revealing mostly hydrophobic residues forming binding pockets S2′ to S3. However, two rather interesting features are reminiscent of human BACE (22Hong L. Kim G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). These are the short proline-rich loop and Arg400 (Fig. 3), which reaches into the active site and might be capable of forming a salt bridge with a negatively charged glutamate residue in S4. A striking feature of wtCDR1 is its rather high pH optimum of 6.25–6.5 that is even higher than the value (5.0) found for human BACE (23Yan R. Kim M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). At such a pH a glutamate should be deprotonated even at the interface between bulk water and protein interior. Considering size, shape, and physicochemical properties of the individual active site subpockets in modeled CDR1, we have designed a new peptide substrate, (MCA)Lys-Leu-His-Pro-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe-Val-Leu-Glu-Lys(DNP), which turned out to be efficiently cleaved by recombinant wtCDR1 and was subsequently used for enzyme characterization. The ionizable residues at each end of the peptide were introduced for solubility reasons. Mass spectrometry analysis of the peptide digestion products yielded a major fragment (m/z 1220.60) which originates from the sequence (MCA)Lys-Leu-His-Pro-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe, therefore suggesting that the peptide is cleaved at the Phe-Val bond. The pH and temperature dependence of the recombinant enzyme are shown in Fig. 4 and some obvious differences betw"
https://openalex.org/W2055596436,"Human polynucleotide kinase (hPNK) is required for processing and rejoining DNA strand break termini. The 5'-DNA kinase and 3'-phosphatase activities of hPNK can be stimulated by the ""scaffold"" protein XRCC1, but the mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. Using a variety of fluorescence techniques, we examined the interaction of hPNK with XRCC1 and substrates that model DNA single-strand breaks. hPNK binding to substrates with 5'-OH termini was only approximately 5-fold tighter than that to identical DNA molecules with 5'-phosphate termini, suggesting that hPNK remains bound to the product of its enzymatic activity. The presence of XRCC1 did not influence the binding of hPNK to substrates with 5'-OH termini, but sharply reduced the interaction of hPNK with DNA bearing a 5'-phosphate terminus. These data, together with kinetic data obtained at limiting enzyme concentration, indicate a dual function for the interaction of XRCC1 with hPNK. First, XRCC1 enhances the capacity of hPNK to discriminate between strand breaks with 5'-OH termini and those with 5'-phosphate termini; and second, XRCC1 stimulates hPNK activity by displacing hPNK from the phosphorylated DNA product."
https://openalex.org/W2066594663,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEAs) family consists of a large group of evolutionarily and structurally divergent glycoproteins. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway has been implicated in the stimulation of CEA secretion in TGF-β-sensitive colon cells, thereby possibly modulating cell adhesion and differentiation. However, the specific CEAs targeted by TGF-β signaling or underlying mechanism of the expression of CEAs has not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the specific CEAs targeted by the TGF-β signaling pathway. In nine human gastric cancer cell lines examined, TGF-β-responsive cell lines showed positive expression of CEAs. Expression patterns of CEA proteins correlated well with the level of CEA (CEACAM5) and CEACAM6 transcripts in these cell lines, but CEACAM1 expression was not observed in all of these cells. To investigate the role of TGF-β signaling in CEA expression, we selected two TGF-β unresponsive gastric cancer cell lines; SNU638 cells that contain a mutation in the TGF-β type II receptor and SNU484 cells that express low to undetectable level of the TGF-β pathway intermediate protein, Smad3. Restoration of TGF-β signaling in these cells induced expression of the CEAs and increased activity of both CEA (CEACAM5) and CEACAM6 promoters. CEA expression was observed in the epithelium of the stomach of wild-type mice, but was markedly decreased in Smad3 null mice. These findings suggest that CEA (CEACAM5) and CEACAM6 are major target genes for Smad3-mediated TGF-β signaling."

It is largely intracellular but has been observed at the plasma membrane as well. The aim of this study was to identify the pathways and regulation of ClC-3 trafficking to intracellular sites. At the steady state, ∼94% of transfected ClC-3 was localized intracellularly, and only 6% was at the plasma membrane. Pulse labeling with [35S]methionine and biotinylation demonstrated that about 25% of newly synthesized ClC-3 traffics through the plasma membrane. We used both immunofluorescence microscopy and biotinylation assays to assess the trafficking of ClC-3. Plasma membrane ClC-3 was rapidly endocytosed (t½ ∼ 9 min); a portion entered a recycling pool that returned to the cell surface after internalization, and the remainder trafficked to more distal intracellular compartments. ClC-3 associated with clathrin at the plasma membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrated that the N terminus of ClC-3 binds to clathrin. Alanine replacement of a dileucine acidic cluster within the cytosolic N terminus (amino acids 13-19) resulted in a molecule that had decreased endocytosis and increased surface expression. This replacement also abolished interaction with clathrin as assessed both by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. We conclude that ClC-3 is primarily an intracellular transport protein that is transiently inserted into the plasma membrane where it is rapidly endocytosed.

Internalization of ClC-3 depends on the interaction between an N-terminal dileucine cluster and clathrin. The ClC chloride transport proteins are ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved. They participate in house-keeping processes such as pH regulation, trans-epithelial transport, and regulation of electrical excitability. Nine mammalian proteins that function either as Cl- ion channels or H+/Cl- antiporters have been identified (1Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 3Scheel O. Zdebik A.A. Lourdel S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). They are localized either at the plasma membrane or in intracellular membrane sites and can have a ubiquitous or a more restricted tissue distribution. ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 are members of one branch of this family that functions primarily intracellularly. They have similar physiological properties, can form heterodimers with other family members, and contribute to endosomal acidification (4Mohammad-Panah R. Harrison R. Dhani S. Ackerley C. Huan L.J.

Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and thus couple Cl- flux to vesicular pH gradients. ClC-3 has not been specifically shown to be an antiporter, but it has similar biophysical properties to ClC-4 and ClC-5 (7Li X. Shimada K. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35994-35998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and thus may function in this way as well. The trafficking pathways for ClC-3 are not well defined, and in different experimental systems ClC-3 has been observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments. Whether this dichotomy results from independent trafficking pools or whether ClC-3 moves between these pools is unknown. Intracellular targeting of membrane proteins is accomplished by the presence of specific short cytoplasmic motifs, which bind to adaptor proteins specific for individual compartments. Most sorting motifs characterized to date exist within the cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. ClC-3 contains several potential trafficking motifs, but their significance has not been determined. The endosome/lysosome compartment can be accessed through a biosynthetic direct pathway from Golgi to endosome/lysosome. It can also be accessed through an indirect pathway in which proteins traffic first to the plasma membrane and are subsequently internalized and routed to endosomes/lysosomes. Clathrin-based systems play important roles in targeting membrane proteins from both the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Several adaptor protein complexes direct clathrin assembly into curved lattices and couple it to cargo recruitment (8Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 9Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar).

These studies show that ClC-3 is primarily an intracellular channel, but it localizes to the plasma membrane as well.

GST-ClC-3 N Δ12-30 and GST-ClC-3 13-19A were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing in the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Texas Medical Branch. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the different cDNAs using FuGENE 6. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Two-hybrid screening was performed in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system (BD Biosciences). Plasmid pGBKT7 contained the N or C terminus of ClC-3 fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. Several adaptor proteins expressed as fusion proteins with the activation domain of GAL4 were kindly provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino. Positive interactions were identified by screening on tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-deficient media. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells, growing on 18-mm coverslips, were incubated with HA antibody (1:400) at 37 °C in PBS for 45 min as indicated. After incubation and washing, the cells were rinsed, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and labeled with secondary antibody. In some experiments cells were permeabilized with 0.25% saponin after fixation but before secondary antibody incubation. For double-labeling of ClC-3 and clathrin, ClC-3 was visualized as described above using Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) as secondary antibody.

At 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 ml of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin diluted in PBS (pH 8) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched with 50 mm glycine in PBS. After three washes at 4 °C in PBS, cells were immediately lysed. For experiments in which surface biotin was cleaved, cells were washed as described and then incubated in DMEM for various times at either 4 or 37 °C prior to a 2.5-h incubation with cleavage solution (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MesNa) (pH 8.6)). Cells were subsequently lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340)). The lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads and pelleted at 3000 × g for 2 min. Lysates and pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8-16% polyacrylamide gels (13Fournier K.M.

The membranes were then washed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, and detected with the ECLplus chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry using TotalLab software (UltraLum Inc., Claremont, CA). Statistical significance was tested using paired t test. Percent of surface expression was calculated by comparing total lysate ClC-3 with the biotinylated fraction as 100 × P/(T × F), where P is the density of the ClC-3 band in the streptavidin pellet; T is the density of the ClC-3 band in the total lysate aliquot; and F is the ratio of total lysate used for streptavidin precipitation compared with the quantity applied directly to the gel, i.e. lysate volume used for streptavidin precipitation/lysate volume applied to the gel. Percent endocytosis was calculated from experiments in which cells were biotinylated, incubated at 37 °C, and then exposed to the biotin cleavage reagent. Numerically it was represented as 100 × (Dt - D0)/S where Dt is the quantity of biotinylated ClC-3 remaining after cleavage at any given time; D0 is the quantity of biotinylated ClC-3 after cleavage at time 0, and S is the total surface ClC-3 determined by biotinylation without cleavage at time 0. To measure recycling, two variant biotinylation experiments were performed. ClC-3 HA-transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed twice with PBS and treated with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) for 2 h. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with biotinylation solution and then further incubated with biotinylation solution at 37 °C for different periods of time. After rinsing cells into ice-cold PBS solution containing glycine to quench the excess biotin, biotinylated proteins were extracted and were subjected to streptavidin precipitation and Western blot. An alternative, two-step cleavage method was also used. COS-7 cells were transfected with ClC-3 HA. After 2 days they were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 ml of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin diluted in PBS (pH 8) for 30 min at 4 °C. After quenching and washing as above, cells were incubated in DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C followed by incubation with cleavage solution at 4 °C. The cleavage solution was removed, and cells were then re-incubated in DMEM at 4 or 37 °C for 30 min. A second incubation with cleavage solution at 4 °C was then performed. The cells were then lysed and subjected to streptavidin precipitation and Western blot. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—ClC-3 HA-transfected COS-7 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to a confluence of 90%. They were then metabolically labeled by incubation for 20 min with 0.8 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine in methionine-free DMEM. Monolayers were washed three times with PBS before adding sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 4 h at 37 °C. After quenching with 50 mm glycine in PBS, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture. Biotinylated proteins were obtained by streptavidin precipitation of postnuclear supernatants, obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Streptavidin precipitation was sequentially performed four times to remove all biotinylated ClC-3 HA from the supernatant. The streptavidin pellets were combined, and biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by incubation in cleavage solution (see above) at 4 °C twice in 12 h. The final streptavidin supernatant and the cleavage product of the streptavidin pellets were then separately immunoprecipitated with polyclonal HA antibody (Sigma H6908 1:200) after removal of proteins to the protein A/G-agarose beads in the absence of specific antibody. The precleared supernatants were incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator with the specific HA antibody. Fresh protein A/G-agarose beads (200 μl of 50% slurry) were added and then incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 2 min, supernatants were aspirated; beads were washed, and antibody-antigen complexes were dissociated with 2× sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was then performed as described. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film, and protein bands were quantitated by autoradiography. GST Pulldown and Immunoprecipitation—GST and GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 according to procedures described for the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences). GST or GST fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 0.5 h at room temperature followed by extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline. It was then incubated with COS-7 cell lysates prepared as described above. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted at 3000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in SDS loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti AP-2 β-subunit (1:5000), anti-clathrin (1:1000), or anti-caveolin (1:1000) antibodies. For coimmunoprecipitation, whole cell lysates from ClC-3 HA-transfected COS-7 cells were used. The lysates were first pre-cleared by6hof incubation at 4 °C with protein A/G beads. The beads were subsequently removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The precleared supernatant was then incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator with either the nonimmune IgG or specific antibody for the HA epitope or clathrin (Sigma H6908 1:200 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-12734 1:100). Fresh protein A/G-agarose beads were then added and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 2 min, supernatant was aspirated, and SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads. The sample was heated and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was subsequently performed. ClC-3 Partially Localizes to the Plasma Membrane—To investigate the trafficking path of ClC-3, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells and determined the extent of its presence at the plasma membrane. GluR6, a known plasma membrane receptor, was used as a control (14Yan S. Sanders J.M. Xu J. Zhu Y. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As reported previously (10Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), ClC-3 demonstrated a predominant intracellular distribution and was present in large intracellular vesicles. This contrasted with the obvious plasma membrane distribution of GluR6 (Fig. 1A). To further determine whether ClC-3 was present at the plasma membrane, we used surface biotinylation. ClC-3 GFP was transiently expressed, and cell surface proteins were labeled at 4 °C with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, precipitated with streptavidin-coated beads, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. GluR6 showed a strong band both in total lysate and in the streptavidin pellet. Biotinylated ClC-3 was also present but to a lower extent (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that biotinylated ClC-3 accounted for only ∼6% of the total. Identical results were obtained with ClC-3 HA, the ClC-3 construct that has an HA epitope at its C terminus. We then used a combination of pulse labeling and surface biotinylation to directly determine the fraction of newly synthesized ClC-3 that is first inserted into the plasma membrane. ClC-3 HA-transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min, immediately transferred to PBS in the presence of the biotinylation reagent, and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently lysed; biotinylated proteins were extracted by streptavidin precipitation, and ClC-3 was separately immunoprecipitated from the biotinylated and nonbiotinylated fractions. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to evaluate the relative proportion of newly synthesized ClC-3 that had been present in the plasma membrane during this 4-h incubation. Control experiments first confirmed that the streptavidin precipitation procedure completely cleared biotinylated ClC-3 from the lysate. After three rounds of streptavidin precipitation, all biotinylated ClC-3 was pelleted, and none remained in the supernatant. We also demonstrated the ability to immunoprecipitate ClC-3 with HA antibody from both the plasma membrane-derived pellet and the non-plasma membrane-derived supernatant (data not shown). Fig. 1C demonstrates one example of this protocol. We were able to detect newly synthesized ClC-3 in both the biotinylated and nonbiotinylated fractions. Fig. 1D shows the densitometric analysis of three independent experiments demonstrating that 25 ± 6% of newly synthesized ClC-3 becomes biotinylated under these conditions. The above analysis could be confounded if nascent ClC-3 were differentially degraded in plasma membrane and non-plasma membrane fractions to a significant extent. We thus determined the stability of ClC-3 by immunoblotting after inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Fig. 1E demonstrates that ClC-3 is not detectably degraded over a 2-h period. Plasma Membrane ClC-3 Undergoes Rapid Internalization—The above results show that ∼25% of ClC-3 is thus initially inserted into the plasma membrane but only 6% remains there at steady state. To test whether this discrepancy results from endocytosis, we examined internalization of surface-biotinylated ClC-3. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Fig. 2A, lane 1), a derivatization that could be cleaved with an impermeant reducing agent, MesNa, either immediately after biotinylation (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Although immediate cleavage of the biotin label was very effective, ClC-3 demonstrated substantial retention of biotinylation after the 15-min incubation, representing endocytosis during the incubation period. In contrast, Na-K-ATPase, a protein that does not undergo internalization, was not protected by a period of post-biotinylation incubation (Fig. 2A). We next measured the time course of ClC-3 internalization. After biotinylation at 4 °C with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for different times prior to cleavage and then subjected to streptavidin precipitation and Western blot for ClC-3. Fig. 2B shows an example of the biotinylation status of ClC-3 according to this protocol, and Fig. 2C demonstrates results from six similar experiments. A portion of the ClC-3 molecule undergoes internalization with a t½ of ∼9 min. Trafficking of Plasma Membrane ClC-3—We generated ClC-3 constructs with either an intracellular or external HA epitope to follow the trafficking of the molecule. The external epitope allowed specific antibody labeling of surface-expressed ClC-3 channels on living cells. We first expressed these constructs in COS-7 cells to evaluate their steady-state distribution. ClC-3 with a C-terminal (intracellular) HA epitope, ClC-3 with an external HA epitope and a C-terminal GFP, and ClC-3 with the external HA epitope but without an internal GFP epitope all resulted in the formation of intracellular vesicles. This steady-state distribution was the same as that seen previously for ClC-3 C-terminal GFP and unmodified ClC-3 (10Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The fate of plasma membrane ClC-3 was assessed by antibody binding in live, nonpermeabilized cells. Specificity of this approach was first assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. For cells expressing ClC-3 with the intracellular HA epitope, antibody labeling was observed only after permeabilization and showed a largely intracellular distribution (Fig. 3, A-D). When cells expressed ClC-3 with the extracellular HA epitope, antibody labeling was observed in both permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 3, E-H). Permeabilized cells (Fig. 3F) displayed the same intracellular pattern as did the internal epitope, but nonpermeabilized cells demonstrated labeling specific for the plasma membrane (Fig. 3H). To follow trafficking, COS-7 cells were transfected with the ClC-3 derivative containing both an external HA epitope and internal GFP. Live cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with anti-HA antibody, rinsed in PBS to wash away the extra antibody, and then chased in DMEM at 37 °C for different times. Cells were subsequently fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies. Before the chase, HA fluorescence (Fig. 3I, red) was clearly defined at the plasma membrane. The green GFP fluorescence was primarily seen intracellularly because the majority of cellular ClC-3 is intracellular, and with this background, the visualization of the relatively dim plasma membrane fluorescence was limited by the dynamic range of the imaging camera. Amplification of the green GFP signal confirmed colocalization between GFP and the red plasma membrane distribution of antibody binding to the external HA epitope (data not shown). We next observed the effect of different chase times on the trafficking of the antibody bound to the extracellular HA epitope. After a 30-min chase, plasma membrane resident ClC-3 moved to small endocytic vesicles (Fig. 3J) and by 2 h had accumulated into the large central vesicles (Fig. 3K) that are the major site of total cellular ClC-3 at the steady state (10Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane can therefore serve as an intermediate trafficking site. Internalized ClC-3 Undergoes Recycling—To determine whether internalized cell surface ClC-3 enters a recycling pool, we biotinylated the cell surface pool, allowed it to internalize for 15 min, and then cleaved the remaining surface biotin. These cells were then further incubated at either 0 or 37 °C for 30 min. At the end of this period they underwent a second round of cleavage. Fig. 4A demonstrates that the first post-biotinylation incubation resulted in endocytosis and protection of a fraction of the biotinylated ClC-3 from cleavage. A second incubation period at 0 °C did not result in any sensitivity to a second round of cleavage. However, a second incubation at 37 °C rendered an additional fraction of ClC-3 sensitive to cleavage. In this regard ClC-3 behaved similarly to the transferrin receptor, an endogenous protein known to undergo recycling (13Fournier K.M. Gonzalez M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The loss of biotinylation of ClC-3 by a second round of cleavage following a 37 °C incubation did not result from degradation o"

Recently, we have shown that myocilin undergoes an intracellular endoproteolytic processing. We show herein that the proteolytic cleavage in the linker region splits the two terminal domains. The C-terminal domain is secreted to the culture medium, whereas the N-terminal domain mainly remains intracellularly retained. In transiently transfected 293T cells, the cleavage was prevented by calpain inhibitors, such as calpeptin, calpain inhibitor IV, and calpastatin. Since calpains are calcium-activated proteases, we analyzed how changes in either intra- or extracellular calcium affected the cleavage of myocilin. Intracellular ionomycin-induced calcium uptake enhanced myocilin cleavage, whereas chelation of extracellular calcium by EGTA inhibited the proteolytic processing. Calpains I and II cleaved myocilin in vitro. However, in cells in culture, only RNA interference knockdown of calpain II reduced myocilin processing. Subcellular fractionation and digestion of the obtained fractions with proteinase K showed that full-length myocilin resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum together with a subpopulation of calpain II. These data revealed that calpain II is responsible for the intracellular processing of myocilin in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that this cleavage might regulate extracellular interactions of myocilin, contributing to the control of intraocular pressure.

Myocilin, initially denominated trabecular meshwork-inducible glucocorticoid response protein, or TIGR, is an extracellular glycoprotein (55–57 kDa) with a modular design consisting of three domains: (i) the N-terminal leucine zipper-like region; (ii) a central putative linker domain; and (iii) the C-terminal olfactomedin-like domain (encoded by exon 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

Recently, we showed that myocilin undergoes an intracellular endoproteolytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) between amino acids Arg226 and Ile227 located in the putative linker domain (10Aroca-Aguilar J.D.

This processing predicts the production of two fragments corresponding to the N- and C-terminal domains. The processed C-terminal domain is co-secreted with the full-length protein, but the fate of the processed N-terminal domain has not yet been investigated. We also reported that pathogenic mutations located in the olfactomedin-like domain of myocilin reduce the proteolytic cleavage in the middle of the protein. The highest inhibition of the processing was produced by the myocilin mutation P370L, which is associated with the most severe glaucoma phenotype.

Despite many efforts made over recent years, the function of this protein in the normal and glaucomatous eye is poorly understood. There is great interest in identifying proteins that interact with myocilin, since it is believed that they could play a key role in its biological function. Several extracellular proteins have been identified to interact with myocilin, including fibronectin (through the HepII domain) (14Filla M.S. Liu X. Nguyen T.D. Polansky J.R. Brandt C.R. Kaufman P.L.

Although the functional meaning of the proteolytic processing of myocilin is currently unknown, it has been suggested that controlled changes in the proportion of processed myocilin might contribute to regulate the normal TM structure by differential intermolecular interactions with other extracellular matrix molecules, therefore contributing to modulate aqueous humor outflow and IOP (10Aroca-Aguilar J.D.

Conformational determinants are a significant factor in the cleavage site specificity of this protease (28Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol.

Calpain is regarded as a biomodulator, since properties of the substrate proteins are often modulated upon cleavage (22Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem.

Our objectives in this work were as follows: (i) to characterize the fate of myocilin fragments released after proteolytic processing; (ii) to analyze the role in the proteolytic processing of different amino acids located around the cleavage point; and (iii) to identify the enzyme responsible for the processing. We show herein that the C-terminal fragment is secreted into the culture medium upon proteolytic processing and that the N-terminal domain remains associated mainly with the cellular fraction. We conclude that myocilin processing is carried out in the lumen of the ER by calpain II. Myocilin Constructs-Wild-type myocilin cDNA cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-myc-His (10Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Ghosh S. Coca-Prados M. Escribano J. J. Biol.

A cDNA construct encoding wild-type myocilin, which in addition to the C-terminal Myc epitope incorporates the HA epitope contiguous to the signal peptide sequence (amino acid residue 32), was obtained by amplifying two PCR fragments using primers 1–6 and 3–7, respectively (Table 1). The two PCR products were purified, mixed, and used as PCR templates with primers 1 and 3. The amplified fragment was directly cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the empty pcDNA3.1-myc-His vector. The N-terminal domain of myocilin (amino acid residues 1–226), cloned into the pcDNA3.1-HA-His vector, was generated by PCR using primers 1 and 2. The C-terminal domain of myocilin (amino acid residues 217–504) was also produced by PCR using primers 3 and 4 (Table 1). The signal peptide of myocilin (amino acid residues 1–32) was incorporated at the 5′ end of this PCR fragment using primers 1 and 5 (Table 1). The final PCR product was also cloned into the pcDNA3.1-HA-His vector. Myocilin deletion mutants were obtained as previously described (10Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Ghosh S. Coca-Prados M.

The PCR primers are shown in Table 1. The mutated myocilin cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the vector pcDNA3.1-myc-His. All cDNA constructs used in this study were completely sequenced to confirm both the correct insertion and absence of undesirable mutations. Calpastatin Construct-A cDNA construct encoding the inhibitor domain 1 of calpastatin (Cs-D1) (amino acid residues 143–169), fused to the signal peptide of myocilin (amino acids 1–32) at the N-terminal end, was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. cDNA synthesized from 293T cell mRNA was used as a template for amplification with primers 32 and 33 (Table 1). The amplified fragment was directly cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pcDNA3.1-myc-His vector. Cell Culture-Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and human retinal pigmented epithelium ARPE-19 cells were bought from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The human cell line 26HCMsv was established from the primary culture of ciliary muscle (CM) cells of a 26-year-old male (cadaver) by viral transformation, as previously described (40Coca-Prados M. Wax M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 293T and 26HCMsv cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Normocin; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a fully humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. ARPE-19 cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Normocin; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a fully humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient plasmid transfections were carried out with 200–500 ng of DNA using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris from the collected culture medium. The supernatant was stored at -80 °C until used. Adhered cells were washed twice with 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2), followed by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitors, as previously described (10Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Ghosh S. Coca-Prados M. Escribano J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21043-21051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Collected cells were vortexed for 30 s at maximum speed, incubated for 30 min on ice, and sonicated for 10 s (cycle 0.5 s). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cellular soluble fraction) were carefully separated from the pellets (cellular insoluble fraction). Both cellular fractions were stored at -80 °C until used. The efficiency of transfections was estimated in cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) by counting the number of GFP-positive cells in a total of 103 cells in four randomly selected areas per dish. As a negative control, the different cell lines were transfected with 200–500 ng of the nonrecombinant pcDNA3.1-myc-His vector. For time course experiments, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium every day over a 6-day period. Tissues-Human eyes were obtained from human cadavers within 24 h after enucleation through the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). A sample of human skeletal muscle was obtained from a cadaver from the “Servicio de Anatomía Patológica, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete,” Spain. Eyes were dissected from the posterior pole, both the vitreous and lens were removed, and the CB was microdissected. Homogenization of both the human CB and human skeletal muscle was performed by mechanical grinding with liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar. Pulverized frozen tissue was suspended in lysis buffer (10Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Ghosh S. Coca-Prados M. Escribano J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21043-21051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), vortexed for 30 s at maximum speed, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at -80 °C until used. Western Blotting and Antibodies-For Western blot analysis, aliquots of culture medium and intracellular fractions of cultured cell lines (both soluble and insoluble) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as reported by Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), using the Mini-PROTEAN III gel electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The samples were normalized for protein content using the Bradford assay. Gels were subsequently transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for immunodetection. Commercial mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-calpain I (Calbiochem) were used as primary antibodies and diluted at 1:1000. Other primary antibodies were anti-calpain II (Calbiochem), anti-calnexin (Sigma), anti-14-3-3 (Sigma), and the anti-myocilin C21A antibody (7Huang W. Jaroszewski J. Ortego J. Escribano J. Coca-Prados M. Ophthalmic Genet. 2000; 21: 155-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were diluted at 1:400, 1:3000, 1:2,000, and 1:400, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse, or rabbit IgG (Pierce) were diluted at 1:1,000–1:4,000. Chemiluminiscence detection was performed with Supersignal Dura Western blot reagents (Pierce). Densitometry for protein band quantification was performed on scanned films using Quantity One 4.1 analysis software (Bio-Rad) in triplicate independent experiments. Data were statistically treated by using SigmaStat 2.0 software (SPSS Science). Fluorescence Microscopy-26HCMsv cells were seeded in coverslips placed into 24-well plates and transiently transfected with DNA constructs encoding different myocilin-tagged variants. DNA constructs encoding GFP-tagged versions of the first 80 N-terminal amino acids of galactosyltransferase or the signal peptide of calreticulin were used as specific fluorescent GA and ER markers, respectively. These constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Juan Llopis (“Facultad de Medicina/CRIB, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Spain”). All transfections were performed with SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with phosphate-buffered solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The recombinant proteins were detected with an anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (at 1:500 dilution) at 4 °C overnight followed by a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium with DABCO (Fluka) and viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMR/XA) with proper filter sets using a ×100 plan objective. Images were captured using a Leica DC500 digital camera. Protease Inhibitor Assays-In order to find out the protease involved in the endoproteolytic processing of myocilin, different membrane-permeable specific protease inhibitors were used: calpeptin (80 μm), calpain inhibitor IV (50 μm), and N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) (40 μm) (inhibitors of calpains); lactacystin (0.25 μm) and MG-132 (0.25 μm) (proteosome inhibitors); and ammonium chloride (1 mm) (lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor). Five days after transfecting 293T cells with the wild-type myocilin construct, the culture medium was removed and substituted with fresh culture medium containing the different inhibitors. Cells were incubated for 16 h with the different inhibitors, the culture medium was then collected, and secreted myocilin was analyzed by Western blot. After treatment with the different proteinase inhibitors, cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, as described (42Plumb J.A. Milroy R. Kaye S.B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4435-4440PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Interference (RNAi)-Two RNAi approaches were assayed to knock down the expression of calpain. In the first one, four shRNA-specific clones for calpain II (MISSION™; Sigma; product number SHDNA-NM_001748) were used, and in the second approach a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for calpain II (Ambion Inc.; ID 105034) was employed. Calpain I expression was knocked down using five shRNA-specific clones (MISSION™; Sigma; product number SHDNA-NM_005186). Transient transfections were carried out using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Treatment of Myocilin-transfected 293T Cells with Ionomycin or EGTA-293T cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type myocilin cDNA construct. The culture medium was removed 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh culture medium containing 2 μm ionomycin was added. To determine whether chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits the processing, culture conditions were established to enhance myocilin processing. After transfection, the culture medium was changed every day over a 6-day period. Cells were treated with 4 mm EGTA on the last day. Eight hours after treatments, either with ionomycin or EGTA, secreted myocilin was analyzed by Western blot. Digestion of Myocilin with Purified Recombinant Calpains-Twenty microliters of conditioned medium containing wild-type myocilin were mixed with 4 μl of 10× digestion buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm CaCl2), 15 μl of water, and 1 μl (1 μg/μl) of purified porcine recombinant calpain I or calpain II (Calbiochem). Digestions were carried out at 37 °C in a final volu"

We employed oligonucleotide templates containing either a deoxyadenosine shape mimic (dQ) or a deoxythymidine shape mimic (dF). Additionally, the nucleoside triphosphate analogs difluorotoluene deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 9-methyl-1-H-imidazo[(4,5)-b]pyridine deoxyribose triphosphate, and 4-methylbenzimidazole deoxyribose triphosphate (dZTP; another dATP shape mimic) were assayed. We used pre-steady state methods to determine the kinetic parameters governing nucleotide incorporation, kpol and Kd. In general, the loss of hydrogen bonding potential led to 2–3 kcal/mol reduction in ground state binding free energy, whereas effects on the maximum rate of polymerization were quite variable, ranging from negligible (dATP:dF) to nearly 4 kcal/mol (dZTP:dT). Although we observed only a 46-fold reduction in discrimination when dF was present in the template, there was a complete elimination of discrimination when dQ was present in the template. Our data with dF indicate that hydrogen bonding contributes 2.2 kcal/mol toward the efficiency of incorporation, whereas data with dQ (which may overestimate the effect due to poor steric mimicry) suggest a contribution of up to 6.8 kcal/mol. Taken together, the data suggest that sterics are necessary but not sufficient to achieve optimal efficiency and fidelity for DNA polymerase. Base pair hydrogen bonding contributes at least a third of the energy underlying nucleoside incorporation efficiency and specificity.

Taken together, the data suggest that sterics are necessary but not sufficient to achieve optimal efficiency and fidelity for DNA polymerase. Base pair hydrogen bonding contributes at least a third of the energy underlying nucleoside incorporation efficiency and specificity. Several factors can contribute to DNA replication fidelity, including base pair hydrogen bonding, base pair geometry, and base stacking, and each of these factors is affected by the environment at the DNA polymerase active site (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 3Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). DNA replication follows a minimal pathway illustrated in Fig. 1, where Kd,dNTP represents the apparent dissociation constant for ground state nucleotide binding, and kpol defines the rate of polymerization at the active site (2Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). After incorporation of one nucleotide, the enzyme-DNA complex can then either bind another nucleotide to continue processive synthesis, the DNA can dissociate at a rate koff, or the DNA can migrate to the exonuclease site and undergo hydrolysis of the 3′-terminal base of the primer at rate kexo. In this report we quantify specificity by measuring the concentration dependence of single nucleotide incorporation events to define the specificity constant, equal to kpol/Kd. Although kpol may be limited by either chemistry or a nucleotide-induced conformational change, these measurements accurately define polymerase specificity and efficiency (2Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 4Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Over a range of DNA polymerases with widely varying fidelity, the ground state binding (Kd) contributes a factor of ∼200–300 toward the net selectivity, whereas kpol contributes between 50- and 2000-fold to achieve variable fidelity for different polymerases (5Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol.

The ground state binding contribution to fidelity is nearly identical to that which is calculated from solution studies of base pair hydrogen bonding, and therefore, it has been suggested that ground state nucleotide binding at the polymerase active site is dominated by formation of the base pair hydrogen bonds with the templating base, whereas the conformational change and/or chemistry steps are dependent upon optimal base pair geometry (2Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) that may be enforced sterically (8Brieba L.G. Kokoska R.J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Ellenberger T.

Accordingly, lower fidelity enzymes with a more open active site do not enforce base pair geometry to the same extent as a higher fidelity enzyme. To resolve the contributions of shape and base pair hydrogen bonding in DNA polymerase fidelity, nucleoside analogs were developed that mimic the overall shape but lack hydrogen bonding capability (10Schweitzer B.A. Kool E.T.

Chem. 1994; 59: 7238-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in which the carbonyl oxygen atoms of dT are replaced by fluorine while retaining nearly the exact shape of dT. Difluorotoluene has been shown to lack base pair hydrogen bonding ability with adenine in either DNA or RNA and even in chloroform, a solvent that strongly favors hydrogen bond formation (11Schweitzer B.A. Kool E.T.

Additionally, when paired opposite a dA in a DNA duplex, dF destabilizes the duplex and shows no pairing selectivity for adenine over mismatched bases.

Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2323-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Another analog, 4-methylbenzimidazole (dZ), is also a shape mimic of adenosine like dQ but lacks a minor groove H-bond acceptor. As with dQ, dZ has been shown to be structurally similar to deoxyadenosine and to lack the ability to pair with natural bases as part of a DNA duplex (12Guckian K.M. Morales J.C. Kool E.T. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To more accurately assess the role of base pair hydrogen bonding in polymerase fidelity, we have employed pre-steady state kinetic assays to determine the parameters governing incorporation of three shape mimic nucleotide analogs. In these studies we examine the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ), a high fidelity replicative polymerase. Our interest in Pol γ stems from its role in the toxicity of nucleoside analogs used to treat HIV infections (17Johnson A.A. Ray A.S. Hanes J. Suo Z.C. Colacino J.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. J.

In this report oligonucleotide templates containing either a deoxyadenosine shape mimic (dQ) or a deoxythymidine shape mimic (dF) were used as templates for kinetic analysis of polymerization using single turnover transient kinetic methods. Additionally, analog triphosphates difluorotoluene deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dFTP), 9-methyl-1-H-imidazo[(4,5)-b]pyridine deoxyribose triphosphate (dQTP), and 4-methylbenzimidazole deoxyribose triphosphate (dZTP; dATP shape mimic) were assayed to determine the kinetic parameters of incorporation of these free nucleotides onto template nucleotides. Our results point to the significance of hydrogen bonding in DNA polymerization catalyzed by Pol γ.

Reagents—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Natural nucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The nucleoside triphosphate analogs dFTP, dQTP, and dZTP were prepared as described (24Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Nat. Struct.

All other reagents were purchased from Fisher unless otherwise noted. Preparation of Oligonucleotides—The sequences of primers and templates used are listed in the Table 1. Oligonucleotides purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies were purified by preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended in 100 μlof deionized water and incubated at room temperature for 2 h, then 25 μl of 5× PAGE loading buffer (0.05% bromphenol blue and 0.05% xylenecyanol in formamide) was added to each oligonucleotide solution. This was then loaded in its entirety onto a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. After electrophoresis, the DNA was visualized by UV fluorescence shadowing, and the bands of interest were excised. These gel pieces were then crushed and soaked in a buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-Cl at pH 8.0 overnight at 37 °C. The crushed gel pieces were subsequently removed from the mixture by filtration through a 0.2-μm syringe filter. The volume of the solution was reduced to 0.5 ml by n-butanol extraction. The oligonucleotides were then precipitated with ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation. Once dry and free of ethanol, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of deionized water, and their concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Extinction coefficients at 260 and 280 nm were provided by Integrated DNA Technologies. Oligonucleotides containing analogs dF, dQ, and dZ were also purified by gel electrophoresis as previously described (13Morales J.C. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem.

Open table in a new tab Primer strands were 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Termination of the reaction was accomplished by heating the reaction to 95 °C for 5 min. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed using a Biospin 6 column per the manufacturer's provided instructions (Bio-Rad). Primer-template annealing was accomplished by mixing equimolar ratios of 25-mer primer and 45-mer template, heating the mixture to 95 °C, and allowing the solution to cool slowly to room temperature. Polymerase Assay Conditions—Assays were performed at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm MgCl2. The holoenzyme-DNA complex was assembled in a MgCl2-free buffer and then rapidly mixed at a 1:1 ratio with the appropriate nucleoside triphosphate previously diluted into a MgCl2-containing buffer to initiate the reaction. Because mixing of the holoenzyme-DNA complex with the nucleotide was at a 1:1 ratio, each complex was assembled at twice the reported final concentration. It should be noted that the Mg2+ concentration used in these studies (25 mm) is larger than the 2.5 mm used previously (7Lee H.R. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This increase causes approximately a 3-fold increase in both kpol and the Kd for nucleotide incorporation but does not change the ratio, kpol/Kd. Accordingly, we can compare the results in this paper with those in the previous work in terms of fidelity, but individual kpol and Kd values cannot be compared. In this paper we have repeated the experiments to quantify the kinetic parameters for incorporation of dATP onto a template dT and TTP onto a template dA to allow direct comparison to the analogs as summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Incorporation opposite nonpolar analogsTemplate basedNTPkpolKdSpecificity constantDiscriminations−1μmμm−1 s−1dFdATP110 ± 1080 ± 101.4 ± 0.2[1]dGTP0.11 ± 0.04800 ± 3000.00014 ± 0.0000710,000TTP0.072 ± 0.008130 ± 200.0006 ± 0.00012,500dCTP0.10 ± 0.01350 ± 500.00028 ± 0.000055,000dQTP34 ± 244 ± 50.8 ± 0.11.25dQTTP0.08 ± 0.01160 ± 300.0005 ± 0.0001[1]dGTP0.047 ± 0.009170 ± 500.0003 ± 0.00011.8dATP0.07 ± 0.0140 ± 100.002 ± 0.00060.25dCTP0.09 ± 0.02290 ± 700.0003 ± 0.00011.6dFTPaIncorporation of dFTP opposite dQ was assayed at 250 μm dFTP only, so the specificity constant listed is a minimum estimate.1.1 ± 0.02(250)(0.004)(0.125)dATTP87 ± 72.1 ± 0.341 ± 7[1]dFTP9 ± 149 ± 90.18 ± 0.04228dTdATP140 ± 103.1 ± 0.445 ± 5[1]dQTP1.6 ± 0.1460 ± 400.0035 ± 0.000413,000dZTP0.17 ± 0.01240 ± 300.0007 ± 0.000164,000a Incorporation of dFTP opposite dQ was assayed at 250 μm dFTP only, so the specificity constant listed is a minimum estimate. Open table in a new tab Kd and Maximum Rate of Polymerization—Single nucleotide incorporation experiments were performed to examine the nucleotide concentration dependence of the rate of polymerization. To eliminate the complications associated with multiple enzyme turnovers, these assays were carried out under single turnover conditions, with enzymes in slight excess over DNA. Reactions were generally carried out from 0 to 100 s, although faster reactions were carried out over shorter times using an RQF-3 rapid chemical quench-flow (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). The time courses of product formation were fit to a single exponential equation, [product] = A·e–kt + C. Rates of polymerization determined from the single exponential fits were plotted against nucleotide concentration and fit to a hyperbola (observed rate = kpol·[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP])) to determine the dissociation constant, Kd, and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol, for each nucleotide combination. Product Analysis—Products were separated from reactants on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels, imaged on a GE Healthcare Storm 860 PhosphorImager, and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). In these studies we employed the three nucleoside analogs shown in Fig. 2. Single turnover kinetic assays were performed to examine the incorporation of all four natural nucleotides opposite a template dF and dQ. In addition, we examined the incorporation of dFTP opposite a template dA and dQTP and dZTP opposite a template dT. Because each of these combinations paired a normal nucleoside with a hydrophobic isostere, which likely requires desolvation of the polar partner, we also examined incorporation with two pairs of analogs, dFTP:dQ and dQTP:dF. Throughout the text we will use the shorthand, dNTP:dX, to denote the base pair formed with a given dNTP substrate reacting opposite a template containing dX. In Figs. 3 and 4 we show representative data for a well tolerated and a poorly tolerated analog, respectively. In Fig. 3A the time course of product formation opposite a template dF (thymidine analog) is shown at concentrations of free dATP ranging from 1 to 500 μm. The data were fit to a single exponential function to obtain the rate of incorporation. In Fig. 3B, the concentration dependence of the rate was fit to a hyperbola to define kpol = 110 s–1 and the apparent ground state Kd = 80 μm. This surprisingly fast and efficient incorporation of dATP opposite dF is in marked contrast to the incorporation of TTP opposite the adenosine analog, dQ, shown in Fig. 4. The time course of each reaction (Fig. 4A) fit a single exponential, and the concentration dependence of the observed rate (Fig. 4B) fit a hyperbola defining kpol = 0.08 s–1 and Kd = 160 μm. Thus, although dF appears to be a reasonably good mimic of thymidine, in most experiments dQ failed to show any reactivity reminiscent of adenine.FIGURE 4Incorporation of TTP opposite dQ. A, TTP incorporation opposite dQ was assayed at TTP concentrations from 1 μm (○) to 500 μm (▿). B, the observed rates were fit to a hyperbola to obtain a kpol of 0.08 ± 0.01 s–1 and Kd of 160 ± 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the fidelity of polymerization by measuring the kinetics of incorporation of mismatched bases opposite dF and dQ in the template strands. Discrimination afforded by each nonpolar analog in the template strand was then calculated as the ratio of kpol/Kd values obtained for the correct dNTP versus that obtained for the mismatched dNTP, defined according to the base pairing rules for the nucleotide that the analog was intended to mimic. The results from all of our assays are summarized in Table 2 and are further analyzed to evaluate the effects of analog substitutions on efficiency and specificity in Table 3 and Figs. 5 and 6.TABLE 3Hydrogen bonding free energy contribution to incorporation efficiencyBase pair dNTP:templateSpecificity constantΔΔGoμm−1 s−1kcal/moldATP:dT45dQTP:dT0.00355.7dZTP:dT0.00076.7dATP:dF1.42.1dQTP:dF0.82.5TTP:dA41dFTP:dA0.183.3TTP:dQ0.00056.8dFTP:dQ*(0.005)(5.4) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6Additive effects on hydrogen bonding on efficiency. We illustrate the changes in enzyme efficiency (kpol/Kd) due to analog substitutions in the incoming dNTP and the templating base for dATP:dT base pair mimics. Changes in efficiency are shown on a free energy scale computed as ΔΔG =–RTln((kpol/Kd)native/(kpol/Kd)analog) and scaled relative to the dQTP:dF base pair (in the plane of the diagram). Accordingly, this diagram shows the gain or loss in efficiency with the sequential addition of hydrogen bonding potential of the nucleotides with the sequential substitution of dATP for dQTP (right to left) and of dT for dF (front to back) in the incoming dNTP and the templating dN, respectively. The values are computed in kcal/mol at 37 °C from the data in Table 2. The dashed lines show the pairwise ΔΔG values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The term kpol/Kd (or kcat/Km) serves to define both the efficiency and specificity of incorporation, but the two terms are evaluated by examining kpol/Kd relative to different standards. In general, efficiency is often discussed by evaluating kcat/Km relative to the diffusion-limited binding rate and the physiological substrate concentration. In this report, we evaluate of changes in efficiency based upon the ratio of (kpol/Kd)native/(kpol/Kd)analog to compare native base pairs with homologous “correct” base pairs containing one or two analogs. Changes in efficiency of incorporation relative to normal base pairs are computed in Table 3 and are shown on a free energy scale in Figs. 5 and 6. To evaluate the effects of the analog substitutions on specificity, we compute discrimination = (kpol/Kd)correct/(kpol/Kd)incorrect and then compare the values for discrimination obtained with analogs in the template with the values obtained using native nucleotides. Changes in specificity brought about by the nucleotide analog substitutions are illustrated on a free energy scale in Fig. 7 compared with native nucleotides. We will use the terms discrimination, specificity, or fidelity strictly to refer to changes in kpol/Kd values comparing correct and incorrect base pairs, whereas the term efficiency will be used to refer to changes in kpol/Kd comparing analog correct base pairs to native correct base pairs. Effects on Incorporation Efficiency—Fig. 5 summarizes the effect on kpol/Kd on the loss of hydrogen bonding potential observed with the various analogs. The figure shows on a free energy scale the net effects on kpol/Kd resolved into contributions from kpol (light) and Kd (dark) relative to the values observed for the native base pair. Note that the kpol free energies reflect changes in apparent transition state activation energy, whereas the numbers for Kd represent changes in ground state binding energy but in either case are computed as a ΔΔGin comparing the analogs with normal nucleotides. Fig. 5A compares the results obtained with each analog base pair to those seen with a normal dATP:dT base pair. In this figure the magnitude of the bar defines the apparent free energy loss with each analog. For example, it can be seen that for dQTP:dT there is a loss of ∼3 kcal/mol in ground state binding free energy and 2.7 kcal/mol in apparent free energy contributions to the maximum rate, kpol, giving a net loss of 5.7 kcal/mol in kpol/Kd. In contrast, dATP:dF shows about a 2 kcal/mol loss in ground state binding free energy but very little effect on kpol. In general for this series, the loss of hydrogen bonding potential leads to 2–3 kcal/mol reduction in ground state binding free energy, whereas effects on the maximum rate of polymerization are quite variable, from negligible (dATP:dF) to nearly 4 kcal/mol (dZTP:dT). In Fig. 5B, we show ΔΔG values for changes in efficiency for base pair mimics of TTP:dA. These data show marked reductions in both ground state binding (3 kcal/mol) and maximum rate of incorporation (2–4 kcal/mol) due to the substitution of dQ for dA in the template. In addition, the vertical alignment of columns in Fig. 5B is correlated with Fig. 5A to allow comparison with the analog in the incoming dNTP rather than the template; for example, we compare TTP:dQ with dQTP:dT in the first column. The trends across this series are consistent between Figs. 5, A and B, indicating the efficiencies of incorporation follow the trend (TTP:dQ < dQTP:dT) < (dFTP:dQ < dQTP:dF) < (dFTP:dA < dATP:dF). Effects on Fidelity—The effects of the analog substitutions on fidelity of Pol γ are summarized in Fig. 7. The net effect on discrimination is shown on a free energy scale, and the contributions to the apparent ground state binding (Kd) and maximum rate of polymerization (kpol) are resolved as the dark and light sections of each bar, respectively. In this figure a larger bar represents better discrimination. The two figures on the left illustrate fidelity for natural nucleotides, whereas the two figures on the right show results for the analogs in the template. In the upper two figures we compare the effect of substituting the template dF for the template dT. It can be clearly seen that there is little effect of a template dF on discrimination contributed by changes in kpol. The enzyme maintains a significant 2 kcal/mol discrimination in kpol against each mismatch independent of whether dF or dT is in the template. However, there is a significant loss in fidelity due to failure to discriminate the correct from incorrect base pair in the ground state binding. This suggests that the loss of hydrogen bonding potential by dF leads to a loss in ground state binding discrimination but not in rate of incorporation. This result parallels that seen in Fig. 5 defining the effects of dF substitution on efficiency. As shown in the lower two graphs in Fig. 7, a templating dQ leads to complete loss of discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W1984990912,"We have previously demonstrated that human H2-relaxin can mediate androgen-independent growth of LNCaP through a mechanism that involves the activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. The goal of the current study is to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which H2-relaxin causes activation of the AR pathway. Our data indicate that there is cross-talk between AR and components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Addition of H2-relaxin to LNCaP cells resulted in increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) with subsequent cytoplasmic accumulation of beta-catenin. Immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that the stabilized beta-catenin formed a complex with AR, which was then translocated into the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis determined that the AR/beta-catenin complex binds to the proximal region of the prostate-specific antigen promoter. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, using LY294002, prevented both H2-relaxin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta and translocation of beta-catenin/AR into the nucleus. Knockdown of beta-catenin levels using a beta-catenin-specific small interfering RNA inhibited H2-relaxin-induced AR activity. The combined data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt and components of the Wnt pathway can facilitate H2-relaxin-mediated activation of the AR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2047535191,"Regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is highly complex and may involve several aldosterone-induced regulatory proteins. The N-Myc downstream-regulated gene <i>2</i> (NDRG2) has been identified as an early aldosterone-induced gene. Therefore, we hypothesized that NDRG2 may affect ENaC function. To test this hypothesis we measured the amiloride-sensitive (2 μm) whole cell current (Δ<i>I</i><sub>ami</sub>) in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes expressing ENaC alone or co-expressing ENaC and NDRG2. Co-expression of NDRG2 significantly increased Δ<i>I</i><sub>ami</sub> in some, but not, all batches of oocytes tested. An inhibitory effect of NDRG2 was never observed. Using a chemiluminescence assay we demonstrated that the NDRG2-induced increase in ENaC currents was accompanied by a similar increase in channel surface expression. The stimulatory effect of NDRG2 was preserved in oocytes maintained in a low sodium bath solution to prevent sodium feedback inhibition. These findings suggest that the stimulatory effect of NDRG2 is independent of sodium feedback regulation. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of NDRG2 on ENaC was at least in part additive to that of Sgk1. A short isoform of NDRG2 also stimulated Δ<i>I</i><sub>ami</sub>. Overexpression of NDRG2 and ENaC in Fisher rat thyroid cells confirmed the stimulatory effect of NDRG2 on ENaC-mediated short-circuit current (<i>I</i><sub>SC-ami</sub>). In addition, small interference RNA against NDRG2 largely reduced <i>I</i><sub>SC-ami</sub> in Fisher rat thyroid cells. Our results indicate that NDRG2 is a likely candidate to contribute to aldosterone-mediated ENaC regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2075954169,"Mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain associate with clinical responses to EGFR inhibitors and are frequently observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in East Asian populations. Clinically identified EGFR mutations cause constitutive receptor activation. The activating mechanisms were unclear but appeared to be different among EGFR mutants. We found that EGFR mutants had different sensitivity to an Src inhibitor PP2. S768I and L861Q mutants were less sensitive to Src suppression than others. Mutation at tyrosine 869 (845) residue, an Src phosphorylation site, decreased the phosphorylation levels of wild-type EGFR and other mutants, but not that of S768I and L861Q mutants, suggesting that S768I and L861Q mutants became Src independent for their activation and biological functions. In contrast, cells expressing EGFR-L858R or exon 19 deletion mutants were more sensitive to PP2 than cells expressing wild-type EGFR. Interestingly, EGFR with exon 19-deletion/T790M double mutations, which was resistant to gefitinib, remained sensitive to PP2. Taken together, our data indicate that Src inhibitors might be effective in treating NSCLC harboring specific types of EGFR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2025968452,"A characteristic feature of many vertebrate axons is their wrapping by a lamellar stack of glially derived membranes known as the myelin sheath. Myelin is a cholesterol-rich membrane that allows for rapid saltatory nerve impulse conduction. Axonal neuregulins instruct glial cells on when and how much myelin they should produce. However, how neuregulin regulates myelin sheath development and thickness is unknown. Here we show that neuregulin receptors are activated by drops in plasma membrane cholesterol, suggesting that they can sense sterol levels. In Schwann cells neuregulin-1 increases the transcription of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis. Neuregulin activity is mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and a cAMP-response element located on the reductase promoter. We propose that by activating neuregulin receptors, neurons exploit a cholesterol homeostatic mechanism forcing Schwann cells to produce new membranes for the myelin sheath.

Glial cells (oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system) extend plasma membrane processes, wrapping axons with specialized membrane named myelin. It is well established that myelin thickness depends largely on axon size (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J.

Studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that HMGR is highly regulated at the transcriptional level (6Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). When cholesterol concentration drops in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the SREBP-2 transcription factor is released and binds to a sterol-response element (SRE) located on the HMGR promoter. This leads to increased transcription of the HMGR gene, stimulating the cholesterol biosynthesis and safeguarding the adequate cholesterol concentration within the cell (6Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Other regulatory elements on this promoter have been described, suggesting that additional transcription factors regulate HMGR expression (7Di Croce L. Vicent G.P. Pecci A. Bruscalupi G. Trentalance A. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase lipoprotein-deficient serum fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cAMP-response element CRE-binding protein sterol-response element phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase sensory and motor-neuron derived factor methyl-β-cyclodextrin glutathione S-transferase endoplasmic reticulum quantitative PCR TATA-binding protein epidermal growth factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein. Most of the free cellular cholesterol is located within the plasma membrane (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1375-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) where levels are tightly regulated. Despite this, no cholesterol sensor has been proposed for this cell compartment. However, it has been shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (also known as ErbB1), which resides in the plasma membrane, is phosphorylated after acute cholesterol depletion (8Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49631-49637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In turn, ErbB1 phosphorylation causes hyperactivation of the PI3K and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, showing that membrane cholesterol depletion can elicit intracellular signaling cascades (9Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and suggesting that some ErbB receptors could be part of a mechanism for sensing plasma membrane cholesterol concentration. Here we show that neuregulin receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) are transactivated by ErbB1 after acute drops in cholesterol, suggesting that they could also form part of a plasma membrane cholesterol-sensing mechanism. In addition, we show that the activation of the neuregulin 1-ErbB pathway in Schwann cells up-regulates the expression of HMGR, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. We propose that neurons, by activating the NRG-ErbB pathway, simulate a drop of cholesterol to which Schwann cells respond augmenting cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol up-regulation will help to increase plasma membrane size, which will wrap around the axon to form the myelin sheath. Constructs, Promoter Cloning, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The HMGR promoter (nucleotides -309, +77) was amplified from mouse genomic DNA (using primers sense 5′-CTGAGTTCGGGGTACTCCAC and antisense 5′-CTCACCTCCGGATCTCAATG), cloned in pCRII, and subcloned in pGL3 basic (Promega). Deletions of SRE and CRE were produced by inverse PCR with a high fidelity DNA polymerase. Briefly, SRE was mutated by inverse PCR using the primers sense 5′-TGGTGCGACGTCCGTTCTCCGCCCGGGTGC and antisense 5′-CGGGCAGACGTCCATCTCTCACCACGCAGA; CRE site was mutated using the primers sense 5′-TTCGTGGACGTCGCCGTCAGGCTGAGCAGC and antisense 5′-CGGCCTGACGTCCGAACGGTCTCCCTAACA. Amplicons were digested with DpnI to remove the template and with AatII to create compatible ends before ligation. Digested products were ligated and transformed in Escherichia coli DH5α. All constructs were verified by automatic sequencing. The pcDNA3-ErbB2, pcDNA3-ErbB3, and pcDNA3-ErbB4 vectors were kindly provided by Professor Yossef Yarden (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). pECF1-myr-Akt was kindly provided by Professor F. Mayor (Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain). mRNA Detection and Quantification by Reverse Transcription-PCR and qPCR—To detect and quantify gene expression, Schwann cell total RNA was isolated and retro-transcribed to cDNA with SuperScript II Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Control reactions were performed by omitting retrotranscriptase. First strand cDNA was PCR-amplified with specific primers for SREBP-2 (sense 5′-AAGTCTGGCGTTCTGAGGAA and antisense 5′-CCAGGAAGGTGAGGACACAT), SCAP (sense 5′-CGATGTACTAACAGGCAGCCG and antisense 5′-GCCGGTCACCAGAAGGTTA), INSIG1 (sense 5′-CTTGTGGTGGACGTTTGATCG and antisense 5′-CACTGTGACACCTCCTGAGA), INSIG-2 (sense 5′-CGGTGCTCTTCTTCATTGGCG and antisense 5′-GTGGCTCTCCTAGATGCCTGTC), site 1 protease (5′-GTTTGAAGACAACATCGCCCG and antisense 5′-AGCTCCCGCTTCTGTACTG); and site 2 protease (sense 5′-TGAAGTCGCAGAGGACTCAC and antisense 5′-GCCATTCAGTAGAACCATCTAGTCG). Real time PCR analysis was performed using Platinum® SYBR®Green qPCR Supermix UDG (Invitrogen) with 400 nm of gene-specific primers for rat HMGR (sense 5′-CCAAGGTGGTGAGAGAAGTATT and antisense 5′-TCTCTATAGACGGCATGGTACA). Reactions were performed in duplicate, and threshold cycle values were normalized to the housekeeping rat TBP mRNA (sense 5′-GAGAGCCACGAACAACTGCG and antisense 5′-AGCTTCTGCACAACTCTAGC). The specificity of the products was determined by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. The ratio of the relative expression of HMGR to TBP was calculated by using the 2ΔCT formula. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and MCF-7 were obtained from the ATCC and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The Oligo-neu cell line was kindly provided by Prof. J. Trotter (University of Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured in SATO medium (10Jung M. Kramer E. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazaie K. Chlichlia K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1245-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were cultured from sciatic nerves of neonatal rats as described previously by Brockes et al. (11Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). All the procedures were performed following European Union and institutional guidelines. Cells cultures were expanded in DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS, 5 μm forskolin, and 50 nm GST-NRG1 and used up to eighth passage except where indicated. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Purification of Recombinant Neuregulins and Tyrosine Phosphorylation Assay—Cloning of pGEX-SMDF was already described elsewhere (12Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding EGF-like domain of NRG1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4T-1. Bacterial cells were grown until reaching 0.6-0.8 mOD. Thereafter, cells were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.3 mm for 4 h and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to reach 1% and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein was purified from the supernatant with GSH-agarose beads. After extensive washing, neuregulin was eluted from the beads with 10 mm GSH in 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The concentration of protein was determined using the method of Bradford et al. (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Neuregulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB receptors was carried out as described by Ho et al. (14Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were grown until ≥80% confluence in 24-well plates. Thereafter, cells were serum-starved for 5 h and incubated with recombinant SMDF for 3 min. Medium was removed, and cells were harvested with 100 μl of β-mercaptoethanol containing SDS sample buffer. Whole cell extracts were heat-denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from Sigma (1:1,000). Cholesterol Depletion Assays—To ensure comparable levels of the receptor per well, pcDNA3-ErbB transiently transfected COS-7 cells were trypsinized, reseeded, and grown to ≈80% confluence in 24-well plates. Thereafter, cells were serum-starved for 18 h and incubated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) at the concentration indicated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Where indicated, AG1478 (in Me2SO) was preincubated for 1 h before MβCD treatment. Controls were treated with vehicle (Me2SO). ErbB phosphorylation analysis in transfected cells was performed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with epitope-specific antibodies (anti-p-ErbB2-Tyr-1248 and anti-ErbB2 from Upstate and anti-phosphotyrosine from Sigma). Reporter Activity Assays—Schwann cells, MCF-7, Oligo-neu, or COS-7 cells were growth in 60-mm culture dishes and transfected with the pHMGR-Luc construct (or the promoter deletions). 6 h later cells were trypsinized, replated into 48-well dishes (100,000 cells/well), and incubated with the indicated treatment in DMEM. 48 h later cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega) using the manufacturer's recommendations. The β-galactosidase activity (Beta-Glo Assay System, Promega) of a pCMV-LacZ reporter co-transfected at 1:100 was used to normalize variations in cell number, viability, and transfection efficiency. No major changes in β-galactosidase activity or cell morphology were observed. Neuregulin Receptors Are Activated by Transphosphorylation after Drops in Plasma Membrane Cholesterol—To test whether, similar to ErbB1 (8Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49631-49637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), other members of the ErbB receptor family can also sense the plasma membrane cholesterol level, the cDNA encoding for ErbB2 was transfected into the fibroblast cell line COS-7. Plasma membrane cholesterol was acutely depleted with increasing concentrations of MβCD and receptor phosphorylation status monitored with an antiphospho-ErbB2 (Tyr-1248)-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1a, ErbB2 was strongly phosphorylated in an MβCD dose-dependent manner, suggesting that cholesterol levels modulate the phosphorylation status of ErbB2. Additionally, we found that all the other members of this receptor family, ErbB3 and ErbB4, are also phosphorylated during cholesterol depletion (Fig. 1b). Because COS-7 cells naturally express ErbB1, which heterodimerizes with other ErbB receptors, the possibility exists that cholesterol depletion-induced ErbB1 activation transphosphorylates other ErbB partners. To test this hypothesis, cells were preincubated with 30 nm of the ErbB1-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 (ErbB1 IC50 = 3 nm) (15Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 1c, AG1478 completely inhibited the MβCD-induced phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB2/ErbB3 in transfected COS-7 cells. Thus, our results indicate that ErbB1 can sense drops in plasma membrane cholesterol concentration and transactivate other ErbB receptors. Activation of the Neuregulin-ErbB Pathway Stimulates HMGR Gene Transcription in Cell Lines of Different Lineages—It has been shown that the epidermal growth factor (a ligand for ErbB1) up-regulates the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in adenocarcinoma cells (16Asslan R. Pradines A. Pratx C. Allal C. Favre G. Le Gaillard F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of ErbB signaling in cholesterol biosynthesis, we investigated the effects produced by activation of this pathway in different ways on the transcription of the HMGR gene. To this goal, we cloned the mouse HMGR promoter (nucleotides -309 to +77) into a luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-basic). The resulting construct (pHMGR-Luc) and the pcDNA3-ErbB2 and pcDNA-ErbB3 vectors were co-transfected into COS-7 cells, and the resulting luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 2a, the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex nearly doubled the transcriptional activity of the HMGR promoter (1.87 ± 0.09-fold (n = 6)). This result suggests that neuregulins, by activating the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex are involved in the control of cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured mammalian cells. To test this hypothesis further, we took advantage of MCF-7 cells, a human adenocarcinoma cell line that naturally expresses the neuregulin receptors ErbB2 and ErbB3 (17Chan S.D. Antoniucci D.M. Fok K.S. Alajoki M.L. Harkins R.N. Thompson S.A. Wada H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells transfected with pHMGR-Luc were incubated with recombinant sensory and motor-neuron derived factor (SMDF), a human type III neuregulin 1 highly expressed in the peripheral nervous system (14Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2b, recombinant SMDF (GST-SMDF) promotes the phosphorylation of the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex (inset) and induces the activity of the HMGR promoter in MCF-7 cells (1.9 ± 0.3-fold increase (n = 6)). Neuregulin-ErbB signaling pathway plays an essential role in glial cell development and myelination (18Garratt A.N. Britsch S. Birchmeier C. BioEssays. 2002; 22: 987-996Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To unveil whether it also has a role in cholesterol biosynthesis in glial cells, we turned to Oligo-neu cells, a murine oligodendrocyte cell line immortalized by the expression of a constitutive active form of ErbB2 (10Jung M. Kramer E. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazaie K. Chlichlia K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1245-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 2c, two ErbB inhibitors (AG1478 and AG825) decreased significantly the activity of the HMGR promoter in these cells, suggesting that neuregulin-ErbB pathway controls cholesterol biosynthesis also in glial cells. Taken together, our results show that activity of the neuregulin-ErbB pathway controls the HMGR gene expression at the transcriptional level in mammalian cell lines of different lineage, including glial cells. Neuregulin 1 Increases the Steady-state Levels for HMGR mRNA in Schwann Cells—It has been shown that the thickness of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system is graded to the amount of neuregulin expressed on the surface of the neuronal axon (2Michailov G.V. Sereda M.W. Brinkmann B.G. Fischer T.M. Haug B. Birchmeier C. Role L. Lai C. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Science. 2004; 304: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 3Taveggia C. Zanazzi G. Petrylak A. Yano H. Rosenbluth J. Einheber S. Xu X. Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. Shrager P. Chao M.V. Falls D.L. Role L. Salzer J.L. Neuron. 2005; 47: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because myelin is a cholesterol-enriched specialized plasma membrane, and cholesterol is critical for myelin biogenesis (4Saher G. Brugger B. Lappe-Siefke C. Mobius W. Tozawa R. Wehr M.C. Wieland F. Ishibashi S. Nave K.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), we tested whether the neuregulin-ErbB pathway controls the cholesterol biosynthesis in primary cultures of Schwann cells, the cell type responsible for myelination in the peripheral nervous system. To this goal, Schwann cells were obtained from excised sciatic nerves of newborn rats and cultured (see “Experimental Procedures”). Schwann cells primary cultures (6-8 passes) were transfected with the pHMGR-Luc and pCMV-LacZ constructs described previously and incubated with recombinant SMDF. As is shown in Fig. 3a, GST-SMDF increased the HMGR promoter activity by 2.21 ± 0.28-fold (n = 9) in Schwann cells, supporting the tenet that axonally derived neuregulin controls cholesterol biosynthesis in myelinating cells. All neuregulin 1 products share an EGF-like domain that binds and activates ErbB receptors (15Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). To test whether the effect of SMDF on HMGR transcriptional activity is mediated by the EGF-like domain, we cloned, expressed, and purified this domain in bacteria. As is shown in Fig. 3a, the recombinant EGF-like domain of neuregulin 1 (GST-NRG1) increased the transcription of the HMGR gene as well (3.47 ± 0.51-fold, (n = 6)), strongly suggesting that SMDF effect is mediated by direct ErbB3-ErbB2 complex activation. Because we regularly expand the Schwann cell cultures in medium containing serum, forskolin, and neuregulin, the possibility exists that the activation-induced down-regulation of neuregulin receptors masked partially the transcriptional effects of neuregulin. To explore the role of neuregulin on HMGR transcriptional activity in a more physiological model, we repeated the experiments with nonexpanded rat Schwann cell cultures. The presence of fibroblasts in these cultures should not affect the conclusions because they do not express neuregulin receptors and cannot contribute to the transcriptional effects of neuregulin (data not shown). In fact, a putative diluting effect caused by a higher reporter (β-galactosidase) activity is expected. Remarkably, as is shown in Fig. 3b, the responsiveness of the HMGR promoter to GST-NRG1 in nonexpanded Schwann cell cultures was much higher (14.3 ± 1.4-fold increase (n = 9)) than that found in expanded cultures. Therefore, our results show that the transcriptional effect of neuregulin decreases in expanded Schwann cell cultures, probably as a consequence of the down-regulation of ErbB receptors. Steady-state levels of mRNA depend on the balance between synthesis and degradation rates. To check whether the transcriptional effect of neuregulin is translated into an increase in the steady-state amount of the HMGR mRNA in Schwann cells, we determined, using real time qPCR, the changes in HMGR mRNA in Schwann cultures in response to neuregulin 1 application. To avoid any genomic DNA amplification, specific primers for rat HMGR were designed in separated exons that include a large intron interposed between them (see “Experimental Procedures”). To normalize gene expression levels, a housekeeping gene (the rat TATA-binding protein (TBP)) was used. As is shown in Fig. 3c, GST-NRG1 increased up to 181 ± 5% (n = 4) the amount of the HMGR transcript. Thus, our results so far show that the axonal product neuregulin 1 stimulates the transcription of the HMGR gene in cultured Schwann cells and produces an almost 2-fold increase in the total amount of the HMGR mRNA transcript. Intracellular Pathways Involved in Neuregulin 1 Signaling—The HMGR promoter contains at least two transcription factor-binding sites, shown schematically in Fig. 4a. The transcriptional control of HMGR in response to cholesterol depletion in hepatocytes and fibroblasts is mainly mediated by a sterol response element (SRE) located in the HMGR promoter (6Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 20Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Because Schwann cells do express the mRNA for the transcription factor SREBP-2 (Fig. 6b), we decided to explore whether SRE mediates the neuregulin-induced HMGR transcriptional activation in these cells. To this goal, we deleted the SRE of the pHMGR-Luc construct (Fig. 4a). Schwann cells were transfected with the wild type construct or the mutant, and the responsiveness to neuregulin SMDF was compared with the luciferase/β-galactosidase assay. As is shown in Fig. 4b, we were unable to detect any modification in the neuregulin-induced transcriptional activation after SRE disruption (1.94 ± 0.19-fold increase in the mutant versus 2.19 ± 0.19 in wild type), suggesting that the neuregulin effect is mediated by a different transcription factor-binding site in this promoter. It has been shown previously that thyrotropin-mediated stimulation of the HMGR gene transcription in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells is mediated by a CRE located downstream of the SRE (21Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4a). To test whether the CRE site mediates the transcriptional effect of neuregulin in Schwann cells, we introduced disruptive mutations in its core by inverse PCR. As is shown in Fig. 4b, mutations in CRE decreased (although not abrogated) the GST-SMDF-induced stimulation of the HMGR promoter (1.33 ± 0.15-fold (n = 6)), suggesting that neuregulin transcriptional control of HMGR is in part mediated by the cAMP-response element. To explore this tenet further, a CRE-luciferase construct (pCRE-Luc) was transfected into cultured rat Schwann cells, and the transcriptional effect of neuregulin was determined by the luciferase/β-galactosidase assay. As is shown in Fig. 4c, GST-SMDF was able to stimulate CRE promoter activity in Schwann cells by 2.37 ± 0.29-fold (n = 6). Even a larger increment (4.52 ± 0.22-fold (n = 3)) was obtained with GST-NRG1. Taken together our results suggest that the transcriptional effect of neuregulin 1 on the HMGR gene in Schwann cells is in part mediated by a CREB/ATF transcription factor. Indeed, when the cAMP-dependent pathway was stimulated with forskolin (Fig. 4d), the transcriptional effect of GST-NRG1 on HMGR gene doubled (6.34 ± 0.69-fold (n = 6) versus 3.24 ± 0.44-fold (n = 6) in nontreated cultures).FIGURE 6Cholesterol deprivation up-regulates the transcription of the HMGR gene in COS-7 but not in Schwann cells. a pHMGR-Luc/pCMV-LacZ-transfected cultures were incubated in culture with cholesterol-containing medium (10% FBS) or cholesterol-deprived medium (10% LPDS). After 48 h, luciferase and β-galactosidase activity of cell extracts were determined. No major changes in β-galactosidase activity were found. Data are given as mean ± S.E. The number of experiments (n) is indicated. b Schwann cells express SREBP-2 mRNA and the mRNA for the proteins involved in its processing. Total RNA from Schwann cells was extracted, retrotranscribed to cDNA, and PCR-amplified with specific primers for SREBP-2, INSIG-1, INSIG-2, Site 1 protease, and Site 2 protease.

https://openalex.org/W2031878325,"In this study, we employed a panel of cell lines to determine whether p53-dependent cell death in neuroblastoma (NB) cells is caused by apoptotic cellular function, and we further studied the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced via the p53-dependent pathway. We obtained evidence that a type of p53-dependent stress, doxorubicin (Doxo) administration, causes accumulation of p53 in the nucleus of NB cells and phosphorylation of several serine residues in both Doxo-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Upregulation of p53-downstream molecules in cells and upregulation of Noxa in the mitochondrial fraction were observed only in Doxo-sensitive NB cells. Significance of Noxa in the Doxo-induced NB cell death was confirmed by Noxa-knockdown experiments. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including cytochrome-c release and membrane potential disregulation, occurred and resulted in the activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway. However, in the Doxo-resistant cells, the accumulation in the nucleus and phosphorylation of p53 did not induce p53-downstream p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression and the Noxa upregulation, resulting in the retention of the mitochondrial homeostasis. Taken together, these findings indicate that the p53 pathway seems to play a crucial role in NB cell death by Noxa regulation in mitochondria, and inhibition of the induction of p53-downstream effectors may regulate drug resistance of NB cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065580598,"The MtrB-MtrA two component system of Corynebacterium glutamicum was recently shown to be in involved in the osmostress response as well as cell wall metabolism. To address the question of whether the histidine protein kinase MtrB is an osmosensor, the kinase was purified and reconstituted into liposomes in a functionally active form. The activity regulation was investigated by varying systematically physicochemical parameters, which are putative stimuli that could be used by the bacterial cell to detect osmotic conditions. Membrane shrinkage was ruled out as a stimulus for activation of MtrB. Instead, MtrB was shown to be activated upon the addition of various chemical compounds, like sugars, amino acids, and polyethylene glycols. Because of the different chemical nature of the solutes, it seems unlikely that they bind to a specific binding site. Instead, they are proposed to act via a change of the hydration state of the protein shifting MtrB into the active state. For MtrB activation it was essential that these solutes were added at the same side as the cytoplasmic domains of the kinase were located, indicating that hypertonicity is sensed by MtrB via cytoplasmatically located protein domains. This was confirmed by the analysis of two MtrB mutants in which either the large periplasmic loop or the HAMP domain was deleted. These mutants were regulated similar to wild type MtrB. Thus, we postulate that MtrB belongs to a class of histidine protein kinases that sense environmental changes at cytoplasmatic protein domains independently of the periplasmic loop and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain.

Bacteria harbor large numbers of sensors for monitoring changes in chemical and physical parameters in their environment. The most common type of a bacterial sensory and signal transduction system is the two-component system. This system typically consists of a homodimeric membrane-bound histidine protein kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator acting in most cases as a transcription factor. The histidine protein kinase, which is activated by an environmental stimulus, autophosphorylates in an ATP-dependent manner on a conserved histidine residue. The resulting high energy phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to an aspartate residue of the response regulator. In turn, this affects the DNA binding properties of the response regulator effector domain (1Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar).Two-component systems are frequently used by bacteria to detect environmental changes. The functions of these different signal transduction systems are diverse, ranging from the detection of nutrients (e.g. citrate, fumarate, or nitrogen) or toxic agents (e.g. copper) to other sensing processes like the perception of envelope, osmotic, or chill stress (3Golby P. Davies S. Kelly D.J. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1248Crossref Google Scholar, 4Munson G.P. Lam D.L. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently it was proposed that MtrB-MtrA from Corynebacterium glutamicum regulates expression of the genes important for both cell wall biosynthesis and osmostress response because altered mRNA levels of different genes were determined in the ΔmtrAB mutant (9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the one hand, the expression of mepA, ppmA, and lpqB was elevated. These genes encode, respectively, a putative secreted metalloprotease, a putative membrane-bound protease modulator, and a lipoprotein of unknown function and are suggested to be important for peptidoglycan bio-synthesis (9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RNA hybridization experiments showed that three of four genes coding for the osmoregulated carriers for the uptake of compatible solutes are under the control of MtrB-MtrA. After a hyperosmotic upshift, the expression of proP, betP,or lcoP was either dramatically decreased (proP) or completely abolished (betP and lcoP) in the mutant strain ΔmtrAB (9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These observations led to the suggestion that the response regulator MtrA could act either as a repressor or as an activator (9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently binding of MtrA to the promoter regions of mepA, betP, and proP has been confirmed (10Brocker M. Bott M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 264: 205-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), proving that the MtrB-MtrA system indeed directly regulates different cellular processes. Presumably, to control both cell wall metabolism and osmoregulation MtrB should possess different sensing capabilities. Because the genes coding for the uptake systems for compatible solutes are induced gradually depending on the extent of the osmotic stress applied, 2N. Möker, P. Reihlen, R. Krämer, and S. Morbach, unpublished results. 2N. Möker, P. Reihlen, R. Krämer, and S. Morbach, unpublished results. we suggested that MtrB is an osmosensor, capable of sensing the stress intensity.The question arose of which stimulus is recognized by the histidine kinase MtrB as a measure of osmotic changes in order to induce the autophosphorylation reaction and, thus, to transduce the osmotic stress signal into the cell. An increase in the environmental osmolality concomitantly leads to changes in many other external and internal parameters, including concentrations of specific solutes, ionic strength, and internal osmolality as well as the physical state of the membrane (11Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not possible to analyze the effect of individual physicochemical parameters in whole cells. The complexity of the cell can be reduced by using proteoliposomes in which the sensing properties of a membrane protein can be examined by varying one parameter at a time (12Rübenhagen R. Morbach S. Krämer R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5412-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, we succeeded in reconstituting MtrB in functionally active form in liposomes. The sensor kinase showed all the characteristic enzymatic activities in this in vitro system (14Möker N. Krämer J. Unden G. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3645-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MtrB was efficiently activated in the presence of monovalent cations, like K+,Rb+, NH +4, and to a lesser extent by Na+. In principle, increasing ionic strength could signal hyperosmotic conditions in vivo, because the induced efflux of water leads to an increased concentration of cytoplasmic K+. However, the tested cations were shown to have a general stabilizing effect on reconstituted histidine protein kinases rather than to act as an osmo-specific signal for MtrB. This was concluded from the observation that the reconstituted fumarate sensor DcuS from Escherichia coli, which is not involved in the osmostress response in this organism, was activated in a similar way by these cations (14Möker N. Krämer J. Unden G. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3645-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this investigation we addressed the question of which stimulus is recognized by MtrB as a measure of the osmotic changes. Using DcuS as a control representing a protein without osmosensing capability, we were able to identify stimuli specific for the activation of MtrB under osmotic stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-The E. coli strains used in this study are DH5αmcr (15Grant S.G.N. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Adad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and DK8 (16Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cells were routinely cultivated in LB (Luria Bertani) medium in shaking flasks under aerobic conditions between 30 and 37 °C. The C. glutamicum type strain ATCC 13032 was cultivated aerobically in shaking flasks on a rotary shaker (125 rpm) at 30 °C in brain heart infusion medium or MM1 minimal medium (17Nottebrock D. Meyer U. Krämer R. Morbach S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 218: 305-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 4% (w/v) sucrose as carbon source. In the latter medium optical cell densities of up to 40 can be reached.Materials and Chemicals-E. coli phospholipids (polar lipid extract) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) 3The abbreviations used are: PEGpolyethylene glycolDDMN-dodecyl α-d-maltoside. i.e. PEG 2, 4, and PEG 6 (Mr of 106–300) were monodisperse fractions from Fluka (Taufkirchen, Germany). The monodisperse PEG 8, PEG 12, and PEG 28 having a molecular weight of 370.4, 546. 7 or 1251. 5, respectively, were purchased from Polypure (Oslo, Norway).Isolation of RNA and RNA Hybridization-C. glutamicum cells were grown in brain heart infusion medium for 10 h before fresh brain heart infusion medium was inoculated at an optical density (A600) of 0.5. After 16 h of growth, these cells were washed once in 0.9% NaCl and inoculated in MM1 medium to an A600 of 2. After reaching the mid-exponential growth phase (A600 of 6–7) trehalose was added to increase the external osmolality from 0.3 to 1.7 osmol/kg. Cells were harvested for purification of RNA immediately before and up to 180 min after the osmotic upshock. For this purpose 2 ml of cell culture were sedimented by centrifugation at 30 °C, suspended in buffer RA I (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and broken with 300 mg of glass beads (0.1–0.25-mm diameter) by two sequential passages of 30 s at 6.5 m/s in a FastPrep ®120 instrument (Q-Biogene, Heidelberg, Germany). RNA was purified from the disrupted cells with the Nucleospin ®RNAII kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digoxygenin-labeled antisense probes were synthesized as described recently (9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Changes in gene transcription were monitored by RNA hybridization experiments using these antisense RNA probes. For this purpose 5 μg of total RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane using a Minifold Dot Blotter (Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was bound to the membrane by careful vacuum suction (15 mbar) and subsequently cross-linked by means of ultraviolet irradiation at 125 J/cm2. Hybridization and detection steps were carried out according to the DIG application manual (Roche Applied Science). Chemiluminescence was detected using a Fuji luminescent image analyzer LAS1000 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).Construction of pASK-IBA3-mtrB-strep and Mutant Forms of MtrB-The construction of the plasmid used for the synthesis of MtrB carrying the Strep Tag II at the C-terminal end was described recently (14Möker N. Krämer J. Unden G. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3645-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the construction of the mtrB variant, mtrBΔ190, missing the sequence encoding the first 190 amino acids, the forward primer (5′-CCC GGG GAC CGC GGT ACC CAA CAG GTC ACC GC), the reverse primer (CAC TTC ACA GGT CAA GC), and the template pIBA3-mtrB-strep were used for PCR. After restriction using SacII and HindIII, the PCR product was ligated into the SacII- and HindIII-restricted pASK-IBA3 vector (IBA GmbH, Göttingen), resulting in a 3′-end fusion to the DNA sequence encoding the Strep Tag II. The correct sequence and orientation of the mtrBΔ190 gene was verified by sequencing. To construct a gene where the sequence encoding the 134 amino acids of the periplasmic loop, which has a total of 144 amino acids, was deleted, the following PCR strategy was used. The primers (forward primer, 5′-AGC GAC GAA TCC TCT CTT G, and the reverse primer, 5′-AAT ATC GAT TTT CTG ATC CAC) annealed at the sequence of mtrB flanking the deletion in the template pIBA3-mtrB-strep. In this case the complete sequence of the plasmid except the desired deletion region was amplified, and the resulting fragment was re-ligated. The sequence encoding mtrBΔL134 was isolated using SacII and HindIII and ligated into the SacII- and HindIII-restricted pASK-IBA3 vector, resulting in a 3′-end fusion to the DNA sequence encoding the Strep Tag II. The correct sequence of the mtrBΔL134 gene was verified by sequencing. A similar PCR strategy was used for the construction of mtrBΔHAMP. In this case the forward primer, 5′-AAA TTG GAG GAA TAC GGC AA, and the reversed primer, 5′-GGT GGC TAG CCA TGC GA, were used. As a result a mutant form of mtrB was constructed in which the DNA sequence encoding the amino acids 192–244 of MtrB was deleted. This sequence represents the HAMP domain starting directly downstream of the second transmembrane segment.Purification of MtrA-His10 by Nickel-nitrilotriacetic Acid Affinity Chromatography-For the isolation and purification of MtrA-His10, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET224b-mtrA in which the sequence of C. glutamicum mtrA was fused in-frame at the 3′-end with the sequence encoding a His tag with 10 histidine residues 4M. Brocker and M. Bott, unpublished data. were used. The purification was performed as recently described (14Möker N. Krämer J. Unden G. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3645-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Purification of MtrB-Strep, MtrBΔ190-Strep, MtrBΔL134-Strep, and MtrBΔHAMP-Strep by Strep Tag II/StrepTactin Affinity Chromatography-For the isolation and purification of MtrB-Strep, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the different pASK-IBA7-mtrB strep derivatives were used. The heterologous expression of mtrB was induced by the addition of 40 μg/liter anhydrotetracycline. Cells were harvested 3 h after induction, washed (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5), diluted in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, Complete (Roche Diagnostics), 5 μg/ml DNase1), and disrupted by three passages through a French ® pressure cell press. Cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation (223,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), washed once in lysis buffer, and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA). Membrane proteins were extracted at 4 °C with N-dodecyl α-d-maltoside (DDM), which was added stepwise until a final concentration of 2% was reached. After stirring at 4 °C for 30 min, the solubilized proteins were centrifuged for 20 min at 67,000 × g. After pre-equilibration of the StrepTactin column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) with buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% DDM), the supernatant containing MtrB-Strep was diluted with 4 volumes of buffer A (lacking DDM) and then applied to the column. The column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer C (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% DDM) and 10 volumes of buffer B before MtrB-Strep was eluted with 10 ml of buffer B containing 5 mm desthiobiotin. MtrB-Strep was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at–80 °C. For the purification of MtrBΔ190-Strep, the cytoplasmic fraction was used instead of the membranes.Purification of His6-DcuS by Nickel-nitrilotriacetic Acid Affinity Chromatography-For the isolation of His6-DcuS, a pET28a plasmid containing the dcuS gene was used that was fused at its 5′-end to the sequence of a His tag (18Janausch I.G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39809-39814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For synthesis of DcuS the E. coli strain BL21 was used. The purification was performed essentially as described recently (18Janausch I.G. Garcia-Moreno I. Unden G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39809-39814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Liposome Preparation-For the preparation of liposomes, E. coli phospholipids (polar lipid extract, 20 mg/ml in chloroform, Avanti polar lipids, Alabaster, AL) were first dried under vacuum in a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized for 16 h. Subsequently, the lyophilized lipids were dissolved in 100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 20 mg of phospholipids/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at–80 °C. To avoid oxidation, the lipids were kept under a nitrogen atmosphere during preparation. Before use, liposomes were formed by extrusion (Liposofast, Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) 14–20 times through polycarbonate filters (pore diameter, 400 nm).Reconstitution of MtrB-Strep, MtrBΔL134-Strep, MtrBΔHAMP, or His6-DcuS-The purified sensor kinases were reconstituted as described by Rigaud et al. (19Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Liposomes were diluted in 100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, to a concentration of 5 mg/ml and extruded (Liposofast; Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) 14–20 times through polycarbonate filters (pore diameter, 400 nm). The liposomes were partly solubilized by the stepwise addition of 2-μl aliquots of 20% Triton-X-100 solution until saturation was reached. Insertion of the detergent into the liposomes was followed by measuring the turbidity at 540 nm. Upon saturation with detergent, liposomes were mixed with purified MtrB-Strep, MtrBΔL134-Strep, MtrBΔHAMP or His6-DcuS at a lipid-to-protein ratio of 20:1 (w/w). The mixture was incubated for 35 min at 20 °C under gentle stirring. To remove detergent, Bio-Beads prewashed with deionized water were added at a Bio-Bead to Triton X-100 ratio of 5 (w/w) and a Bio-Bead to DDM ratio of 10 (w/w). Bio-Beads were added four times, and the mixture was kept under gentle stirring at room temperature for 1 h after each addition. The third treatment differed from these conditions; in this case the double amount of Bio-Beads was added, and the incubation time was prolonged to 16 h at 4 °C. After removal of Bio-Beads, the proteoliposomes in the supernatant were sedimented at 337,000 × g, extruded 14–20 times through polycarbonate filters (pore diameter, 400 nm) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and washed once. The proteoliposomes were adjusted to 0.8–1 μg of protein/μl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at–80 °C.Autophosphorylation of MtrB-Strep in Proteoliposomes-To test autophosphorylation activity of membrane-bound MtrB-Strep, 1.6–2 μg of reconstituted sensor kinase were slowly thawed at room temperature and diluted into phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) to a final volume of 950 μl. The proteoliposomes were extruded 14–20 times through polycarbonate filters (pore diameter, 400 nm) and collected by ultracentrifugation (337,000 × g). Subsequently they were adjusted to the desired concentration with the phosphorylation buffer supplemented with 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2 to a final volume of 10 μl. If indicated, the buffer contained up to 600 mm concentrations of various solutes. The autophosphorylation reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.22 μm [γ-33P]ATP (110 TBq mmol–1). Samples were incubated at 30 °C. Under standard conditions the reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of 9 μl of 2.4× SDS loading buffer, and samples were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to phosphorimaging plates (BAS-IP MP 2025, Fujifilm, Düsseldorf, Germany). Phosphorylation of proteins with [γ-33P] was detected using Fuji BAS-1800 (Fujifilm). For quantification of the phosphorylation signals, PcBAS version 2.09c was used. In control experiments, as shown in supplemental Fig. S1, it was verified that the autophosphorylation reaction still linearly increased after 20 min and, therefore, was not completed or saturated.Phosphotransfer from Membrane-bound MtrB-Strep to MtrA-His10-To analyze the MtrB-MtrA phosphotransfer activity in the presence of different solutes, reconstituted MtrB-Strep was phosphorylated by the addition of 0.22 μm [γ-33P]ATP as described above in the presence of up to 600 mm concentrations of several solutes. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, purified MtrA-His10 was added at a 4:1 MtrA/MtrB ratio (132 and 33 pmol, respectively) and further incubated at 30 °C. At the indicated time points, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 9 μl of 2.4× SDS loading buffer, and the samples were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE.Determination of High Osmolarity Induced Shrinkage of E. coli Polar Lipid Extract Liposomes-The measurements of high osmolarity induced shrinkage of E. coli lipid liposomes was performed as described by Racher et al. (20Racher K.I. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7324-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For this purpose E. coli liposomes were slowly thawed at room temperature and collected by ultracentrifugation. Calcein at 10 mm concentration (Invitrogen) was diluted in 20 mm KPi containing 50 mm NaCl, and the pH was titrated to 7.2 by the addition of KOH. To entrap 10 mm calcein in the liposomal lumen, liposomes were diluted in the calcein solution to a concentration of 20 mg/ml and extruded 14–20 times through polycarbonate filters (pore diameter, 400 nm). External calcein was removed by three gel filtration steps using G75-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Calcein-loaded liposomes were eluted in 1-ml fractions of 20 mm NaPi buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl. Osmotic upshifts were imposed by diluting 5–15 μl of calcein-loaded liposomes (5 mg/ml) into 500 μl of reaction buffer with or without added osmolyte in a 1-ml cuvette. Samples were kept at room temperature in the dark for exactly 1 min. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrometer (SLM Aminco, Büttelborm, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm (slit width of 8 nm).Determination of the Orientation of Reconstituted MtrB-Strep by Proteolysis-Accessibility of the C-terminal domain of MtrB-Strep was determined using either intact or solubilized liposomes. After thawing, MtrB-proteoliposomes were diluted in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, to meet the conditions required for peptidase activity and extruded 14–20 times in citrate buffer. Subsequently, 2.25 μg of reconstituted MtrB-Strep were diluted in the identical buffer to a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was performed in the presence of 0.2 μg/μl carboxypeptidase Y. In a control reaction, MtrB liposomes were disintegrated by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 before the protease was added. Proteolysis was carried out at 25 °C. At the given time intervals (up to 24 h) the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-loading buffer. The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or MtrB was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Integrity of the C-terminal Strep Tag II of MtrB was analyzed by Western blot analysis using the Strep-tag antibody.RESULTSExpression Regulation of betP and proP upon Hyperosmotic Shock in C. glutamicum-Recently, activation of the MtrB-dependent gene expression of betP and proP was analyzed by increasing the external osmolality of the medium with NaCl (9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test whether the external ionic strength or osmolality induces gene expression, an osmotic shift with trehalose was applied. Trehalose is suitable for this purpose since it cannot be taken up by C. glutamicum (21Tropis M. Meniche X. Wolf A. Gebhardt H. Strelkov S. Chami M. Schomburg D. Krämer R. Morbach S. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26573-26585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), thus creating an osmotic gradient across the membrane. After reaching the mid-exponential growth phase, C. glutamicum wild type or ΔmtrAB cells were shifted from the external osmolality of 0.3–1.7 osmol/kg by the addition of 1.5 m trehalose. Cells were harvested at time intervals up to 180 min after the osmotic shift, and total RNA was isolated. RNA hybridization experiments revealed that in C. glutamicum wild type cells expression of the carrier genes was significantly increased after the hyperosmotic shift. The betP gene showed a relatively high basal expression already at low osmolalities, whereas the proP expression was not detectable before the shift and showed a higher extent of induction. In contrast, in the ΔmtrAB mutant, the expression was abolished (betP) or markedly reduced (proP) (Fig. 1). Thus, induction of the two genes after an osmotic upshift by trehalose was almost identical to the response to the NaCl addition (Ref. 9Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). These results can be explained in two ways. If MtrB senses osmotic stress via the external protein domains, then osmolality rather than ionic strength is detected by MtrB. On the other hand, it is also possible that an internal parameter is sensed by MtrB. Applying a hyperosmotic shock with both trehalose or NaCl will lead to the efflux of water out of the cytoplasm and, thus, to a change of the internal conditions as well as the membrane strain.Orientation of MtrB in Liposomes-The orientation of a membrane protein after reconstitution is unpredictable. The reconstituted protein can be integrated in liposomes either randomly or in a unidirectional “right-side-out” or “inside-out” orientation. To analyze possible physicochemical stimuli related to hyperosmotic stress and to distinguish whether cytoplasmic or periplasmic protein domains of MtrB were involved in osmosensing, it was essential to determine the orientation of MtrB in proteoliposomes. We used a proteolytic approach to investigate the accessibility of the large catalytic C-terminal domain of MtrB, which is located in the cytoplasm in vivo. For this purpose either intact freshly extruded or solubilized MtrB-proteoliposomes were incubated with carboxypeptidase Y for up to 24 h (Fig. 2). At the indicated time points aliquots were withdrawn. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS, and subsequently proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The rate of degradation of MtrB was slightly faster in intact proteoliposomes than in the solubilized material. Starting at 30 min after the addition of the peptidase, a small but significant mass decrease of the intact MtrB was observed, but no smaller bands were detected during the course of the experiment. The limited degradation of MtrB at the C-terminal end is likely to be caused by the presence of several glycine residues in this region that are known to retard carboxypeptidase Y activity. To prove that degradation occurred in fact at the C-terminal end, Western blot analys"
https://openalex.org/W1983411754,"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1A catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the transport of long chain acyl-CoAs from cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix by converting them to acylcarnitines. Located within the outer mitochondrial membrane, CPT1A activity is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, its allosteric inhibitor. In this study, we investigate for the first time the quaternary structure of rat CPT1A. Chemical cross-linking studies using intact mitochondria isolated from fed rat liver or from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing CPT1A show that CPT1A self-assembles into an oligomeric complex. Size exclusion chromatography experiments using solubilized mitochondrial extracts suggest that the fundamental unit of its quaternary structure is a trimer. When studied in blue native-PAGE, the CPT1A hexamer could be observed, however, suggesting that under these native conditions CPT1A trimers might be arranged as dimers. Moreover, the oligomeric state of CPT1A was found unchanged by starvation and by streptozotocin-induced diabetes, conditions characterized by changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT1A. Finally, gel filtration analysis of several yeast-expressed chimeric CPTs demonstrates that the first 147 N-terminal residues of CPT1A, encompassing its two transmembrane segments, trigger trimerization independently of its catalytic C-terminal domain. Deletion of residues 1–82, including transmembrane 1, did not abrogate oligomerization, but the latter is limited to a trimer by the presence of the large catalytic C-terminal domain on the cytosolic face of mitochondria. Based on these findings, we proposed that the oligomeric structure of CPT1A would allow the newly formed acylcarnitines to gain direct access into the intermembrane space, hence facilitating substrate channeling. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1A catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the transport of long chain acyl-CoAs from cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix by converting them to acylcarnitines. Located within the outer mitochondrial membrane, CPT1A activity is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, its allosteric inhibitor. In this study, we investigate for the first time the quaternary structure of rat CPT1A. Chemical cross-linking studies using intact mitochondria isolated from fed rat liver or from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing CPT1A show that CPT1A self-assembles into an oligomeric complex. Size exclusion chromatography experiments using solubilized mitochondrial extracts suggest that the fundamental unit of its quaternary structure is a trimer. When studied in blue native-PAGE, the CPT1A hexamer could be observed, however, suggesting that under these native conditions CPT1A trimers might be arranged as dimers. Moreover, the oligomeric state of CPT1A was found unchanged by starvation and by streptozotocin-induced diabetes, conditions characterized by changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT1A. Finally, gel filtration analysis of several yeast-expressed chimeric CPTs demonstrates that the first 147 N-terminal residues of CPT1A, encompassing its two transmembrane segments, trigger trimerization independently of its catalytic C-terminal domain.

Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of long chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitines, which permits, in cooperation with the carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) and the CPT2, their transport from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix to undergo β-oxidation. CPT1 is an integral protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and exists under two main isoforms, the liver (CPT1A) and the muscle (CPT1B), whereas CPT2 is loosely associated with the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and only one ubiquitous isoform exists (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). A unique feature of CPT1 is its potent inhibition by malonyl-CoA (3McGarry J.D. Leatherman G.F. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the first committed intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis. This malonyl-CoA/CPT1 partnership is a key actor not only in physiological regulation of LCFA oxidation (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar) but also in many other processes such as fuel-sensing in hypothalamic neurons and the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis (4Wolfgang M.J.

Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extended N-terminal domain (about 150 residues) of CPT1A bears no significant similarity to CPT2 and contains two hydrophobic transmembrane (TM1 and TM2) segments (5Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its N terminus (residues 1–47) and its large catalytic C-terminal domain (residues 123–773) are exposed on the cytosolic face of mitochondria, whereas the loop connecting TM1 and TM2 protrudes into the intermembrane space (IMS) (6Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is essential for mitochondrial targeting, for import into the OMM, and for maintenance of a folded active and malonyl-CoA-sensitive conformation (7Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D.

Pioneer studies showed that inhibition by malonyl-CoA is produced by the occurrence of two binding sites. One site is the low affinity site corresponding to the catalytic acyl-CoA binding domain leading to a competition behavior between malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA, whereas the second high affinity site is distinct from the active site and does not compete with acyl-CoA (3McGarry J.D.

Functional studies indicated that both malonyl-CoA-binding sites of CPT1A are located within its catalytic C-terminal domain (11Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Rubi B. Clotet J. Arino J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and not within its cytosolic N terminus (12Pan Y. Cohen I. Guillerault F. Feve B. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47184-47189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the latter is essential for maintaining the high affinity malonyl-CoA-binding site (13Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the N terminus of CPT1A, which contains both positive and negative determinants of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (14Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), influences the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity through modulations of its interaction with the C-terminal domain (16Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, the existence of the two malonyl-CoA-binding sites, as well as the importance of these intramolecular N/C interactions for malonyl-CoA sensitivity, was recently supported by a three-dimensional in silico model of both the N- and C-terminal domains (17Lopez-Vinas E. Bentebibel A. Gurunathan C. Morillas M. de Arriaga D. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Gomez-Puertas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18212-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although key insights into the structure-function relationships of CPT1A have emerged during the past decade, the quaternary structure of CPT1A still remains totally unknown. Previously reported hysteretic behavior and intrinsic positive cooperativity of CPT1A for palmitoyl-CoA (3McGarry J.D. Leatherman G.F. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Cook G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18160-18167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested multisubunit cooperation. Moreover, the observation of positive cooperative inhibition of CPT1A by malonyl-CoA and that malonyl-CoA could introduce sigmoidicity into the relationship between palmitoyl-CoA and CPT1A activity (3McGarry J.D. Leatherman G.F. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Cook G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4968-4972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) strongly suggested allosteric behavior. Binding of malonyl-CoA could produce a conformational change that would either make the binding of a second malonyl-CoA much easier or make the binding of a second long chain acyl-CoA more difficult. Proteins exhibiting such cooperative effects are thought to be complexes of two or more subunits, raising the crucial question of whether CPT1A exists as a monomer or is assembled into an oligomeric complex once imported into the OMM. In this study we have used three complementary approaches, namely chemical cross-linking, chromatography by gel filtration, and blue native PAGE, to study for the first time the quaternary structure of rat CPT1A. We show evidence that both CPT1A expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and native protein from fed rat liver mitochondria self-assemble into an oligomeric complex and that the fundamental unit of their quaternary structure is a homotrimer. Moreover, the oligomeric state of CPT1A was unchanged by starvation and diabetes, conditions characterized by changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT1A. Finally, by using several fusions or partially deleted CPT constructs, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of CPT1A can trigger its oligomerization, but the latter is limited to a trimer likely by the presence of its large catalytic C-terminal domain on the cytosolic face of the mitochondria. The functional relevance of the existence of an oligomeric CPT1A complex within the OMM is discussed. Yeast Expression of Fusion and Deletion Proteins—The S. cerevisiae strains (haploid strain W303: MATa, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, ade2-1, can1-100) expressing either rat CPT1A, CPT1Δ1–82, pOM29-CPT2, or CPT1-(1–147)-CPT2 were obtained as described previously (7Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, pOM29-CPT2 corresponds to the fusion of the first N-terminal 29 amino acids of S. cerevisiae Tom70p, pOM29, which contains a specific OMM signal anchor sequence (23Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18403-18406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the mature form of CPT2. CPT1-(1–147)-CPT2 is the fusion of the first 147 N-terminal residues of CPT1A to the mature form of CPT2. CPT1Δ1–82 corresponds to CPT1A deleted of residues 1–82. For yeast expression of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion constructs, the corresponding cDNAs were retrieved from pGEM4 as an EcoRI-HindIII-blunted fragment (7Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYeDP1–8/10 cut by EcoRI and SmaI (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These DHFR fusion constructs were CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR and CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR, which respectively correspond to the fusion of amino acids 1–147 and 97–147 of CPT1A to DHFR. A C-terminally Myc/His-6 tagged construct had been previously generated for expression in Pichia pastoris as follows. The PCR primers 5′-GCAGGTGGAGCTCTTTGACTTT-3′ and 5′-TTTTGGGCCCCTTTTTAGAATTGATGGTGAG-3′ were used to amplify a region corresponding to the C terminus of CPT1A, with replacement of the stop codon with an ApaI restriction site. The product was cleaved with SacI-ApaI and used to replace the 3′ end of CPT1A previously subcloned into pGAPZ A (Invitrogen). To generate the construct for S. cerevisiae expression, the SacI-BamHI fragment (including the region encoding the tag) was subcloned into empty pYeDP1–8/10. The remainder of CPT1A was then added as an EcoRI-SacI fragment. Each cDNA was placed under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter present in the vector, and the constructs were used to transform S. cerevisiae. The fidelity of PCR and the quality of DNA subcloning were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Isolation of Yeast and Rat Liver Mitochondria—Methods for yeast culture and isolation of yeast mitochondria were performed as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from male Wistar rats (200–300 g) (Centre d'Elevage et de Reproduction Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) that had continuous free access to water and were either fed ad libitum on a standard laboratory chow diet (62% carbohydrate, 12% fat, and 26% protein in terms of energy) or starved for 48 h. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin as described previously (16Faye A. Borthwick K. Esnous C. Price N.T. Gobin S. Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All animals were kept on a light/dark cycle (light from 15:00 to 03:00 h) and were killed at 08:00 h. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated in an isolation buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) using differential centrifugation, further purified on self-forming Percoll gradients, and resuspended in the isolation buffer as described previously (7Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry with bovine serum albumin as a standard. CPT1 Activity—CPT1 activity was assayed using freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein/ml) at 30 °C as palmitoyl-l-[methyl-3H]carnitine formed from l-[methyl-3H]carnitine (200 μm; 10 Ci/mol) and palmitoyl-CoA (80 μm) in the presence of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA concentration was varied over 0.01–150 μm for estimation of the IC50 value (concentration of malonyl-CoA required to achieve 50% inhibition at 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA). Chemical Cross-linking—Mitochondria were washed twice either in HSY buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.6 m sorbitol, pH 8) (yeast mitochondria) or in HSR buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.3 m sucrose, pH 8) (rat liver mitochondria), and finally resuspended in the respective buffer at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. The polar cross-linkers, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-MBS, and sulfo-KMUS, used were dissolved in water. The apolar cross-linker, DSS, was dissolved in Me2SO. After addition of cross-linkers to a final concentration of either 50, 100, 200, 250, or 500 μm to mitochondria (80 μg), samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Excess of cross-linkers was then quenched by addition of 6 μlof TSY buffer (750 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6 m sorbitol, pH 8) (yeast mitochondria) or TSR buffer (750 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m sucrose, pH 8) (rat liver mitochondria). After incubation for 15 min at 4 °C, mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, at a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 177,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, integral membrane proteins were recovered in the pellet, analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 4–8% gradient gel, and immunoblotted. Detergent Solubilization of CPT1A—Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g and resuspended at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml either in the BN-PAGE buffer (750 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bistris/HCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7) containing either 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 or 1% (w/v) digitonin, or 1% (v/v) SDS, or in the gel filtration buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 30 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The lysis buffers were supplemented with 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin. After solubilization for 20 min on ice, mitochondrial extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 177,000 × g, and the supernatants were recovered. Gel Filtration Analysis—Supernatants from solubilized mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were loaded into either a Superose 6 or Superose 12 gel filtration column (25-ml column volume; Amersham Biosciences) and chromatographed in the gel filtration buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 8 or 12% gel, and immunoblotted. Calibration standards (Amersham Biosciences) used were as follows: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa) for the Superose 6 column, and catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) for the Superose 12 column. BN-PAGE—BN-PAGE was performed as described previously (24Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Briefly, following solubilization of mitochondria in the BN-PAGE buffer, supernatants (28.5 μl) were supplemented with 1.5 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Serva Blue G in 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid) prior to electrophoresis. Samples were then analyzed on a 4–13% gradient BN gel. The calibration standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa). Western Blot Analysis—Detection of proteins after blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using the ECL detection system (Pierce). The antibodies used were against the rat CPT1A (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the mouse DHFR (BD Biosciences), the His tag (Novagen), the yeast cytochrome b2 (gift from Prof. W. Neupert, Munich, Germany), and the rat Tom40 (gift from Prof. K. Mihara, Japan). For the generation of anti-CPT2 polyclonal antibody, peptide corresponding to the last 20 C-terminal residues of human CPT2 was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunized New Zealand White rabbits (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France). The immunoblots were quantified using a Chemigenius apparatus (Syngene). Chemicals—PCR reagents, restriction enzymes, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). Yeast culture media products were from Difco, and Zymolase 20T was from ICN Biomedicals, France. All cross-linkers were purchased from Pierce. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. CPT1A Exists as an Oligomeric Complex within the OMM—The first approach used to investigate the organization of rat CPT1A within the OMM was chemical cross-linking using intact mitochondria isolated from fed adult rat liver. After treatment with the noncleavable water-insoluble DSS (11.3 Å) cross-linker, CPT1A-containing cross-linking products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Whereas the monomeric form of CPT1A (88 kDa) decreased as the concentration of DSS increased, both a major band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass ranging between 250 and 400 kDa and a minor band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa were detected (Fig. 1A). Treatment with the noncleavable water-soluble sulfo-GMBS (6.8 Å), sulfo-MBS (9 Å), and sulfo-KMUS (15.7 Å) cross-linkers also led to the generation of these two specific CPT1A adducts. In addition, another band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼160 kDa was detected upon cross-linking with sulfo-GMBS and sulfo-MBS, which have a shorter spacer-arm length (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that within intact OMM of rat liver mitochondria, CPT1A interacts with protein(s) and may be assembled into complex(es). To determine whether the high molecular cross-linked product could result from oligomerization of CPT1A or not, cross-linking experiments were performed using mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae expressing rat CPT1A. Indeed, the yeast model is not only devoid of any of the mitochondrial CPTs but also of all the mitochondrial enzymes necessary for mitochondrial LCFA oxidation because this pathway takes place in peroxisomes. Therefore, the use of the yeast heterologous expression model specifically allowed us to study the oligomeric state of rat CPT1A when expressed in this model. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of mitochondria isolated from yeast cells expressing rat CPT1A with the sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-MBS, and sulfo-KMUS cross-linkers resulted in the generation of a high molecular mass band (∼200–360 kDa), whereas the ∼100-kDa band could never be detected. These observations suggested that, independently of the existence of a mitochondrial LCFA oxidation “metabolon” or of other protein-protein interactions, CPT1A could form an oligomeric complex within the OMM. Gel Filtration Chromatography Analysis of CPT1A Complex(es)—To demonstrate the existence of CPT1A complex(es), Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography experiments were performed after lysis of purified rat liver mitochondria with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 under a low detergent to protein ratio. Internal protein control was the IMM COX IV (17 kDa), which is 1 of the 13 subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase (180 kDa) that exists as a dimer of monomers (25Suarez M.D. Revzin A. Narlock R. Kempner E.S. Thompson D.A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13791-13799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions indicated that rat liver COX IV was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 2A) corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa (Fig. 2B). These observations validated that our experimental conditions did not dissociate this well known mitochondrial complex. The native rat CPT1A was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 2A), and the corresponding molecular mass of the detected complex was ∼275 kDa (Fig. 2B). We next addressed whether this complex may represent an oligomeric and/or multiproteic CPT1A complex by performing gel filtration experiments using solubilized mitochondrial extracts from yeast cells expressing rat CPT1A. Internal protein control for these experiments was the yeast cytochrome b2 (cyt b2) protein (52 kDa) that is assembled into a 250-kDa complex within the IMM (26Arlt H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As expected, Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions indicated that yeast cyt b2 was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 2A) corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼260 kDa (Fig. 2B). As observed for the native protein, the yeast-expressed CPT1A was also fractionated as an ∼275-kDa complex (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained when rat liver or yeast mitochondria were solubilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin (results not shown). Because CPT1A has a molecular mass of 88 kDa, the results obtained using the yeast-expressed CPT1A revealed that CPT1A forms a homotrimeric complex within the OMM. In the native environment, i.e. rat liver OMM, the size of the ∼275-kDa CPT1A species (Fig. 2A) indicated that this trimeric organization is also preserved following solubilization and gel filtration chromatography, whereas other protein-protein interactions, as suggested by our cross-linking experiments (Fig. 1A), were likely disrupted under this experimental procedure. Native Gel Electrophoresis Analysis of CPT1A Complex(es)—To further examine the complex state(s) of CPT1A, detergent-solubilized rat liver mitochondria were subjected to BN-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Whatever the detergent (Triton X-100 or digitonin) used, the major fraction of CPT1A migrated as an ∼550–620-kDa complex (Fig. 3A). In addition, bands with a much lower intensity were observed and estimated at ∼130–150 and ∼90 kDa, the latter most likely corresponding to the monomeric form of CPT1A. CPT1A complexes solubilized with Triton X-100 were observed to migrate faster in BN-PAGE than those solubilized with digitonin (Fig. 3A). Such a difference between the two detergents could be explained by variation in the lipid content of the various complexes as reported previously (27Dembowski M. Kunkele K.P. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17679-17685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon solubilization of rat liver mitochondria with the denaturing SDS detergent, only the ∼90-kDa signal could be detected but with a much higher intensity (Fig. 3A), indicating SDS-induced dissociation of CPT1A complexes. To validate our results, Tom40 (40 kDa) was used as an internal control because this membrane protein, which belongs to the OMM protein import machinery, is assembled into a ∼400-kDa complex (28Suzuki H.

As shown in Fig. 3A, Tom40 migrated at a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa indicating that our experimental conditions allowed solubilization of mitochondrial complexes without their disruption. We next addressed whether the ∼550–620-kDa species may represent an oligomeric"

Mice harboring a dominant-negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor-beta (TRbeta(PV/PV) mice) spontaneously develop follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human cancer. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of the steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) in thyroid carcinogenesis in vivo by using the offspring from the cross of TRbeta(PV/PV) and SRC-3(-/-) mice. TRbeta(PV/PV) mice deficient in SRC-3 (TRbeta(PV/PV)SRC-3(-/-) mice) had significantly increased survival, decreased thyroid tumor growth, delayed tumor progression and lower incidence of distant metastasis as compared with TRbeta(PV/PV) mice with SRC-3 (TRbeta(PV/PV)SRC-3(+/+) mice). Further, in vivo and in vitro analyses of multiple signaling pathways indicated that SRC-3 deficiency could lead to (1) inhibition of cell cycle progression at the G(1)/S transition via controlling the expression of cell cycle regulators, such as E2F1; (2) induction of apoptosis by controlling the expression of the Bcl-2 and caspase-3 genes and (3) suppression of neovascularization and metastasis, at least in part, through modulating the vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression. Taken together, SRC-3 could play important roles through regulating multiple target genes and signaling pathways during thyroid carcinogenesis, understanding of which should direct future therapeutic options for thyroid cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1972889605,"The Drosophila Dysfusion basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) protein controls the transcription of genes that mediate tracheal fusion. Dysfusion is highly related to the mammalian Nxf protein that has been implicated in nervous system gene regulation. Toward the goal of understanding how Dysfusion controls fusion cell gene expression, the biochemical properties of Dysfusion were investigated using protein interaction experiments, cell culture-based transcription assays, and in vivo transgenic analyses. Dysfusion dimerizes with the Tango bHLH-PAS protein, and together they act as a DNA binding transcriptional activator. Dysfusion/Tango binds multiple NCGTG binding sites, with the following preference: TCGTG > GCGTG > ACGTG > CCGTG. This binding site promiscuity differs from the restricted binding site preferences of other bHLH-PAS/Tango heterodimers. However, it is identical to the binding site preferences of mammalian Nxf/Arnt, indicating that the specificity is evolutionarily conserved. Germ line transformation experiments using a fragment of the CG13196 Dysfusion target gene allowed identification of a fusion cell enhancer. Experiments in which NCGTG sites were mutated individually and in combination revealed that TCGTG sites were required for fusion cell expression but that the single ACGTG and GCGTG sites present were not. Finally, a reporter transgene containing four tandemly arranged TCGTG elements has strong expression in tracheal fusion cells. Transgenic misexpression of dysfusion further revealed that Dysfusion has the ability to activate transcription in multiple cell types, although it does this most effectively in tracheal cells and can only function at mid-embryogenesis and later.

Members within a related group of transcription factors often control expression of different gene sets despite their protein sequence conservation. This differential gene regulation can arise from a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms include 1) different transcription factor DNA binding specificities, 2) interactions with different co-regulatory proteins, and 3) expression in different cell types that may vary in their chromatin states. The basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) 2The abbreviations used are: bHLH-PASbasic-helix-loop-helix-PASActactin5CArntaromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocatorbtlbreathlessdysdysfusionenengrailedGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininHif-1αhypoxia-inducible factor-1αlacZβ-galactosidaselucluciferasembomembers onlyscascabrousshgshotgunsimsingle-mindedsimasimilar, ss, spinelesstgotangotrhtrachealesstwitwistvvlventral veinlesskbkilobaseAhraryl hydrocarbon receptor. proteins comprise a group of highly conserved transcription factors that control a variety of developmental and physiological events (1Crews S.T. PAS Proteins: Regulators and Sensors of Development and Physiology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2003Crossref Google Scholar). The defining structural feature of this class of bHLH proteins is the presence of the PAS domain, a multifunctional interaction domain. In Drosophila there are 11 bHLH-PAS family members, and they control disparate processes, including neurogenesis, tracheal formation, tracheal fusion, dendrite morphology, retinal cell fate, circadian rhythms, hormone responsiveness, appendage identity, and the response to hypoxia. Most of these proteins have mammalian and nematode orthologs. One of the issues regarding bHLH-PAS protein function is how these related proteins regulate the different sets of genes that execute these biological phenomena. basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS actin5C aromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocator breathless dysfusion engrailed green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin hypoxia-inducible factor-1α β-galactosidase luciferase members only scabrous shotgun single-minded similar, ss, spineless tango trachealess twist ventral veinless kilobase aryl hydrocarbon receptor. One mechanism of differential bHLH-PAS protein gene control involves protein binding to different co-regulatory proteins. The Drosophila Single-minded (Sim) and Trachealess (Trh) bHLH-PAS proteins both dimerize with the Tango (Tgo) bHLH-PAS protein, and bind the same ACGTG sequence (2Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ohshiro T. Saigo K. Development. 1997; 124: 3975-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Trh directly interacts with the Ventral veinless (Vvl) POU-homeobox protein and activates expression of tracheal target genes that contain both Trh and Vvl binding sites (4Zelzer E. Shilo B. Mech. Dev. 2000; 19: 163-173Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sim is unable to directly bind Vvl and, thus, unable to activate tracheal gene expression. In other cases, transcriptional specificity arises from differences in the basic region protein sequences that results in recognition of different DNA sequences. For example, the Drosophila Spineless (Ss) protein also pairs with Tgo but preferentially binds a GCGTG sequence unlike the Sim/Tgo and Trh/Tgo heterodimers that prefer ACGTG (5Emmons R.B. Duncan D. Estes P.A. Kiefel P. Mosher J.T. Sonnenfeld M. Ward M.P. Duncan I. Crews S.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, similar to other transcription factor families, bHLH-PAS proteins use multiple methods to differentially regulate gene transcription in vivo. The last Drosophila bHLH-PAS protein to be discovered was the dysfusion (dys) gene (6Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This gene has a mammalian ortholog (Nxf) (7Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and a nematode ortholog (C15C8.2) (8Powell-Coffman J.A. PAS Proteins: Regulators and Sensors of Development and Physiology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2003: 51-68Google Scholar). The Dys DNA binding basic region sequence is highly conserved but not identical among the different animal species (Table 1). It is markedly divergent compared with the basic regions of other bHLH-PAS proteins. DNA binding and transient transfection studies on human Nxf revealed that Nxf dimerized with the aromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein, the mammalian Tgo ortholog, and bound ACGTG, GCGTG, and TCGTG sequences (7Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Moser M. Knoth R. Bode C. Patterson C. Brain Res. Mol.

Brain Res. 2007; 1135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Which of these sequences is utilized in vivo to control gene expression by Nxf is unknown. The Drosophila dys gene is prominently expressed in tracheal fusion cells. These cells reside at the tip of the growing tracheal tubules and mediate the fusion of adjacent tracheal branches. Elimination of dys function by mutation and RNA interference resulted in an absence of tracheal fusion (6Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and four genes were identified whose fusion cell transcription was abolished or reduced in dys mutants (11Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6547-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and are potential candidates to be directly regulated by Dys. The identification of these target genes allows biochemical and molecular experiments that can test the mechanistic role of dys in controlling fusion cell transcription.TABLE 1Basic region alignment of selected bHLH-PAS proteins Basic region sequences are shown along with binding site specificity for each protein. · indicates amino acid identity, and basic region numbering is at the top.

We showed that Dys dimerizes with Tgo, resulting in nuclear translocation of the Dys/Tgo complex. The Dys/Tgo dimer then acts to activate transcription. The Dys basic region differs from mammalian Nxf at 3 amino acid sites. Yet transient transfection experiments revealed that Dys/Tgo, like Nxf/Arnt, binds to multiple NCGTG sequences with a specificity conserved between mammalian and Drosophila proteins. This is in contrast to the results of identical experiments with Sim/Tgo and Trh/Tgo which demonstrated that they are restricted to a single ACGTG binding site specificity. Drosophila transgenic approaches were employed to test how Dys/Tgo controls transcription in vivo. Reporter gene transformants containing a 1.0-kb fragment of the fusion cell-expressed CG13196 Dys target gene drives fusion cell expression. Mutation of ACGTG, GCGTG, and TCGTG sites in the CG13196 fragment along with analysis of a transgene containing TCGTG multimers revealed that TCGTG is required for expression in vivo. This indicated that Dys/Tgo uses a novel bHLH-PAS protein DNA binding specificity in vivo to control fusion cell gene expression. Further dys misexpression experiments revealed that Dys/Tgo has the ability to ectopically activate CG13196 transcription in multiple cell types but is temporally blocked from acting until mid-embryogenesis. S2 Cell Transient Expression Plasmids and Assays—The dys expression plasmid, pAct-dys, was generated by cloning an EcoRV fragment of a full-length dys cDNA (6Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) into the EcoRV site of the pAct5CSRS (12Han K. Levine M.S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 56: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This pAct-dys plasmid contains the entire dys coding sequence behind an actin5C (Act) promoter. The pAct-dys-Δb plasmid has a deletion of the entire Dys basic region (NKSTKGASKMRR), which is expected to abolish DNA binding. It served as a negative control. The dys-Δb fragment was cloned into the SacI site of pAct5CSRS. The construction of pAct-sim, pAct-tgo, and pAct-trh were previously described (2Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids contained four tandemly linked copies of an identical 24 bp Toll CME-4 sequence (13Wharton J.K.A. Franks R.G. Kasai Y. Crews S.T. Development. 1994; 120: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a different, potential Dys/Tgo NCGTG binding site (underlined): CTAGAAATTTGTACGTGCCACAGA, CTAGAAATTTGTCCGTGCCACAGA, CTAGAAATTTGTGCGTGCCACAGA, and CTAGAAATTTGTTCGTGCCACAGA. Each fragment was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen), cut with KpnI and SacI, and then cloned into the KpnI and SacI sites of the pGL-3 enhancer tester vector (Promega). pGL3 utilizes a firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene. The full-length Nxf cDNA coding sequence was generated by PCR from pEGFP-LE-PAS (9Moser M. Knoth R. Bode C. Patterson C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 128: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-GGTACCATGTACCGATCCACCAAGGGCG-3′ and 5′-GGTACCTCAAAACGTTGGTTCCCCTCCA-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), digested with KpnI, and cloned into the KpnI site of pAct5CSRS, generating pAct-Nxf. The full-length human Arnt coding sequence was contained on a BamHI fragment derived from pBM5/Neo/M1-1 (14Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pAct5CSRS, generating pAct-Arnt. The pAc5.1/V5-His/lacZ transfection control plasmid (Invitrogen) consists of the actin5C promoter driving β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene expression. The LE-PAS and Arnt clones were generously provided by Cam Patterson. Transient transfection in Drosophila S2 cells was carried out using an Effectene transfection reagent protocol (Qiagen). Each transfection was performed 6 times using 1 μg of total DNA. The total DNA included 0.3 μg for each reporter and expression plasmid, 0.1 μg of pAc5.1/V5-His/lacZ internal control plasmid, and additional pAct5CSRS DNA to achieve a final DNA concentration of 1 μg. After 48 h of growth, luc expression was assayed using a luc assay kit (Promega) and a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (Amersham Biosciences). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with a β-galactosidase assay kit (Promega) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Protein-Protein Interaction (HA Pulldown) Assays—The dys cDNA coding sequence was cloned into pAHW (T. Murphy, Carnegie Institution) in which an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to dys. The dys cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CACCATGCCAAATGCTATTGGAGCTAG-3′ and 5′-CACACTTAATACTAACCTCTATCCTC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pENTR using the pENTR TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Then the dys cDNA was recombined into pAHW using the Gateway LR Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen). S2 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pAct-tgo and 0.5 μg pAct-HA-dys individually or in combination using Effectene. pAct5CSRS DNA was added to achieve a final DNA concentration of 1 μg when necessary. After 48 h of growth, whole-cell extracts were prepared by sonication of cells in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were incubated with 30 μl of anti-HA-conjugated-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The extracts and HA-associated proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blot analysis using mAb-Tgo antibody (2Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar). CG13196 Transgenic Strains—The sequence from -985 to -1 in the 5′-flanking sequence of CG13196 was PCR-amplified using the primer pair GGTACCCTATAAGTATGGCAAGAGGTGGC (KpnI site is underlined) and AGATCTGATTGGGCCGCAAGTGATA (BglII site is underlined). This 1.0-kb fragment was cloned into the KpnI and BglII sites of pH-Stinger (15Barolo S. Carver L.A. Posakony J.W. Biotechniques. 2000; 29: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which is a nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP) P-element reporter. The CG13196 1.0-kb fragment has 3 TCGTG, 1 ACGTG, and 1 GCGTG potential Dys-Tgo binding sites. These sites were mutated individually and in combination using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each ACGTG, GCGTG, and TCGTG site was mutated to GATCC. Five CG13196 1.0-kb plasmids were generated: unmutated, all 5 (A/G/T)CGTG sites mutated, all TCGTG sites mutated, single ACGTG site mutated, and single GCGTG site mutated. Each transgene was introduced into the Drosophila germ line using standard P-element transformation techniques. Three independent lines of each transgene were analyzed for embryonic expression. Multimerized TCGTG Transgenic Strain—The 4× 24-bp Toll CME-4 sequence that contains TCGTG, described above under “S2 Cell Transient Expression Plasmids and Assays” was used to generate a 4X-TCGTG-GFP transgenic reporter train. The 4X-TCGTG fragment was excised from the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid by cutting with KpnI and BglII and then cloned into the KpnI and BglII sites of pH-Stinger to yield P[4X-TCGTG-GFP]. After introduction into the Drosophila genome, two independent lines were analyzed for embryonic and larval reporter gene expression. Transgenic Misexpression Strains—The UAS-dys and UAS-dys-Δb transgenic lines were previously described (11Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6547-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The dys mutant embryos analyzed were a trans-heterozygous combination of the dys2 and dys3 null mutants (11Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6547-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Gal4 drivers included breathless (btl)-Gal4 (most tracheal cells), engrailed (en)-Gal4 (ectodermal stripes), scabrous (sca)-Gal4 (nervous system), and twist (twi)-Gal4 (mesoderm) (6Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Ward M.P. Mosher J.T. Crews S.T.

Embryonic Immunostaining and in Situ Hybridization—Whole-mount embryos were immunostained and subjected to in situ hybridization using standard techniques (18Patel N.H. Snow P.M. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1987; 48: 975-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used for immunostaining: rat anti-Dys (1:200), anti-Tgo monoclonal antibody (1:1), and rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; AbCam). The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexafluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen), Alexafluor 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Invitrogen), and Cy3-labeled anti-rat IgG (1:200; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The CG13196 cDNA plasmid, RE44287 (Open Biosystems), was used to generate an RNA probe for in situ hybridization. Embryos were examined using a Zeiss Pascal confocal microscope. Dys Forms a Heterodimer with Tgo in Vivo—Tgo forms heterodimers in vivo with multiple bHLH-PAS proteins, including Sim, Similar (Sima), Ss, and Trh (2Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar, 5Emmons R.B. Duncan D. Estes P.A. Kiefel P. Mosher J.T. Sonnenfeld M. Ward M.P. Duncan I. Crews S.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of a bHLH-PAS partner protein, Tgo resides at low levels in the cytoplasm. In the presence of a partner protein, the Tgo-containing heterodimer translocates and accumulates in the nucleus (16Ward M.P. Mosher J.T. Crews S.T. Development. 1998; 125: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear appearance of Tgo generally indicates the occurrence of a partner bHLH-PAS protein (note, there may be exceptions to this rule; Refs. 19Kim M.D. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2806-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and 20Crews S.T. Brenman J.E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It also seemed likely that Dys functions as a DNA binding heterodimer with Tgo. First, nuclear Tgo is present at sites of dys expression (6Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is particularly evident in the embryonic leading edge cells, in which no other bHLH-PAS protein besides Dys is known to be present. Second, the Nxf protein, which is the mammalian Dys ortholog, dimerizes with Arnt and Arnt2, the mammalian Tgo orthologs (7Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Hester I. McKee S. Pelletier P. Thompson C. Storbeck C. Mears A. Schulz J.B. Hakim A.A. Sabourin L.A. Brain Res. 2007; 1135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether Drosophila Dys/Tgo heterodimerization occurs, biochemical protein binding assays, in vivo genetic and misexpression experiments, and cell culture-based molecular assays were performed. Both tgo and HA-tagged dys were cotransfected into Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells, and HA-tagged Dys protein complexes were purified with anti-HA-agarose beads. Western blot analysis of the protein complex with anti-Tgo revealed that Tgo was bound to HA-Dys (Fig. 1A), indicating a direct, biochemical association between Dys and Tgo. Immunostaining of wild-type embryos with anti-Dys and anti-Tgo showed strong nuclear colocalization of both proteins in the leading edge cells (Fig. 2, A-C). Immunostaining of dys mutant embryos using dys alleles predicted to generate truncated proteins terminating in the HLH regions revealed the absence of nuclear Tgo in the leading edge cells (Fig. 2, D and F), indicating that Tgo nuclear localization requires the presence of (and presumably direct interaction with) Dys. The dys gene is also prominently expressed in tracheal fusion cells, and both nuclear Dys and Tgo appear in fusion cells (Fig. 2, G-I). However, because Trh, another partner of Tgo, is also expressed in tracheal cells, including fusion cells, the appearance of nuclear Tgo cannot be unambiguously ascribed to the appearance of Dys. However, careful examination of Tgo levels in wild-type tracheal nuclei indicated that it is at higher levels in fusion cells than other tracheal cells (Fig. 2, G-I). In dys mutant embryos the levels of nuclear Tgo in fusion cells are reduced to the same levels as the surrounding tracheal cells (Fig. 2, J-L). This reduction occurs even though Trh levels are increased in fusion cells of dys mutants (6Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5625-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Jiang L. Crews S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6547-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results indicated that some of the nuclear Tgo in fusion cells is due to heterodimerization with Dys and subsequent nuclear import of the complex. It also indicated that there is a pool of cytoplasmic Tgo that normally turns over rapidly but is stabilized upon interaction with partner bHLH-PAS proteins. This pool can expand when increasing amounts of Dys are present in fusion cells. Misexpression of bHLH-PAS proteins was previously employed in assays to demonstrate that these proteins dimerize with Tgo in vivo (5Emmons R.B. Duncan D. Estes P.A. Kiefel P. Mosher J.T. Sonnenfeld M. Ward M.P. Duncan I. Crews S.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ward M.P. Mosher J.T. Crews S.T. Development. 1998; 125: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The UAS-dys transgene was ectopically expressed in ectodermal stripes with en-Gal4. Immunostaining with anti-Dys and anti-Tgo revealed that both proteins were localized to nuclei in en stripes (Fig. 2, M-O). This reinforces the notion that the appearance of Dys protein results in dimerization with Tgo and subsequent translocation into nuclei. Similar results were obtained with misexpression of UAS-Δb-dys (Fig. 2, P-R), indicating that DNA binding of Dys/Tgo is not required for stable localization in nuclei. This result is similar to that observed for Sim/Tgo (21Estes P. Mosher J. Crews S.T. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In summary, the biochemical experiments showed that Dys and Tgo dimerize. The genetic and misexpression results confirmed that this association also occurs in the embryo and further indicated that Dys/Tgo translocates into nuclei, where the dimer likely acts to bind DNA. Dys/Tgo Activates Transcription and Binds Multiple NCGTG Binding Sites—Generally, bHLH-PAS dimers containing Tgo/Arnt bind an asymmetric E-box with the sequence NCGTG (1Crews S.T. PAS Proteins: Regulators and Sensors of Development and Physiology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2003Crossref Google Scholar). The basic regions primarily contribute to DNA binding, although additional sites on the protein may contribute. Transient transfection assays using Drosophila cell culture have been successful in determining the binding site specificity of Drosophila bHLH-PAS proteins (2Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, this approach was employed to study the specificity of Dys/Tgo. Tgo binds the half-site GTG (2Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ohshiro T. Saigo K. Development. 1997; 124: 3975-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dys has an Arg residue at basic region position 12 (Table 1), and according to the “B-1” rule for bHLH proteins (13Wharton J.K.A. Franks R.G. Kasai Y. Crews S.T. Development. 1994; 120: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it will bind an NC half-site. Consequently, Dys/Tgo should bind an NCGTG sequence. This is consistent with known Nxf/Arnt/Arnt2 binding sites of ACGTG, CGGTG, GCGTG, and TCGTG (7Ooe N. Saito K. Mikami N. Nakatuka I. Kaneko H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Moser M. Knoth R. Bode C. Patterson C. Brain Res. Mol.

Brain Res. 2007; 1135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Dys basic region (NKSTKGASKMRR) has three amino acid substitutions compared with human Nxf (YRSTKGASKARR; differences are underlined), which could cause changes in DNA binding specificities between the two proteins. Thus, we tested Dys/Tgo in an S2 cell transient transfection assay to test the binding specificity of Dys/Tgo as well as to determine whether Dys/Tgo was a transcriptional activator. Reporter genes were constructed that were identical except that each had four copies of either ACGTG, CCGTG, GCGTG, or TCGTG. These constructs were cotransfected with plasmids that expressed either tgo, dys, or dys-Δb in various combinations. The dys-Δb plasmid lacks the Dys basic region and presumably is unable to bind DNA. The transfection experiments that lacked either tgo or dys or combined tgo with dys-Δb acted as negative controls. The results (Fig. 1B) showed that Dys/Tgo acts as a transcriptional activator. Strongest activation was with TCGTG (17× control) followed by GCGTG (10×). In addition ACGTG showed significant activation (7×), whereas CGGTG was significantly lower (3×). Consistent with the need for both tgo and dys, all reporters showed low levels of activation when either Tgo or Dys was absent or when Dys-Δb/Tgo heterodimers were analyzed, indicating that activation requires both Dys and Tgo proteins and is due to direct DNA binding. Binding Site Promiscuity is Unique to Dys/Tgo—Dys/Tgo binds all four NCGTG sequences, ACGTG, CGGTG, GCGTG, and TCGTG, relatively well. Other studies have shown that Sim/Tgo preferentially binds ACGTG better than GCGTG, and Ss/Tgo preferentially binds GCGTG better than ACGTG (21Estes P. Mosher J. Crews S.T. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, previous studies with Drosophila bHLH-PAS proteins did not systematically assay all four NCGTG reporters as was done here with Dys/Tgo. Thus, it is possible that other Drosophila bHLH-PAS heterodimers, besides Dys/Tgo, may also bind sequences other than their preferred sequence. To test this we utilized the same reporters assayed with Dys/Tgo in assays containing sim, tgo, and trh expression plasmids in the S2 cell transient transfection assay. The results (Fig. 1, C and D) showed that Sim/Tgo and Trh/Tgo differed from Dys/Tgo in that they were specific for ACGTG binding sites and did not significantly activate CGTGT, GCGTG, or TCGTG sites. Thus, these assays indicated that Dys/Tgo has a broader specificity than"

Here we identify and define the novel binding interaction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase atrophin-interacting protein 4 (AIP4) with the GTP exchange factor β-p21-activated kinase-interactive exchange factor (βPIX). We demonstrate that this interaction is mediated in part by the βPIX-SH3 domain binding to a proline-rich stretch of AIP4. Analysis of the interaction by isothermal calorimetry is consistent with a heterotrimeric complex with one AIP4-derived peptide binding to two βPIX-SH3 domains. We determined the crystal structure of the βPIX-SH3·AIP4 complex to 2.0-Å resolution. In contrast to the calorimetry results, the crystal structure shows a monomeric complex in which AIP4 peptide binds the βPIX-SH3 domain as a canonical Class I ligand with an additional type II polyproline helix that makes extensive contacts with another face of βPIX. Taken together, the novel interaction between AIP4 and βPIX represents a new regulatory node for G protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase signal integration.

AIP4 is abundantly expressed in most human tissues and displays tissue specificity similar to that of Cbl (19Courbard J.R. Fiore F. Adelaide J. Borg J.P. Birnbaum D. Ollendorff V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45267-45275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). β-PAK-interactive exchange factor (βPIX also referred to as Cool-1) is composed of modular domains, including an N-terminal SH3 domain followed by DH (Dbl, diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology) domain, PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, and a leucine zipper (20Manser E.

Functionally, βPIX acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac/Cdc42 and was first identified as an exchange factor for PAK (20Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I.

Like other SH3 domains, βPIX-SH3 binds to proline-rich sequences with a polyproline II helix (PPII) conformation. Although most SH3 domain ligands contain a PXXP motif, βPIX-SH3 binds ligands with a non-canonical PXXXPR sequence and serves as a scaffolding point for a number of protein-protein interactions as demonstrated by the direct coupling of βPIX to p21-activated kinase (PAK) family members (20Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The βPIX-SH3 domain also binds to the PXXXPR motif of Cbl family members to facilitate the clustering of proteins involved in the down-regulation of EGF receptor signaling (26Schmidt M.H. Husnjak K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K. Dikic I. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the βPIX-SH3 domain also binds proteins, including Rac1 and SAP (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein) (29Ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Gu C. Tangye S.G. Sun X. Luo Y. Lin Z. Wu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structural basis for these interactions and the functional ramifications of competition among multiple ligands for overlapping binding sites on βPIX remain to be elucidated. Here we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 as a binding partner for the βPIX scaffolding protein. We demonstrate an endogenous βPIX·AIP4 complex in breast cancer cell lines and show that complex formation is mediated in part by βPIX-SH3 domain binding to a proline-rich stretch of AIP4. We show using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) that the interaction is heterotrimeric in solution, with one AIP4-derived peptide binding to two βPIX-SH3 domains. Fluorescence assays suggest that the mode of interaction for the βPIX-SH3·AIP4 complex is unique compared with known βPIX-SH3 interactions. We determined the crystal structure of the βPIX-SH3·AIP4 complex to 2.0-Å resolution. AIP4 binds the βPIX-SH3 domain as a canonical Class I ligand with an additional PPII helix that makes extensive contacts with another face of βPIX. Our structure of the βPIX-SH3·AIP4 complex provides important insight into the mechanistic basis for βPIX scaffolding of signal components. The novel interaction between βPIX and AIP4 represents a new regulatory node for GPCR and RTK signal integration. Reagents and Antibodies—Except where noted, all buffers and chemicals were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma. Monoclonal anti-Myc and monoclonal anti-AIP4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-βPIX antibody was from Chemicon International. Polyclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Covance. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-Itch antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. SDF1α was purchased from R&D Systems, and EGF was purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfection—HEK293T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and NIH 3T3 cells were all cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The pcDNA3-FLAG-CIN85 mammalian expression construct was a kind gift from Dr. Sachiko Kajigaya (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The pEBB-βPIX-HA mammalian expression construct was a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Mayer (University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT). The pRK5-Myc-AIP4 mammalian expression construct was a kind gift from Dr. Tony Pawson (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The pGEX-6P1-βPIX-SH3 domain expression construct was a kind gift from Dr. André Hoelz (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). All truncation and mutant constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene). All transfection studies were performed using DNA-Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and cells were assayed or harvested ∼48 h after transfection. Harvested cells were either used immediately or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C. Immunoblotting, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Pulldown Assays—Harvested cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v)), plus protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were subsequently cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with the appropriate antibody at 4 °C for 1 h to overnight followed by incubation with protein A- or G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three to five times with cold lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the appropriate antibody of interest. To probe for endogenous AIP4 levels a monoclonal antibody to mouse Itch was used. This antibody readily detects AIP4, because Itch and AIP4 are highly homologous. In overexpression studies, all AIP4 constructs encode an N-terminal Myc tag, βPIX constructs encode a C-terminal HA tag, and CIN85 constructs encode an N-terminal FLAG tag to aid in immunoblot detection. For GST pulldown assays, lysates of transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing either GST-βPIX-SH3 or GST alone were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Amersham Biosciences) in a Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3) for 1 h at 4 °C.The beads were subsequently washed in the same buffer and incubated with HEK 293T cellular lysate expressing either Myc-tagged AIP4 or an empty vector. The complexes were pulled down, washed extensively, and resolved via SDS-PAGE. Proteins were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose and probed for AIP4 binding using an anti-Myc antibody. Protein Expression and Purification—The SH3 domain βPIX was expressed and purified essentially as described previously (31Hoelz A. Janz J.M. Lawrie S.D. Corwin B. Lee A. Sakmar T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Preparation—All peptides were synthesized by the Proteomics Resource Center at the Rockefeller University (New York, NY), purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and verified by mass spectrometry. Peptides that correspond to regions of AIP4 were as follows: AIP4206-229, Y206GFKPSRPPRPSRPPPPTPRRPASV229; AIP4211-226, 211RPPRPSRPPPPTPRRP226; AIP4201-216, 201SLSNGGFKPSRPPRPS216; AIP4216-232, 216SRPPPPTPRRPAS-VNGS232; AIP4216-226, 216SRPPPPTPRRP226; and AIP4-R217A, 205YGFKPSRPPRPSAPPPPTPRRPASV229. The following peptide corresponds to the βPIX-SH3 binding domain of human PAK2 (PAK2176-199,176EETAPPVIAPRPDHTKSIYTRSVI199) and that of human Cbl-b (Cbl-b899-914, 899SQAPARPPKPRPRRTA914Y). Note that a tyrosine residue was added on to the N terminus of peptides AIP4206-229 and AIP4-R217A or the C terminus of Cbl-b899-914 to aid in concentration determination. All protein and peptide concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy and/or amino acid analysis. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were performed essentially as described previously (31Hoelz A. Janz J.M. Lawrie S.D. Corwin B. Lee A. Sakmar T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, at 20 °C in a 4-× 4-mm quartz cuvette. Intrinsic Trp fluorescence was measured by exciting samples at 295 nm (1 nm bandpass) and monitoring emission from 315 to 450 nm (10-15 nm bandpass). The EC50 values were determined by titrating βPIX-SH3 domain samples with increasing amounts of WT AIP4206-229 peptide and monitoring both the shift in Trp emission wavelength and overall fluorescence intensity. Competition experiments were performed in a similar manner using the PAK2176-199 and Cbl-b899-914 peptides. The PAK2176-199 peptide sequence contains a tyrosine residue, and it is possible that some energy transfer to this residue from the Trps in the SH3 domain takes place upon binding, thereby reducing the fluorescence emission intensity. However, a PAK2 peptide in which this Tyr residue is converted to a Phe did not significantly increase the fluorescence emission intensity (data not shown). Data were analyzed in Sigma-Plot using nonlinear regression and fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation four-parameter logistic equation: Y = minimum + (maximum - minimum)/1 + 10(log EC50 - x)*Hill slope. ITC—All ITC measurements were performed at 20 °C using a MicroCal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC calorimeter essentially as described previously (31Hoelz A. Janz J.M. Lawrie S.D. Corwin B. Lee A. Sakmar T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Typically, the sample cell contained 50 μm solution of the βPIX-SH3 domain and was titrated at equal intervals with 10-μl aliquots of 500 μm AIP4 peptide solution for a total of ∼290 μl. The heat generated due to dilution of the titrants (peptide) was subtracted for baseline correction. Baseline corrected data were analyzed with MicroCal ORIGIN version 6.0 software. All experiments were performed at least twice. Crystallography, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—The SH3 domain (3 mm in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) was mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio with AIP4206-229 peptide dissolved in the same buffer and crystallized at 20 °C by the vapor diffusion method. Drops containing 1 μl of the complex were mixed with 1 μl of the well solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.1-7.9, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 32-38% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-MME 5000). The crystals were allowed to grow at 20 °C and appeared as long rectangular rods, with typical dimensions of 40 μm × 30 μm × 600 μm. The crystals were snap-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen in the mother liquor supplemented by 10% glycerol. Data were collected using a Raxis IV (Rigaku) with 1° oscillations. Data were integrated and scaled using the program HKL2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The phases were determined by molecular replacement, using the model from 2AK5 from the Protein Data Bank and the program Phaser (33McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar).

The Proline-rich Region of AIP4 Binds to the SH3 Domain of βPIX—AIP4 regulates the stability and degradation of p73 and p63 oncogenic transcription factors, and both AIP4 and βPIX have been shown independently to be involved in breast cancer metastasis (15Rossi M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2965-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). With this in mind we first assayed for the endogenous association of βPIX and AIP4 in two breast cancer cell lines as well as a fibroblast line also known to express both proteins (11Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that endogenous βPIX forms a stable complex with endogenous AIP4 in MDA-MB-231 and NIH3T3 cell lines (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we could not detect an endogenous interaction between these proteins in the MCF7 line (Fig. 1A). To test whether AIP4 and βPIX interact directly to form a complex, we conducted a series of pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments using affinity-tagged constructs. We hypothesized that AIP4 interacts directly with βPIX through binding of the proline-rich region of AIP4 to the SH3 domain of βPIX. First we found that βPIX-SH3 alone was sufficient to pull down AIP4 in a GST pulldown assay with HEK293T lysate-expressing Myc-tagged AIP4 (Fig. 1B). We further confirmed the importance of the proline-rich region of AIP4 using co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells. HA-tagged βPIX was co-expressed with full-length or truncated forms of Myc-tagged AIP4; immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Myc antibody, and immunoblots were performed to test for the association of βPIX. We found that deletion of the proline-rich region of AIP4 abolished the interaction with βPIX in this assay (Fig. 1C). AIP4 Binds to the CIN85 Scaffolding Protein—The βPIX-SH3 domain is phylogenetically similar to the three SH3 domains of CIN85, an adaptor protein involved in Cbl-mediated down-regulation of RTKs (9Soubeyran P.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Like βPIX, the SH3 domains of CIN85 recognize and bind the non-canonical PXXXPR motifs in Cbl and PAK proteins (26Schmidt M.H. Husnjak K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K. Dikic I. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

When both FLAG-tagged CIN85 and Myc-tagged AIP4 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells we found that CIN85 pulled down AIP4, albeit to a lesser extent than βPIX (Fig. 1D). Notably, this interaction dissipated as cells co-expressed increasing amounts of βPIX (Fig. 1D). AIP4 Forms a Heterotrimeric Complex with βPIX-SH3 Domains in Solution—Guided by our cellular binding assays we designed a series of peptides corresponding to the proline-rich region of AIP4 shown to bind the βPIX-SH3 domain. We synthesized two WT peptides AIP4206-229 and AIP4211-226 that contain the proline-rich stretch, but vary in the number of residues flanking these regions, and three peptides AIP4201-216, AIP4216-232, and AIP4216-226 that contain only the N- or C-terminal PXXXPR motif (Fig. 2B). Our ITC studies reveal that both peptides AIP4206-229 and AIP4211-226 bind to the SH3 domain of βPIX with high affinity, 7.38 ± 0.9 μm and 10.1 ± 0.6 μm, respectively (Fig. 2C). The C-terminal portion of the sequence is required in the binding interaction, because peptide AIP4216-232 bound to the SH3 domain with a Kd of 72.2 ± 5.0 μm, whereas peptide AIP4201-216 did not show any detectable binding (Fig. 2C). The significant decrease in affinity observed between peptide AIP4216-232 relative to AIP4206-229 and AIP4211-226 further indicates that residues adjacent to the C-terminal proline-rich region are necessary to impart high affinity binding. Importantly, a binding stoichiometry for AIP4 peptide to βPIX-SH3 domain of 1:2 was consistently observed for all of these peptides (Table 1). This suggests that binding the proline-rich region of AIP4 by βPIX may induce the formation of heterotrimeric complexes in solution, similar to what has been previously reported for CIN85-SH3·Cbl-b and βPIX-SH3·Cbl-b (28Jozic D.

Open table in a new tab Alternate Mode of Binding for the AIP4·βPIX-SH3 Complex in Solution—We next investigated the role that residue Arg-217 of AIP4 plays in formation of βPIX-SH3·AIP4 heterotrimeric complexes. The analogous Arg in Cbl-b (Arg-904) is necessary for the formation of heterotrimeric complexes of βPIX-SH3·Cbl-b (28Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I.

We find that the R217A mutant of AIP4 associated with βPIX when each were co-expressed in HEK 293T cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). As expected, our ITC tests on an AIP4-R217A peptide indicated that this mutation reduced the affinity of the βPIX-SH3·AIP4 interaction with an apparent Kd of 43.4 ± 3.5 μm (Fig. 2C). To our surprise, this mutation did not alter the binding stoichiometry for the βPIX-SH3·AIP4 complex, n = 0.452 ± 0.04, in contrast with the effect of an analogous Arg mutation on the stoichiometry observed for both the CIN85·Cbl"

Although the p53 family member DeltaNp51B/DeltaNp63alpha (an N terminal-deleted form of p51/p63) is abundantly expressed in keratinocytes, its contribution to UV-B-dependent apoptosis is largely unknown. We found that, after a transient increase, DeltaNp51B is downregulated in UV-B-irradiated keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis, whereas p53 is upregulated with delayed kinetics. Furthermore, the reduction of DeltaNp51B by small interfering RNAs augmented UV-B-dependent apoptosis in keratinocytes, indicating that DeltaNp51B blocks keratinocyte apoptosis. Although the exogenous expression of DeltaNp51B in keratinocytes did not further block the UV-B-dependent apoptosis, to our surprise the expression of TAp51B (an isoform with a full NH(2)-terminal transactivation domain that is structurally and functionally similar to p53) decreased apoptosis significantly. The blockade of keratinocyte apoptosis by the p51 was dependent on the phosphorylation of Akt, resulting in the activation of a survival pathway. Thus, in addition to its indispensable roles in epithelial development, p51 acts in adult cells to protect the epidermis against UV-B irradiation by preventing excess depletion of keratinocytes."

Here we show that 30 +/- 6% fewer inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)), receptors were expressed in adult stargazer cerebellum compared with controls because of a specific loss of GABA(A) receptor expression in the cerebellar granule cell layer. Radioligand binding assays allied to in situ immunogold-EM analysis and furosemide-sensitive tonic current estimates revealed that expression of the extrasynaptic (alpha6betaxdelta) alpha6-containing GABA(A) receptor were markedly and selectively reduced in stargazer. These observations were compatible with a marked reduction in expression of GABA(A) receptor alpha6, delta (mature cerebellar granule cell-specific proteins), and beta3 subunit expression in stargazer. The subunit composition of the residual alpha6-containing GABA(A) receptors was unaffected by the stargazer mutation. However, we did find evidence of an approximately 4-fold up-regulation of alpha1betadelta receptors that may compensate for the loss of alpha6-containing GABA(A) receptors. PCR analysis identified a dramatic reduction in the steady-state level of alpha6 mRNA, compatible with alpha6 being the primary target of the stargazer mutation-mediated GABA(A) receptor abnormalities. We propose that some aspects of assembly, trafficking, targeting, and/or expression of extrasynaptic alpha6-containing GABA(A) receptors in cerebellar granule cells are selectively regulated by AMPA receptor-mediated signaling."

Human cytomegalovirus encodes a type I glycoprotein, US11, that binds to nascent MHC class I heavy chain molecules and causes their dislocation from the ER to the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome. Examination of US11-mediated class I degradation has identified a host of cellular proteins involved in the dislocation reaction, including the cytosolic AAA ATPase p97, the membrane protein Derlin-1, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sel1L. However, the intermediate steps occurring between the initiation of dislocation and full extraction of the misfolded substrate into the cytosol are not known. We demonstrate that US11 itself undergoes ER export and proteasomal degradation and utilize this system to define multiple steps of US11 dislocation. Treatment of US11-expressing cells with proteasome inhibitor resulted in the accumulation of glycosylated and ubiquitinated species as well as a deglycosylated US11 intermediate. Subcellular fractionation of proteasome-inhibited US11 cells demonstrated that deglycosylated intermediates continued to be integrated within the ER membrane, suggesting that the proteasome functions in the latter steps of dislocation.

Around 30% of newly synthesized proteins are unable to assemble into their final functional conformation or complex and are degraded (5Schubert U. Anton L. Gibbs J. Norbury C. Yewdell J.W. Bennick J. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Improperly assembled proteins are recognized by the ER quality control machinery and exported from the ER in a process called dislocation and are degraded by the proteasome. The ability of the cell to dispose of misfolded proteins is critical for cell survival (6Faitova J. Krekac D. Hrstka R. Vojtesek B. Cell. Mol. Biol.

First, degradation substrates are recognized by ER sensors and targeted for removal via an aqueous membrane pore referred to as the “dislocon.” Ubiquitination of ER degradation substrates is carried out by cytosolic or ER membrane bound E3 ubiquitin ligases. Once exposed to the cytosolic environment, N-linked glycans can be cleaved by the cytosolic enzyme peptide N-glycanase. Finally, the ER degradation substrates are delivered to the proteasome and destroyed. Model systems have been established in mammalian cells to study the export of misfolded ER substrates. For example, a mutant form of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a multimembrane-spanning protein, is targeted for proteasomal destruction (9Ward C. Omura S. Kopito R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Degradation of type I membrane proteins have been investigated using the human cytomegalo-virus (HCMV)-encoded type I glycoproteins US2 and US11 that bind directly to nascent MHC class I heavy chains in the ER and catalyze their export and subsequent destruction by the proteasome (10Wiertz E.

In fact, ER quality control is important in the folding and maturation of many proteins that could give rise to disease states (18Aridor M. Hannan L.

Dislocation of type I glycoproteins targeted for degradation in mammalian cells has been partially defined as a multistep process using HCMV US2 and US11. Class I heavy chains are highly unstable in US2- and US11-expressing cells, displaying a half-life of 1–2 min, and degradation can be attenuated through the use of proteasome inhibitors (10Wiertz E. Jones T. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of class I heavy chains by cytosolic peptide N-glycanase occurs promptly upon exposure of the polypeptide to the cytoplasmic environment in cells that have been treated with proteasome inhibitor (10Wiertz E. Jones T. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). MHC class I heavy chains accumulate as deglycosylated, polyubiquitinated intermediates before degradation (20Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Shamu C.E. Story C. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this context class I heavy chains exist as distinct populations after treatment with proteasome inhibitor: glycosylated, ER resident molecules, ubiquitinated membrane-bound species, and deglycosylated cytosolic intermediates. However, the role of ubiquitination in substrate extraction is not fully understood, and at what point during the dislocation reaction ubiquitination occurs remains an outstanding question. The accumulation of dislocation intermediates during proteasome inhibition provides a window through which the steps of dislocation can be delineated. US11 co-opts the host cellular dislocation machinery to degrade MHC class I heavy chains. US11 activates a mild ER stress response to facilitate class I heavy chain degradation (22Tirosh B. Iwakoshi N. Lilley B.N. Lee A. Glimcher L. Ploegh H. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mammalian ER transmembrane protein Derlin-1, a homologue of yeast Der1p, has been implicated in the US11-mediated dislocation of class I heavy chains (23Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L.

A requirement for Sel1L, the mammalian ortholog of yeast Hrd3p, has been demonstrated for class I degradation in US11-expressing cells (25Mueller B. Lilley B.N. Ploegh H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The addition of ubiquitin to dislocation substrates is a critical step in ER dislocation, and ubiquitin-conjugated MHC class I heavy chains accumulate in US11-expressing cells (20Shamu C.E.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Additionally, these cellular components of dislocation may be important in CFTR degradation as well (29Sun F. Zhang R. Gong X.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4557-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), implying that the pathways utilized by US11 likely reflect those employed by the cell to export endogenous misfolded ER substrates. The study presented here identifies HCMV US11 as an uncharacterized ER dislocation and proteasome degradation substrate and explores the impact of proteasome inhibition on the dislocation reaction. A population of glycosylated US11 molecules that are modified with ubiquitin accumulate under conditions of proteasome inhibition. Notably, deglycosylated membrane-bound US11 intermediates accumulate after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that proteasome function impacts the final steps of US11 removal from the ER membrane. The findings presented here further define the dislocation reaction and demonstrate that US11 ubiquitination and deglycosylation occur before its extraction from the ER membrane. Ubiquitination is followed by deglycosylation and complete dislocation. Cells and Antibodies—Human U373-MG and U373-MG stably expressing HCMV US11 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air/5% CO2). gp2-293 cells (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were utilized to generate retroviruses (see below) and were cultured in media similar to U373 cells. Rabbit polyclonal anti-US11, anti-MHC class I heavy chains, and anti-p97 antibodies were kind gifts from H. Ploegh (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Anti-TRAM1 antibodies were raised against peptides that correspond to amino acids 278–291 and 361–374 of TRAM1. The monoclonal antibody W6/32 (31Parham P. Barnstable C. Bodmer W. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from hybridoma cultured supernatant. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH) polyclonal antibody was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) and rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA), respectively. cDNA Constructs—The US11 site-directed cDNA constructs (US11K200R, US11Q192L, US11Q192L,K200R) were generated from the ligation of two PCR fragments in which one fragment contained the mutated codon (32Oresic K. Noriega V. Andrews L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19395-19406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All of the constructs were engineered with restriction sites permissive for insertion into pcDNA3.1(+) and subsequent subcloning into the retrovirus vector pLgPW, which contained EGFP as a selection marker. Retrovirus Transduction—Retrovirus vectors encoding US11 wild-type or mutant constructs were transiently transfected simultaneously with vector containing the VSV-G envelope into gp2-293 cells via a lipid-based protocol to generate pseudotyped Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus amphotropic retrovirus as described previously (32Oresic K. Noriega V. Andrews L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19395-19406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were sorted using a Vantage high speed cell sorter (Mount Sinai Flow Cytometry Facility) 3–5 days post-infection. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were recovered by trypsin digestion and resuspended in 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide followed by incubation on ice for 2 min. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis mix (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Usually, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis mix. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. US11 was immunoprecipitated with anti-US11 antibody and recovered using Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4°C. Pansorbin cells were pelleted and washed 3 times with NET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The polypeptides were removed from the Pansorbin cells with 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 50 mm dithiothreitol) and separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis. Alternatively, U373 and US11 cells were lysed using 1% SDS followed by extreme agitation and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min (cycle repeated 3 times). After lysis, the SDS concentration was diluted to 0.06% using 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis mix, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. Direct cell lysis was carried out by resuspending pelleted cells in 1× SDS sample buffer (0.5 × 106/50 μl of SDS sample buffer) followed by cycle of extreme agitation and incubation at 95 °C (repeated 3 times). Endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycanase sensitivity was determined as per the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). In brief, polypeptide samples were incubated in 1× denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.04 m dithiothreitol) followed by the addition of 10× G5 buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, for endoglycosidase H) or 10× G7 buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 7.5, 10% Nonidet P-40, for peptide N-glycanase) and 1000 units of endoglycosidase H or 500 units of peptide N-glycanase. Enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Pulse-chase Analysis—U373 and US11 cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min at 37 °C. Metabolic labeling was carried out with 500 mCi of [35S] methionine/cysteine (1200 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences)/ml at 37 °C for 10 min. For experiments performed in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, cells were incubated with 50 μm ZL3VS for 1 h at 37 °C. After labeling, the chase was performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing an excess of 25 mm cold methionine and 50 μg/ml cyclohexamide for the indicated times. Cells were pelleted at each chase point by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 s at 4 °C and lysed in 1.5 ml of 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer on ice for 15 min with intermittent vortexing. The cell lysates were precleared by the addition of 3 μl of normal mouse serum/ml, 3 μl of normal rabbit serum/ml and subsequently incubated with 50 μl of Pansorbin cells/ml for 1 h at 4 °C. Pansorbin cells were removed through centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min, and immunoprecipitations for US11 polypeptides were performed as described above. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%), and the radioactive signal in the polyacrylamide gel was enhanced using Autofluor (National Diagnostics). The dried polyacrylamide gel was exposed to autoradiography film for 3 (Fig. 1A) or 11 (Fig. 1C) days at–80 °C. Radiolabeled polypeptides were quantified using GE Healthcare Storm 860. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Quantitative flow cytometry analysis of surface expressed MHC class I molecules in US11WT and US11K200R cells was performed using the monoclonal antibody W6/32. The cells were then incubated with Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), and fluorescence was measured using a Cytomics FC 500 Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The data were analyzed using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Inc). The levels of surface class I molecules are represented by plots of normalized cell number (% of cells) versus fluorescence signal. The % of cells was calculated by converting the maximum cell number at the respective peak fluorescence value to 100%. Isoelectric Focusing—US11 membrane fractions (subcellular fractionation) were subjected to endoglycosidase H or peptide N-glycanase digestion for 2.5 h at 37 °C. 100-μl reaction mixtures were diluted to 1.5 ml with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and US11 polypeptides were recovered using anti-US11 serum as described above. The precipitates were incubated with isoelectric focusing sample buffer (57% (w/v) urea, 2% (v/v) Non-idet P-40, 0.02% ampholytes pH 3.5–10 (Amersham Biosciences), 0.025% 2-mercaptoethanol), and resolved on a 17-cm IEF gel (57% (w/v) urea, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 15.5% acrylamide (30/1.6 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), 4% ampholytes pH 5–7, 1% ampholytes pH 3.5–10, 0.4% ampholytes pH 7–9) for 14 h (33Ploegh H. Coligan J. Dunn B. Ploegh H. Speicher D. Wingfield P. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10.12.11-10.12.18Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed 5 times for 10 min each in 50% methanol, 1% (w/v) SDS/5 mm Tris Cl, pH 8.0, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Subcellular Fractionation—US11 cells were untreated or treated with 5 μm ZL3VS for 14 h. Cells were detached using trypsin and resuspended in 1× homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and mechanically homogenized using a 12-μm ball bearing homogenizer (Isobiotec, Hiedelberg, Germany) with 12 passes. Unbroken cells and other debris were pelleted at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were treated with 4.5 m urea (final) for 10 min on ice. Supernatants were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets from both centrifugation steps were lysed directly in 1× SDS sample buffer, and the 12,000 × g supernatant was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (10,000 Mr cut-off) at 15,000 × g at 4 °C until a final volume of around 100 μl. Supernatants and pellets were lysed directly in 1× SDS sample buffer and resolved using SDS-PAGE (12.5%). US11 Is Degraded in a Proteasomal-dependent Manner— The degradation of type I membrane glycoproteins is a multi-step process that involves both membrane and cytosolic protein complexes. The relationship of the proteasome to the extraction of degradation substrates is not well defined. The current study addresses how proteasome inhibition impacts dislocation of the type I ER membrane protein HCMV US11. Our initial experiment examined the degradation kinetics of US11 using pulse-chase analysis to determine the half-life of US11 protein. U373 cells and cells that stably express US11 were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min followed by a chase of up to 120 min. US11 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-US11 serum at the 0, 30, 60, and 120 min chase points. The immunoprecipitates were resolved using SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. US11 is a 215-amino acid glycoprotein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼25 kDa. As expected, US11 molecules were not recovered from U373 lysates (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). US11 polypeptides recovered from US11 cells decreased throughout the course of the chase (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–8) and were largely absent from the 120-min chase point (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Quantification of the recovered US11 reveals that it has a half-life of around 60 min (Fig. 1B). The instability of US11 molecules throughout the course of the chase demonstrates that US11 was targeted for proteolysis. The instability of US11 molecules is reminiscent of that observed for other ER degradation targets (10Wiertz E. Jones T. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 13Huppa J. Ploegh H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggesting that US11 may also be targeted for proteasomal degradation. To address this hypothesis, U373 and US11 cells treated with or without the proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS (50 μm, 1 h) were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 10 min and chased for up to 60 min (Fig. 1C). US11 was recovered from cell lysates at the 0-, 30-, and 60-min chase points using anti-US11 serum. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 1C). US11 was not recovered from U373 lysates (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3 and 7–9). In US11 cells untreated with ZL3VS, the amount of US11 decreased throughout the chase times (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6) in keeping with our previous findings (Fig. 1A). However, when US11 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, relatively equal amounts of US11 were recovered throughout the chase points (Fig. 1C, lanes 11–12). Notably, a faster migrating species was recovered from the US11 precipitates from the 60-min chase point (Fig. 1C, lane 12, denoted by the asterisk). Treatment with proteasome inhibitors typically results in the accumulation of faster-migrating, deglycosylated class I heavy chains in US11-expressing cells (10Wiertz E. Jones T. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The appearance of a faster-migrating US11 polypeptide upon proteasome inhibition suggests that deglycosylated US11 molecules may accumulate under these conditions. These data demonstrate that US11 was targeted for proteasomal destruction. Degradation of viral proteins may be a strategy evolved by HCMV to prevent a massive ER stress response induced by overexpression of the US11 glycoprotein in the host ER, as US11 has been shown provoke a mild ER stress response (22Tirosh B. Iwakoshi N. Lilley B.N. Lee A. Glimcher L. Ploegh H. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). US11 Degradation Intermediates Accumulate upon Proteasome Inhibition—A major difference between US11 degradation and US11-mediated class I degradation is the kinetics of the reaction. In US11-expressing cells, class I heavy chains are degraded with a half-life of 1–2 min (10Wiertz E. Jones T. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), whereas the half-life of US11 is around 60 min (Fig. 1). The appearance of degradation intermediates is likely dependent upon the efficiency of proteasome inhibition and the rate of dislocation. To determine conditions that allow for accumulation of US11 degradation intermediates, US11 was immunoprecipitated from US11 cells that had been treated with ZL3VS for up to 12 h. Treatment with a minute amount of proteasome inhibitor for a prolonged period of time was not toxic to cells (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently separated using SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-US11 serum (Fig. 2A). As expected, US11 was not recovered from U373 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). An increasing amount of glycosylated US11 was recovered from US11 cells treated with proteasome inhibitor, with nearly equal amounts of glycosylated US11 recovered from cells treated for 6 and 12 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-8). Interestingly, a faster migrating polypeptide was also recovered from US11 cells treated with ZL3VS for 6 and 12 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). Therefore, accumulation of glycosylated and deglycosylated US11 species after long periods of proteasome inhibition is representative of US11 degradation intermediates. Notably, high molecular weight US11-reactive polypeptides were observed after 3 h of proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 2A, lane 6, denoted by arrows). These molecules increased in molecular weight during the time course (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–8, denoted by arrow) and are likely US11 molecules modified with ubiquitin. Indeed, slower migrating US11 species are modified with ubiquitin, as evidenced by immunoblot of US11 immunoprecipitates using anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). In addition, US11 recovered from ZL3VS-treated cells followed by immunoblot using polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody shows a discrete pattern of ubiquitin-reactive bands similar to that observed in the anti-US11 immunoblot (Fig. 2C). It could be the case that the polyclonal antibody recognizes polyubiquitin chains more readily than monoubiquitin modifications and, thus, gives rise to the observed distinct high molecular weight US11 species (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Collectively, these data suggest that longer periods of proteasome inhibition are required to observe"
https://openalex.org/W2049393494,"The Escherichia coli product of the suhB gene, SuhB, is an inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) that is best known as a suppressor of temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes in E. coli. To gain insights into these biological diverse effects, we determined the structure of the SuhB R184A mutant protein. The structure showed a dimer organization similar to other IMPases, but with an altered interface suggesting that the presence of Arg-184 in the wild-type protein could shift the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward monomer. In parallel, a gel shift assay showed that SuhB forms a tight complex with RNA polymerase (RNA pol) that inhibits the IMPase catalytic activity of SuhB. A variety of SuhB mutant proteins designed to stabilize the dimer interface did not show a clear correlation with the ability of a specific mutant protein to complement the ΔsuhB mutation when introduced extragenically despite being active IMPases. However, the loss of sensitivity to RNA pol binding, i.e. in G173V, R184I, and L96F/R184I, did correlate strongly with loss of complementation of ΔsuhB. Because residue 184 forms the core of the SuhB dimer, it is likely that the interaction with RNA polymerase requires monomeric SuhB. The exposure of specific residues facilitates the interaction of SuhB with RNA pol (or another target with a similar binding surface) and it is this heterodimer formation that is critical to the ability of SuhB to rescue temperature-sensitive phenotypes in E. coli."

Two Japanese adults were identified with inherited MPO deficiency because of mutations at Arg-499 or Gly-501, conserved residues near the proximal histidine in the heme pocket. Because of the proximity of these residues to a critical histidine in the heme pocket, we examined the biosynthesis, function, and spectral properties of the peroxidase stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Biosynthesis of normal MPO by human embryonic kidney cells faithfully mirrored events previously identified in cells expressing endogenous MPO. Mutant apopro-MPO was 90 kDa and interacted normally with the molecular chaperones ERp57, calreticulin, and calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, mutant precursors were not proteolytically processed into subunits of MPO, although secretion of the unprocessed precursors occurred normally. Although δ-[14C]aminolevulinic acid incorporation demonstrated formation of pro-MPO in both mutants, neither protein was enzymatically active. The Soret band for each mutant was shifted from the normal 430 to ∼412 nm, confirming that heme was incorporated but suggesting that the number of covalent bonds or other structural aspects of the heme pocket were disrupted by the mutations. These studies demonstrate that despite heme incorporation, mutations in the heme environs compromised the oxidizing potential of MPO.

When PMN are deficient in number or function, normal antimicrobial action is severely compromised, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality from infection. Well suited for the wide diversity of potential microbial challenges, PMN possess a broad array of responses by which to contain, control, kill, and degrade microorganisms, both in the phagosome and within the immediate cellular environs. These defenses include degradative and antimicrobial proteins, fabricated during myeloid development and stored within the granules, as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated de novo specifically in response to invasion.

The H2O2 produced by the multicomponent phagocyte NADPH oxidase (2Nauseef W.M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) converts the azurophilic granule protein myeloperoxidase (MPO) from its resting state into compound I, a transient intermediate with potent oxidizing properties, which in turn oxidizes Cl- to Cl+, thereby generating the potent antimicrobial agent HOCl (3Hampton M.B.

Investig. 1983; 71: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as was the rabbit antibody against human calreticulin (24Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the latter available commercially from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum were obtained from Calbiochem. Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Molecular Modeling—Reasoning that the missense mutations at residues 499 and 501 might adversely influence the structure around the heme in MPO, we modeled the active site of native and mutant forms of the protein. To that end, the three-dimensional structure of human MPO protein was retrieved from the protein data base (Protein Data Bank code 1D2V), and its heme-containing domain was subjected to simplistic energy minimization. For all three structures, we performed force field-based energy minimization of side chains in proximity to the heme to gain insight into the geometry and possible conformational changes of critical residues at the atomic level. We considered the heme, iron, and bromide ions and close proximity residues (Fig. 1). Mutant MPO structures were derived from the native MPO crystal structure by the in silico replacement of Arg-499 with cysteine and Gly-501 with serine using a molecular modeling package (Molecular Operation Environment, version 2004.10, Chemical Computation Group). The geometry of introduced residues of the mutant forms in the active site was minimized using the CHARMM 22 force field (25MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck Jr., J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T. K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher W.E. Roux III, B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J.C.

The hydrogen atoms were added to the structures of native and mutated MPO protein using CHARMM HBUILD module, and their positions were further optimized. Stably Transfected Cells Lines—K562 erythroleukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 (18Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. McCormick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9546-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HEK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Stably transfected cell lines expressing G501S and R499C were created using the same approaches previously employed to analyze normal and specific mutants of human MPO (17DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PCR was used to mutate Gly-501 or Arg-499 in normal MPO cDNA for heterologous expression in human cell lines that are devoid of endogenous MPO. The forward and reverse primers for mutagenesis of Gly-501 were GCCTTCCGCTACAGCCACACCCTCA and TGAGGGTGTGGCTGTAGCGGAAGGC, respectively, with the mutated residue indicated in boldface type, whereas primers ACCAATGCCTTCTGCTACGGCCACA and TGTGGCCGTAGCAGAAGGCATTGTT were used to create R499C. The presence of the desired mutation and absence of unintentional mutations were confirmed by sequencing the cDNA prior to transfection. Once the sequence of the desired mutant construct was confirmed, it was cloned into the expression vector (pREP10 for K562 cells and pcDNA3.1(-) for HEK cells). Stable transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution and selected using hygromycin and G-418 sulfate, respectively. MPO Biosynthesis by Transfectants—Stable transfectants were used for the expression of wild-type and mutant forms of MPO (17DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin.

Cells were maintained at low density in media supplemented with 2 μg/ml hemin for 24 h prior to labeling and placed in methionine-free RPMI medium supplemented with fetal calf serum and antibiotics for 1 h prior to pulse labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine. Cells were labeled for the indicated period and then recovered or chased by the addition of 1000-fold excess of cold methionine, before solubilization for subsequent analysis. MPO-related products were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against MPO, CRT, or CLN. Biosynthetically radiolabeled MPO-related proteins in cell lysates or culture medium were immunoprecipitated with monospecific, polyclonal rabbit anti-human MPO (17DeLeo F.R. Goedken M.

MPO-related species that were associated with CRT or CLN were recovered and quantitated using sequential immunoprecipitations (17DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7107-7111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated first with CRT or CLN antiserum under nondenaturing conditions. The CRT- or CLN-associated proteins in the recovered complex were released by heating in the presence of 2% SDS, and the solution was cooled and diluted 10-fold before proceeding with the immunoprecipitation with MPO antiserum. CRT- and CLN-associated MPO species were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantitated using the PhosphorImager. Heme acquisition was assessed by radiolabeling with δ-[14C]aminolevulinic acid, a precursor in heme synthesis, as done previously. Stable transfectants expressing normal or mutant MPO were cultured in the presence of δ-[14C]aminolevulinic acid overnight, followed by solubilization and immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate or conditioned culture media with MPO antibody, as described above. MPO species containing 14C were quantitated with the PhosphorImager. MPO Activity—Four different assays were employed to assess MPO activity. Peroxidase activity of the expressed wild-type or mutant MPO was quantitated in two complementary ways. Nontransfected cells, normal MPO transfectants, and transfectants expressing mutant MPO were cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml hemin for 48 h prior to recovery and solubilization for determination of enzymatic activity. Peroxidase activity was quantitated spectrophotometrically using o-dianisidine as a substrate (32Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Blood. 1986; 68: 442-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity in cell lysates was also assessed by in situ staining in a native polyacrylamide gel. Duplicate samples were electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions into two 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.05% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 25% glycerol (w/v) in the absence of a stacking gel. Samples were electrophoresed at constant voltage (100 V) toward the cathode until the dye front was ∼5 mm from the bottom of the gel (∼5 h). To avoid permanently staining the Scotch Brite pads with crystal violet, we often electrophorese the dye front off the gel (800–1000 V-h) when subsequently blotting native gels. One gel was washed and stained with trimethylbenzidine to assess peroxidase activity (33Olsen R.L. Little C. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34Pember S.O. Shapira R. Kindade Jr., J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The other gel was soaked in transfer buffer for 1 h and then subjected to electroblotting to a nitrocellulose filter for 850 V-h. The resulting blot was blocked and then processed with MPO antiserum. By performing both analyses in parallel, peroxidase activity could be assigned to a specific protein immunochemically related to MPO. The greater amounts of mutant protein generated by HEK transfectants made possible two additional assays that are specific for MPO. We quantitated the capacity of HEK cell lysates, either wild-type or transfectants expressing normal or mutant MPO, to consume H2O2, using a H2O2 electrode and modification of a method described previously (36Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the presence of chloride, H2O2 consumption by MPO reflected HOCl production. The electrode (Apollo 4000, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) was calibrated daily with dilutions of reagent grade H2O2 (0–20 mm), with the concentrations of the H2O2 standard verified spectrophotometrically using ϵ240 = 43.6 m-1 cm-1 (37Beers R.J. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were added to known amounts of H2O2 in the presence of taurine, to scavenge HOCl and thus eliminate the possibility of its inactivation of the MPO (36Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the rate of H2O2 consumption was measured polarigraphically. Data are expressed as nanomoles H2O2 consumed per min per cell eq. The lysates were likewise assessed for MPO-specific chlorinating capacity using the taurine chloramine assay (36Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). HOCl reacts with taurine to generate taurine monochloramine, which in turns reacts with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid to generate 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The concentration of taurine monochloramine measured spectrophotometrically, ϵ412 = 14.1 m-1 cm-1, and its loss were monitored as a reflection of HOCl production. Lysates from wild-type or transfected cells were used as the potential peroxidase source, and acetaldehyde-xanthine oxidase served as a source for generating oxidants. Data are expressed as nanomoles of HOCl produced/min. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was performed at least three times. We confirmed our findings in a more sensitive and specific assay for MPO-dependent chloramine production that uses iodide-dependent oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate (38Dypbukt J.M. Bishop C. Brooks W.M. Thong B. Eriksson H. Kettle A.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As little as 200 pm MPO can be detected using this assay. Glycosidase Susceptibility of MPO-related Proteins—Modifications of the carbohydrate side chains on MPO-related proteins were assessed by their relative susceptibility to endoglycosidases as done previously with MPO endogenously expressed in myeloid precursors (31Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1987; 70: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Andersson E. Hellman L. Gullberg U. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4747-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MPO-related proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates or culture medium at specified time points and treated with endoglycosidase H or N-glycanase to digest high mannose or complex carbohydrate side chains, respectively. Digested proteins and control immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Spectroscopy—Just as the endogenous MPO synthesized by myeloid precursors is largely compartmentalized into an intracellular organelle (1Klebanoff S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 598-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), MPO expressed by HEK cells was stored in membrane-bound organelles that could be recovered by differential centrifugation. HEK cells (1–2.5 × 108) were collected, treated with diisopropylfluorophosphate, washed, and resuspended in relaxation buffer (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.3) at 2 × 107/ml. Cells were then disrupted by N2 cavitation (350 p.s.i.), and the cavitate was collected in a volume of EGTA, pH 7.4, to achieve a final concentration of 1.25 mm, using a method employed previously for recovering intact intracellular organelles from human neutrophils (40Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and cultured promyelocytic cell lines (32Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Blood. 1986; 68: 442-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min (4 °C) to recover a pellet enriched for dense intracellular organelles, including those containing MPO-related proteins. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium, washed, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles using vigorous pipetting. Vigorous pipetting at each step was essential to maximize vesicle disruption. The clarified supernatant after pellet lysis was scanned from 400 to 600 nm in a Lambda 40 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In addition, oxidation-reduction difference spectroscopy was performed, using dithionite to reduce the lysate in the sample cuvette. The concentration of normal MPO was calculated for oxidized samples using ϵ430 = 91 mm-1 cm-1 (41Bos A.J. Wever R. Roos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For turbid samples reduced minus oxidized difference spectra were obtained, and the concentration was calculated using ϵ473 = 75 mm-1 cm-1 (41Bos A.J. Wever R. Roos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For assays using mutant MPO, the same extinction coefficients were employed to approximate the concentrations of G501S and R499C. Identification of MPO-deficient Subjects—As part of ongoing studies of the prevalence of inherited MPO deficiency in Japan (42Kameoka Y. Persad A.S. Suzuki K. Jpn. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 57: S12-S13PubMed Google Scholar), individuals with partial or complete deficiency were identified using automated flow hematocytochemistry to screen large populations. Among these deficient individuals were two with missense mutations in MPO, G501S, and R499C, that had not been reported previously. In both cases, the individuals were asymptomatic and had not suffered from frequent or severe infectious complications, as described in the detailed clinical reports (21Ohashi Y.Y. Kameoka Y. Persad A.S. Koi F. Yamagoe S. Hashimoto K. Suzuki K. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 327: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Persad A.S. Kameoka Y. Kanda S. Niho Y. Suzuki K. Gene Expr. 2006; 13: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 42Kameoka Y. Persad A.S. Suzuki K. Jpn. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 57: S12-S13PubMed Google Scholar). Predictions Derived from Molecular Modeling—Given the availability of the crystal structure of human MPO (11Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), we modeled the heme pocket of specific mutants at residues 499 and 501 for comparison with the native protein and to gain insight into their potential impact on MPO enzymatic activity. The iron ion in native MPO has six coordination sites as follows: four sites are mediated by pyrrole nitrogen atoms in the heme, and the fifth coordination is the axial His-502–iron bond. The sixth coordination site on the iron ion is vacant and serves to accept electrons and thereby participate in the electrochemistry of the iron-catalyzed oxidation (43Battistuzzi G. Bellei M. Zederbauer M. Furtmüller P.G. Sola M. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12750-12755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The heme in MPO is covalently bound to the protein through two ester linkages and a methionyl sulfonium linkage (11Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition to the three covalent bonds, electrostatic interactions with pyrrole rings C and D contribute to the structure and stability of the heme pocket in MPO. The guanidinium group of Arg-499, as well as that of Arg-590, forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of a propionate in ring D (11Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Replacement of Arg-499 with any residue that eliminates this electrostatic interaction would likely compromise heme binding and stability. Furthermore, after arranging the side chains in R499C to optimize favorable interactions with the molecular neighbors, the model of the heme pocket predicted sufficient space and side chain mobility to afford close proximity between its sulfur atom and the heme iron, if heme were incorporated into the pocket lacking the stabilizing arginine at 499. Whether in a neutral or deprotonated state, the sulfur introduced by R499C could coordinate with the iron, thereby forming a relatively strong interaction at ∼2.5 Å (Fig. 1B). Such"
https://openalex.org/W2074465512,"We have characterized the role of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding in the 3′-terminal base pair on the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase. Nonpolar nucleoside analogs of thymidine (dF) and deoxyadenosine (dQ) were used to eliminate hydrogen bonds while maintaining base pair size and shape. Exonuclease reactions were examined using pre-steady state kinetic methods. The time dependence of removal of natural nucleotides from the primer terminus paired opposite the nonpolar analogs dF and dQ were best fit to a double exponential function. The double exponential kinetics as well as the rates of excision (3–6 s–1 fast phase, 0.16–0.3 s–1 slow phase) are comparable with those observed during mismatch removal of natural nucleotides even when the analog was involved in a sterically correct base pair. Additionally, incorporation of the next correct base beyond a nonpolar analog was slow (0.04–0.22 s–1), so that more than 95% of terminal base pairs were removed rather than extended. The polymerase responds to all 3′-terminal base pairs containing a nonpolar analog as if it were a mismatch regardless of the identity of the paired base, and kinetic partitioning between polymerase and exonuclease sites failed to discriminate between correct and incorrect base pairs. Thus, sterics alone are insufficient, whereas hydrogen bond formation is essential for proper proofreading selectivity by the mitochondrial polymerase. The enzyme may use the alignment and prevention of fraying provided by proper hydrogen bonding and minor groove hydrogen bonding interactions as critical criteria for correct base pair recognition.

The enzyme may use the alignment and prevention of fraying provided by proper hydrogen bonding and minor groove hydrogen bonding interactions as critical criteria for correct base pair recognition. Accurate replication by a DNA polymerase relies upon discrimination against incorrect nucleotides during polymerization, and the overall fidelity can be improved by the selective removal of mismatches by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. As shown in Fig. 1, during each round of processive synthesis the polymerase can bind and incorporate the next nucleotide, or the 3′-terminal base can be removed by the proofreading exonuclease. Earlier studies employing the T7 DNA polymerase (1Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 2Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 3Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and subsequent work on the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the kinetic partitioning between polymerase and exonuclease sites governs the selectivity of the proofreading exonuclease. During successive rounds of correct base pair incorporation, polymerization is fast relative to the slow migration of the DNA to the exonuclease site, and so, excision occurs infrequently, and the cost of proofreading is low. However, after incorporation of a mismatch, forward polymerization stalls, thereby inverting the kinetic partitioning to favor excision rather than extension of the DNA. Moreover, enzyme trapping experiments established that the DNA can migrate from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site and back again without dissociating from the enzyme. These studies showed that the decision to continue incorporation or remove a nucleotide is made at the polymerase site by recognition of a proper base pair after incorporation. The enzyme somehow recognizes a mismatch at the primer terminus and markedly reduces the rate of incorporation of the next nucleotide. However, little is known about how the polymerase recognizes a mismatch at the 3′-terminus and how the rate of polymerization is inhibited. Because proofreading is an important contributor to overall fidelity of DNA replication, it is of interest to determine the physical origins of this enzymatic selectivity. In principle, the recognition of a mismatch could be due to loss of base pair hydrogen bonding and lower free energy of formation of the terminal base pair, or it could be a function of selection for proper base pair geometry. To evaluate the relative contributions of these effects in the human mitochondrial polymerase, we have employed nonpolar nucleoside analogs in the terminal base pair of primer-template duplexes. We have used the nonpolar analogs shown in Fig. 2. The analog difluorotoluene deoxyriboside (dF) 2The abbreviations used are: dF, difluorotoluene deoxyriboside; dQ, 9-methyl-1-H-imidazo[(4,5)-b]pyridine deoxyribose; Pol γ, DNA polymerase; dFTP, difluorotoluene deoxynucleoside triphosphate; dFMP, difluorotoluene deoxynucleoside monophosphate. is a non-hydrogen bonding isostere of thymidine (5Schweitzer B.A. Kool E.T. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 7238-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas 9-methyl-1-H-imidazo[(4,5)-b]pyridine deoxyribose (dQ) is an isostere of deoxyadenosine that also lacks Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding ability (6Guckian K.M. Morales J.C. Kool E.T. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the analogs can serve as useful probes of the relative roles of hydrogen bonding and shape in governing the selectivity of proofreading by examining their effects on rates of excision and extension. We have employed the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ), a high fidelity A family DNA polymerase, to assay exonuclease proofreading and active site partitioning with nonpolar analogs dF and dQ in either the template or the primer strand at the 3′-terminus. This enzyme replicates DNA with high fidelity, introducing an average of 1 error for every 440,000 bases (7Lee H.R. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the polymerase can enhance the overall fidelity of the enzyme by as much as 200-fold (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, pre-steady state kinetic methods have been employed to assay the effect of nonpolar analogs on the selectivity of the exonuclease activity for removing correct and incorrect base pairs. We have also assayed the kinetics of polymerization of the next correct nucleotide beyond each base pair to assess the kinetic partitioning between extension versus excision. In the accompanying paper we reported on the influence of hydrogen bonding during nucleotide incorporation by Pol γ (8Lee H.R. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we show that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding plays a central role in exonuclease proofreading and in subsequent rounds of polymerization, as seen by the lack of selectivity exhibited by Pol γ in removing and/or burying correct and incorrect 3′ terminal bases when hydrogen bonding groups are absent.

Formation of a dFMP-terminated Primer—To assay the kinetics of incorporation after a 3′ dFMP:dA pair (where dA was the templating base, a dFMP-terminated primer was required. These reactions were carried out by stepwise synthesis to first incorporate dFMP and then examine incorporation on top of the product. Catalytic subunit (400 nm) was preincubated with a 2 μm accessory subunit and 360 nm 27p/45A primer/template in a buffer lacking MgCl2. Oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I. This solution was mixed (1:1) with one containing 200 μm dFTP and 50 mm MgCl2. After 10 s, this combined solution was rapidly mixed (1:1) with a solution containing 25 mm MgCl2 and varying concentrations of dCTP to assay the nucleotide concentration dependence of extension on top of dFMP. During the final reaction, concentrations were as follows: 100 nm catalytic subunit, 500 nm accessory subunit, 90 nm 28pF/45A, 25 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dFTP, and 10–500 μm dCTP.TABLE 1DNA primer-template combinations27p5′-CCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAAC28paThe 3′-terminal base of 28p was A, T, G, or C based upon the base pair assayed.5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAACA45F3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGFGCGATCCAATGCCGTCC45Q3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGQGCGATCCAATGCCGTCC45A3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGAGCGATCCAATGCCGTCCa The 3′-terminal base of 28p was A, T, G, or C based upon the base pair assayed.

Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that the dNTP was omitted so the exonuclease reaction could be observed. The holoenzyme-DNA complex was assembled in a buffer free of MgCl2 at twice the final concentration and then rapidly mixed 1:1 with a solution containing MgCl2. The concentration of product was plotted against the time course of the reaction, and the subsequent curve was fit to a single or double exponential equation to determine the rate of exonuclease proofreading by Pol γ as described (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exonuclease Removal of Natural Nucleotides Paired with Nonpolar Analogs—We used single turnover kinetic methods to examine the removal of each of the four possible nucleotides paired opposite the nonpolar analogs dF and dQ to get the results shown in Fig. 3. The kinetics of removal are nearly indistinguishable irrespective of the base pair assayed and, in each case, fit best to a double exponential equation. The fitted parameters describing the time course of hydrolysis in each case are presented in Table 2. The kinetics of removal of each natural nucleotide paired opposite the nonpolar analog was nearly indistinguishable from the removal of mismatched base pairs described previously (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and repeated here for a dG:dT mismatch (Table 2). Thus, for the non-hydrogen-bonded base pairs at the DNA terminus, the Pol γ exonuclease failed to distinguish between correct and incorrect base pairs and removed any nucleotide paired with a nonpolar analog in the template strand as if it were a mismatch.TABLE 2Removal of natural nucleotidesTemplate basePrimerRate 1Amplitude 1Rate 2Amplitude 2s−1nms−1nmdFdA6 ± 146 ± 70.3 ± 0.136 ± 6dC4.4 ± 0.739 ± 40.24 ± 0.0648 ± 3dG5 ± 136 ± 30.27 ± 0.0648 ± 3dT4.5 ± 0.238 ± 10.24 ± 0.0148 ± 1dQdA6 ± 147 ± 40.24 ± 0.0738 ± 3dC3.6 ± 0.437 ± 20.22 ± 0.0347 ± 2dG1.1 ± 0.647 ± 120.14 ± 0.0438 ± 12dT4.1 ± 0.241 ± 10.16 ± 0.0145 ± 1dTdA0.021 ± 0.00278 ± 3NANAdG3.3 ± 0.257 ± 20.45 ± 0.0629 ± 2 Open table in a new tab These data suggest that hydrogen bonding is absolutely essential for recognition of correct terminal base pair. However, the major contributor to selectivity of the proofreading exonuclease is not the rate of excision but, rather, the rate of extension over a mismatch. Therefore, we measured the kinetics of extension over several of the base pairs containing nonpolar analogs. Incorporation of the Next Correct Base—A series of experiments was carried out to determine the effects of a 3′ terminal base pair containing a nonpolar analog on the incorporation of the next correct nucleotide by Pol γ. Representative data are shown in Fig. 4 for the incorporation of dCTP over a 3′dTMP:dQ (primer:template) base pair. The time courses of product formation (Fig. 4A) were fit to a single exponential to obtain the rate of polymerization at several concentrations of dCTP (the next correct base). Fitting the concentration dependence of the rate to a hyperbola (Fig. 4B) defines the maximum rate kpol and apparent dissociation constant for dCTP binding, Kd. The rate of nucleotide incorporation was reduced by ∼400-fold relative to the rate of extension of a dT:dA base pair. The results of similar experiments using several different 3′-terminal base pairs (3′dFMP:dA, 3′dAMP:dF, 3′dTMP:dQ, and 3′dCMP:dQ) are summarized in Table 3. In each case the kinetics of primer extension are considerably slower than the rate of extension of a correct natural base pair and also slower than the rate of extension to bury a natural mismatch (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the efficiency of extension beyond a 3′dFMP:dA correct base pair mimic was 680,000-fold lower than that observed for a native 3′dTMP:dA pair (Table 3). Interestingly, the extension of the converse 3′dAMP:dF pair was 130-fold more efficient than the converse 3′dFMP:dA pair due to both tighter binding and faster incorporation of the next correct nucleotide.TABLE 3Incorporation beyond a nonpolar analog of a “correct” base pairTerminal base pair (P/T)Kdkpol-Fold effectμms−13′dFMP:dA550 ± 1100.038 ± 0.005680,0003′dAMP:dF24 ± 40.22 ± 0.025,1003′dTMP:dQ250 ± 600.22 ± 0.0453,0003′dCMP:dQ180 ± 400.21 ± 0.0340,000 Open table in a new tab In this report we have employed the nonpolar analogs dF and dQ and used pre-steady state kinetic methods to test the roles of hydrogen bonding within the 3′-terminal base pair on selectivity during exonuclease removal and primer extension. The present data suggest that base pair hydrogen bonding plays a central role in error correction. We observed a complete loss of the ability of the enzyme to distinguish between correctly and incorrectly paired bases at the terminus when hydrogen bonding was eliminated. This is in marked contrast with naturally hydrogen bonded pairs and mismatches. Thus, we conclude that terminal pair hydrogen bonding has a strong influence on the partitioning of the primer terminus to the exonuclease site and in the recognition of a mismatch at the polymerase site. Possible reasons for this are discussed below. Exonuclease Removal of Natural Nucleotides Paired Opposite Nonpolar Analogs—It was first shown by Brutlag and Kornberg (15Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of a DNA polymerase shows selectivity for mismatched DNA. Subsequent analysis using T7 polymerase showed that the kinetic partitioning between polymerase and exonuclease sites governs selectivity of the proofreading function and that stalling of the polymerase after a mismatch is the major contributor to exonuclease selectivity (1Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) by changing the kinetic partitioning to favor excision rather than extension of a mismatch. Similar analysis using Pol γ showed that correct nucleotides are removed by the 3′-5′ exonuclease domain at a rate of 0.02 s–1 (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mismatched nucleotides are removed in a biphasic reaction with rates of 3.3 and 0.46 s–1 (Table 2). The biphasic nature of the removal of incorrectly paired nucleotides suggests a model whereby the rates of removal represent partitioning of the primer strand between the polymerase site and the exonuclease site and subsequent exonuclease removal of the 3′ terminal nucleotide. Because the reaction was initiated by the addition of Mg2+ to a preformed enzyme-DNA complex, it is not possible to assign these observed rates to individual steps in the pathway. Nonetheless, the observed rate of 3.3 s–1 sets a lower limit of the rate of excision, and the large amplitude of this fast phase indicates that the majority of the DNA was excised at this rate. Previous analysis of the rates of hydrolysis of DNA containing a frayed primer stand of varying lengths suggested that the slow phase may represent the rate of migration of the primer strand from the polymerase to the exonuclease site, whereas the fast phase sets a lower limit on the rate of hydrolysis once the primer strand is at the exonuclease site (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the details of the model with which we interpret the observed kinetics, it is apparent that the primer:templates containing nonpolar analogs are excised at rates comparable with the rates of removal of mismatches. The rates of excision are independent of the identity of the base pair in that any 3′ terminal nucleotide involved in a base pair with a nonpolar analog is removed as if it were a mismatch. In an earlier study of proofreading by the Klenow fragment of DNA Pol I, it was shown that the rate of removal of dA paired opposite dF was much faster than the rate of removal of dA paired opposite dT (13Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study with polymerase γ this is also the case; moreover, we show that the rate of removal of dA paired opposite dF was roughly equivalent to the rates of removal of the mismatches dC, dG, and dT paired opposite dT. In addition, we observe that the kinetics of removal of dA, dC, dG, and dT paired opposite dF are all biphasic and that the rates observed are nearly equivalent. We have also shown that the kinetics of removal of most of these nucleotides paired opposite dQ do not deviate significantly from those nucleotides paired opposite dF, and they are not changed by the presence of bases of varied sizes and shapes opposite these analogs. One minor but interesting exception is dG opposite dQ, which is edited 3-fold more slowly than a G-T mismatch (although still 50-fold more rapidly than the control T-A pair). A possible explanation for this is that dQ, when flipped to the syn orientation, is isosteric with C and could in principle form a hydrogen bond with G analogous to the central bond in a G-C pair (Fig. 5). Our data for polymerase γ show that in the absence of hydrogen bonding, simple structural mimicry is not sufficient to suppress rapid editing by the proofreading exonuclease. NMR data and solution studies have shown that dF is a good shape mimic of dT and that the presence of dF opposite dA in a DNA duplex distorts the structure of the duplex very little (16Guckian K.M. Krugh T.R. Kool E.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and yet the dA:dF pair is proofread as if it were a mismatch. Taken together, the current data suggest that partitioning to the exonuclease site in Pol γ is influenced strongly by hydrogen bonding in the terminal pair. We hypothesize that the unwinding of the terminus of the primer-template duplex starts with the terminal pair, and so fraying rates of that terminal pair could well directly affect exonuclease rates. Because they lack hydrogen bonds that could provide an energetic or kinetic constraint on initial separation of the pair, it seems quite possible that pairs involving dF and dQ may well fray at an increased rate and have an equilibrium for fraying that lies further to the separated side. NMR studies of DNA duplexes containing F-A and F-Q pairs show evidence of rapid motion around the nonnatural bases, consistent with the possibility that the lack of hydrogen bonds increases fraying rates (16Guckian K.M. Krugh T.R. Kool E.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Guckian K.M. Schweitzer B.A. Ren R.X. Sheils C.J. Tahmassebi D. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although the nonpolar bases of dF and dQ in fact stack more strongly in DNA than their natural counterparts thymine and adenine (17Guckian K.M. Schweitzer B.A. Ren R.X. Sheils C.J. Tahmassebi D. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), pairs involving dF and dQ are weakly destabilizing to short synthetic duplexes containing 5′ overhangs as occurs in proofreading (13Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The same is true of natural mismatched pairs. Although natural mismatches (such as G-T) are known to be hydrogen-bonded to one another, such mismatches often have a reduced number of hydrogen bonds (18Kouchakdjian M. Li B.F. Swann P.F. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and their noncanonical geometries may also weaken the base-base interaction and facilitate fraying. We also considered steric and geometric differences between matched and mismatched pairs, but our data here show that regardless of the shape of the natural base opposite an analog and regardless of whether the analog is smaller (dF) or larger (dQ), the exonuclease proofreading rate remains essentially unchanged. Very similar results were previously observed with dF in a study of proofreading by the Klenow exonuclease (13Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The data reported here may reflect the mechanisms by which the mitochondrial polymerase interacts with the primer terminus to distinguish a correct base pair from a mismatch in ways that are not yet understood. Perhaps the distortion of the primer terminus by interaction at the enzyme active site destabilizes mismatched base pairs. Alternatively, the hydrogen bonds may provide a degree of alignment of a proper base pair that is a critical element in distinguishing a mismatch. This is clearly an area of research that demands more direct and rigorous analysis. Roles of Hydrogen Bonding in Extension of Pairs—The frequency of editing of a given base pair depends strongly on the rate of primer extension. As summarized in Table 3, the effect of a nonpolar analog in the primer terminus ranged from a 5,100- to 680,000-fold effect on kpol/Kd. Base pairs containing one nonpolar partner either in the primer or template strand were extended at markedly reduced rates. For example, Pol γ extends a 3′dAMP:dF pair ∼5000-fold less efficiently than a natural 3′dAMP:dT pair. Conversely, Pol γ extends the converse 3′dFMP:dA pair 680,000-fold less efficiently than the analogous 3′dTMP:dA pair. It is interesting to note the asymmetry in that dF in the primer strand has a much greater effect than dF in the template strand, paralleling the effects seen during incorporation (8Lee H.R. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results are reminiscent of the asymmetry in the dG:dT wobble base pair incorporation kinetics (7Lee H.R. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36236-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and suggest a difference in interactions with the enzyme in the primer versus template strand. We suggest two possible explanations for this poor extension of pairs containing a nonpolar base. One is that the dF is more free to “wobble” into the major groove when it is on the primer side of the duplex and that hydrogen bonds play a critical role in preventing this motion with native nucleotides. A second possibility (not mutually exclusive) is that Pol γ may form energetically important minor groove hydrogen bonds both to the primer and template sides of the groove at the extended pair. Thus, a nonpolar base on either side would result in a costly desolvation upon extension. Previous results with the Klenow polymerase and nonpolar analogs showed extensions that were less efficient by 110-fold when nonpolar bases were in the template strand and by 3000-fold when in the primer strand; this latter poor extension could be rescued by the addition of a minor groove hydrogen bond acceptor (13Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Morales J.C. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2323-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13292-13297Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Spratt T.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggested an important minor groove interaction on the primer side of the extended pair. Other studies of nonpolar base pairs have also reported poor extension by the Klenow polymerase and improved extension with the addition of hydrogen bond acceptors in the groove (22Henry A.A. Romesberg F.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 23Leconte A.M. Matsuda S. Romesberg F.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 6780-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We expect that geometry of the A-F pair is not likely to cause this poor extension with Pol γ, since the dF analog minimizes any effects of geometry of the base pair by closely mimicking the shape of thymidine (24Guckian K.M. Krugh T.R. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6841-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that either the alignment of base pairs afforded by hydrogen bonding or the minor groove hydrogen bonds (or both) are critical elements leading to fast primer extension. In the absence of hydrogen bonding, the resulting misalignment of the 3′-terminal base and/or the cost of desolvation of the enzyme may slow the rate of extension. Cost of Proofreading and Error Correction—The cost of proofreading is a measure of the frequency with which a correctly paired nucleotide is removed by the exonuclease and is defined as kexo/(kextend + kexo), where kexo is the rate of excision, and kextend is the rate of primer extension. One would expect highly efficient DNA polymerases to exhibit a low rate of removal of correct nucleotides relative to removal of incorrect nucleotides. Indeed, this is the case for Pol γ. The cost of proofreading for Pol γ is 0.14%, whereas between 75 and 99.5% of mismatches are removed rather than extended (4Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T7 DNA polymerase shows even greater selectivity (1Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When a nonpolar analog is present in the template, the rate of extending the 3′ terminal pair is only 0.022 s–1. The rate of removal of the nucleotide from the primer opposite such an analog is between 4.1 and 6 s–1, leading to a cost of proofreading between 95 and 97%, a value comparable with the efficiency seen for mismatch removal. Thus, the processive synthesis of base pairs containing nonpolar bases is quite inefficient with this polymerase. Summary—Combined with the results from the companion study of nucleotide incorporation by Pol γ (8Lee H.R. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the data show that the synthesis of base pairs by the mitochondrial polymerase depends significantly on hydrogen bonds in three ways. First, the companion study revealed that the fidelity and efficiency of nucleotide insertion was significantly greater for natural nucleotides compared with non-hydrogen-bonding mimics. Second, the current study shows that extension beyond the nonpolar analogs by this enzyme is a factor of at least 103-fold less efficient than beyond natural polar ones, suggesting a possible role of hydrogen bonds in alignment of the 3′-terminal base of the primer. Third, the current data also show that exonuclease editing of pairs lacking hydrogen bonds is rapid, suggesting that hydrogen bonds play an important role in lowering the cost of proofreading, possibly by slowing the fraying of the DNA terminus."

Approximately 50% of eukaryotic proteomes are comprised of glycoproteins and proteoglycans (1Apweiler R. Hermjakob H. Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), which together with glycolipids play many essential cellular functions. These include molecular recognition events that are critical to cell growth and differentiation, inflammation, immune defense, fertilization, and parasitic infection. Assembly of the glycan moieties takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In this latter organelle, different glycosyltransferases transfer sugars, from nucleotide sugars, to the appropriate acceptors. Nucleotide sugars are mostly synthesized in the cytosol and therefore need to be translocated into the Golgi apparatus before becoming substrates for the corresponding transferases. Studies on these transporter mutants in yeast, mammals, and invertebrates have shown that transport of nucleotide sugars regulates their availability in the Golgi apparatus lumen and thereby the quantity and quality of their reaction products (2Abeijon C.

For example, the highly substrate-specific UDP-GlcNAc transporters from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis are only 22% identical (8Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although initial studies suggested that these transporters were specific for only one substrate, more recent studies have shown that several substrates can be transported by a given transporter (4Caffaro C.E.

The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes 18 putative nucleotide sugar transporters based on amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding transporters from other species (Fig. 1). However, analyses of sugars occurring in this nematode suggest that only seven nucleotide sugars should be required for their glycoconjugate biosynthesis. A similar situation occurs in humans (9Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Codogno P. Oriol R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This observation raises the question of whether, in multicellular organisms, different proteins transport the same nucleotide sugars in different tissues, whether the transporters have redundant activities in the same tissues, or whether different nucleotide sugar transporters may act in distinct compartments of the secretory pathway. To date, in-depth biochemical and biological studies have been done with only three C. elegans nucleotide sugar transporters. We showed that SQV-7 transports UDP-Gal, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), 4The abbreviations used are: UDP-GlcAUDP-glucuronic acidRNAiRNA interferenceGFPgreen fluorescent protein. and UDP-GalNAc in a competitive manner (10Berninsone P.

Recently we characterized the transporter encoded by the CO3H5.2 gene and found that it translocates UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc in a novel manner that is non-competitive, simultaneous, and independent (11Caffaro C.E. Hirschberg C.B. Berninsone P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16176-16181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previously we had shown that SRF-3 transports UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc-NAc (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R.

In this instance and in virtually all other cases where multisubstrate transporters of nucleotide sugars were described (13Ashikov A. Routier F. Fuhlrott J. Helmus Y. Wild M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

UDP-glucuronic acid RNA interference green fluorescent protein. The partial overlap in substrate specificity among the above three C. elegans transporters, namely UDP-Gal for SQV-7 and SRF-3, UDP-GalNAc for SQV-7 and CO3H5.2, and UDP-GlcNAc for SRF-3 and CO3H5.2, suggests the possibility that this redundancy may have significant biological implications, particularly for multicellular organisms. We now show that reducing the activity of the CO3H5.2 gene product by RNAi in SRF-3 transporter mutants results in oocyte accumulation and abnormal gonad morphology, whereas RNAi in wild type or RNAi hypersensitive C. elegans strains does not cause a detectable phenotype. We further show that transport of substrates via transporter SRF-3 occurs in a non-competitive, independent, and simultaneous manner, similarly to that of CO3H5.2 but differently from the competitive transport of SQV-7. Based on the phylogenetic tree of C. elegans nucleotide sugar transporters, we hypothesize that different transport mechanisms may have evolved parallel to amino acid sequence divergence. Strain Maintenance and Genetics—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PRY225 (ura3-52, lys2-801am, ade2-1020c, his3, leu2, trplΔ1) was grown at 30 °C in liquid yeast extract/peptone/dextrose or on solid yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media containing 2% Bacto-agar. Strains derived from PRY225 transformed with URA plasmids were grown at 30 °C in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-URA) prepared using SCM-URA (Sigma). All C. elegans strains were grown as described previously. The following strains were used: Bristol N2; srf-3 (yj10); rrf-3 (pk1426) (provided by CGC); srf-3 (e2689), srf-3 (e2797) (provided by J. Hodgkin), and BC14237 (C03H5.2 promoter-GFP fusion construct) (provided by C. elegans bioinformatics via the C. elegans expression patterns site). Some nematode strains used in this work were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) at the National Institutes of Health. Radioactive Substrates—The following radioactive substrates used were all purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO): UDP-[14C]GlcA (196 mCi/mmol), UDP-[14C]Gal (258 mCi/mmol), UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (60 Ci/mmol), UDP-[3H]GalNAc (60 Ci/mmol). Subcellular Fractionation—S. cerevisiae transformed with pG426, pG426-SQV-7, or pG426-SRF-3 were grown in SCM-URA liquid medium to an A600 of 3. The culture was centrifuged and converted to spheroplasts as described previously by using a total of 1 mg of Zymolyase 100 T (Seikagaku America, Rockville, MD) per g of cells. The spheroplast suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Cells were broken by suspending the pellet in 1.5× volume of membrane buffer and by drawing the cells rapidly several times into a narrow bore serological pipette. The suspension was centrifuged successively for 10 min at 2000 × g, 8 min at 5000 × g, and finally, 45 min at 125,000 × g to obtain a pellet fraction enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi Apparatus-derived vesicles. Nucleotide Sugar Transport Assay—The theoretical basis for the translocation assay of nucleotide sugars into Golgi apparatus-enriched vesicles has been described previously (19Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transport assays of C. elegans nucleotide sugar transporter expressed in S. cerevisiae and analyses of the samples were carried out as described previously. Radioactivity was detected using a liquid scintillation spectrometer. RNAi Experiments—RNAi was performed by feeding as described (20Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). All the RNAi experiments were done using clones from Open Biosystems. These clones contain the entire open reading frame for the corresponding gene, from start to stop, cloned into an RNAi feeding vector (pL4440-dest-RNAi) and transformed into the compatible host (HT115 (DE3)). Briefly, bacteria transformed with empty plasmid or the corresponding constructs were grown in LB media supplemented with 50 μg/μl ampicillin and 12.5 μg/μl tetracycline for 16 h. Cultures were diluted and induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when they reached an A600 = 0.5. Induced bacteria, resuspended in 50% fresh media, were used to seed nematode growth medium plates containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 50 μg/μl carbenicillin, and 12.5 μg/μl tetracycline. L4 hermaphrodite animals (N2, rrf-3, srf-3 yj10, srf-3 e22689, srf-3 e2797) were transferred to these plates. After 24 h, individual adults were transferred to fresh plates and allowed to lay eggs for 6 h to obtain a synchronized progeny for microscopy observation. Tissue Expression and Localization of C. elegans Nucleotide Sugar Transporters CO3H5.2 and SRF-3—In previous studies, the SQV-7 transporter was localized to the vulva, seam cells, distal tip cells, and oocytes, whereas the SRF-3 transporter was detected in seam cells, pharyngeal gland cells, and the spermatheca (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We used a C. elegans strain BC 14237, which carries an extrachromosomal array with a promoter CO3H5.2-GFP construct, to identify the tissue expression pattern of this nucleotide sugar transporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2, left and right panels, B, D, and F, the GFP fluorescence, driven by the above promoter, suggests that the CO3H5.2 gene has a broad expression pattern, consistent with that reported in Worm-Base. This includes expression in the pharynx and pharyngeal gland cells, seam cells, spermatheca, stomatointestinal muscle, vulva, and body wall muscle. Therefore, the C. elegans CO3H5.2 and SRF-3 transporters appear to have a partial overlap in tissue expression (pharynx and pharyngeal gland cells, seam cells, and spermatheca), as well as nucleotide sugar transport specificity, that of UDP-GlcNAc. Functional Redundancy between C. elegans Nucleotide Sugar Transporters CO3H5.2 and SRF-3—We previously showed that mutants lacking SRF-3 activity exhibit only a mild locomotion phenotype and are virtually indistinguishable from wild type animals when grown on E. coli (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These characteristics, as well as the above partial overlap in tissue and substrate specificity with transporter CO3H5.2, stimulated our interest in determining whether or not functional redundancy occurred between these transporters. We therefore determined the effects of CO3H5.2 RNAi inactivation in wild type, RNAi hypersensitive strain rrf-3, and srf-3 animals when grown on E. coli. In all cases, we used a culture of the same strain fed with bacteria transformed with an empty plasmid as a control. CO3H5.2 RNAi inactivation in wild type or the RNAi hypersensitive strains resulted in neither morphological defects (Fig. 3, left panel) nor a surface phenotype such as that of srf animals (data not shown) and is consistent with a previous report (22Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J. Nature. 2003; 421: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). In contrast, CO3H5.2 inactivation in srf-3 mutants resulted in striking morphological phenotypes. These consisted of an increased accumulation of oocytes in proximal gonad arms, when compared with wild type animals (Fig. 3, right panel, D and E when compared with negative controls A and B). No evidence of sterility or differences in brood size was detected, and each oocyte appeared to have normal morphology with only one nucleus with an intact membrane per cell. We also observed abnormal gonad arms, such as twists and overturns resembling morphological gonad distortion caused by defects during gonad migration (Fig. 3, right panel, F when compared with negative control C). Importantly, no abnormal phenotypes were observed when N2 or srf-3 animals were subject to RNAi against the closely related (43% identical) nucleotide sugar transporter encoded by the ZK896.9 gene (Fig. 1; data not shown). This last experiment rules out that a closely related nucleotide sugar transporter is a secondary target of C03H5.2 RNAi. It was also important to rule out the possibility that the above observed defects in srf-3 mutants were the result of unknown mutations in the particular srf-3 strain used. Therefore, the same RNAi experiments were also performed with two independently isolated srf-3 alleles. Fig. 4A shows scores of abnormal morphology of the gonad arms and of oocyte accumulation for each of the three srf-3 alleles. Twenty-three percent of the yj10 animals (n = 65), 25% of the e2689 animals (n = 52), and 19.6% of the e2797 (n = 56) animals displayed misshapen gonad arms (extra turns of distal gonad arms or intersecting gonad arms), whereas less than 4% of control srf-3 animals (empty plasmid RNAi) showed this phenotype. Eleven percent of the yj10 animals, 17.3% of the e2689 animals, and 3.6% of the e2797 animals showed accumulation of oocytes (Fig. 4B), whereas neither CO3H5.2 RNAi in wild type animals nor empty plasmid RNAi in srf-3 animals showed this defect (Fig. 4B). The above experiments therefore strongly suggest that simultaneous inactivation of CO3H5.2 and SRF-3 causes the observed abnormal phenotypes and are consistent with functional redundancy between these nucleotide sugar transporters. The low percentage of e2797 animals showing accumulation of oocytes after C03H5.2 RNAi inactivation is consistent with e2797 mutants displaying a temperature-sensitive Bus phenotype (bacterial unswollen) when grown on Microbacterium nematophilum (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At 16 °C, the temperature used in our experiments, e2797 animals are barely resistant to this infection, suggesting that the SRF-3 transport activity is not completely abolished. SQV-7 also shares substrate specificity with SRF-3 (UDP-Gal) and CO3H5.2 (UDP-GalNAc) (10Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SQV-7, SRF-3, and CO3H5.2 were shown to be expressed in seam cells (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas both SQV-7 and CO3H5.2 are also expressed in the vulva (21Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the low fertility of sqv-7 mutants does not allow us to use the RNAi approach with these animals to test whether there is also functional redundancy among these transporters. Evolutionary Relationship among C. elegans Nucleotide Sugar Transporter Mechanisms—We have recently demonstrated that transporter CO3H5.2 translocates UDP-Glc-NAc and UDP-GalNAc in an independent and simultaneous manner (11Caffaro C.E. Hirschberg C.B. Berninsone P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16176-16181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This novel translocation mechanism is different from the competitive and non-cooperative transport of multiple substrates by SQV-7 (10Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and prompted us to examine the transport mechanism of the multisubstrate transporter SRF-3 (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SRF-3 was identified as a C. elegans nucleotide sugar transporter with specificity for UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was initially assumed, without detailed studies, that these substrates compete for transport as reported previously for SQV-7 (10Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Examination of the C. elegans nucleotide sugar transporter phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) indicates that SRF-3 has a high amino acid sequence identity with CO3H5.2 (37.8%) and shares lower identity with SQV-7 (13%). This observation led us to hypothesize that mechanisms of transport of substrates by different nucleotide sugar transporters may have evolved parallel to the divergence among the transporter proteins as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, we postulated that transport of nucleotide sugars via SRF-3 might be similar to that of transporter CO3H5.2 and different from that reported for SQV-7. To test whether UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal can be transported via SRF-3 in an independent and simultaneous manner as CO3H5.2, we incubated Golgi apparatus-enriched vesicles from S. cerevisiae, which expressed SRF-3, with 2 μm UDP-[14C]Gal alone or with the mixture of 2 μm UDP[14C]Gal and a 10-fold excess (20 μm) UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. Following the incubation, we measured the radioactivity corresponding to each radionuclide within the vesicles. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, the amount of UDP-[14C]Gal entering the vesicles is not significantly affected by the presence of a 10-fold excess of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. In addition, this latter substrate is entering the vesicles at the same rate as if it were the only substrate in the reaction mixture (Fig. 5A). This result resembles the one previously described for transporter CO3H5.2 and suggests that transporter SRF-3, which is closely related to transporter CO3H5.2 in the phylogenetic tree, is also closely related in the manner by which it transports substrates, namely a non-competitive, independent, and simultaneous manner (11Caffaro C.E. Hirschberg C.B. Berninsone P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16176-16181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was important to demonstrate that the experimental design shown above could indicate a competitive mechanism, had it occurred. Accordingly, we next incubated S. cerevisiae Golgi apparatus-enriched vesicles containing the SQV-7 transporter (previously shown via a different approach to have a competitive transport mechanism) with 1 μm UDP-[3H]Gal-NAc alone or with the mixture of 1 μm UDP-[3H]GalNAc and a 10-fold excess (10 μm) of UDP-[14C]GlcA. These are two of the substrates previously shown to be translocated by SQV-7 in a competitive manner (10Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Following incubation with the radiolabeled substrates, we measured the radioactivity corresponding to each radionuclide within vesicles. Fig. 5B shows that the addition of a 10-fold excess of UDP-GlcA when compared with UDP-GalNAc to the reaction mixture decreased by almost 90% the amount of UDP-GalNAc being transported. This experiment corroborates the competitive transport mechanism described previously for SQV-7 using an entirely different approach (10Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The results further demonstrate that the experimental approach used to study the transport mechanism of CO3H5.2 (11Caffaro C.E. Hirschberg C.B. Berninsone P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16176-16181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and SRF-3 (this study) would detect a competitive transport mechanism should it occur. Together, our collective studies suggest the possibility that the competitive transport mechanism exhibited by SQV-7 reflects an evolutionary divergence from that of nucleotide sugar transporters CO3H5.2 and SRF-3. We have obtained evidence for functional redundancy between nucleotide sugar transporters in a multicellular organism and hypothesize this to be a mechanism required to ensure adequate glyco-conjugate formation, which in turn may be necessary for proper tissue development. This requirement might reflect complete redundancy. Both transporters perform exactly the same function, e.g. they translocate the same nucleotide sugar into the same compartment, or alternatively, the transporters may sequentially regulate glycosylation of the same target(s) by translocating different nucleotide sugars or the same nucleotide sugar into different compartments. So far, corresponding changes in glycoconjugates were detected in every instance where mutants defective in nucleotide sugar transport were studied. Unfortunately, such analyses are not feasible in the current study because of the incomplete penetrance of phenotypic defects by RNAi and the lack of a CO3H5.2 mutant. Interestingly, MIG-23, a luminal nucleoside diphosphate phosphatase implicated in the nucleotide sugar transport/antiport cycle (23Nishiwaki K. Kubota Y. Chigira Y. Roy S.K. Suzuki M. Schvarzstein M. Jigami Y. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is required for proper gonad development due to its role in the glycosylation of MIG-17 (24Nishiwaki K. Genetics. 1999; 152: 985-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that mutations that reduce MIG-23 activity and MIG-17 glycosylation (24Nishiwaki K. Genetics. 1999; 152: 985-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) result in gonad abnormalities, similar to CO3H5.2 inactivation of srf-3 mutants, supports our hypothesis that the combined requirement of CO3H5.2 and SRF-3 for proper gonad morphology may be related to their role in regulating glycosylation. Nevertheless, at this time, we cannot completely rule out that a function of these transporters, unrelated to nucleotide sugar transport, may be the immediate cause for the observed phenotype. Although genetic enhancement and functional redundancy have been described for many C. elegans genes (25Appleford P.J. Griffiths M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Chomey E.G. Isaac R.E. Coates D. Hope I.A. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Jarriault S. Greenwald I. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), they have not, to our knowledge, been shown for genes encoding proteins of glycosylation pathways in multicellular organisms. In the present instance, nucleotide sugar transporters CO3H5.2 and SRF-3 share partial substrate and tissue specificity (11Caffaro C.E. Hirschberg C.B. Berninsone P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16176-16181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although srf-3 mutants have no morphological phenotype when grown on E. coli (12Hoflich J. Berninsone P. Gobel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J. Hirschberg C.B. Baumeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30440-30448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and CO3H5.2 RNAi inactivation does not cause visual morphological defects in wild type animals, inactivation of CO3H5.2 in srf-3 animals leads to abnormal gonad morphology and oocyte accumulation in the proximal gonad arms, strongly suggesting genetic enhancement between these transporters. In C. elegans hermaphrodites, each gonad arm adopts a U-shape, resulting from the migration path of the distal tip cells, a process in which, as mentioned above, the glycoprotein MIG-17 is known to play a role (24Nishiwaki K. Genetics. 1999; 152: 985-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ovulation requires the passage of oocytes through the spermatheca, a process that requires integrin INA-1, also a glycoprotein, suggesting an additional possible mechanism for the phenotype observed upon inactivation of CO3H5.2 in srf-3 mutants (27Xu X. Lee D. Shih H.Y. Seo S. Ahn J. Lee M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that several target sites occur downstream of the nucleotide sugar transport, resulting in the described phenotype. C03H5.2 is expressed in the spermatheca, gonad distal tip cell, and body wall muscle (Fig. 2). The phenotypes observed when this transporter is targeted by RNAi might reflect lower transport activity in one or more of these tissues by specifically affecting glycosylation of extracellular or secreted signaling ligand(s) or membrane bound receptor(s). Thus, further studies will be required to determine the specific tissues where functional redundancy occurs and which particular glycoconjugates are subject to this regulation. Inactivation or mutations in only 20–35% of C. elegans genes result in observable visual phenotypes (28Thomas J.H. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 395-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This observation implies that many genes encode proteins with functions that may be fully or partially substituted by the activity of other gene products. Thomas (28Thomas J.H. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 395-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) suggests four different possible reasons for evolution to have maintained genetic redundancy: (a) to increase the quantity of a particular gene product, (b) to ensure high fidelity for some particular process, (c) to preserve non-overlapping functions of the corresponding gene products, or (d) an emergent property that depends on genetic redundant genes. Thus, genetic redundancy between transporters CO3H5.2 and SRF-3 may be understood in terms of any, several, or all of the above selection mechanisms. We had previously characterized SQV-7 as a multisubstrate nucleotide sugar transporter in which substrate translocation occurred via a competitive, non-cooperative mechanism (10Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since then, multisubstrate transporters of nucleotide sugars have been described in several organisms, including Leishmania donovani (29Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol.

In all these instances, a competitive translocation mechanism of substrates has been assumed but not demonstrated. Very recently, a new nucleotide sugar multisubstrate transporter from C. elegans was characterized, CO3H5.2, with a novel, simultaneous, and non-competitive transport mechanism (11Caffaro C.E. Hirschberg C.B. Berninsone P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16176-16181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that SRF-3, another C. elegans multisubstrate transporter, has a translocation mechanism that is similar to the one described for C03H5.2 and different from the one previously shown for SQV-7 (10Berninsone P.

Our collective results regarding different transport mechanisms of the nucleotide sugar transporters of C. elegans raise the intriguing possibility that different nucleotide sugar transport mechanisms may have evolved parallel to the divergent evolution of the transporter proteins themselves in terms of their amino acid sequence. Consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that the phylogenetic tree of the putative nucleotide sugar transporters from the C. elegans genome shows that SRF-3 and C03H5.2 are more closely related from an evolutionary point of view than SQV-7 with the former two. Further support, or lack thereof, for this hypothesis will be obtained as substrate specificities and mechanisms of other C. elegans nucleotide sugar transporters are elucidated."

Kinetic studies carried out in various concentrations of sucrose revealed that both kcat and kcat/Km for either ATP or EtsΔ138 were highlysensitive to solvent viscosity, suggesting that the rapid equilibrium assumption is not valid for the phosphorylation of protein substrate by ERK2. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis with the minimal random Bi Bi reaction mechanism is shown to be inconsistent with the principle of the detailed balance. This inconsistent calculation strongly suggests that there is isomerization of the enzyme-substrate ternary complex. The viscosity-dependent steady-state kinetic data are combined to establish a kinetic mechanism for the ERK2-catalyzed reaction that predicts initial reaction velocities under varying concentrations of ATP and substrate. These results complement previous structure-function studies of mitogen-activated protein kinases and provide important insight for mechanistic interpretation of the kinase functions.

The MAP kinase family comprises the ERK, JNK, and p38 subfamilies of kinases. All participate in three-tier protein phosphorylation cascades that serve to mediate diverse cellular processes. MAP kinase cascades are conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to human. A typical MAP kinase cascade consists of at least three kinases, a MAP kinase, a MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) that activates the MAP kinase, and a MEK kinase that activates the MEK. Although ERKs respond robustly to growth factors and certain hormones, JNK kinases and p38 kinases react primarily to cytokines and stress stimuli. After activation, each MAP kinase phosphorylates a distinct spectrum of substrates, which include key regulatory enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear receptors, regulators of apoptosis, and many transcription factors. Such an array of substrates is consistent with the observation that MAP kinases are involved in many critical cell functions (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv.

Because of their central role in signal transduction, the regulation and function of MAP kinases has been the subject of intense interest since their discovery. The prototypic member of the MAP kinase family is extracellular-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). As a result, abundant molecular biological, biochemical, and structural information has occurred on ERK2. Like all MAP kinases, ERK2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to serine or threonine residues that precede proline (5Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this specificity is critical, further specificity is thought to be conferred through substrate docking domains where interactions are made between ERK2 and the substrate at sites on the enzyme that can lie a considerable distance from the active site (6Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although progress in identifying these sequences and demonstrating their involvement in mediating specificity has advanced our knowledge considerably, precisely how they contribute to regulation and catalysis is still unclear. The mechanism of ERK2-catalyzed reaction has been elucidated by initial velocity and product inhibition studies (8Waas W.F. Dalby K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12532-12540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The substrate used in this study was EtsΔ138, a model protein substrate derived from the N terminus of Ets-1, which is currently the most thoroughly characterized protein substrate of ERK2. As shown by Seidel and Graves (7Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it is an excellent surrogate for the full-length protein. In the presence of MgATP2– and excess Mg2+, ERK2 phosphorylates EtsΔ138 exclusively on Thr-38 to a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol. The kinetic dependence on substrate concentration and product inhibition patterns was consistent with a rapid equilibrium random order ternary complex mechanism. Although product inhibition data are not definitive evidence for a rapid equilibrium mechanism, the approximation of steady-state data to a rapid equilibrium model suggests that the dissociation rate constants from the ternary complex for both substrates must be of greater magnitude than the catalytic constant. On the other hand, Prowse et al. (9Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) employed solvent viscosometric techniques to characterize the catalytic reaction pathway of ERK2 with respect to the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. In this study the investigators showed that the catalytic mechanism for this reaction consists of the diffusion-limited binding of myelin basic protein (k–2 << k3) and the rapid equilibrium binding of ATP k−2'≫k3, followed by phosphoryl group transfer, which is slow in comparison with the release of products. This is in contrast to the kinetic mechanism established for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 by ERK2, in which the dissociation rate constants of EtsΔ138, k–2, is of similar magnitude to the catalytic constant, k3. Furthermore, as ATP binds deep within the active site cleft of protein kinases (10Akamine Madhusudan Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that such binding is prevented when protein substrate is bound. Because the rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism with EB and EP abortive complexes is distinguishable by initial velocity and product inhibition studies from the random addition case, further studies are required to address this point (11Frieden C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 68: 914-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, the enzymatic mechanism of ERK2 is re-examined by a combination of steady-state kinetic studies in the absence and presence of viscosogenic agents. Our results showed that 1) the reaction pathway for the turnover of transcription factor EtsΔ138 occurs through two partially rate-limiting steps: one step correlates with phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 on the enzyme, and the second step is related to product release; 2) the dissociation rate constant of EtsΔ138 is much less than the catalytic constant, and therefore the rapid equilibrium assumption is not valid for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 by ERK2; and 3) the kinetic analysis with the minimal steady-state random mechanism was shown to be inconsistent with the principle of the detailed balance, suggesting that there is isomerization of the enzyme-substrate ternary complex. These results complement previous structure-function studies of MAP kinases and provide important insight for mechanistic interpretation of the kinase functions. Materials-ATP, phospho(enol) pyruvate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced NADH, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, were purchased from Sigma. Sucrose was purchased from Invitrogen. MOPS was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Other reagents were local products of analytical grade used without further purification. Double-deionized water was used throughout. Expression and Purification of Proteins-The plasmid pETHis6-ERK2-MEK1(R4F) (a generous gift of Dr. Melanie Cobb) was used to coexpress a constitutively active MEK1 and an N-terminal His6-tagged ERK2 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expression and purification of bisphosphorylated ERK2 were carried out following the procedure described by Wilsbacher and Cobb (12Wilsbacher J.L. Cobb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After the final fast protein liquid chromatography step, ∼3 mg of ERK2/pTpY were obtained from 6 liters of culture. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the purified ERK2/pTpY was effectively homogenous and was phosphorylated stoichiometrically to a ratio of 2 mol of phosphate/mole of ERK2. Plasmid used to express Ets-1 (1–138) has been reported previously. The N-terminal His6-tagged Ets-1 (EtsΔ138) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using standard procedures of nickel chelate affinity chromatography (13Waas W.F. Dalby K.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein purity was over 90% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified proteins were made to 20% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Enzyme Assays for ERK2-Enzyme activity of ERK2 was determined with the EtsΔ138 as a substrate using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (14Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The standard assay for ERK2 was carried out at 30 °C in 1.8 ml of reaction mixture containing 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μm NADH, 1 mm phospho(enol) pyruvate, 18 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 7.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and different concentrations of substrates. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ERK2 to the reaction mixture. Progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by following the formation of NAD+ at 340 nm, on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 45 spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. The concentrations of ADP formed in ERK2-catalyzed reaction were determined using an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6220 cm–1 m–1 at 340 nm. The concentration of ERK2 was determined spectrophotometrically based on an extinction coefficient (ϵ = 44,825 cm–1m–1) calculated from its primary amino acid sequence and verified by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of EtsΔ138 was determined by turnover with the enzyme under conditions of limiting EtsΔ138 at a fixed low concentration of ATP (17.5 μm). Solvent Viscosometric Studies-Steady-state assays were carried out as described above in buffer containing varied sucrose, corresponding to relative solvent viscosities varying between 1 and 2.92. The relative solvent viscosities (ηrel) were determined from the equation ηrel=(t/t0)(ρ/ρ0) (Eq. 1) where ηrel is the solvent viscosity relative to the buffer containing no viscosogen, t is the solvent transit time measured by an Ostwald capillary viscometer, and ρ is the solvent specific gravity (15Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 1982; Google Scholar). Superscript 0 indicates conditions of the buffer with no viscosogen. Effects of Viscosogens on the Steady-state Kinetic Parameters - Scheme 1 describes the minimal kinetic mechanism for an enzyme-catalyzed two-substrate, two-product reaction, where k3 is the rate constant for the functional group transfer step, k4 the rate constant for products release, E represents enzyme, and A and B represent ATP and the protein substrate, respectively. When the concentration of one substrate is infinite, the enzyme can be treated as “one-substrate” enzyme for kinetic purposes, and the steady-state rate equation at saturating A can be written as follows. v=c2[B][E]0c8+c10[B]=kcatB[B][E]0KmB+[B] (Eq. 2) where kcatB=k3k4k3+k4 (Eq. 3) KmB=k4k3+k4k−2+k3k2 (Eq. 4) Combining Equations 3 and 4, we obtain kcatBKmB=k2k3k−2+k3 (Eq. 5) Because k2, k–2, and k4 are presumed to represent diffusion-controlled processes, these rate constants will be dependent on the relative viscosity of the solvent. A comprehensive explanation of the use of solvent viscosogens in enzymatic analysis is presented by Gutfreund (16Gutfreund H. Kinetic for the Life Sciences. 1995; : 248-261Google Scholar), and its application to protein kinases is reviewed by Adams (17Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The relative solution viscosity (ηrel) can be equated to the ratio of the microscopic rate constants, ηrel=k20/k2=k−20/k−2=k40/k4(Eq. 6) where k20 is the association rate constant of substrate, and k−20 and k40 are the dissociation rate constants of substrate and product, respectively, when ηrel = 1. By taking separately the ratio of Equations 3 and 5 in the absence and presence of viscosogen according to Equation 6, two linear equations are derived upon plotting kcatB0/kcatB and kcat/KmB0/kcat/KmB as a function of ηrel. The slopes of these lines are given by KcatBη=K3K3+K40(Eq. 7) and KcatBKmBη=K3K−20+K3(Eq. 8) Thus, (k(kcatB)η and (kcatB/KmB)η can vary between 0 and 1, the limit of diffusion control. Similarly at high [B] v=C3AE0C9+C11A=KcatAAE0KmA+A(Eq. 9) where KcatA=K3K4K3+K4(Eq. 10) and KmA=K4K3+K4K−2'+K3K2'(Eq. 11) Saturating ATP and Varying EtsΔ138 Concentrations-To characterize the steady-state kinetic properties of ERK2, the kinase activity of ERK2 were measured by following ADP formation using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay. All of the initial velocity studies were carried out using a continuous assay in which the linearity of the initial portion of the reaction profile was carefully monitored. Because the spontaneous ATP hydrolysis by ERK2 occurs in parallel to the phosphorylation reaction, the assays were corrected for the ATPase effect, which is taken as the observed absorption changes in the absence of EtsΔ138. We first attempted to define the diffusion-controlled steps in the catalytic reaction of ERK2 by examining the steady-state phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 in the presence of sucrose. The initial velocity data were collected under conditions of saturating ATP (2.5 mm), varied EtsΔ138, and varied relative solvent viscosities ranging from 1 to 2.92. When the initial velocity data were plotted versus EtsΔ138 concentrations, typical Michaelis-Menten behavior was observed in the absence and presence of the viscosogen. Fig. 1 shows the effect of increasing solvent viscosity on the steady-state kinetic parameters for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 by ERK2. It can be seen from this figure that both kcatB and kcatB/KmB are linear functions of the relative solvent viscosity. The slope of a plot of KcatB0 versus ηrel,(kcatB)η, which indicates the sucrose effect on EtsΔ138 phosphorylation, was determined to be 0.49 ± 0.02. From these values, the rates of product release and phosphoryl group transfer can then be calculated as K40=KcatB0/kcatBη=37.76s−1 and K3=KcatB0/1−kcatBη=36.27s−1, respectively. The dissociation of products, ADP and phospho-EtsΔ138, is combined in K40, and the viscosity method cannot discern which product release step controls K40 without other kinetic experiments. By comparison, a nearly full viscosity effect was observed on kcatB/KmB. The slope of a plot of (kcat/KmB)0/(kcat/KmB) versus ηrel,(kcatB/KmB)η, was determined to be 0.92 ± 0.05. Because the value of k3 is known, the dissociation rate constant of EtsΔ138 to the E-ATP complex can then be calculated as K−20=K31−KcatB/KmB)η/KcatB/KmBη=3.15s−1. The corresponding association rate constant can then be calculated as K20=KcatB/KmB0/KcatB/KmBη=1.90s−1. Saturating EtsΔ138 and Varying ATP Concentrations-We next tested the effect of increased solvent viscosity on the catalytic reaction mechanism when the concentration of ATP was varied and the amount of EtsΔ138 was fixed. The effect of increasing solvent viscosity on the steady-state kinetic parameters for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 by ERK2 is shown in Fig. 2. At saturating EtsΔ138 concentration (440 μm), the viscosity effect on kcat was close ((kcat)η = 0.42 ± 0.01) to that observed when the EtsΔ138 concentration was varied under saturating ATP. Similarly, a partial viscosity effect on kcatA/KmA at high EtsΔ138 concentration was observed ((kcatA/KmA)η = 0.69 ± 0.01). If an ordered mechanism (with ATP binding first) is assumed, the value for kcatA/KmA in such a mechanism would be equal to k1, and the viscosity effect on the parameter would be predicted as (kcatA/KmA)η = 1 at saturating concentrations of EtsΔ138. Our viscosity data, apparently, conflict with such an ordered binding mechanism. Taken together, the results from viscosity experiments are consistent with random addition of ATP and EtsΔ138 to the ERK2 active site. In this model, the substrate ATP combines with the enzyme-EtsΔ138 complex to form the active ternary complex by the second order association rate constant, k2', and the dissociation rate constant, k−2'. Therefore, the association and dissociation rate constants of ATP from the enzyme-EtsΔ138 complex can be estimated as k2'o=KcatA/KmA0/KcatA/KmAη=0.10μM−1S−1 and K−2'o=k3[1−(kcatA/KmA)η]/(kcatA/KmA)η=15.54 s−1, respectively. Note that the full or partial viscosity effects on kcat/Km indicate that the dissociation rates of ATP and EtsΔ138 from the E-ATP-EtsΔ138 complex are not much faster than the phosphoryl group transfer of ATP to the EtsΔ138. Thus, the ERK2-catalyzed reaction has a random, but not truly rapid equilibrium random mechanism. Steady-state Kinetics of the ERK2-catalyzed EtsΔ138 Phosphorylation Reaction-To analyze the kinetic mechanism of ERK2 catalyzed reaction further, 12 data sets of initial velocities were obtained over a wide range of ATP and EtsΔ138 concentrations. Fig. 3 shows double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity versus either EtsΔ138 or ATP concentrations (for clarity, only six data sets are shown). It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the Lineweaver-Burk plots were linear and displayed a nonparallel pattern of intersecting lines. Thus, a ping-pong mechanism (where a parallel line pattern is characteristic) can be excluded from such analysis. As mentioned above, the simplest explanation for the kinetic observation is the random Bi Bi mechanism. It is therefore reasonable to start the analysis of our experimental data with this mechanism first. The exact steady-state rate equation for the general sequential mechanism is too complicated for practical use. As pointed by Dalziel (18Dalziel K. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1958; 545: 1247-1253Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), however, if substrate concentrations are sufficiently small to satisfy conditions of k–1 >> k [B] and k−1'≫k2'A, the intial rate equation for the steady-state random mechanism reduces to the simple form v=K3K4K3+K4E0ABK4K−2+K−2'+K3K−1K−1'+K1K−1'A+K−1K1'BK3+K4K2'K−1K1'+K2K1K−1'+AB(Eq. 12) which is identical to the rate equation obtained by Seubert et al. with the partial equilibrium assumption (19Seubert P.A. Renosto F. Knudson P. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the condition of k–1 >> k2[B] and K−1'≫K2'A is equivalent to the assumption that the binary enzyme-substrate complexes remain in equilibrium with the free enzyme and substrate. Because the values of k3, K40,K20,K−20,K2'0, and K−2'0 have been determined separately by solvent viscosometric analysis, we can fix them to constant values in curve fitting. The data sets of initial velocities were analyzed with Equation 12 by global fitting procedures, and the kinetic parameters were determined to be KA=K−10/K10=32.26±4.22 μm, and KB=K−10/K10=3.57±0.54μM, respectively. However, according to the principle of detailed balance, the rate constants must satisfy the following condition (20Hammes G.G. Thermodynamics and Kinetic for the Biological Sciences. 1995; Google Scholar). K1K2K−2'K−1'=K1'K2'K−2K−1(Eq. 13) or K2K−2'KB=K2'K−2KA(Eq. 14) It is important to confirm that this principle is obeyed whenever reaction cycles are present. Obviously, our kinetic analysis is inconsistent with the principles of detailed balance, and thus, the calculation of rate constants is invalid. Thus, the minimal random mechanism is not applicable to our experimental data. These inconsistent calculations strongly suggest that there is isomerization of the ERK2-EtsΔ138 complex. Kinetic Analysis with an Iso Random Bi Bi Mechanism-The steady-state kinetic data and the effects of solvent viscosity on the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 can be combined to outline a complete kinetic mechanism for the ERK2-catalyzed reaction. Scheme 2 describes the sequential step processing of ATP and EtsΔ138 under all substrate concentrations. The steady-state rate equation at saturating A is given by the following. KcatB=K3K4KcK3Kc+K4Kc+K−c(Eq. 15) KmB=K4KcK−2+K3K2K3Kc+K4Kc+K−c(Eq. 16) and KcatBKmB=K2K3K−2+K3(Eq. 17) Applying the same viscosity constraints as for Equations 15 and 17, the slopes of the viscosity-dependent steady-state kinetic parameters are KcatBη=K3KcK3Kc+K40Kc+K−c(Eq. 18) and kcatBKmBη=k3k−20+k3 (Eq. 19) Because (kcatB)η = 0.49 ± 0.02 and (kcat/KmB)η = 0.92 ± 0.05, the rate constants of product release and substrate association can be calculated as k40=kcatB0/(kcatB)η=37.76±3.83 s−1 and k20=(kcatB0/KmB0)/(kcat/KmB)η=1.90±0.56 s−1, respectively. When substrate B is saturating, we have kcatA=k3k4kck3kc+k4(kc+k−c+k3) (Eq. 20) KmA=K4K−2'K−c+K3+K3KcK2'K3Kc+K4Kc+K−c+K3(Eq. 21) kcatAKmA=K2'K3KcK−2'K−c+K3+K3Kc(Eq. 22) The slopes of the viscosity-dependent steady-state kinetic parameters are given by the following. (kcatA)η=k3kck3kc+k40(kc+k−c+k3)(Eq. 23) kcatAKmAη=k3kcK−2'0K−c+K3+K3Kc(Eq. 24) Similarly, from the value of (kcatA/KmA)η = 0.69 ± 0.01, the association rate constant of ATP can be estimated to be (kcatA/KmA)0/(kcatA/KmA)η = 0.10 ± 0.01 μ–1 s–1. In addition, from Equations 18 and 23, we have the following. 1(kcatA)η−1(kcatB)η=k40kc (Eq. 25) Hence kc=k40(kcatB)η(kcatA)η(kcatB)η−(kcatA)η=111.01±50.43 (Eq. 26) In this case, however, the values of k3, k−2'0, and k−20 cannot be determined directly from the viscosity experiment. Instead, the following relationships between the rate constants can be obtained. k3=kcatB01−(kcatB)ηkc+k−ckc=36.27kc+k−ckc (Eq. 27) k−20=k3{1−(kcatB/KmB)η}(kcatB/KmB)η=0.087k3 (Eq. 28) k−2′0={1−(kcatA/KmA)η}(kcatA/KmA)ηk3kck−c+k3=0.43k3kck−c+k3 (Eq. 29) To determine the values of other kinetic parameters in Scheme 2, the data sets of initial velocities shown in Fig. 3 must be reanalyzed according to the rate equation derived from this model. The minimum assumption that needs to be made to obtain a velocity equation without squared terms is that the reactions forming the EA and EB complexes are at equilibrium. The method of Cha (21Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can then be used to solve for the concentrations of various enzyme species. The resulting expression for the initial rate of reaction as a function of the concentrations of substrates is given by the following. ν=kc[E]0[A][B]α{KAKB+KB[A]+KA[B]}+β[A][B] (Eq. 30) where kc=k3k4k2KBkc+k−2'+k−2'KAKc(Eq. 31) α=k4[k−2'(k−2+k−c+k3)+kc(k−2+k3)] (Eq. 32) β=k2'KA[k4(k−2+k−c+k3)+kc(k3+k4)]+k2KB[k4k−c+(kc+k−2')(k3+k4)] (Eq. 33) The required microscopic reversibility condition for Scheme 2 is then given by the following. KB=k2'k−2kcKAk2k−2'k−c(Eq. 34) Therefore, by substituting Equations 27, 28, 29 and 34 into Equation 30 and treating the parameters, k40,k20,k2'0, and kc as fixed constants, all of the data (12 data sets) were simultaneously analyzed with Equation 30. The resulting family of curves shown in Fig. 3 represents a best fit of the model to all data points simultaneously constrained, from which the kinetic parameters were determined to be KA = 107.21 ± 0.87 μm, and k–c = 3.93 ± 0.07 s–1, respectively. It can be seen from this figure that the experimental data fit very well to this model with standard errors less than 2%, indicating that the proposed model (Scheme 2) satisfactorily described the reaction. Thus, the values of k3, k−20, k−2'0, and KB can be calculated from Equations 27, 28, 29 and 34. All of the kinetic parameters for the mechanism of Scheme 2 are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic constants for phosphorylation of EtsΔ 138 by ERK2Kinetic parameterValueKATP107.21 μmKEtsΔ13812.05 μmK201.90 μm-1 s-1K−203.27 s-1K2'00.10 μm-1 s-1K−2'043.21 s-1kc111.01 s-1k-c3.93 s-1k337.55 s-1K4037.76 s-1 Open table in a new tab It should be indicated that the isomerization step invoked in the reaction pathway of binding the peptide substrate first could be either before (in the binary complex) or after (in the ternary complex) ATP binding. If an intermediate is formed before the central ternary complex, the initial rate equation is first degree with respect to [B] and secondary degree to [A]. It predict that the plots of 1/v versus 1/[B] are linear and plots of 1/v versus 1/[A] are theoretically nonlinear. These random Bi Bi mechanisms can be eliminated readily, because no evidence for this type behavior has been observed. The sequential random two-substrate mechanism is of great importance in enzyme kinetics and has been discussed by several authors (18Dalziel K. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1958; 545: 1247-1253Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Ferdinand W. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Pettersson G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 2717-2726Crossref Google Scholar). A complete steady-state treatment for the random ternary complex mechanism yields a complicated velocity equation containing [A]2, [B]2, [A]2[B], and [A][B]2 terms. It has, in fact, often been stated in the literature that random order mechanisms (with exception for the rapid equilibrium case) always yield nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plots, and a large number of two-substrate enzyme systems have been claimed to operate by a compulsory order or a rapid equilibrium mechanism merely because they obey a hyperbolic type of rate equation. Some years ago, Pettersson (23Pettersson G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 2717-2726Crossref Google Scholar) carried out detailed theoretical studies on random order steady-state systems and showed that the degree to which reciprocal plots deviate from linearity in systems that obey a steady-state random order mechanism will depend on the values of individual rate constants relative to the concentrations of the two substrates. At relatively low substrate concentrations, linear Lineweaver-Burk relationships will always be obtained. Gulbinsky and Cleland (24Gulbinsky J. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 2: 566-575Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have also shown by computer simulation studies of the random order two-substrate mechanism that the initial velocity patterns did not deviate significantly from linearity under some circumstances in which equilibrium conditions did not apply. The present investigation confirmed experimentally that although the dissociation rate for EtsΔ138 (k–2) is 10-fold slower than that for the phosphoryl group transfer step (k3) and therefore the rapid equilibrium assumption is not valid, linear Lineweaver-Burk relationships were indeed observed when the kinetic data of ERK2-catalyzed reaction were plotted in the traditional double-reciprocal forms. A thorough understanding of the mechanism of protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases requires the unambiguous identification of individual kinetic steps comprising the catalytic pathway. In this report we have deduced from the studies of initial velocity and viscosity that ERK2 conforms to an iso random mechanism for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138. All of the rate constant values to each step in the overall kinetic mechanism for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 have been determined from steady-state kinetic data. The concentration of ATP in mammalian cells is ∼1 mm, which is 10-fold higher than the dissociation constant for ATP and the free enzyme, KA (25Gribble F.M. Loussouarn G. Tucker S.J. Zhao C. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30046-30049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, although the mechanism is formally random sequential, there is a preferred binding order under limiting amounts of protein substrate with ATP binding first, because 1 mm ATP is capable of trapping 90% of the free enzyme. However, at higher protein substrate concentrations (say 10-fold higher than KB), binding of the protein substrate as the first substrate is physiological relevant, and ATP binds to form an unproductive enzyme-substrate conformer that can reversibly covert to productive ternary complex. Currently, the molecular details of ERK2-substrate interactions remain unclear, although there is a large body of evidence suggesting that ERK2 facilitates substrate recognition, at least in part, through interactions that are discrete from those at the active site (6Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Because the three-dimensional structure of ERK2 cocrystallized with a protein substrate or substrate analogue has not been solved, there is little mechanistic information available to ultimately correlate the structural data with the substrate recognition properties of this enzyme. Some years ago, Adams and Taylor (26Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) proposed a similar kinetic mechanism for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The x-ray crystal structure of the binary enzyme-peptide complex of the catalytic subunit of cAPK indicates that ATP binds deep within the active site groove with peptide directly lining the periphery. Therefore, they concluded that ATP prebinding directs the productive association of substrate, and in the presence of a large substrate pool, bound peptide substrate adjusts its conformation upon ATP binding to position the γ phosphate for delivery. It is likely that ERK2 has properties similar to those of the catalytic subunit of cAPK."

A reduced probability of transcript abortion at RNA lengths of 6 and 7 nucleotides and a lower ratio of abortive to productive initiation events was observed for some discontinuous templates, consistent with models attributing abortive initiation to the accumulation of strain in the initiating complex. The effect of DNA discontinuity on abortion of shorter RNA transcripts (2–3 nucleotides) was less pronounced; abortion at these short chain lengths may primarily be attributed to the low stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid. Certain discontinuities had significant effects on the intrinsic catalytic capacity of the open complex and also on the partitioning between productive and unproductive complexes, suggesting that subtle changes in the conformation of the open complex can profoundly affect its function. The rate and efficiency of promoter escape were not correlated with the stability of the open promoter complex despite previous suggestions to the contrary. We conclude that the stability of the open promoter complex is only one of several factors that contribute to the overall rate of promoter escape.

We conclude that the stability of the open promoter complex is only one of several factors that contribute to the overall rate of promoter escape. Transcription, the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA, is the first and central step of gene expression and regulation. To begin transcription, RNA polymerase must locate a promoter site on the DNA and bind sequence specifically to form an open promoter complex (EPo) poised to begin RNA synthesis. The process of RNA chain initiation and promoter escape achieves the conversion of the open promoter complex into a stably elongating complex, which transcribes processively until reaching a termination signal in the DNA template. A phenomenon known as abortive initiation accompanies RNA chain initiation. Abortive initiation appears to be a universally conserved process among all RNA polymerases that have been studied in vitro (for review, see Ref. 1Vo N.V. Hsu L.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3798-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this process RNA polymerase undergoes multiple rounds of synthesis of short oligonucleotides immediately after the start of transcription while maintaining contact with the promoter region.

Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Hansen U.M. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9564-9570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this point RNA polymerase extends its footprint downstream, relinquishes many upstream contacts with the promoter, and either ejects the σ factor or retains it with lower affinity than in the ITC (4Bar-Nahum G. Nudler E. Cell. 2001; 106: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Mukhopadhyay J. Kapanidis A.N. Mekler V. Kortkhonjia E. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The result is a reduction in the size of the footprint to 35–40 bp. This physical movement of RNA polymerase away from the promoter is referred to as promoter escape. Upon promoter escape, the polymerase achieves the stability and processivity that are the hallmarks of the mature elongation complex. Abortive initiation and promoter escape comprise a complex series of events whose properties vary from promoter to promoter and depend on DNA sequences in the promoter recognition region as well as the initial transcribed region (6Hsu L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To explain the differences that have been observed in initiation behavior between promoters, biochemical and structural features of the relevant transcription complexes must be considered. For example, the necessity of breaking contacts between RNA polymerase and the promoter in order to complete the transition to stable elongation has led to the suggestion that unusually strong protein-DNA interactions in the promoter complex may interfere with promoter escape. This prediction has been supported by a number of experimental observations (1Vo N.V. Hsu L.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3798-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Ellinger T. Behnke D. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Different promoter complexes may also vary in the conformation of the polymerase's active site in ways that affect the inherent capacity for catalyzing the synthesis of the initial phosphodiester bond in the RNA transcript (9Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly apparent (10Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Vo N.V. Hsu L.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3787-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that two distinct types of open promoter complex can be formed at a given promoter, one that is capable of promoter escape (and therefore, productive synthesis) and one that is not, and that the relative proportions of these two types of complexes varies from promoter to promoter. In previous work (12Levin J.R. Blake J.J. Ganunis R.A. Tullius T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6885-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) we explored the roles of specific template nucleosides in the process of promoter escape by E. coli RNA polymerase at the T7 A1 promoter. This study used template populations containing random gaps (“missing nucleosides”) that had been generated by hydroxyl radical treatment of the DNA template (13Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase was allowed to bind to the gapped templates and then was challenged to initiate transcription and form a stable ternary elongation complex (TEC) in the presence of a limited set of nucleotide substrates. Using native gel electrophoresis, TECs were separated from complexes that retained the mobility of an open promoter complex. The resulting populations of gapped DNA were examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis to determine the effect of particular single-nucleoside gaps on the partitioning between these two types of complexes (summarized in Fig. 1). The missing nucleoside technique has traditionally been used to study the effects of removal of particular DNA nucleosides on static protein-DNA interactions. The use of this technique to study transcription initiation and promoter escape adds an important dimension, as the polymerase must move relative to the DNA during these processes and is thought to do so by reeling downstream DNA into itself by a “scrunching” mechanism (6Hsu L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Hsu L.M. Cobb I.M. Ozmore J.R. Khoo M. Nahm G. Xia L. Bao Y. Ahn C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8841-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Kapanidis A.N. Margeat E. Ho S.O. Kortkhonjia E. Weiss S. Ebright R.H. Science. 2006; 314: 1144-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). By affecting the flexibility of the DNA and thereby the amount of strain that is accumulated during this putative scrunching process, a missing nucleoside in the DNA template or nontemplate strand may have effects on initiation and promoter escape that relate more to the physical discontinuity in the DNA than to the loss of interactions due to a missing nucleoside. Such information may be revealing in terms of our understanding of these processes. As a result of the missing nucleoside study we identified several template positions that affect promoter escape. The transition from the open promoter complex to the TEC is a multi-step process though, and our previous experiments provided no information on which step is affected by a particular nucleoside gap. We now have constructed templates that are specifically gapped at positions of interest for the promoter escape process. Here we characterize transcription initiation on these templates to elucidate in more detail the mechanisms accounting for the effects of discontinuous templates on transcription that we observed in our previous study. RNA Polymerase—E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) with a His6 tag at the C terminus of the β′ subunit was purified from strain RL712 (R. Landick) by the method of Uptain (16Uptain S.M. Structural and Functional Characterization of Escherichia coli RNA Polymerase Ternary Complexes during Transcript Elongation and Termination. 1997; (Doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, CA)Google Scholar). The preparations we used contained ∼35–50% active molecules, assayed as described (17Chamberlin M.J. Nierman W.C. Wiggs J. Neff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10061-10069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Templates—Templates used in these experiments contained the T7A1 promoter for RNA polymerase binding and transcription initiation. Gapped or nicked templates were generated by annealing three oligonucleotides as described (12Levin J.R. Blake J.J. Ganunis R.A. Tullius T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6885-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides were purchased from Gene Link (Hawthorne, NY). NT-60+40 and T-60+40 refer to the nontemplate and the template strands spanning positions –60 to +40 relative to the transcription start site of +1, respectively, of plasmid pAR1707 (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 503-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). An intact control DNA template was constructed by annealing NT-60+40 with T-60+40. Shorter oligonucleotides used for construction of singly nicked or gapped templates were complementary to part of the 100-mer NT-60+40 or 100-mer T-60+40. For singly gapped templates, oligonucleotide termini flanking the gap were phosphorylated; for nicked templates, a 3′ hydroxyl and a 5′ phosphate flanked the nick. For templates containing a gap in the UP element (19Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the upstream end of the template extended to position –70 on both DNA strands. Annealing reactions were carried out as previously described (12Levin J.R. Blake J.J. Ganunis R.A. Tullius T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6885-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) followed by purification of the annealed templates on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel. Template nomenclature is as follows, g for gapped or n for nicked followed by the strand (T for template strand, NT for nontemplate strand) containing the discontinuity followed by the position of the discontinuity relative to the start site (+1) of transcription. For gapped templates, the position of the discontinuity refers to the nucleotide that is missing in that template. For nicked templates nNT-3, nNT-10, and nNT+1, the nick was positioned 3′ to the indicated nucleotide; for nicked templates nT-3 and nT-10, the nick was positioned 5′ to the indicated nucleotide. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay of EPo Stability—Open promoter complexes were allowed to form by mixing 10 nm RNA polymerase with 4 nm DNA template for 10 min at 37 °C in a buffer consisting of 44 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 14 mm MgCl2, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5% glycerol, and 40 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. Before the addition of RNAP, a 5-μl aliquot was removed to serve as a free DNA control sample. After formation, the open promoter complex was challenged by adding 50 μg/ml heparin. After EPo formation and at various times after heparin addition, a 5-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and mixed with sucrose loading buffer (60% sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% xylene cyanol) and immediately loaded onto a running native 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio of 37.5:1) at 20 °C. The gel was run at 250 V for 1.5 h until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was dried and imaged using a GE Healthcare Storm PhosphorImager. Single-round Run-off RNA Synthesis Assay—EPo stability also was assayed by quantitation of single-round run-off RNA synthesized by EPo at various times after heparin challenge. Open promoter complexes were prepared and challenged with heparin, as described above. At various times after heparin addition, transcription was initiated by adding a substrate mixture containing 50 μm each of [γ-32P]ATP (750 cpm/pmol), CTP, UTP, and GTP. After incubating for 5 min at 37 °C, transcription was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (80% (v/v) deionized formamide, 50 mm Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). 5′-Radiolabeled RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing 23% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide, 7 m urea). The gel was run at 65 watts for 4.5 h using a salt gradient buffer system (20Sheen J.Y. Seed B. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar) until the xylene cyanol dye migrated 19 cm in the gel. The gel was dried and phosphorimaged. Dinucleotide Synthesis Assay—The intrinsic initiation rate and the fraction of unproductive complexes were measured using a pppApU synthesis assay as described by Vo et al. (11Vo N.V. Hsu L.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3787-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Magnetic Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose beads (Qiagen) were prewashed 3 times in washing buffer (44 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8), 14 mm MgCl2, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol). His-tagged RNA polymerase (10 nm) and DNA template (4 nm) were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 15 min at 37 °C. Partitioning of open promoter complexes into halted ternary elongation complexes and unproductive complexes was carried out by the addition of an initiation mixture containing 100 μm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and ApU. After 10 min at 37 °C, free nucleotides were removed by four washes with washing buffer. Synthesis of the pppApU dinucleotide was then initiated by adding a mixture of 200 μm ATP and 50 μm [α-32P]UTP (400 cpm/pmol). At various time intervals, samples were removed, mixed with an equal volume of formamide loading buffer, and subsequently analyzed by electrophoresis on a 23% denaturing gel (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). To assay the total rate of pppApU synthesis (from productive and unproductive transcription complexes), the same procedure as described above was followed but without nucleotides present during the “partitioning” process. The fraction of unproductive complex was derived by taking the ratio of the rates of pppApU synthesis by unproductive initiation complexes versus total initiation complexes. Steady State Transcription Reactions—RNA polymerase (2 pmol) and DNA (3 pmol) were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of a buffer containing 190 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. Reactions were initiated by adding a mixture of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (14 cpm/fmol), GTP, CTP, and UTP. At various time intervals aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal amount of formamide loading buffer and subsequently analyzed by electrophoresis on a 23% denaturing gel (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The steady state parameters described by Hsu and coworkers (21Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were derived from these data. The abortive rate is the sum of the rates of synthesis of all abortive transcripts (from 2 to 9 nt long on these templates). The productive rate is the rate of synthesis of all productive RNA molecules. The abortive probability, defined as the probability that a transcript will abort rather than extend to the next position, can be calculated using the following equation (21Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where Pi is the probability of aborting transcription at the ith position, and Xi is the percent yield of transcript at the ith position at the 10-min time point. Pi=Xi100%-∑2i-1Xi×100%(Eq. 1) Steady State Transcriptional Analysis of Specifically Gapped Templates—The results of our previous missing nucleoside analysis for both strands of the T7A1 promoter and its initial transcribed region (12Levin J.R. Blake J.J. Ganunis R.A. Tullius T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6885-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) are summarized in Fig. 1. This figure depicts the ability of open promoter complexes formed on templates gapped at various nucleoside positions in comparison to those formed on an intact template to escape the promoter and form a stable TEC. Negative values represent gaps that interfere with promoter escape; positive values denote gaps that enhance escape. We chose gaps at positions –3 and –10 (both template and nontemplate strands) and +1 (nontemplate strand) for in-depth study as representatives of two classes of gaps, those that interfere with and those that enhance promoter escape. Gray bars in the histograms shown in Fig. 1 indicate these positions. We also chose for analysis two gaps in the UP element region (19Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) that strongly interfere with promoter escape, –53 on the nontemplate strand and –55 on the template strand (not shown in Fig. 1). Templates were assembled from sets of three oligonucleotides, one intact strand spanning the region from –60 to +40 relative to the T7 A1 promoter (Fig. 1C; templates for the –53 and –55 UP element gap positions extended to –70) and two segments of the other strand spanning the same region and flanking the desired nucleoside gap position. Oligonucleotide termini flanking the gap were phosphorylated to mimic the predominant product of hydroxyl radical treatment, i.e. a missing nucleoside flanked by phosphate groups (23Balasubramanian B. Pogozelski W.K. Tullius T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9738-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These templates were then used in steady state transcription assays to measure several parameters that characterize the process of RNA chain initiation and promoter escape (22Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These experiments involve the visualization and quantitation of abortive and productive transcripts that accumulate over time in multiple rounds of transcription under steady state conditions. The pattern of RNA species produced during steady state transcription displayed distinct characteristics for each gapped template despite all of these templates having been derived from the same intact nucleotide sequence. This is visually evident in the gel electrophoretic patterns of the RNA products (Fig. 2A) and is confirmed in the quantitative parameters that were derived from these patterns (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The rate of abortive synthesis varied over a 15-fold range among the gapped templates, with the highest rate being only one-third that observed for the intact template. The rate of productive synthesis varied over more than a 100-fold range, with only the gNT+1 template (see “Experimental Procedures” for template nomenclature) having a rate higher than the intact template. It is notable that of the templates we chose to investigate, only this one showed enhanced TEC formation in the previous study (12Levin J.R. Blake J.J. Ganunis R.A. Tullius T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6885-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The ratio of abortive to productive transcription (APR) varied over an ∼15-fold range (Table 1); here it is notable that whereas three of the gapped templates (gNT-3, gNT-10, and gNT+1) showed a higher efficiency of promoter escape (as measured by a low value of APR) than the intact template under these steady state conditions, only one of these (gNT+1) had a positive effect in the previous study (12Levin J.R.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for a discussion of this parameter). All templates showed the greatest abortive probability after synthesis of dinucleotide- and trinucleotide-length transcripts (Fig. 2B). The greatest variation among templates was in the probability of aborting transcripts in the 4–7-nucleotide size range. Vo et al. (1Vo N.V. Hsu L.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3798-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggest that most promoters pose two significant barriers to escape by RNA polymerase, one at 2–4 nucleotides and a second at 6–9 nucleotides. In agreement with this pattern, the intact T7 A1 template showed the highest abortive probability at positions 2, 3, 6, and 7. Comparing the behavior of the gapped templates to the intact template at these barriers (see Table 1), gNT-3 has slightly reduced abortive probability at the 2–3 barrier, whereas gT-3 has significantly higher abortive probability at this barrier. At the 6–7 barrier, templates gNT-3, gT-3, gNT-10, and gNT+1 all have lower abortive probabilities than the intact template, whereas gNT-53 has high abortive probability (in fact throughout the 4–7 nucleotide range). Only template gT-10 had an abortive probability profile that resembled that of intact template, although it had slightly reduced abortive probability at the 6–7 barrier. Percentage of Unproductive Complexes Varies among Gapped Templates—We set out to measure for each gapped template the fraction of binary complexes that was capable of productive RNA synthesis. We used the method described by Vo et al. (11Vo N.V. Hsu L.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3787-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in which only the first two nucleotide substrates, ATP and UTP, are provided. The rate of dinucleotide synthesis in the total RNA polymerase population is compared with that in a population in which only unproductive complexes are capable of dinucleotide synthesis because productive complexes have been allowed to transcribe out to template position 20 in the presence of a limited set of unlabeled nucleotide substrates. We see two distinct and independent types of effect (Fig. 3, Table 1). Results of the dinucleotide synthesis assay for the intact template and for one gapped template, gT-10, are shown in Fig. 3. First, some templates have a significantly lower rate of overall dinucleotide synthesis than the intact template. This effect is greater for gaps on the template strand than on the nontemplate strand (compare gT-3 to gNT-3 and gT-10 to gNT-10) and is most profound when the gap is very close to the transcription start site (i.e. gT-3 has a 20-fold reduced dinucleotide synthesis rate compared with intact template). Only one gapped template (gNT+1) had a dinucleotide synthesis rate significantly higher than the intact template. Hydroxyl radical footprinting of the open promoter complex on this template suggests that the region near the start of transcription on the template strand is more solvent-accessible in this complex than in the complex with intact template (data not shown). Second, some gapped templates (gT-3, gT-10, gNT-53, gT-55) generate a noticeably higher proportion of unproductive complexes than the intact template. Among the gapped templates studied, only gNT+1 makes a lower proportion of unproductive complexes (which is already quite low, 4%, for the intact template); again, it is interesting to note that this template was the only one in the group that displayed enhanced TEC formation in our previous missing nucleoside experiment (12Levin J.R. Blake J.J. Ganunis R.A. Tullius T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6885-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). EPo Stability Varies among Templates but Does Not Necessarily Correlate with Promoter Escape Efficiency—We used two methods to measure the stability of the open promoter complexes formed on the gapped templates, one that directly observed binary complexes by native gel electrophoresis (24Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and one that indirectly quantitated these complexes by measuring their capacity for run-off transcription (25Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) at various times after a heparin challenge. Results were similar using the two methods. Data obtained using the native gel electrophoresis method are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Of the gapped templates, only gNT-53 and gT-55 supported formation of complexes whose stability (t½ < 5 min) was in the same range as those formed on the intact template. Other gapped templates (gNT-10, gT-10) formed complexes that were somewhat more stable than those on the intact template. Open promoter complexes formed on three of the gapped templates (gNT+1, gNT-3, gT-3) were greatly stabilized relative to complexes formed on the intact template. Interestingly, these latter three templates did not all exhibit a high value for the APR as might be expected. Rather, gNT+1 and gNT-3 both had APR values lower than the intact template; furthermore, gNT+1 had a productive rate slightly hi"
https://openalex.org/W1994021971,"The correct stereochemistry of prostaglandins is a prerequisite of their biological activity and thus is under a strict enzymatic control. Recently, we cloned and characterized two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms in the coral Plexaura homomalla that share 97% amino acid sequence identity, yet form prostaglandins with opposite stereochemistry at carbon 15. The difference in oxygenation specificity is only partially accounted for by the single amino acid substitution in the active site (Ile or Val at position 349). For further elucidation of residues involved in the C-15 stereocontrol, a series of sequence swapping and site-directed mutagenesis experiments between 15R- and 15S-COX were performed. Our results show that the change in stereochemistry at carbon 15 of prostaglandins relates mainly to five amino acid substitutions on helices 5 and 6 of the coral COX. In COX proteins, these helices form a helix-turn-helix motif that traverses through the entire protein, contributing to the second shell of residues around the oxygenase active site; it constitutes the most highly conserved region where even slight changes result in loss of catalytic activity. The finding that this region is among the least conserved between the P. homomalla 15S- and 15R-specific COX further supports its significance in maintaining the desired prostaglandin stereochemistry at C-15. The results are particularly remarkable because, based on its strong conservation, the conserved middle of helix 5 is considered as central to the core structure of peroxidases, of which COX proteins are derivatives. Now we show that the same parts of the protein are involved in the control of oxygenation with 15R or 15S stereospecificity in the dioxygenase active site."
