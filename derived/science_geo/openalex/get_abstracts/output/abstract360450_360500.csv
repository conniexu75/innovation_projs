https://openalex.org/W2004538934,"The failure of axons to regenerate is a major obstacle for functional recovery after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Removing extracellular inhibitory molecules results in limited axon regeneration in vivo. To test for the role of intrinsic impediments to axon regrowth, we analyzed cell growth control genes using a virus-assisted in vivo conditional knockout approach. Deletion of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes robust axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. In wild-type adult mice, the mTOR activity was suppressed and new protein synthesis was impaired in axotomized RGCs, which may contribute to the regeneration failure. Reactivating this pathway by conditional knockout of tuberous sclerosis complex 1, another negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, also leads to axon regeneration. Thus, our results suggest the manipulation of intrinsic growth control pathways as a therapeutic approach to promote axon regeneration after CNS injury."
https://openalex.org/W1981733710,"A record from Wanxiang Cave, China, characterizes Asian Monsoon (AM) history over the past 1810 years. The summer monsoon correlates with solar variability, Northern Hemisphere and Chinese temperature, Alpine glacial retreat, and Chinese cultural changes. It was generally strong during Europe's Medieval Warm Period and weak during Europe's Little Ice Age, as well as during the final decades of the Tang, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, all times that were characterized by popular unrest. It was strong during the first several decades of the Northern Song Dynasty, a period of increased rice cultivation and dramatic population increase. The sign of the correlation between the AM and temperature switches around 1960, suggesting that anthropogenic forcing superseded natural forcing as the major driver of AM changes in the late 20th century."
https://openalex.org/W2001206796,"A number of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) epigenetically silence genes through unknown mechanisms. The Air ncRNA is imprinted—monoallelically expressed from the paternal allele. Air is required for allele-specific silencing of the cis-linked Slc22a3, Slc22a2 , and Igf2r genes in mouse placenta. We show that Air interacts with the Slc22a3 promoter chromatin and the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a in placenta. Air accumulates at the Slc22a3 promoter in correlation with localized H3K9 methylation and transcriptional repression. Genetic ablation of G9a results in nonimprinted, biallelic transcription of Slc22a3 . Truncated Air fails to accumulate at the Slc22a3 promoter, which results in reduced G9a recruitment and biallelic transcription. Our results suggest that Air , and potentially other large ncRNAs, target repressive histone-modifying activities through molecular interaction with specific chromatin domains to epigenetically silence transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2083263204,"Cryptochromes (CRY) are photolyase-like blue-light receptors that mediate light responses in plants and animals. How plant cryptochromes act in response to blue light is not well understood. We report here the identification and characterization of the Arabidopsis CIB1 (cryptochrome-interacting basic-helix-loop-helix) protein. CIB1 interacts with CRY2 (cryptochrome 2) in a blue light–specific manner in yeast and Arabidopsis cells, and it acts together with additional CIB1-related proteins to promote CRY2-dependent floral initiation. CIB1 binds to G box (CACGTG) in vitro with a higher affinity than its interaction with other E-box elements (CANNTG). However, CIB1 stimulates FT messenger RNA expression, and it interacts with chromatin DNA of the FT gene that possesses various E-box elements except G box. We propose that the blue light–dependent interaction of cryptochrome(s) with CIB1 and CIB1-related proteins represents an early photoreceptor signaling mechanism in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1985969995,"Can we decipher speech content (“what” is being said) and speaker identity (“who” is saying it) from observations of brain activity of a listener? Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with a data-mining algorithm and retrieve what and whom a person is listening to from the neural fingerprints that speech and voice signals elicit in the listener's auditory cortex. These cortical fingerprints are spatially distributed and insensitive to acoustic variations of the input so as to permit the brain-based recognition of learned speech from unknown speakers and of learned voices from previously unheard utterances. Our findings unravel the detailed cortical layout and computational properties of the neural populations at the basis of human speech recognition and speaker identification."
https://openalex.org/W2006592554,"Hot electrons in semiconductors lose their energy very quickly (within picoseconds) to lattice vibrations. Slowing this energy loss could prove useful for more efficient photovoltaic or infrared devices. With their well-separated electronic states, quantum dots should display slow relaxation, but other mechanisms have made it difficult to observe. We report slow intraband relaxation (&gt;1 nanosecond) in colloidal quantum dots. The small cadmium selenide (CdSe) dots, with an intraband energy separation of ∼0.25 electron volts, are capped by an epitaxial zinc selenide (ZnSe) shell. The shell is terminated by a CdSe passivating layer to remove electron traps and is covered by ligands of low infrared absorbance (alkane thiols) at the intraband energy. We found that relaxation is markedly slowed with increasing ZnSe shell thickness."
https://openalex.org/W1980073515,"A major barrier to regenerating axons after injury in the mammalian central nervous system is an unfavorable milieu. Three proteins found in myelin—Nogo, MAG, and OMgp—inhibit axon regeneration in vitro and bind to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Nogo receptor (NgR). However, genetic deletion of NgR has only a modest disinhibitory effect, suggesting that other binding receptors for these molecules probably exist. With the use of expression cloning, we have found that paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), which has been implicated in nervous system plasticity, is a high-affinity receptor for Nogo, MAG, and OMgp. Interfering with PirB activity, either with antibodies or genetically, partially rescues neurite inhibition by Nogo66, MAG, OMgp, and myelin in cultured neurons. Blocking both PirB and NgR activities leads to near-complete release from myelin inhibition. Our results implicate PirB in mediating regeneration block, identify PirB as a potential target for axon regeneration therapies, and provide an explanation for the similar enhancements of visual system plasticity in PirB and NgR knockout mice."
https://openalex.org/W2024543003,"The abundance of cellular proteins is determined largely by the rate of transcription and translation coupled with the stability of individual proteins. Although we know a great deal about global transcript abundance, little is known about global protein stability. We present a highly parallel multiplexing strategy to monitor protein turnover on a global scale by coupling flow cytometry with microarray technology to track the stability of individual proteins within a complex mixture. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by measuring the stability of ∼8000 human proteins and identifying proteasome substrates. The technology provides a general platform for proteome-scale analysis of protein turnover under various physiological and disease conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2032306298,"Fat metabolism, reproduction, and aging are intertwined regulatory axes; however, the mechanism by which they are coupled remains poorly understood. We found that germline stem cells (GSCs) actively modulate lipid hydrolysis in Caenorhabditis elegans , which in turn regulates longevity. GSC arrest promotes systemic lipolysis via induction of a specific fat lipase. Subsequently, fat mobilization is promoted and life span is prolonged. Constitutive expression of this lipase in fat storage tissue generates lean and long-lived animals. This lipase is a key factor in the lipid hydrolysis and increased longevity that are induced by decreased insulin signaling. These results suggest a link between C. elegans fat metabolism and longevity."
https://openalex.org/W1989067983,"The termination of protein synthesis occurs through the specific recognition of a stop codon in the A site of the ribosome by a release factor (RF), which then catalyzes the hydrolysis of the nascent protein chain from the P-site transfer RNA. Here we present, at a resolution of 3.5 angstroms, the crystal structure of RF2 in complex with its cognate UGA stop codon in the 70S ribosome. The structure provides insight into how RF2 specifically recognizes the stop codon; it also suggests a model for the role of a universally conserved GGQ motif in the catalysis of peptide release."

https://openalex.org/W2064675942,"Using an inverse mantle convection model that assimilates seismic structure and plate motions, we reconstruct Farallon plate subduction back to 100 million years ago. Models consistent with stratigraphy constrain the depth dependence of mantle viscosity and buoyancy, requiring that the Farallon slab was flat lying in the Late Cretaceous, consistent with geological reconstructions. The simulation predicts that an extensive zone of shallow-dipping subduction extended beyond the flat-lying slab farther east and north by up to 1000 kilometers. The limited region of flat subduction is consistent with the notion that subduction of an oceanic plateau caused the slab to flatten. The results imply that seismic images of the current mantle provide more constraints on past tectonic events than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1989162757,"After learning, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) gradually comes to modulate the expression of memories that initially depended on the hippocampus. We show that during this consolidation period, neural firing in the mPFC becomes selective for the acquired memories. After acquisition of memory associations, neuron populations in the mPFC of rats developed sustained activity during the interval between two paired stimuli, but reduced activity during the corresponding interval between two unpaired stimuli. These new patterns developed over a period of several weeks after learning, with and without continued conditioning trials. Thus, in agreement with a central tenet of consolidation theory, acquired associations initiate subsequent, gradual processes that result in lasting changes of the mPFC's code, without continued training."
https://openalex.org/W2039562024,"Disposable plasticware such as test tubes, pipette tips, and multiwell assay or culture plates are used routinely in most biological research laboratories. Manufacturing of plastics requires the inclusion of numerous chemicals to enhance stability, durability, and performance. Some lubricating (slip) agents, exemplified by oleamide, also occur endogenously in humans and are biologically active, and cationic biocides are included to prevent bacterial colonization of the plastic surface. We demonstrate that these manufacturing agents leach from laboratory plasticware into a standard aqueous buffer, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methanol and can have profound effects on proteins and thus on results from bioassays of protein function. These findings have far-reaching implications for the use of disposable plasticware in biological research."
https://openalex.org/W2076243370,"At geological time scales, the role of continental erosion in the organic carbon (OC) cycle is determined by the balance between recent OC burial and petrogenic OC oxidation. Evaluating its net effect on the concentration of carbon dioxide and dioxygen in the atmosphere requires the fate of petrogenic OC to be assessed. Here, we report a multiscale (nanometer to micrometer) structural characterization of petrogenic OC in the Himalayan system. We show that graphitic carbon is preserved and buried in marine sediments, while the less graphitized forms are oxidized during fluvial transport. Radiocarbon dating indicates that 30 to 50% of the carbon initially present in the Himalayan rocks is conserved during the erosion cycle. Graphitization during metamorphism thus stabilizes carbon in the crust over geological time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2076229820,"Mitochondrial dysfunction was reported in schizophrenia, bipolar disorderand major depression. The present study investigated whether mitochondrial complex I abnormalities show disease-specific characteristics.mRNA and protein levels of complex I subunits NDUFV1, NDUFV2 and NADUFS1, were assessed in striatal and lateral cerebellar hemisphere postmortem specimens and analyzed together with our previous data from prefrontal and parieto-occipital cortices specimens of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and healthy subjects. A disease-specific anatomical pattern in complex I subunits alterations was found. Schizophrenia-specific reductions were observed in the prefrontal cortex and in the striatum. The depressed group showed consistent reductions in all three subunits in the cerebellum. The bipolar group, however, showed increased expression in the parieto-occipital cortex, similar to those observed in schizophrenia, and reductions in the cerebellum, yet less consistent than the depressed group.These results suggest that the neuroanatomical pattern of complex I pathology parallels the diversity and similarities in clinical symptoms of these mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2100547839,"Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis regulates all aspects of cellular function, and defects in this process are associated with human diseases. The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase–substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitin field. We established and applied genetic technologies that combine global protein stability (GPS) profiling and genetic perturbation of E3 activity to screen for substrates of the Skp1–cullin–F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase in mammalian cells. Among the &gt;350 potential substrates identified, we found most known SCF targets and many previously unknown substrates involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, and signaling pathways. Exploring cell cycle–stage stability, we found that several substrates used the SCF and other E3s in different cell cycle stages. Our results demonstrate the potential of these technologies as general platforms for the global discovery of E3-substrate regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W1971889528,"In the past 50 years, biologists have learned a tremendous amount about human brain function and its genetic basis. At the same time, political scientists have been intensively studying the effect of the social and institutional environment on mass political attitudes and behaviors. However, these separate fields of inquiry are subject to inherent limitations that may only be resolved through collaboration across disciplines. We describe recent advances and argue that biologists and political scientists must work together to advance a new science of human nature."
https://openalex.org/W2069735943,"We determined model ages of mare deposits on the farside of the Moon on the basis of the crater frequency distributions in 10-meter-resolution images obtained by the Terrain Camera on SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) (Kaguya). Most mare volcanism that formed mare deposits on the lunar farside ceased at â¼3.0 billion years ago, suggesting that mare volcanism on the Moon was markedly reduced globally during this period. However, several mare deposits at various locations on the lunar farside also show a much younger age, clustering at â¼2.5 billion years ago. These young ages indicate that mare volcanism on the lunar farside lasted longer than was previously considered and may have occurred episodically."
https://openalex.org/W2125489894,"The regulatory protein NsrR, a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription repressors, is specifically dedicated to sensing nitric oxide (NO) in a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. It has been proposed that NO directly modulates NsrR activity by interacting with a predicted [Fe-S] cluster in the NsrR protein, but no experimental evidence has been published to support this hypothesis. Here we report the purification of NsrR from the obligate aerobe Streptomyces coelicolor. We demonstrate using UV-visible, near UV CD and EPR spectroscopy that the protein contains an NO-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster when purified from E. coli. Upon exposure of NsrR to NO, the cluster is nitrosylated, which results in the loss of DNA binding activity as detected by bandshift assays. Removal of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to generate apo-NsrR also resulted in loss of DNA binding activity. This is the first demonstration that NsrR contains an NO-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster that is required for DNA binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W2052749010,"Caloric restriction (CR) can extend longevity and modulate the features of obesity-related metabolic and vascular diseases. However, the functional roles of CR in regulation of revascularization in response to ischemia have not been examined. Here we investigated whether CR modulates vascular response by employing a murine hindlimb ischemia model. Wild-type (WT) mice were randomly divided into two groups that were fed either ad libitum (AL) or CR (65% of the diet consumption of AL). Four weeks later, mice were subjected to unilateral hindlimb ischemic surgery. Body weight of WT mice fed CR (CR-WT) was decreased by 26% compared with WT mice fed AL (AL-WT). Revascularization of ischemic hindlimb relative to the contralateral limb was accelerated in CR-WT compared with AL-WT as evaluated by laser Doppler blood flow and capillary density analyses. CR-WT mice had significantly higher plasma levels of the fat-derived hormone adiponectin compared with AL-WT mice. In contrast to WT mice, CR did not affect the revascularization of ischemic limbs of adiponectin-deficient (APN-KO) mice. CR stimulated the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) in the ischemic limbs of WT mice. CR increased plasma adiponectin levels in eNOS-KO mice but did not stimulate limb perfusion in this strain. CR-WT mice showed enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in ischemic muscle, and administration of AMPK inhibitor compound C abolished CR-induced increase in limb perfusion and eNOS phosphorylation in WT mice. Our observations indicate that CR can promote revascularization in response to tissue ischemia via an AMPK-eNOS-dependent mechanism that is mediated by adiponectin.

These conditions lead to increased vulnerability to ischemic injury and impaired wound healing and promote the progression of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, therapeutic approaches that enhance revascularization could be beneficial for ischemic vascular disease.

However, the consequences of CR on vascular responses to tissue ischemia have not been examined. Adipose tissue secretes a variety of bioactive molecules, referred to as adipokines, that directly affect obesity-linked disorders in remote organs (15Lago F. Dieguez C. Gomez-Reino J. Gualillo O. Nat. Clin. Pract. Rheumatol. 2007; 3: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Adiponectin is an adipokine that is down-regulated in obesity-linked diseases, including ischemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease (16Ouchi N. Kihara S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Walsh K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 17Iwashima Y. Horio T. Suzuki Y. Kihara S. Rakugi H. Kangawa K. Funahashi T. Ogihara T. Kawano Y. Atherosclerosis. 2006; 188: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Adiponectin exerts protective actions on a variety of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, including insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction, and cardiac injury (18Ouchi N. Walsh K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 380: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). CR has been shown to markedly increase circulating levels of adiponectin (14Shinmura K. Tamaki K. Saito K.

Thus, it is plausible that adiponectin mediates the salutary actions of CR in the setting of obesity-linked vascular complications. Here we investigated whether CR modulates the process of ischemia-induced revascularization in vivo. We first examined the effect of CR on revascularization using a mouse model of vascular insufficiency. We also examined the potential contribution of adiponectin to CR-mediated revascularization process in ischemic muscles. Our observations indicate that CR promotes revascularization in response to tissue ischemia via modulation of adiponectin production. Materials—Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-eNOS (Ser-1177), phospho-AMPK (Thr-172), and pan-α-AMPK antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Tubulin antibody was from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA). Adenovirus vectors containing the gene for β-galactosidase (Ad-βgal) and full-length mouse adiponectin (Ad-APN) were described previously (20Matsuda M. Shimomura I. Sata M. Arita Y. Nishida M.

CR Protocols—Studies using wild-type (WT), eNOS-deficient (eNOS-KO), and adiponectin-deficient (APN-KO) mice in a C57/BL6 background were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Nagoya University. Male mice at the ages of 6 weeks were housed in individual cages and fed ad libitum (AL) on a normal chow for 2 weeks. Food was provided at the same time (3:00 p.m.), and food intake of individual mice was measured daily. The average value of caloric intake was calculated from daily food intake for 2 weeks. After that, mice were randomly divided into two groups. The AL group was fed ad libitum for an additional 4 weeks. CR mice were fed with 65% of the average caloric intake of control AL diet for the next 4 weeks. At 4 weeks after the CR or control AL diet, mice were subjected to unilateral hindlimb surgery. All mice were weighed at weekly intervals. Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure were determined using a tail-cuff pressure analysis system in the conscious state. Mouse Model of Revascularization—Mice were subjected to unilateral hindlimb surgery under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally). In this model, the entire left femoral artery and vein were removed surgically as described previously (21Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F.

In some experiments, we intraperitoneally injected NOS inhibitor l-NAME (20 mg/kg/day) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) into WT mice 1 day prior to surgery and daily until sacrifice. In some experiments, AMPK inhibitor compound C (20 mg/kg/3 times per week) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or vehicle (DMSO) was intraperitoneally injected into the abdomen of WT mice 1 day before the operation until sacrifice (23Li P.

Analysis of Hindlimb Blood Flow—Hindlimb blood flow was determined using a laser Doppler blood flow (LDBF) analyzer (Moor LDI; Moor Instruments, Devon, UK). LDBF analyses were performed on legs and feet before surgery and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14. Blood flow was shown as changes in the laser frequency using different color pixels. Quantitative analysis of blood flow was expressed as the ratio of left (ischemic) to right (nonischemic) LDBF to avoid data variations because of ambient light and temperature (22Shibata R. Ouchi N.

Measurement of Capillary Density—Capillary density in adductor muscle was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. Muscle samples were embedded in OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Elkhart, IN) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue slices (7 μm in thickness) were prepared and stained with CD31 (PECAM-1, BD Biosciences) followed by treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody to detect CD31. The signals were detected and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Capillary endothelial cells were quantified by measuring the number of CD31-positive cells per high power field (×400), and the number of capillaries per muscle fiber in 15 randomly chosen microscopic fields from three different sections in each tissue block (22Shibata R.

Western Blot Analysis—Tissue samples obtained on postoperative day 7 were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein content was determined by the Bradford method. The same amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated with denaturing SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. The membranes were immunoblotted with the primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution followed by the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a 1:5000 dilution. Bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Plasma Parameters—Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels were measured with enzymatic kits (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Insulin levels were measured with electroimmunoassay kit (Wako Chemicals). Adiponectin levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Blood was collected by heart puncture from mice on 4 weeks of CR. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe’s F test. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Effect of CR on Body Weight in WT Mice—A linear reduction in body weight occurred during the first 2 weeks of CR, and the reduction in body weight was maintained between 2 and 6 weeks (Fig. 1). The WT mice fed AL (AL-WT mice) showed a moderate increase in body weight of 7.3% over this time course. At the end of the 6-week time course, the difference in body weight between AL-WT mice and WT mice fed CR diet (CR-WT mice) was 26% (Fig. 1). HR and systolic blood pressure did not differ between the two groups (Table 1). Consistent with previous reports (12Mahoney L.B. Denny C.A. Seyfried T.N. Lipids Health Dis. 2006; 5: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Stein O. Dabach Y. Halperin G. Ben-Naim M. Stein Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, and plasma glucose levels in the CR-WT mice compared with AL-WT mice.TABLE 1Characteristics of AL-WT and CR-WT mice Blood samples were obtained from WT mice fed AL or CR diet for 4 weeks (n = 6).

All mice survived and appeared healthy during the follow-up period. Fig. 2A shows representative LDBF images of hindlimb blood flow before surgery and at different time points after surgery in the AL- and CR-WT mice. In AL-WT mice, hindlimb perfusion fell precipitously after surgery, increased to 20–30% of the nonischemic limb by day 7, and ultimately returned to 50% of the nonischemic limb by day 14 (Fig. 2B). CR-WT mice showed a significant increase in limb flow at 7 and 14 days after hindlimb surgery compared with AL-WT mice (Fig. 2B) (p < 0.05; n = 6). To investigate the extent of revascularization at the microcirculatory level, capillary density was measured in histological sections harvested from the ischemic tissues. Representative photomicrographs of CD31-stained ischemic muscles are shown in Fig. 3A. Quantitative analysis revealed that the capillary density was significantly increased in CR-WT mice compared with AL-WT mice at 14 days after surgery (Fig. 3B). Role of Adiponectin in CR-mediated Revascularization—CR has been shown to increase serum levels of adiponectin (14Shinmura K. Tamaki K. Saito K. Nakano Y. Tobe T. Bolli R. Circulation. 2007; 116: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Zhu M. Miura J. Lu L.X. Bernier M. DeCabo R. Lane M.A. Roth G.S. Ingram D.K. Exp. Gerontol. 2004; 39: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and we have shown that adiponectin promotes blood flow recovery in response to ischemia (22Shibata R. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Sato K. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28670-28674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These findings led us to hypothesize that the increase in circulating adiponectin levels contributes to the improved vascular response in the CR-treated animals. We assessed plasma adiponectin levels in WT treated with AL or CR. At the time of surgery, CR increased plasma adiponectin levels to a level 1.8 times higher compared with AL-WT mice (9.7 ± 1.8 in AL-WT mice and 17.4 ± 2.4 μg/ml in CR-WT mice, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). To examine the involvement of adiponectin in ischemia-induced revascularization caused by CR, we investigated the effect of CR on blood flow recovery of ischemic muscles of APN-KO mice on postoperative day 0, 3, 7, and 14. AL-APN-KO mice had a reduced blood flow of ischemic limbs in agreement with our previous work (22Shibata R. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Sato K. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28670-28674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Importantly, CR did not affect ischemic limb perfusion of APN-KO mice after surgery as compared with AL-APN-KO (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the treatment of AL-APN-KO mice with an adenovirus expressing adiponectin (Ad-APN) led to a significant increase in plasma adiponectin levels. In this experiment Ad-APN is delivered systemically 3 days prior to surgery. This procedure leads to transduction of the liver, and vector-encoded adiponectin can be detected in serum (26Shibata R. Sato K. Kumada M. Izumiya Y. Sonoda M. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas circulating levels of adiponectin are not detectable in AL-APN-KO mice and Ad-βgal-treated AL-APN-KO mice, Ad-APN treatment increased circulating levels to 9.1 ± 2.2 μg/ml in AL-APN-KO mice at day 7 after surgery that is similar to AL-WT mice. This restoration of circulating adiponectin led to an enhancement of limb perfusion after hindlimb surgery (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these data suggest that the stimulant effect of CR on ischemia-induced revascularization is mediated by the up-regulation of adiponectin. eNOS Activation Is Essential for CR-induced Revascularization— eNOS plays an important role in revascularization following hindlimb ischemia (21Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). To analyze the potential involvement of eNOS in CR-induced revascularization, the expression and phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic adductor muscle were assessed by Western blot analysis. The expression of total eNOS protein in ischemic muscles did not differ between AL and CR-mice. However, phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 in ischemic muscle was significantly greater in CR-WT mice than in AL-WT mice (Fig. 5, A and B). To test the possible contribution of adiponectin to regulation of eNOS activation by CR, we assessed the phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic tissue of APN-KO mice treated with AL or CR. In contrast to the stimulatory effects of CR on eNOS phosphorylation in WT mice, CR did not influence eNOS phosphorylation in APN-KO mice (Fig. 5, A and B). To test whether increased expression of adiponectin affects phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic muscle, Ad-βgal or Ad-APN was intravenously delivered to APN-KO and WT mice. Circulating adiponectin levels were 9.9 ± 2.1 μg/ml in wild-type/Ad-βgal, 18.1 ± 3.6 μg/ml in wild-type/Ad-APN, <0.05 μg/ml in APN-KO/Ad-βgal, and 9.1 ± 2.2 μg/ml in APN-KO/Ad-APN on postoperative day 7. Treatment with Ad-APN significantly increased eNOS phosphorylation in ischemic muscle of WT and APN-KO mice at day 7 after surgery (Fig. 5, A and B). To further analyze the involvement of eNOS signaling in revascularization by CR, we examined the impact of CR on blood flow of ischemic muscles in eNOS-KO mice. CR-eNOS-KO mice had increased plasma adiponectin levels compared with AL-eNOS-KO mice (8.1 ± 1.4 in AL-eNOS-KO mice and 15.1 ± 2.3 μg/ml in CR-eNOS-KO mice, respectively, p < 0.05). LDBF analysis revealed that no significant differences in limb perfusion were observed between AL-eNOS-KO and CR-eNOS-KO mice on postoperative day 0, 3, 7, and 14 (Fig. 5C). Because eNOS-KO mice exhibit severe ischemia-induced vascular insufficiency, which is accompanied by amputation, we assessed lower limb function and tissue salvage post-surgery using a clinical scoring system (27Yu J. deMuinck E.D. Zhuang Z. Drinane M. Kauser K. Rubanyi G.M. Qian H.S. Murata T. Escalante B. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10999-11004Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Similarly, the index of severity of tissue ischemia after hindlimb surgery did not differ between AL-eNOS-KO and CR-eNOS-KO mice (Fig. 5D). We also analyzed the effect of CR on blood flow recovery of ischemic muscles in WT mice receiving NOS inhibitor l-NAME or vehicle. Although vehicle-treated CR-WT mice showed increased recovery of blood flow compared with vehicle-treated AL-WT mice, treatment with l-NAME abrogated the increase in limb perfusion recovery in CR-WT mice (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these data suggest that CR-stimulated revascularization is attributed to eNOS activation that is involved in adiponectin production. Role of AMPK in CR-induced Revascularization—To examine the possible participation of AMPK in CR-induced revascularization, the expression and phosphorylation of AMPK in ischemic adductor muscle were assessed by Western blot analysis. The expression of total AMPK protein in ischemic muscles did not differ between AL and CR mice. However, phosphorylation of AMPK in ischemic muscle was significantly greater in CR-WT mice than in AL-WT mice at day 7 after the operation (Fig. 6, A and B). To further analyze the involvement of AMPK in CR-induced revascularization, we examined the effect of CR on blood flow recovery of ischemic muscles in WT mice receiving AMPK inhibitor compound C or vehicle. CR-WT mice receiving compound C or vehicle had increased plasma adiponectin levels compared with AL-WT mice receiving vehicle (8.3 ± 1.6 in vehicle-treated AL-WT mice, 16.1 ± 2.4 in vehicle-treated CR-WT mice, and 15.4 ± 2.4 μg/ml in compound C-treated CR-WT mice, respectively). Treatment of CR-WT mice with compound C blocked increased limb perfusion caused by CR compared with vehicle-treated CR-WT mice (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, treatment with compound C significantly diminished CR-induced increase in eNOS phosphorylation in ischemic muscle tissue (Fig. 6, D and E). These data suggest that AMPK is involved in CR-induced eNOS activation and revascularization. This study provides evidence that CR promotes ischemia-induced revascularization in a well established hindlimb model. CR enhanced blood flow recovery and capillary formation in ischemic muscle of wild-type mice, which was accompanied by increased levels of eNOS phosphorylation and plasma adiponectin. The stimulatory actions of CR on reperfusion and eNOS phosphorylation of ischemic limbs were abolished in APN-KO mice. Furthermore, CR did not improve flow recovery in ischemic limbs of eNOS-KO mice. The ability of CR to increase adiponectin levels is likely to contribute to the stimulation of revascularization under our experimental conditions. We have shown that adiponectin overexpression will accelerate revascularization of ischemic limbs in wild-type mice (22Shibata R. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Sato K. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28670-28674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Our observations here show that CR increased plasma adiponectin levels 1.8-fold in wild-type mice, in agreement with previous reports (14Shinmura K. Tamaki K. Saito K. Nakano Y. Tobe T. Bolli R. Circulation. 2007; 116: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Zhu M. Miura J. Lu L.X. Bernier M. DeCabo R. Lane M.A. Roth G.S. Ingram D.K. Exp. Gerontol. 2004; 39: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CR promoted ischemia-induced revascularization in wild-type mice but not APN-KO mice. Because adiponectin promotes vascular cell function and survival under conditions of stress (22Shibata R. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Sato K. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28670-28674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 28Kobayashi H. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Walsh K. Kumada M. Abe Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that adiponectin functions as an important mediator of CR-stimulated vascular responses. Recently, it was reported that CR confers resistance to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing adiponectin levels (14Shinmura K. Tamaki K. Saito K. Nakano Y. Tobe T. Bolli R. Circulation. 2007; 116: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CR also improves the survival and myocardial damage in obese mice with viral myocarditis, which is accompanied by increased adiponectin levels in plasma and myocardium (29Kanda T. Saegusa S. Takahashi T. Sumino H. Morimoto S. Nakahashi T. Iwai K. Matsumoto M. Int. J. Cardiol. 2007; 119: 310-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of adiponectin by CR could represent a common mechanism in the protection of cardiovascular tissues to stress. It is well established that eNOS is beneficial for various types of vascular and metabolic diseases (21Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 30Williams I.L. Wheatcroft S.B. Shah A.M. Kearney M.T. Int. J. Obes. Relat.

In this study, CR increased the activating phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic muscles, and the ability of CR to enhance revascularization was abrogated in eNOS-KO mice or WT mice receiving NOS inhibitor. Thus, CR appears to promote revascularization in ischemic states through its ability to activate eNOS. It is reported that CR induces mitochondrial biogenesis in various tissues of mice, and these effects are diminished in eNOS-KO mice (32Nisoli E. Tonello C. Cardile A. Cozzi V. Bracale R. Tedesco L. Falcone S. Valerio A. Cantoni O. Clementi E. Moncada S. Carruba M.O. Science. 2005; 310: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that eNOS acts as a key mediator of the protective actions of CR. It has been shown that adiponectin exerts vascular protection through modulation of eNOS signaling. We have shown that adiponectin stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS, which is associated with enhanced endothelial cell migration and differentiation into capillary-like structures (28Kobayashi H. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Walsh K. Kumada M. Abe Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T.

Kihara S. Murohara T. Walsh K. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Adiponectin stimulates nitric oxide production by endothelial cells via the activating phosphorylation of eNOS (33Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 35Cheng K.K. Lam K.S. Wang Y. Huang Y. Carling D. Wu D. Wong C. Xu A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45021-45026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that APN-KO mice develop increased cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury compared with WT mice, which is accompanied by reduced eNOS activation in ischemic cerebral tissue (37Nishimura M. Izumiya Y. Higuchi A. Shibata R. Qiu J. Kudo C. Shin H.K. Moskowitz M.A. Ouchi N. Circulation. 2008; 117: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Conversely, administration of adiponectin reduces cerebral infarct size and stimulates eNOS phosphorylation in ischemic brain. Of importance, the cerebroprotective actions of adiponectin were diminished in eNOS-KO mice, suggesting that eNOS is required for salutary vascular responses to adiponectin in ischemic brain. Consistent with these observations, this study shows that APN-KO mice have reduced phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic muscles. The CR-induced increase in eNOS phosphorylation during ischemia was abolished in APN-KO mice. Furthermore, despite the increased plasma adiponectin in eNOS-KO mice following CR, CR had no effects on perfusion recovery of ischemic limbs in eNOS-KO mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the vasculo-protective actions of CR are medicated, at least in part, through the adiponectin-eNOS regulatory axis. Our data show that AMPK is required for CR-stimulated revascularization in ischemic tissue. CR stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPK in the ischemic tissue, and administration of an AMPK inhibitor abrogated CR-induced increase in ischemia-induced revascularization and eNOS phosphorylation. AMPK is reported to directly phosphorylate eNOS at Ser-1177 (38Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that adiponectin stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS in endothelial cells through its ability to activate AMPK (33Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 36Chen H. Montagnani M. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45021-45026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). AMPK activation has also been shown to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor production in ischemic muscle (39Ouchi N. Shibata R. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, vascular endothelial growth factor levels in ischemic muscles did not differ between AL and CR-WT mice (data not shown), suggesting that the beneficial effect of CR on revascularization is not mediated by the angiogenic properties of this cytokine. Although other proangiogenic cytokines may be involved in CR-induced revascularization, we favor the hypothesis that CR-mediated increase in adiponectin has a salutary effect on the vasculature under conditions of ischemic stress by promoting AMPK-eNOS signaling and thereby promotes the revascularization response. Obesity-linked diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cause increased mortality and morbidity of coronary and peripheral artery diseases because of microvascular rarefaction and impaired collateral vessel growth under ischemic conditions (2Yilmaz M.B. Biyikoglu S.F. Akin Y. Guray U. Kisacik H.L. Korkmaz S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40Abaci A. Oguzhan A. Kahraman S. Eryol N.K.

Pathol. 1992; 166: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The findings reported here suggest that CR could favor revascularization in response to tissue ischemia. Thus, nutritional approaches aimed at limiting caloric intake could be useful for treatment of ischemic heart and limb diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1974024841,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurological disorder that is one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation in women. A great landmark in research in this field was the discovery of a relationship between the disease and the presence of mutations in the gene that codes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Currently, MeCP2 is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor that couples DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing. The present study aimed to identify new target genes regulated by Mecp2 in a mouse model of RTT.We have compared the gene expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Mecp2-null (KO) mice in three regions of the brain (cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum) by using cDNA microarrays. The results obtained were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed seven direct target genes of Mecp2 bound in vivo (Fkbp5, Mobp, Plagl1, Ddc, Mllt2h, Eya2, and S100a9), and three overexpressed genes due to an indirect effect of a lack of Mecp2 (Irak1, Prodh and Dlk1). The regions bound by Mecp2 were always methylated, suggesting the involvement of the methyl-CpG binding domain of the protein in the mechanism of interaction.We identified new genes that are overexpressed in Mecp2-KO mice and are excellent candidate genes for involvement in various features of the neurological disease. Our results demonstrate new targets of MeCP2 and provide us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of RTT."

https://openalex.org/W1967328758,"Root architecture is a crucial part of plant adaptation to soil heterogeneity and is mainly controlled by root branching. The process of root system development can be divided into two successive steps: lateral root initiation and lateral root development/emergence which are controlled by different fluxes of the plant hormone auxin. While shoot architecture appears to be highly regular, following rules such as the phyllotactical spiral, root architecture appears more chaotic. We used stochastic modeling to extract hidden rules regulating root branching in Arabidopsis thaliana. These rules were used to build an integrative mechanistic model of root ramification based on auxin. This model was experimentally tested using plants with modified rhythm of lateral root initiation or mutants perturbed in auxin transport. Our analysis revealed that lateral root initiation and lateral root development/emergence are interacting with each other to create a global balance between the respective ratio of initiation and emergence. A mechanistic model based on auxin fluxes successfully predicted this property and the phenotype alteration of auxin transport mutants or plants with modified rhythms of lateral root initiation. This suggests that root branching is controlled by mechanisms of lateral inhibition due to a competition between initiation and development/emergence for auxin."
https://openalex.org/W2025863286,"Background We previously identified by genetic mapping an Anopheles gambiae chromosome region with strong influence over the outcome of malaria parasite infection in nature. Candidate gene studies in the genetic interval, including functional tests using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, identified a novel leucine-rich repeat gene, APL1, with functional activity against P. berghei. Principal Findings Manual reannotation now reveals APL1 to be a family of at least 3 independently transcribed genes, APL1A, APL1B, and APL1C. Functional dissection indicates that among the three known APL1 family members, APL1C alone is responsible for host defense against P. berghei. APL1C functions within the Rel1-Cactus immune signaling pathway, which regulates APL1C transcript and protein abundance. Gene silencing of APL1C completely abolishes Rel1-mediated host protection against P. berghei, and thus the presence of APL1C is required for this protection. Further highlighting the influence of this chromosome region, allelic haplotypes at the APL1 locus are genetically associated with and have high explanatory power for the success or failure of P. berghei parasite infection. Conclusions APL1C functions as a required transducer of Rel1-dependent immune signal(s) to efficiently protect mosquitoes from P. berghei infection, and allelic genetic haplotypes of the APL1 locus display distinct levels of susceptibility and resistance to P. berghei."

Reduction in prion protein levels has potential as a therapeutic approach in treating these diseases. Key targets for this goal are factors that affect the regulation of the prion protein gene. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested a role for prion protein in copper homeostasis. Copper can also induce prion gene expression in rat neurons. However, the mechanism involved in this regulation remains to be determined. We hypothesized that transcription factors SP1 and metal transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) may be involved in copper-mediated regulation of human prion gene. To test the hypothesis, we utilized human fibroblasts that are deleted or overexpressing the Menkes protein (MNK), a major mammalian copper efflux protein. Menkes deletion fibroblasts have high intracellular copper, whereas Menkes overexpressed fibroblasts have severely depleted intracellular copper. We have utilized this system previously to demonstrate copper-dependent regulation of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein. Here we demonstrate that copper depletion in MNK overexpressed fibroblasts decreases cellular prion protein and PRNP gene levels. Conversely, expression of transcription factors SP1 and/or MTF-1 significantly increases prion protein levels and up-regulates prion gene expression in copper-replete MNK deletion cells. Furthermore, siRNA “knockdown” of SP1 or MTF-1 in MNK deletion cells decreases prion protein levels and down-regulates prion gene expression. These data support a novel mechanism whereby SP1 and MTF-1 act as copper-sensing transcriptional activators to regulate human prion gene expression and further support a role for the prion protein to function in copper homeostasis. Expression of the prion protein is a vital component for the propagation of prion diseases; thus SP1 and MTF-1 represent new targets in the development of key therapeutics toward modulating the expression of the cellular prion protein and ultimately the prevention of prion disease.

PrPC expression is an absolute requirement for prion infection, because mice in which PRNP has been ablated are completely resistant to infection when inoculated with prions (3Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar), and this protective phenotype can be inhibited when transgenes expressing PrPC are reintroduced (4Asante E.A. Li Y.G. Gowland I. Jefferys J.G. Collinge J. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 360: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PrPC is a cell surface glycoprotein anchored at the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (5Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression is most abundant in the central nervous system, primarily in neuronal (6Kretzschmar H.A. Prusiner S.B. Stowring L.E. DeArmond S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar) and glial cells (7Moser M. Colello R.J. Pott U. Oesch B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). PrPC is also expressed in many non-neuronal tissues, including blood lymphocytes, gastroepithelial cells, heart, kidney, and muscle (8Horiuchi M. Yamazaki N. Ikeda T. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2583-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Fournier J.G. Escaig-Haye F. Billette de Villemeur T. Robain O. Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Brown P. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although this widespread expression pattern has suggested potential functional roles for PrPC in a variety of cellular mechanisms (10Martins V.R. Linden R. Prado M.A. Walz R. Sakamoto A.C. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the cellular functions of PrPC are still poorly understood. Several studies have demonstrated that a major function of PrPC relates to the maintenance of intracellular copper homeostasis. PrPC contains two distinct copper-binding domains. The primary copper-binding domain is located in the N-terminal region between residues 60-91 (11Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), consists of four to six octapeptide repeats of the sequence Pro-His-Gly-Gly-Gly-Trp-Gly-Gln (12Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R.

Brown D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42750-42758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The secondary copper-binding domain is located between residues 91 and 111 just outside of the octapeptide repeat region (16Hasnain S.S. Murphy L.M. Strange R.W. Grossmann J.G. Clarke A.R.

This domain is coordinated by two histidine residues, His96 and His111, and is suggested to have a much lower affinity for copper than the primary copper-binding domain (15Thompsett A.R.

Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These copper-binding regions may have functional significance, because they are very highly conserved among a wide variety of mammalian species (11Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and insertions of one or more octapeptide repeat units are associated with familial forms of prion disease in humans (20Duchen L.W. Poulter M. Harding A.E. Brain. 1993; 116: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Copper binding to the octapeptide repeat region induces the endocytosis of PrPC from the cell surface in a reversible manner, which suggests PrPC may act as a recycling receptor for cellular uptake or efflux of copper (22Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 23Brown L.R. Harris D.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown in PRNP null mice that copper levels in cerebellar cells are significantly reduced compared with cells from age- and sex-matched controls (13Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that PrPC is an important component for maintaining brain copper homeostasis. In addition, the octapeptide region of human PrPC reduces Cu2+ to Cu+ in vitro, which is an important step required for cellular copper uptake (24Ruiz F.H. Silva E. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Opazo C. Barria M.I. Ruiz F.H. Inestrosa N.C. Biometals. 2003; 16: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that copper can regulate the expression of the rat prion gene promoter in neurons via putative metal response element (MRE) 3The abbreviations used are: MRE, metal response element; APP, amyloid precursor protein; MNK, Menkes protein; MTF-1, metal transcription factor-1; MLS, MRE-like sequence; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; ANOVA, analysis of variance.3The abbreviations used are: MRE, metal response element; APP, amyloid precursor protein; MNK, Menkes protein; MTF-1, metal transcription factor-1; MLS, MRE-like sequence; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; ANOVA, analysis of variance.

However, the precise transcriptional machinery involved in this regulation has not been determined. Because copper homeostasis from yeast to mammals is regulated by several cellular mechanisms including copper-dependent transcriptional regulation (27Rutherford J.C. Bird A.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28Balamurugan K. Schaffner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the PRNP promoter region is highly conserved among several species (29Mahal S.P. Asante E.A. Antoniou M. Collinge J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we propose that copper regulation of the human PRNP gene is controlled by metal-regulated or metal-responsive transcription factors via putative MRE sequences. The human PRNP promoter region contains a number of putative transcription factor-binding sites, including the transcriptional activator SP1, AP1, AP2, and a CCAAT box (29Mahal S.P. Asante E.A. Antoniou M. Collinge J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The active promoter region has been determined to be within a 273-bp region, -148 to +125, relative to the cap start site (29Mahal S.P. Asante E.A. Antoniou M. Collinge J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Puckett C. Concannon P. Casey C. Hood L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 320-329PubMed Google Scholar). Metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) can bind to MRE sequences to regulate genes encoding metallothioneins (31Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl.

Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, dMTF-1 can also regulate the expression of copper detoxification metallothioneins (36Balamurugan K. Egli D. Selvaraj A. Zhang B. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and paradoxically control the expression of copper import and export proteins DmCtr1b (37Selvaraj A. Balamurugan K. Yepiskoposyan H. Zhou H. Egli D. Georgiev O. Thiele D.J. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and DmATP7 (38Burke R. Commons E. Camakaris J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1850-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), respectively. SP1, a general activator of transcription, can also bind to putative MRE sequences, possibly in a negative-regulatory manner in competition with MTF-1 to regulate gene expression (39Ogra Y. Suzuki K. Gong P. Otsuka F. Koizumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16534-16539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The contribution of these transcription factors, SP1 and MTF-1, in copper regulation of the human PRNP gene has not yet been determined. To investigate the role of SP1 and MTF-1 in copper-dependent regulation of the human PRNP gene, we utilized a novel human cell culture model system that has previously been used to demonstrate copper-dependent regulation of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene (40Bellingham S.A.

This approach involves cultured human fibroblasts overexpressing the Menkes protein (MNK; encoded by ATP7A), a major mammalian copper translocating P-type ATPase involved in copper efflux (41Petris M.J.

Cells lacking the MNK protein show high intracellular copper levels caused by the lack of active copper efflux, whereas cells transfected and hence overexpressing MNK have markedly reduced copper levels (40Bellingham S.A.

Volitakis I. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F. Bush A.I. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we report that transcription factors SP1 and MTF-1 increase both cellular prion protein levels and PRNP gene expression under copper-replete conditions. Conversely, reducing levels of SP1 and MTF-1 using siRNA “knockdown” decreases both cellular prion protein and PRNP gene expression under copper-replete conditions. In addition, depletion of intracellular copper results in complete reduction of PrPC protein and PRNP gene levels. Overall, these data suggest that SP1 and MTF-1 are required for copper-mediated regulation of the PRNP gene and supports the increasing evidence that the cellular prion protein is involved in copper homeostasis.

All of the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cellular Metal Analysis—Copper, zinc, and iron levels were determined in MNK(Del), MNK(v/o), MNK(++), and normal human fibroblasts according to established procedures (40Bellingham S.A. Lahiri D.K.

Preparation of Expression Constructs—Full-length True-Clone™ cDNA expression constructs (Origene) for SP1 (SC116396) and MTF-1 (SC101137) were prepared for transfection using a plasmid DNA maxi kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient Transfection and Lysate Preparation—The cells were seeded at ∼1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection in basal medium. All of the cells were transfected with FuGENE® 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection mixture was prepared containing 4 μg of pSP1 and/or 4 μg of pMTF-1/well. 24 h post-transfection, the medium was changed to either basal medium or 100 μm CuCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, or 50 μm FeCl3 supplemented medium. 48 h post-transfection the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS several times, lysed, and extracted for total protein or total RNA using the PARIS™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Confocal Microscopy—The cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and grown for 48 h prior to being fixed in 3.2% paraformaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. The coverslips were then placed in blocking solution containing 10% goat serum (Invitrogen)/2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4 °C overnight. PrPC was detected with primary antibody ICSM-18 and secondary antibody Alexa-488 conjugated to goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) diluted at 1:250 and 1:500 in blocking solution, respectively. Nuclear staining was performed with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) diluted at 1:1000 and co-incubated with the secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in DABCO (Sigma) and scanned using a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope under identical exposure conditions. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Protein extracts were fractionated on NuPage™ Bis-Tris (4-12%) gradient acrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters or polyvinylidene difluoride filters. Detection of protein was performed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—1 μg of total RNA extracted from cell lysates was converted to cDNA using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time RT-PCR samples were then prepared using Taqman® gene expression master mix and human-specific Taqman® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) for PRNP (Hs00175591_m1) with endogenous controls for human GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) and RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real Time RT-PCR samples were then run on a RotorGene 3000 (Corbett Research). The data were analyzed and quantified using the DeltaDelta CT method (47Pfaffl M.W.

Bioinformatics—The human PRNP gene promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession number AJ289875) was analyzed for the presence of metal response element (48Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Yamada H. Otsuka F.

In addition, promoters were searched for MRE-like sequences (MLS), with no more than one base mismatch from the last three MRE consensus residues (5′-TGCRCNC-3′). Statistical Analysis—The results were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis involving two groups was performed by unpaired t test, whereas one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison of mean's post-test was performed to compare more than two groups using Prism 4 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software Inc.). Statistically significant was defined as p < 0.05. The Human PRNP Gene Promoter Contains a Number of Putative Metal Regulatory Sequences—The human PRNP gene promoter (GenBank™ accession code AJ289875) was analyzed for the presence of MREs and MRE-like sequences found in the mammalian copper detoxification gene, metallothionein (MT) promoter (48Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Yamada H. Otsuka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Utilizing this search criteria, we identified three consensus MTF-1-binding sites, several potential MRE-like sequences (Fig. 1). In addition, multiple SP1-binding sites in the human PRNP promoter were also identified (Fig. 1). Of interest, the 273-bp (-148 to +125) active promoter region (29Mahal S.P. Asante E.A. Antoniou M. Collinge J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) contained tandem MTF-1- and SP1-binding sites immediately prior to the suggested 5′-untranslated region cap start site (30Puckett C. Concannon P. Casey C. Hood L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 320-329PubMed Google Scholar). These observations supported our hypothesis that transcription factors SP1 and MTF-1 may mediate copper regulation of the human PRNP gene.

https://openalex.org/W2054257792,"Background During development, embryos decode maternal morphogen inputs into highly precise zygotic gene expression. The discovery of the morphogen Bicoid and its profound effect on developmental programming in the Drosophila embryo has been a cornerstone in understanding the decoding of maternal inputs. Bicoid has been described as a classical morphogen that forms a concentration gradient along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo by diffusion and initiates expression of target genes in a concentration-dependent manner in the syncytial blastoderm. Recent work has emphasized the stability of the Bicoid gradient as a function of egg length and the role of nuclear dynamics in maintaining the Bicoid gradient. Bicoid and nuclear dynamics were observed but not modulated under the ideal conditions used previously. Therefore, it has not been tested explicitly whether a temporally stable Bicoid gradient prior to cellularization is required for precise patterning. Principal Findings Here, we modulate both nuclear dynamics and the Bicoid gradient using laminar flows of different temperature in a microfluidic device to determine if stability of the Bicoid gradient prior to cellularization is essential for precise patterning. Dramatic motion of both cytoplasm and nuclei was observed prior to cellularization, and the Bicoid gradient was disrupted by nuclear motion and was highly abnormal as a function of egg length. Despite an abnormal Bicoid gradient during cycles 11–13, Even-skipped patterning in these embryos remained precise. Conclusions These results indicate that the stability of the Bicoid gradient as a function of egg length is nonessential during syncytial blastoderm stages. Further, presumably no gradient formed by simple diffusion on the scale of egg length could be responsible for the robust antero-posterior patterning observed, as severe cytoplasmic and nuclear motion would disrupt such a gradient. Additional mechanisms for how the embryo could sense its dimensions and interpret the Bicoid gradient are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2169385823,"Polymorphisms in CCR5, the major coreceptor for HIV, and CCL3L1, a potent CCR5 ligand and HIV-suppressive chemokine, are determinants of HIV-AIDS susceptibility. Here, we mathematically modeled the potential impact of these genetic factors on the epidemic spread of HIV, as well as on its prevention.Ro, the basic reproductive number, is a fundamental concept in explaining the emergence and persistence of epidemics. By modeling sexual transmission among HIV+/HIV- partner pairs, we find that Ro estimates, and concordantly, the temporal and spatial patterns of HIV outgrowth are highly dependent on the infecting partners' CCL3L1-CCR5 genotype. Ro was least and highest when the infected partner possessed protective and detrimental CCL3L1-CCR5 genotypes, respectively. The modeling data indicate that in populations such as Pygmies with a high CCL3L1 gene dose and protective CCR5 genotypes, the spread of HIV might be minimal. Additionally, Pc, the critical vaccination proportion, an estimate of the fraction of the population that must be vaccinated successfully to eradicate an epidemic was <1 only when the infected partner had a protective CCL3L1-CCR5 genotype. Since in practice Pc cannot be >1, to prevent epidemic spread, population groups defined by specific CCL3L1-CCR5 genotypes might require repeated vaccination, or as our models suggest, a vaccine with an efficacy of >70%. Further, failure to account for CCL3L1-CCR5-based genetic risk might confound estimates of vaccine efficacy. For example, in a modeled trial of 500 subjects, misallocation of CCL3L1-CCR5 genotype of only 25 (5%) subjects between placebo and vaccine arms results in a relative error of approximately 12% from the true vaccine efficacy.CCL3L1-CCR5 genotypes may impact on the dynamics of the HIV epidemic and, consequently, the observed heterogeneous global distribution of HIV infection. As Ro is lowest when the infecting partner has beneficial CCL3L1-CCR5 genotypes, we infer that therapeutic vaccines directed towards reducing the infectivity of the host may play a role in halting epidemic spread. Further, CCL3L1-CCR5 genotype may provide critical guidance for optimizing the design and evaluation of HIV-1 vaccine trials and prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2039573418,"To generate adaptive behavior, the nervous system is coupled to the environment. The coupling constrains the dynamical properties that the nervous system and the environment must have relative to each other if adaptive behavior is to be produced. In previous computational studies, such constraints have been used to evolve controllers or artificial agents to perform a behavioral task in a given environment. Often, however, we already know the controller, the real nervous system, and its dynamics. Here we propose that the constraints can also be used to solve the inverse problem—to predict from the dynamics of the nervous system the environment to which they are adapted, and so reconstruct the production of the adaptive behavior by the entire coupled system. We illustrate how this can be done in the feeding system of the sea slug Aplysia. At the core of this system is a central pattern generator (CPG) that, with dynamics on both fast and slow time scales, integrates incoming sensory stimuli to produce ingestive and egestive motor programs. We run models embodying these CPG dynamics—in effect, autonomous Aplysia agents—in various feeding environments and analyze the performance of the entire system in a realistic feeding task. We find that the dynamics of the system are tuned for optimal performance in a narrow range of environments that correspond well to those that Aplysia encounter in the wild. In these environments, the slow CPG dynamics implement efficient ingestion of edible seaweed strips with minimal sensory information about them. The fast dynamics then implement a switch to a different behavioral mode in which the system ignores the sensory information completely and follows an internal “goal,” emergent from the dynamics, to egest again a strip that proves to be inedible. Key predictions of this reconstruction are confirmed in real feeding animals."
https://openalex.org/W2105095514,"Eukaryotic genomes are mostly composed of noncoding DNA whose role is still poorly understood. Studies in several organisms have shown correlations between the length of the intergenic and genic sequences of a gene and the expression of its corresponding mRNA transcript. Some studies have found a positive relationship between intergenic sequence length and expression diversity between tissues, and concluded that genes under greater regulatory control require more regulatory information in their intergenic sequences. Other reports found a negative relationship between expression level and gene length and the interpretation was that there is selection pressure for highly expressed genes to remain small. However, a correlation between gene sequence length and expression diversity, opposite to that observed for intergenic sequences, has also been reported, and to date there is no testable explanation for this observation. To shed light on these varied and sometimes conflicting results, we performed a thorough study of the relationships between sequence length and gene expression using cell-type (tissue) specific microarray data in Arabidopsis thaliana. We measured median gene expression across tissues (expression level), expression variability between tissues (expression pattern uniformity), and expression variability between replicates (expression noise). We found that intergenic (upstream and downstream) and genic (coding and noncoding) sequences have generally opposite relationships with respect to expression, whether it is tissue variability, median, or expression noise. To explain these results we propose a model, in which the lengths of the intergenic and genic sequences have opposite effects on the ability of the transcribed region of the gene to be epigenetically regulated for differential expression. These findings could shed light on the role and influence of noncoding sequences on gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2153889302,"Neonates reproduce facial movements in response to an adult model just after birth. This neonatal oral imitation usually disappears at about 2- to 3-months of age following the development of cortical control. There is controversy relating to the nature and neural basis of such neonatal imitation. To address this issue, we studied the relationship between oral imitation, primitive reflexes, and residual voluntary movement in patients with severe brain damage.Six male and six female patients with cerebral palsy, from 4 to 39 years, were included in this study. Oral imitation was examined when they were awake and looked at the experimenter. Patients were evaluated as performing oral imitation when they opened their mouth repeatedly without visual feedback regarding their own behavior in response to the experimenter's oral movement. Tongue or lip protrusion was not examined because none of patients were able to do those behaviors due to their physical disability. Rooting and sucking reflexes were also investigated as representatives of primitive reflexes.Six patients (50%) performed oral imitation. Mouth opening was not observed repeatedly in response to other facial expression without opening the mouth such as surprise or smile, excluding the possibility of nonspecific oral reaction. They exhibited little voluntary movement of their extremities. Half of them also manifested at least one primitive reflex. No patients exhibiting residual voluntary movements of their extremities performed oral imitation or primitive reflexes.Oral imitation reappears in a similar way to primitive reflexes in patients showing severely impaired cortical function and little voluntary movement of their extremities due to severe brain damage, suggesting that neonatal oral imitation is mainly controlled by the subcortical brain region."
