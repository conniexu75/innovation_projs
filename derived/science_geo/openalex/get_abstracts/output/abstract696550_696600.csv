https://openalex.org/W4284964386,"Metformin is a traditional anti-hyperglycemic medication that has recently been shown to benefit vascular complications of diabetes via an anti-inflammatory mechanism other than glycemic control. This study aims to test the hypothesis that metformin suppresses diabetic retinopathy (DR) associated intraocular inflammation. Human vitreous from control and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients with or without long-term metformin treatment (> 5 years) were collected for multiple inflammatory cytokines measurements with a cytokine array kit. The vast majority of the measurable cytokines in PDR vitreous has a lower level in metformin group than non-metformin group. Although the p values are not significant due to a relatively small sample size and large deviations, the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference between the two groups shows some difference in the true values should not be neglected. Using quantitative ELISA, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1) presented with significantly lower concentrations in metformin group versus non-metformin group. Metformin group also has significantly less up-regulated cytokines and diminished positive correlations among the cytokines when compared to non-metformin group. Possible role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in metformin's anti-inflammatory effects were studied in human retinal vascular endothelial cells (hRVECs) cultured in normal glucose (NG) and high glucose (HG) conditions. Metformin inhibited HG-induced ICAM-1, IL-8, and MCP-1 via AMPK activation, whereas pharmacological AMPK inhibition had no effect on its inhibition of NF-κB p65, sICAM-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Metformin-induced suppression of the inflammatory cytokines could also be mediated through its direct inhibition of NF-κB, independent of AMPK pathway. This is a proof-of-concept study that found metformin treatment was associated with reduced inflammatory responses in vitreous of diabetes patients and retinal vascular endothelial cells, supporting the rationale for using metformin to treat DR at an early stage."

In this manuscript we analyze the long-term effect of COVID-19 on poverty at the country-level across various income thresholds to 2050. We do this by introducing eight quantitative scenarios that model the future of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1) achievement using alternative assumptions about COVID-19 effects on both economic growth and inequality in the International Futures model. Relative to a scenario without the pandemic (the No COVID scenario), the COVID Base scenario increases global extreme poverty by 73.9 million in 2020 (the range across all scenarios: 43.5 to 155.0 million), 63.6 million in 2030 (range: 9.8 to 167.2 million) and 57.1 million in 2050 (range: 3.1 to 163.0 million). The COVID Base results in seven more countries not meeting the SDG1 target by 2030 that would have achieved the target in a No COVID scenario. The most pessimistic scenario results in 17 more countries not achieving SDG1 compared with a No COVID scenario. The greatest pandemic driven increases in poverty occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4284960725,"Aging is associated with impairment in postural control in humans. While dogs are a powerful model for the study of aging, the associations between age and postural control in this species have not yet been elucidated. The aims of this work were to establish a reliable protocol to measure center of pressure excursions in standing dogs and to determine age-related changes in postural sway. Data were obtained from 40 healthy adult dogs (Group A) and 28 senior dogs (Group B) during seven trials (within one session of data collection) of quiet standing on a pressure sensitive walkway system. Velocity, acceleration, root mean square, 95% ellipse area, range and frequency revolve were recorded as measures of postural sway. In Group A, reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation, and the effect of morphometric variables was evaluated using linear regression. By means of stepwise linear regression we determined that root mean square overall and acceleration in the craniocaudal direction were the best variables able to discriminate between Group A and Group B. The relationship between these two center-of-pressure (COP) measures and the dogs' fractional lifespan was examined in both groups and the role of pain and proprioceptive deficits was evaluated in Group B. All measures except for frequency revolve showed good to excellent reliability. Weight, height and length were correlated with most of the measures. Fractional lifespan impacted postural control in Group B but not Group A. Joint pain and its interaction with proprioceptive deficits influence postural sway especially in the acceleration in the craniocaudal direction, while fractional lifespan was most important in the overall COP displacement. In conclusion, our study found that pressure sensitive walkway systems are a reliable tool to evaluate postural sway in dogs; and that postural sway is affected by morphometric parameters and increases with age and joint pain."
https://openalex.org/W4284974861,"Stay-at-home-orders, online learning, and work from home policies are some of the responses governments, universities, and other institutions adopted to slow the spread of COVID-19. However, research shows these measures have increased pre-existing gender disparities in the workplace. The working conditions for women during the pandemic worsened due to increased family care responsibilities and unequal distribution of domestic labor. In the academy, working from home has resulted in reduced research time and increased teaching and family care responsibilities, with a larger proportion of that burden falling to women. We investigate the persistence of gender inequity among academic scientists resulting from university COVID-19 responses over time. We draw on two surveys administered in May 2020 and May 2021 to university-based biologists, biochemists, and civil and environmental engineers, to analyze how the pandemic response has disproportionately impacted women in academia and the endurance of those inequities. Results show significantly greater negative impacts from the pandemic on women's research activities and work-life balance, compared to men. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results, and the need for the academy to better predict and adjust to the gender disparities its policies create."
https://openalex.org/W4284959762,"Objective Diabetes self-management (DSM) enables maintenance of optimal individualized glycemic control for patients with diabetes through comprehensive lifestyle, medication adherence, and self-monitoring glucose level. This study aimed to evaluate DSM and to find associated factors among Vietnamese diabetes patients by using the Vietnamese version of Diabetes Self-Management Instrument (DSMI). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at a single hospital in the central Vietnam. DSM was assessed using the DSMI. The participant’s socio-demographic and clinical features were obtained through face-to-face interviews and medical records. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine independent factors associated with total DSMI. Results The mean total DSM score based on DSMI self-administered questionnaire scores was 88.4 ± 22.1, with a range of 47 to 140. The mean self-integration, self-regulation, interaction with health professionals, self-monitoring blood glucose, and adherence to the prescribed regime were 24.8, 22.3, 21.6, 10.2, and 9.5, respectively. 48.1% of DM patients had good HbA1c control. Sex, educational status, BMI, waist circumference, medical nutrition therapy, and sufficient physical activities were factors independently predictive of DSMI total score. Conclusion This study emphasizes that the DSM situation is seen to be average among DM patients with mean DSMI score 88.4 ± 22.1 and sex, educational status, BMI, waist circumference, medical nutrition therapy, and sufficient physical activities were independently predictive factors of DSMI total score. This evidence suggests that there is a need to enhance the effectiveness of DSM education programs among diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W4284961000,"Adverse pregnancy outcomes are the main causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and long-term physical and psychological sequels in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. In Ethiopia, maternal mortality remained high despite the country's maximum effort. This study aimed to assess adverse pregnancy outcomes and associated factors among deliveries at Debre Berhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia.A retrospective cross-sectional study was done among deliveries at Debre Berhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018. The data was collected using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire by reviewing labor and delivery service log books and admission or discharge registration books. The data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Logistic regression analysis was computed to identify independent predictors of pregnancy complications.In this study, the magnitude of adverse pregnancy outcomes was 28.3%, 95% CI (25.7-30.9). The most frequently recorded obstetric complications were obstructed labor (7.4%), retained placenta (5.3%), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (2.4%). Whereas stillbirths (10%), malpresentation (3%), and prematurity (2.3%) frequently occurred fetal/neonatal complications. There were 29 maternal deaths and the possible causes of death were obstructed labor (51.7%), hemorrhage (44.7%), eclampsia (24.1%), and sepsis (6.9%). Home delivery (AOR (CI = 4.12 (2.30-7.15) and low birth weight (AOR (CI = 1.63 (1.36-1.96) were significant associates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.The magnitude of adverse pregnancy outcomes was high. Obstructed labor, retained placenta, hypertension in pregnancy, malpresentation, prematurity, and stillbirth are the commonest adverse pregnancy outcomes. Place of delivery and birth weight were independent predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Institutional delivery, early detection and management of complications, and adequate nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy should be encouraged to minimize the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4284966707,"This study aimed to validate Lee’s age estimation method and assess the 18-year threshold in Korean and Japanese populations. We evaluated the maxillary and mandibular second (M2) and third molars (M3) in 2657 orthopantomograms of the Korean and Japanese populations aged 15–23 years (19.47±2.62 years for Koreans, 19.31±2.60 years for Japanese), using Demirjian’s criteria. Dental age was estimated, and correlations between chronological and dental ages were analyzed. Classification performance was calculated based on the 18-year threshold. The relationship between developmental stage and chronologic age was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Our results revealed that Lee’s method was appropriate for estimation in the Korean population. When the Lee’s method was applied to the Japanese population, a lower value of correlation coefficients between estimated and chronological age, and lower specificity were observed. Population differences were observed predominantly in the stages of root development (stages F and G) of M2s and M3s in both jaws and more frequently in females than in males. In the multiple linear regression between developmental stage and chronological age, lower values of adjusted r 2 were observed in the Japanese population than in the Koreans. In conclusion, the Lee’s method derived from the Korean population data might be unsuitable for Japanese juveniles and adolescents. To support the findings of this study, future studies with samples from multiple institutions should be conducted. Future studies with larger sample sizes are also warranted to improve the accuracy of dental age estimation and confirm the developmental pattern of teeth in the Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W4284974834,"Particle encapsulated hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen (O 2 ) carriers (HBOCs) have clear advantages over their acellular counterparts because of their larger molecular diameter and lack of vasoactivity upon transfusion. Poly(ethylene glycol) surface conjugated liposome encapsulated Hb (PEG-LEH) nanoparticles are considered a promising class of HBOC for use as a red blood cell (RBC) substitute. However, their widespread usage is limited by manufacturing processes which prevent material scale up. In this study, PEG-LEH nanoparticles were produced via a scalable and robust process using a high-pressure cell disruptor, and their biophysical properties were thoroughly characterized. Hb encapsulation, methemoglobin (metHb) level, O 2 -PEG-LEH equilibria, PEG-LEH gaseous (oxygen, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide) ligand binding/release kinetics, lipocrit, and long-term storage stability allowed us to examine their potential suitability and efficacy as an RBC replacement. Our results demonstrate that PEG-LEH nanoparticle suspensions manufactured via a high-pressure cell disruptor have Hb concentrations comparable to whole blood (~12 g/dL) and possess other desirable characteristics, which may permit their use as potential lifesaving O 2 therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4284969086,"The association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of death from cancer is still a controversial issue. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of MetS and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) with cancer mortality in a Japanese population.We used data from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. The study population consisted of 28,554 eligible subjects (14,103 men and 14,451 women) aged 35-69 years. MetS was diagnosed based on the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) and the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity (JASSO), using the body mass index instead of waist circumference. The Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total cancer mortality in relation to MetS and its components. Additionally, the associations of obesity and the metabolic health status with cancer mortality were examined.During an average 6.9-year follow-up, there were 192 deaths from cancer. The presence of MetS was significantly correlated with increased total cancer mortality when the JASSO criteria were used (HR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.04-2.21), but not when the NCEP-ATP III criteria were used (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.53). Metabolic risk factors, elevated fasting blood glucose, and MUHO were positively associated with cancer mortality (P <0.05).MetS diagnosed using the JASSO criteria and MUHO were associated with an increased risk of total cancer mortality in the Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W4284972211,"Background Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are widely used to determine latent tuberculosis infection status. However, its pregnancy-affected performance and cost-expensive nature warrants for different alternatives for pregnant women. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of several alternative cytokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) to identify latent tuberculosis status in pregnant women. Materials and methods 123 pregnant womens were recruited for this study. The IGRA status was determined by using QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube. Meanwhile, we measured the level IL-2, IL-10, and IP-10 by using sandwich-microELISA method. We performed normality and comparison test by SPSS. In addition, receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analyses and the optimal cutoff scores were identified using the EasyROC webtool. Results We showed that IL-2, IL-10, and IP-10 were able to discriminate between IGRA-negative and IGRA-positive pregnant women. Moreover, IP-10 showed the highest discriminatory and diagnostic performance when compared to IL-2 and IL-10 with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 and cutoff point of 649.65 pg/mL. Conclusions Our study showed that IP-10 can be considered as a promising alternative biomarker for IGRAs to diagnose LTBI in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W4284976899,"Our changing climate poses growing challenges for effective management of marine life, ocean ecosystems, and human communities. Which species are most vulnerable to climate change, and where should management focus efforts to reduce these risks? To address these questions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Climate Science Strategy called for vulnerability assessments in each of NOAA’s ocean regions. The Pacific Islands Vulnerability Assessment (PIVA) project assessed the susceptibility of 83 marine species to the impacts of climate change projected to 2055. In a standard Rapid Vulnerability Assessment framework, this project applied expert knowledge, literature review, and climate projection models to synthesize the best available science towards answering these questions. Here we: (1) provide a relative climate vulnerability ranking across species; (2) identify key attributes and factors that drive vulnerability; and (3) identify critical data gaps in understanding climate change impacts to marine life. The invertebrate group was ranked most vulnerable and pelagic and coastal groups not associated with coral reefs were ranked least vulnerable. Sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, and oxygen concentration were the main exposure drivers of vulnerability. Early Life History Survival and Settlement Requirements was the most data deficient of the sensitivity attributes considered in the assessment. The sensitivity of many coral reef fishes ranged between Low and Moderate, which is likely underestimated given that reef species depend on a biogenic habitat that is extremely threatened by climate change. The standard assessment methodology originally developed in the Northeast US, did not capture the additional complexity of the Pacific region, such as the diversity, varied horizontal and vertical distributions, extent of coral reef habitats, the degree of dependence on vulnerable habitat, and wide range of taxa, including data-poor species. Within these limitations, this project identified research needs to sustain marine life in a changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W4284958606,"We aimed to analyze the dispersion slope (DS) using shear wave dispersion (SWD) in patients with Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) and to investigate its utility as a biomarker of disease progression.This cross-sectional study enrolled 27 adults with FALD who underwent SWD, two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or abdominal computed tomography (CT) from April 2019 to April 2021. According to CT findings, patients were divided into two groups: significant fibrosis and non-significant fibrosis.The median DS in the control (n = 10), non-significant fibrosis (n = 12), and significant fibrosis (n = 15) was 9.35, 12.55, and 17.64 (m/s)/kHz, respectively. The significant fibrosis group showed a significantly higher DS than non-significant fibrosis group (P = 0.003). DS showed a significant correlation with central venous pressure (r = 0.532, P = 0.017) and liver stiffness measurements using 2D-SWE (r = 0.581, P = 0.002). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis were 0.903 and 0.734 for SWD and 2D-SWE, respectively (P = 0.043).DS measured by SWD reflects the severity of liver damage in patients with FALD. SWE may be valuable for the therapeutic management of patients with FALD."
https://openalex.org/W4284968976,"Aims The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is over-activated and the serum angiotensin II (Ang II) level increased in obese patients, while their correlations were incompletely understood. This study aims to explore the role of Ang II in diet-induced obesity by focusing on adipose lipid anabolism and catabolism. Methods Rat model of AT1aR gene knockout were established to investigate the special role of Ang II on adipose lipid metabolism. Wild-type (WT) and AT1aR gene knockout (AT1aR -/- ) SD rats were fed with normal diet or high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Adipose morphology and adipose lipid synthesis and lipolysis were examined. Results AT1aR deficiency activated lipolysis-related enzymes and increased the levels of NEFAs and glycerol released from adipose tissue in high-fat diet rats, while did not affect triglycerides synthesis. Besides, AT1aR knockout promoted energy expenditure and fatty acids oxidation in adipose tissue. cAMP levels and PKA phosphorylation in the adipose tissue were significantly increased in AT1aR -/- rats fed with high-fat. Activated PKA could promote adipose lipolysis and thus improved adipose histomorphology and insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet rats. Conclusions AT1aR deficiency alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy in high-fat diet rats by promoting adipose lipolysis probably via cAMP/PKA pathway, and thereby delayed the onset of obesity and related metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4284970695,"Saliva sampling is a promising alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing, but acceptability data is lacking. We characterize the acceptability of saliva sampling and nasopharyngeal swabs for primary decision makers and their children after experiencing both testing modalities.We administered a cross-sectional survey to participants aged 6-to-17 years and their primary decision makers at an Ottawa community COVID-19 testing centre in March 2021. Included were participants meeting local guidelines for testing. Excluded were those identified prior to participation as having inability to complete the consent, sampling, or survey process. Acceptability in multiple hypothetical scenarios was rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Pain was measured using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). Preference for testing was assessed with direct binary questions.48 participants and 48 primary decision makers completed the survey. Nasopharyngeal swab acceptability differed between scenarios, ranging 79% [95%CI: 66, 88] to 100% [95%CI: 95, 100]; saliva sampling acceptability was similar across scenarios, ranging 92% [95%CI: 82, 97] to 98% [95%CI: 89, 99]. 58% of youth described significant pain with nasopharyngeal swabbing, versus none with saliva sampling. 90% of children prefer saliva sampling. 66% of primary decision makers would prefer nasopharyngeal swabbing if it were 10% more sensitive.Though youth prefer saliva sampling over nasopharyngeal swabs, primary decision makers present for testing remain highly accepting of both. Acceptance of nasopharyngeal swabs, however, varies with the testing indication and is influenced by perceived test accuracy. Understanding factors that influence sampling acceptance will inform more successful testing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4284973543,"Dyslipidemia increases the risk of serious cardiovascular disease; and conventional cigarette smoking is widely recognized as a risk factor. Thus, as electronic cigarettes were introduced, many smokers utilized them for smoking cessation. However, due to the lack of researches scrutinized the relationship between dual smoking and dyslipidemia, a lot of those who failed in cessation end up utilizing both types of cigarettes (dual smoking). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of dual smoking on dyslipidemia in South Korean adults.Data were included from the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2019 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 8,398 Korean men. The KNHANES is conducted by a national institution based on random cluster sampling, and therefore, the data gained from it is statistically reliable and representative in comparison to surveys performed by private institutions. Cigarette use status was the main independent variable. Cigarette use status was categorized as one of the four status: dual smoker, single smoker, non-smoker, and ex-smoker. The dependent variable, presence of dyslipidemia, was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program as displaying one or more of the following criteria: total cholesterol: ≥240 ㎎/dL, LDL cholesterol: ≥160 ㎎/dL, triglyceride: ≥200 ㎎/dL, or HDL cholesterol: ≤40 ㎎/dL. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine target association.Current and former users of either electronic or conventional cigarettes presented with a higher odd ratio of dyslipidemia compared to non-smokers. (ex-smoker: OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.41-1.83; single smoker: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.06-1.38). More importantly, those who smoke both conventional and electronic cigarettes were also, at high risk of dyslipidemia (dual smoker: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.26-2.20). Along with smoking status, those who did not exercise had a higher risk of dyslipidemia than those who exercised regularly and higher self-reported health status was also related to a lower risk of dyslipidemia.This study suggests that along with conventional cigarettes, dual smoking negatively impacts dyslipidemia, and smoking cessation of evert types is necessary for a healthy life."
https://openalex.org/W4284964333,"This study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial effects of chlorhexidine (CHX) and povidone-iodine (PI) on clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Trueperella pyogenes (T. pyogenes) from the vaginal discharge of dairy cows, as well as to compare the cytotoxicity effects of CHX and PI on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEnEpC). In Experiment 1, 12 E. coli and 10 T. pyogenes were isolated from the vaginal discharge of cows with a uterine infection. The MIC and MBC against CHX and PI were analyzed in vitro. In Experiment 2, the cytotoxicity effects of CHX and PI on BEnEpC were analyzed using a Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit, wound scratch healing assay, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α). In Experiment 1, the MIC and MBC values of CHX against E. coli were 0.0002% and 0.0002 to 0.00025%, respectively. The MIC and MBC values of PI were 1.25 to 2.5% and 1.25 to 5%, respectively. For T. pyogenes, the MIC and MBC values of CHX were 0.00002%. The MIC and MBC values of PI were 1.25%. In Experiment 2, the cell viability significantly decreased, and wound closures were significantly inhibited after treatment with ≥ 0.002% CHX and ≥ 0.025% PI. The expression of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α significantly increased after treatment with PI. Only IL-6 showed a significant increase after cells were treated with 0.00002% and 0.0002% CHX. The results suggested that both CHX and PI had high antibacterial effects. However, veterinarians and farmers should be aware of their cytotoxicity, which decrease viability of endometrial epithelial cells and inhibit wound healing in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W4284965210,"Introduction Thymine auxotrophic in vitro mutants of Escherichia coli were first reported in the mid-20th century. Later, thymine-dependent clinical strains of E . coli as well as other Enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus have been recognized as the cause of persistent and recurrent infections. Objectives The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype and investigate the molecular basis of thymine auxotrophy in ten E . coli isolates obtained at different time points from a patient with recurrent bloodstream infection (BSI) due to a chronic aortic graft infection treated with Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Methods Clinical data was obtained from hospital records. Growth characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to TMP-SMX was performed on M9 agar and in MH broth with different thymine concentrations (0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 20 μg/mL), on Mueller-Hinton (MH) and blood agar. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all E . coli isolates. Results E . coli were isolated from ten consecutive BSI episodes from a patient with chronic aortic graft infection. Six of these isolates were resistant to TMP-SMX when assayed on blood agar. Growth experiments with added thymine confirmed that these isolates were thymine-dependent ( thy- ), and revealed growth defects (slower growth rate and smaller colony size) in these isolates relative to thy+ isolates (n = 4). WGS indicated that all isolates were of the same clonal lineage of sequence type 7358. Genomic analysis revealed a G172C substitution in thyA in all TMP-SMX resistant isolates, while mutations affecting genes involved in the deoxyribose salvage pathway ( deoB and deoC ) were identified in eight isolates. Conclusion This case highlights the risk of resistance development to TMP-SMX, especially for long-term treatment, and the possible pitfalls in detection of growth-deficient subpopulations from chronic infections, which could lead to treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W4284965771,"Blood plasma separation is a prerequisite in numerous biomedical assays involving low abundance plasma-borne biomarkers and thus is the fundamental step before many bioanalytical steps. High-capacity refrigerated centrifuges, which have the advantage of handling large volumes of blood samples, are widely utilized, but they are bulky, non-transportable, and prohibitively expensive for low-resource settings, with prices starting at $1,500. On the other hand, there are low-cost commercial and open-source micro-centrifuges available, but they are incapable of handling typical clinical amounts of blood samples (2-10mL). There is currently no low-cost CE marked centrifuge that can process large volumes of clinical blood samples on the market. As a solution, we customised the rotor of a commercially available low-cost micro-centrifuge (~$125) using 3D printing to enable centrifugation of large clinical blood samples in resource poor-settings. Our custom adaptor ($15) can hold two 9 mL S-Monovette tubes and achieve the same separation performance (yield, cell count, hemolysis, albumin levels) as the control benchtop refrigerated centrifuge, and even outperformed the control in platelet separation by at least four times. This low-cost open-source centrifugation system capable of processing clinical blood tubes could be valuable to low-resource settings where centrifugation is required immediately after blood withdrawal for further testing."
https://openalex.org/W4284971753,"Light emitting diode (LED) lamps are increasingly being studied in cultivation of horticultural, ornamental and medicinal plants as means to increase yield, quality, stress resistance, and bioactive compounds content. Enhancing the production of metabolites for medicinal or pharmaceutical use by regulating LED intensity and spectra is a challenging subject, where promising results have been achieved. Nevertheless, some species have been poorly investigated, despite their interest as a source of medicinally active substances, with particular reference to LED effects at the plant cultivation level. This study evaluates the effects of supplementary top-light LED treatments on Taxus baccata , one of the main sources of taxane precursors. Blue, red and mixed red–and-blue spectra were tested at 100 μM m -2 s -1 . Moreover, 50 and 150 μM m -2 s -1 intensities were tested for the mixed spectrum. All treatments were set for 14 hours a day and were tested against natural light as control treatment, in a controlled environment, from 19 August to 9 December 2019, this latter date representing 112 days after treatment (DAT) began. A smart monitoring and control system powered by environmental and proximal sensors was implemented to assure homogeneity of temperature, humidity, and base natural light for all the treatments. It resulted in negligible deviations from expected values and reliable exclusion of confusing factors. Biometric measurements and 1 H-NMR based metabolomic analysis were performed to investigate growth and phytochemical profile throughout the trial. One-way ANOVA showed that supplemental LED lighting increased plant height and number of sprouts. Considering the mixed red–and-blue spectrum, plant height increased almost proportionally from control to 100 μM m -2 s -1 (+20% at 112 DAT), with no further increase at higher intensity. The number of sprouts was strongly enhanced by LED treatments only in the early phase (48.9 vs. 7.5 sprouts in the averaged 50, 100 and 150 μM m -2 s -1 vs. the control at 28 DAT), with no differences related to intensity in the very early stage, and more persisting effects (up to 56 DAT) for higher intensities. After the very early growth stages (28 DAT), plant vigor showed a modest although significant increase over time compared to the control, with no differences related to light intensity (0.81 vs. 0.74 of NDVI in the averaged 50, 100 and 150 μM m -2 s -1 vs. the control, across 56, 84 and 112 DAT). The different spectra tested at 100 μM m -2 s -1 showed no significant differences in growth parameters, except for a slight beneficial influence of blue (alone or with red) compared to only red for sprouting. According to the metabolomic analysis, treated plants at 28 DAT were characterized by the highest content of sucrose and aromatic compounds. Signals of a putative taxane were detected in the 1 H NMR profiles of plants, which were compared to the spectrum of baccatin III standard. However, the intensity of these spectral signals was not affected by the treatment, while they increased only slightly during time. Light at 150 μM m -2 s -1 induced the strongest variation in the metabolome. Conversely, light composition did not induce significant differences in the metabolome."
https://openalex.org/W4284974108,"Little is known about the epidemiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN).We conducted a nationwide epidemiological survey of Japanese children aged 1 to 15 years with HSPN. Children who were newly diagnosed with HSPN by biopsy between January 2013 and December 2015 were eligible for the survey to clarify the incidence of HSPN. We also conducted an institutional survey on kidney biopsy criteria and treatment protocols.A total of 353 of 412 institutions (85.7%) responded to the questionnaire. Of the 353 institutions, 174 reported to perform kidney biopsies at their institutions, and 563 children were diagnosed with HSPN. Considering the collection rate, the estimated incidence of biopsy-proven HSPN was 1.32 cases/100,000 children per year. The median age at biopsy was 7.0 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1. The kidney biopsy criteria and treatment protocols for HSPN were as follows. Patients with acute kidney injury underwent biopsy at least one month after onset. For patients without kidney dysfunction, the timing for biopsy was determined by the amount of proteinuria. Regarding the treatment of HSPN, there were certain commonalities among the treatment protocols, they eventually differed depending on the institutions involved.The incidence of biopsy-proven HSPN was 1.32 cases/100,000 children per year in Japan. The male-to-female ratio and date of diagnosis of HSPN were similar to those in previous studies. The kidney biopsy criteria and treatment protocols for HSPN varied among institutions. Further studies are warranted to establish an optimal treatment policy based on the prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4284959143,"Purpose To evaluate the imaging features of coronary spasm, including transluminal attenuation gradient (TAG) on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), in patients with vasospastic angina (VA). Methods A total of 43 patients with a high clinical likelihood of VA were included in the study. All the subjects underwent double CCTA acquisition: CCTA without a vasodilator (‘baseline CT’) and CCTA during continuous intravenous nitrate infusion (‘IV nitrate CT’). A catheterized ergonovine provocation test was used to determine true VA patients. Coronary spasm is classified into focal- and diffuse-types according to morphological differences. We measured TAG and contrast enhancement of the proximal ostium (ProxHU) of each coronary artery for both the baseline and IV nitrate CT. Results Twenty-four patients (55.8%) showed positive results of coronary vasospasm on the provocation test. Thirty-eight vessels showed coronary spasms (29.5%): Focal-type in nine vessels (24%), and diffuse-type in 29 (76%). In the baseline CT, LCX showed significantly lower (steeper) TAG in spasm(+) vessels than in spasm(-) vessels, while LAD and RCA showed no significant differences in TAG. The ProxHU of LAD showed significantly lower values in spasm(+) vessels than in spasm(-) vessels, while the other vessels did not show significant differences in ProxHU. For IV nitrate CT, there were no significant differences in either the TAG and ProxHU between spasm(+) and (-) vessels for all the three vessel types. In subgroup analysis for spasm(+) vessels, diffuse spasms showed significantly lower TAG than focal spasms, while the ProxHU did not differ between the two types of spasm. Conclusions A relatively large percentage of coronary spasms present as diffuse type, and the TAG values significantly differed according to the morphological type of the coronary spasm."
https://openalex.org/W4284959540,"For most cell culture experiments, it is indispensable that the cells are firmly anchored to culture plates, withstanding rinsing steps that can create shear forces and tolerating temperature changes without detaching. For semi-adherent cells such as the common HEK 293 or PC-12 cells, this could so far be obtained by time-consuming plate pre-coating with cationic polymer solutions. We report here, that i) pre-coating with the cheaper poly-ethylenimine (PEI) works as well as the commonly used poly-D-lysine (PDL), but more importantly and novel ii) that simple direct addition of either PEI (1.5 μg/ml) or PDL (2 μg/ml) to the cell culture medium results in strongly anchored HEK 293 cells, indistinguishable from ones seeded on pre-coated plates. Therefore, the replacement of plate pre-coating by direct addition of either PEI or PDL gives comparable excellent results, but is highly labour-, time-, and cost-efficient. Moreover, we could show that addition of PDL or PEI also works similarly well in animal-free culture using human platelet lysate instead of fetal bovine serum. Interestingly, additional experiments showed that strong cell attachment requires only cationic polymers but not fetal bovine serum or human platelet lysate added to the medium."
https://openalex.org/W4284960489,"Introduction Epigenetic changes that cause genomic instability may be the basis of pathogenic processes of age-associated noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Essential hypertension is one of the most common NCDs. Alu hypomethylation is an epigenetic event that is commonly found in elderly individuals. Epigenomic alterations are also found in age-associated NCDs such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Alu methylation prevents DNA from being damaged. Therefore, Alu hypomethylated DNA accumulates DNA damage and, as a result, causes organ function deterioration. Here, we report that Alu hypomethylation is a biomarker for essential hypertension. Results We investigated Alu methylation levels in white blood cells from normal controls, patients with prehypertension, and patients with hypertension. The hypertension group possessed the lowest Alu methylation level when classified by systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0088, respectively). In the hypertension group, a higher diastolic blood pressure and a lower Alu methylation level were observed (r = -0.6278). Moreover, we found that changes in Alu hypomethylation in the four years of follow-up in the same person were directly correlated with increased diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions Similar to other age-associated NCDs, Alu hypomethylation is found in essential hypertension and is directly correlated with severity, particularly with diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, Alu hypomethylation may be linked with the molecular pathogenesis of high blood pressure and can be used for monitoring the clinical outcome of this disease."

Here, we developed a novel label-free microelectronic impedance spectroscopy for non-invasive and rapid characterization of exosomes based on their unique dielectric properties. The device is comprised of an insulator-based dielectrophoretic (iDEP) module for exosomes isolation followed by an impedance spectroscopy utilizing the embedded micro-electrodes. This device is capable of distinguishing between exosomes harvested from different cellular origins as the result of their unique membrane and cytosolic compositions at a wide range of frequency. Therefore, it has the potential to be further evolved as a rapid tool for characterization of pathogenic exosomes in clinical settings."

We investigated the scenic resources in the Yesanpo National Park based on 3S technology. The Nearest-Neighbor Index, Kernel density estimation, imbalance index, and geographical concentration index in modern geography were introduced into the spatial distribution evaluation of scenic resources, and here, for the first time, the spatial combination index of scenic resources was proposed as one of the quantitative analysis indices of spatial distribution of scenic resources. Moreover, the spatial combination distribution characteristics of scenic resources were analyzed quantitatively and graphically. The characteristics of the spatial distribution of scenic resources in the Yesanpo National Park were as follows: The spatial distribution type of scenic spots in the Yesanpo National Park is a clustered type. The spatial distribution of the scenic resource groups in the Yesanpo National Park was extremely imbalanced and highly concentrated. Based on the identification of scenic resources, we evaluated the scenic resources of each area and propose sustainable development plans for each area. This evaluation method can be applied to similar national parks to promote the quantitative and graphical evaluation of the spatial distribution of scenic resources and provide support for the decision-making processes related to national park planning and management."
https://openalex.org/W4284963831,"Reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis triggered by the decline in serum progesterone in mid-gestation is an uncommon trait that distinguishes the vizcacha from most mammals. Accessory corpora lutea (aCL) developed upon this event have been proposed as guarantors of the restoration of the progesterone levels necessary to mantain gestation. Therefore, the steroidogenic input of primary CL (pCL) vs aCL was evaluated before and after HPO axis-reactivation (BP and AP respectively) and in term pregnancy (TP). Nonpregnant-ovulated females (NP) were considered as the pCL-starting point group. In BP, the ovaries mainly showed pCL, whose LH receptor (LHR), StAR, 3β-HSD, 20α-HSD, and VEGF immunoexpressions were similar or lower than those of NP. In AP, luteal reactivity increased significantly compared to the previous stages, and the pool of aCL developed in this stage represented 20% of the ovarian structures, equaling the percentage of pCL. Both pCL and aCL luteal cells shared similar histological features consistent with secretory activity. Although pCL and aCL showed equivalent labeling intensity for the luteotropic markers, pCL were significantly larger than aCL. Towards TP, both showed structural disorganization and loss of secretory characteristics. No significant DNA fragmentation was detected in luteal cells throughout gestation. Our findings indicate that the LH surge derived from HPO axis-reactivation targets the pCL and boost luteal steroidogenesis and thus progesterone production. Because there are many LHR-expressing antral follicles in BP, they also respond to the LH stimuli and luteinize without extruding the oocyte. These aCL certainly contribute but it is the steroidogenic restart of the pCL that is the main force that restores progesterone levels, ensuring that gestation is carried to term. Most importantly, the results of this work propose luteal steroidogenesis reboot as a key event in the modulation of vizcacha pregnancy and depict yet another distinctive aspect of its reproductive endocrinology."
https://openalex.org/W4284966381,"Strong anthropogenic pressures on global forests necessitate that managed forests be evaluated as habitat for biodiversity. The complex pattern of habitat types created in forestry systems is ideal for analyses through the theoretical framework of alpha (local), gamma (total) and beta (compositional) diversity. Here I use saproxylic beetles, a species-rich threatened group, to compare four Norway spruce-dominated habitats representative of the boreal forest landscape of northern Europe: unmanaged semi-natural stands, nature reserves, unthinned middle-aged production stands and commercially thinned production stands. The beetles (in total 38 085 individuals of 312 species), including red-listed ones and three feeding guilds (wood consumers, fungivores and predators) were studied in 53 stands in central-southern Sweden, in two regions with differing amounts of conservation forest. Alpha diversity of saproxylic, but not red-listed, beetles was higher in the thinned stands than in the semi-natural stands, and did not differ for the other forest types. Beta diversity of saproxylic beetles was higher in unmanaged semi-natural stands than in the other forest types, but species composition did not differ noticeably. Furthermore, red-listed saproxylic beetles had higher gamma diversity in unmanaged semi-natural stands in the region with more conservation forest, but not in the one with less such forest. The local factors dead wood volume and dead wood diversity did not influence alpha diversity of beetles, but increasing canopy openness had a minor negative influence on saproxylic and red-listed beetles. While the local scale (alpha diversity) indicates the potential for managed forests to house many saproxylic beetle species associated with spruce forests in this boreal landscape, the larger scales (beta and gamma diversity) indicate the value of unmanaged forests for the conservation of the entire saproxylic beetle fauna. These results show the importance of analyses at multiple levels of diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) for identifying patterns relevant to conservation."

Bivariate and multivariate ordinal regression statistics were performed.Fourteen percent (n = 193,14.2%) identified as LGBTQ+. Variables significantly associated with LGBTQ+ included: COVID testing/treatment affordability, canceled activities, stocking food/medications, quitting job, lost income, and inability to procure groceries/cleaning supplies/medications.

https://openalex.org/W4284968660,"Objectives Common mental disorders in combination with work-related stress are widespread in the western world, not least in Sweden. Various interactive factors, primarily work-related, have impact on the return to work process, for example; a supportive communicative function between the person on sick leave and the employer may facilitate this process. The aim was to investigate experiences of being part of a collaborative care model including a person-centered dialogue meeting with the employer and with a rehabilitation coordinator as the moderator. Methods A qualitative design based on individual interviews with 13 persons diagnosed with common mental disorders who participated in an extensive collaborative care model, called the Co-Work-Care model. Persons were recruited as a heterogeneous sample with respect to age, gender, work background, and time since the intervention. All interviews were analyzed with Systematic Text Condensation. Results Five codes synthesized the results: 1) A feeling of being taken care of, 2) Collaboration within the team was perceived as supportive, 3) An active and sensitive listener, 4) Structure and planning in the dialogue meeting, 5) The person-centered dialogue meeting was supportive and provided increased understanding. Conclusions Participants experienced the close collaborative contact with the care manager and the rehabilitation coordinator as highly valuable for their rehabilitation process. Participants valued a well-structured dialogue meeting that included initial planning and a thorough communication involving the patient, the employer, and coordinator. Further, participants appreciated having an active role during the meeting, also empowering the return to work process."
https://openalex.org/W4284969709,"The study aimed to assess the quality of training programs for teachers of students with disabilities in light of recent trends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The descriptive-inferential approach was used in this study, which was applied to male and female teachers who attended an initiative of training teachers of students with disabilities. The initiative was launched by the Ministry of Education in the summers of 2019/2020. The sample of the study consisted of (272) teachers who were chosen by the stratified random sampling method from three cities (Jeddah, Makkah, and Taif). To achieve the objective of the study, a questionnaire was used to collect data after checking the issues of validity and reliability indications. The results of the study revealed that the overall degree of the assessment of the quality of training programs for teachers of students with disabilities in light of recent trends from the point of view of the study sample was medium. Also, there were statistically significant differences in the assessment degree of the quality of training programs for teachers of students with disabilities in light of recent trends due to academic qualification in favor of postgraduate studies, and years of experience for those with more than 10 years of experience. However, no statistically significant differences were shown due to gender. In light of these results, the study presented some recommendations. There were weaknesses in the training programs in terms of training teachers on their various roles and responsibilities, standards for the effective use of educational skills, and the development of values and ideas. Also, these training programs did not take into account the development of the values associated with technology and its relationship to teachers. In light of the results, the study recommended that the Ministry of Education should pay attention to the adoption of a strategic plan to improve the quality of training programs for the teachers of students with disabilities by relying on modern models and trends in teacher training. I addition, there is a need to conduct a diagnostic study of the most important challenges and obstacles and proposed solutions to the quality of training programs for the teachers of students with disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W4284969816,"Individual animals engage in many behaviours which are mutually exclusive, and so where individuals increase the duration of time spent on one type of behavioural activity, this must be offset by a corresponding decrease in at least one other type of behaviour. To understand the variation observed in animal behaviour, researchers need to know how individuals trade-off these mutually-exclusive behaviours within their time-activity budget. In this study, we used remotely collected behavioural observations made from a live-streaming webcam to investigate trade-offs in the behaviour of two bird species, the mute swan (Cygnus olor) and whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus). For both species, we tested for correlations in the duration of time spent on key mutually exclusive behaviours: aggression, foraging, maintenance, and resting. We detected a negative association between aggression and resting behaviours in both species, indicating that increased aggression is achieved at the expense of resting behaviour. In contrast, there was no apparent trade-off between aggression and foraging, aggression and maintenance, or maintenance and resting. Foraging and resting behaviours were negatively correlated in both species, highlighting a trade-off between these distinct modes of behaviour. A trade-off between foraging and maintenance behaviours was detected for the sedentary mute swans, but not the migratory whooper swans. Our findings show how birds can trade-off their time investments in mutually exclusive behaviours within their time-activity budgets. Moreover, our study demonstrates how remotely-collected data can be used to investigate fundamental questions in behavioural research."

In this paper, a novel robust audio zero-watermarking scheme is designed by applying non-negative matrix decomposition algorithm to zero-watermarking technology. Firstly, the proposed scheme divides the input audio signal into fixed frames, then applies fast Fourier transform(FFT) and non-negative matrix factorization(NMF) algorithm to extract the feature vector of the original audio signal. Finally, XOR the feature vector and the digital watermark sequence to achieve the embedding of zero-watermarking. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme performs more effectively in resisting common and frame-desynchronization attacks than the existing zero-watermarking schemes."
https://openalex.org/W4284974160,"Objectives This study assessed risk adjustment performance of six comorbidity indices in two categories of comorbidity measures: diagnosis-based comorbidity indices and medication-based ones in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods This was a population–based retrospective cohort study. Data used in this study were sourced from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study population comprised all patients who were hospitalized due to COPD for the first time in the target year of 2012. Each qualified patient was individually followed for one year starting from the index date to assess two outcomes of interest, medical expenditures within one year after discharge and in-hospital mortality of patients. To assess how well the added comorbidity measures would improve the fitted model, we calculated the log-likelihood ratio statistic G 2 . Subsequently, we compared risk adjustment performance of the comorbidity indices by using the Harrell c -statistic measure derived from multiple logistic regression models. Results Analytical results demonstrated that that comorbidity measures were significant predictors of medical expenditures and mortality of COPD patients. Specifically, in the category of diagnosis-based comorbidity indices the Elixhauser index was superior to other indices, while the RxRisk-V index was a stronger predictor in the framework of medication-based codes, for gauging both medical expenditures and in-hospital mortality by utilizing information from the index hospitalization only as well as the index and prior hospitalizations. Conclusions In conclusion, this work has ascertained that comorbidity indices are significant predictors of medical expenditures and mortality of COPD patients. Based on the study findings, we propose that when designing the payment schemes for patients with chronic diseases, the health authority should make adjustments in accordance with the burden of health care caused by comorbid conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4284974379,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and often coexists with myocardial fibrosis (MF); however, the causality of these conditions is not well established. Objective We aim to corroborate AF to MF causality by quantifying left atrial (LA) fibrosis in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images after persistent rapid ventricular pacing and subsequent AF using a canine model and histopathological validation. Methods Twelve canines (9 experimental, 3 control) underwent baseline 3D LGE-CMR imaging at 3T followed by insertion of a pacing device and 5 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing to induce AF (experimental) or no pacing (control). Following the 5 weeks, pacing devices were removed to permit CMR imaging followed by excision of the hearts and histopathological imaging. LA myocardial segmentation was performed manually at baseline and post-pacing to permit volumetric %MF quantification using the image intensity ratio (IIR) technique, wherein fibrosis was defined as pixels &gt; mean LA myocardium intensity + 2SD. Results Volumetric % MF increased by an average of 2.11 ± 0.88% post-pacing in 7 of 9 experimental dogs. While there was a significant difference between paired %MF measurements from baseline to post-pacing in experimental dogs (P = 0.019), there was no significant change in control dogs (P = 0.019 and P = 0.5, Wilcoxon signed rank tests). The median %MF for paced animals was significantly greater than that of non-paced dogs at the 5-week post-insertion time point (P = 0.009, Mann Whitney U test). Histopathological imaging yielded an average %MF of 19.42 ± 4.80% (mean ± SD) for paced dogs compared to 1.85% in one control dog. Conclusion Persistent rapid ventricular pacing and subsequent AF leads to an increase in LA fibrosis volumes measured by the IIR technique; however, quantification is limited by inherent image acquisition parameters and observer variability."
https://openalex.org/W4284976237,"Background Although many biomarkers have high diagnostic and predictive power for diabetic kidney disease (DKD), less studies were performed for the predictive assessment in DKD and its progression with combined blood and urinary biomarkers. This study aims to explore the predictive significance of joint plasma fibrinogen (FIB) concentration and urinary alpha-1 microglobulin-creatinine (α1-MG/CR) ratio in DKD. Methods A total of 234 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled, and their clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively assessed. A ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the power of plasma FIB and urinary α1-MG/CR ratio for identifying DKD and advanced DKD, respectively. The predictive power for DKD and advanced DKD was analyzed by regression analysis. Results Plasma FIB and urinary α1-MG/CR levels were higher in patients with DKD than with pure T2D (p&lt;0.001). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 5.047 (95%CI: 2.276–10.720) and 2.192 (95%CI: 1.539–3.122) (p&lt;0.001) for FIB and α1-MG/CR as continuous variables for DKD prediction, respectively. The optimal cut-off values were 3.21 g/L and 2.11mg/mmol for identifying DKD, and 5.58 g/L and 11.07 mg/mmol for advanced DKD from ROC curves. At these cut-off values, the sensitivity and specificity of joint FIB and α1-MG/CR were 0.95 and 0.92 for identifying DKD, and 0.62 and 0.67 for identifying advanced DKD, respectively. The area under curve was 0.972 (95%CI: 0.948–0.995) (p&lt;0.001) and 0.611, 95%CI: 0.488–0.734) (p&gt;0.05). The multivariate-adjusted ORs for joint FIB and α1-MG/CR at the cut-off values were 214.500 (95%CI: 58.054–792.536) and 3.252 (95%CI: 1.040–10.175) (p&lt;0.05), respectively. Conclusion The present study suggests that joint plasma FIB concentration and urinary α1-MG/CR ratio can be used as a powerful predictor for general DKD, but it is less predictive for advanced DKD."
https://openalex.org/W4284977767,"Many lichens are well known to accumulate radiocaesium and, thus acting as biomonitors of contamination levels. However, the actual localisation and chemical forms of radiocaesium in contaminated lichens have not yet been elucidated because, despite their high radioactivity, these forms are present in trace amounts as chemical entities. Here, we use autoradiography and demonstrate for the first time in situ microscale localisation of radiocaesium within thallus tissues to investigate the radiocaesium forms and their accumulation mechanism. Radiocaesium distributions showed similar trends in lichen tissues collected two and six years after the Fukushima nuclear accident. The radiocaesium was localised in the brown pigmented parts i.e., melanin-like substances, in the lower cortex of lichen thallus. Quantum chemical calculations showed that functional group of melanin-like substances can chelate Cs + ion, which indicates that the Cs + ions form complexes with the substances. Based on these findings, we suggest that radiocaesium ions may be retained stably in melanin-like substances for long periods (two to six years) due to steric factors, such as those seen in porphyrin-like structures and via multimer formation in the lower cortex. In addition, electron microscopy and autoradiography were used to observe radiocaesium-bearing microparticles (CsMPs) on/in the upper cortex and around the medullary layer. Micron-sized particles appeared to adhere to the surface tissue of the thallus, as shown by electron microscopy, suggesting that the particles were trapped by development of an adhesive layer; that is, CsMPs were trapped both physically and physiologically. These findings provide information on in situ localisation of two chemical forms of radiocaesium, cations and particles, in lichen thallus tissues and their accumulation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4284958553,"The wavelength-dependent photo-reactivity of polyanthracene was explored upon UV-C and VIS light irradiation. The material was prepared via one-pot chemical oxidation route using FeCl3 as oxidizing agent. A decrease in surface hydrophobicity of a polyanthracene-coated poly(methylmethacrylate) substrate from 109.11° to 60.82° was observed upon UV-C exposure for 48 hrs which was attributed to increase in oxygen content at the surface, as validated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Upon exposure to ultraviolet-visible LEDs, photo-dimerization of polyanthracene in solution occurred and was monitored using UV-VIS spectroscopy. The photo-dimer product formation decreased from 381 nm to 468 nm and was found to be higher for the polyanthracene material compared to the monomer anthracene. At 381 nm, photo-dimerization of the material was found to be approx. 4x more efficient than the non-substituted monomer counterpart. Results obtained show that photo-dimerization of polyanthracene will proceed upon exposure with visible light LEDs with reduction in efficiency at longer wavelengths. To compensate, irradiation power of the light source and irradiation time were increased."
https://openalex.org/W4284959486,"Most developing economies have recently experienced significant economic growth without corresponding substantial poverty reduction and improved population wellbeing. This paper uses a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model to explore the growth-poverty relationship in Tanzania using annual time series data on per capita consumption expenditure, real GDP, GINI index, and unemployment from 1991–2020. To explore the causality among the variables and long-run asymmetry between per capita consumption expenditure and economic growth, the study employs Granger causality and Wild test respectively. The results confirm the presence of long and short-run asymmetric behavior of economic growth. Besides, in the short-run, the Granger causality test supported the feedback hypothesis between economic growth and consumption expenditure, and the unidirectional hypothesis from income inequality and unemployment to consumption expenditure. In the long-run, unidirectional causality was observed from consumption expenditure to both economic growth and unemployment. The study submits that while economic growth exhibits poverty reduction features, growth alone is not sufficient to alleviate poverty because the interaction of income inequality with economic growth dampens the poverty-reducing effects of economic growth. Therefore, economic growth has a significant explanation for poverty but not all about the evolution of poverty. The study opens policy perspectives with wide international relevancy as outlined in the policy implication section."

Our objective was to compare non-targeted plasma metabolomic profiles of women with versus without confirmed incident DM. We focused on three lipid classes (fatty acyls, prenol lipids, polyketides). Materials and methods Fifty DM cases and 100 individually matched control participants (80% with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) were enrolled in a case-control study nested within the Women’s Interagency HIV Study. Stored blood samples (1–2 years prior to DM diagnosis among cases; at the corresponding timepoint among matched controls) were assayed in triplicate for metabolomics. Time-of-flight liquid chromatography mass spectrometry with dual electrospray ionization modes was utilized. We considered 743 metabolomic features in a two-stage feature selection approach with conditional logistic regression models that accounted for matching strata. Results Seven features differed by DM case status (all false discovery rate-adjusted q&lt;0.05). Three flavonoids (two flavanones, one isoflavone) were respectively associated with lower odds of DM (all q&lt;0.05), and sorbic acid was associated with greater odds of DM (all q&lt;0.05). Conclusion Flavonoids were associated with lower odds of incident DM while sorbic acid was associated with greater odds of incident DM."
https://openalex.org/W4284962007,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is often accompanied by gastrointestinal dysfunction due to the disconnection of the spinal autonomic nervous system. Gastrointestinal dysfunction reportedly upregulates intestinal permeability, leading to bacterial translocation of the gut microbiome to the systemic circulation, which further activates systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuronal damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) reportedly ameliorate SCI. Here, we aimed to investigate their effect on the associated gastrointestinal dysfunction. Human amnion-derived MSC (AMSCs) were intravenously transplanted one day after a rat model of midthoracic SCI. Biodistribution of transplanted cells, behavioral assessment, and histological evaluations of the spinal cord and intestine were conducted to elucidate the therapeutic effect of AMSCs. Bacterial translocation of the gut microbiome was examined by in situ hybridization and bacterial culture of the liver. Systemic inflammations were examined by blood cytokines, infiltrating immune cells in the spinal cord, and the size of the peripheral immune tissue. AMSCs released various neurotrophic factors and were mainly distributed in the liver and lung after transplantation. AMSC-transplanted animals showed smaller spinal damage and better neurological recovery with preserved neuronal tract. AMSCs transplantation ameliorated intestinal dysfunction both morphologically and functionally, which prevented translocation of the gut microbiome to the systemic circulation. Systemic inflammations were decreased in animals receiving AMSCs in the chronic phase. Intravenous AMSC administration during the acute phase of SCI rescues both spinal damage and intestinal dysfunction. Reducing bacterial translocation may contribute to decreasing systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4284962846,"Dendritic cells (DCs) promote HIV-1 transmission by acting as Trojan horses, capturing viral particles, facilitating the infection of CD4+ T-cells. Vitamin D (VitD) has shown to decrease T cell activation, reducing susceptibility to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-cells in vitro; however, if VitD decreases viral transfer from DCs to CD4+ T-cells is unknown. In this study, we co-cultured HIV-1-pulsed immature and LPS mature monocytes-derived DCs (iDCs and LmDCs, respectively), differentiated in presence or absence of calcitriol (VitD active form), with PHA-activated autologous CD4+ T-cells from 16 healthy donors. In co-cultures of iDCs and LmDCs treated with calcitriol, there was a significant decrease in frequency of infected CD4+ T-cells, evaluated by flow cytometry. However, p24 levels evaluated by ELISA were not significantly reduced in culture supernatants. Moreover, calcitriol-treated iDCs exhibited decreased expression of genes involved in HIV-1 transfer compared to the control. Both, calcitriol-treated iDCs and LmDCs exhibit a similar gene expression profile, probably related to a transcriptional balance achieved after long treatment with calcitriol. Since calcitriol-differentiated DCs express on their surface a lower amount of DC-SIGN and SIGLEC-1 molecules, widely associated with HIV-1 transfer, suggesting that this mechanism contributes to a lower transfer of viral particles by the DCs."
https://openalex.org/W4284962983,"Migrant workers greatly contributing to China's industrialization and urbanization are confronted with increasing health risks. This study empirically investigates the effects of public employment services on the self-rated health of migrant workers in Shanghai China, by using data from the National Bureau of Statistics from 2015 to 2020. The estimation results under the Ordered Probit model illustrate that public employment services significantly improve the self-rated health of migrant workers, and vocational training, job development and other related services show an apparently positive correlation with the self-rated health. The marginal effect analysis reveals that public employment services obviously reduce the probability of health satisfaction as ""average"", ""relatively satisfied"" and ""relatively dissatisfied"", which translate into a significant increase in the probability of ""very satisfied"". The mechanism analysis verifies that public employment services enhance the self-rated health by increasing the proportion of medical insurance and injury insurance of migrant workers. The results are still reliable by adopting the methods of subsample regression, Propensity Score Matching and variable substitution to conduct robustness checks. This study further enriches the literature on public employment services and the health status of migrant workers, and provides policy implications on improving the health status of migrant workers and the public employment service system of China under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4284966040,"Perioperative blood transfusion in colorectal and some other cancer patients has been linked to the increased risk for recurrence, but a causal mechanism remains unclear. During the preparation and storage of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) bio-active substances accumulate in the acellular fraction (supernatant). Viability, proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and DNA damage of colon (LoVo) and breast (MCF7) adenocarcinoma cells and non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cell line were determined in response to the supernatants of fresh and long-stored (day 42) PRBCs, leukoreduced (LR) or non-leukoreduced (NLR). The effect of supernatants on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (cisPt) towards the cells was also examined. Supernatants, especially from a day 1 PRBCs, both LR and NLR, reduced the viability and inhibited proliferation of tumor cells (LoVo, MCF7), accompanying by the excessive ROS production, but these were not the case in MCF-10A. Moreover, supernatants had no effect on the cytotoxicity of cisPt against LoVo and MCF7 cells, while caused increased drug resistance in MCF-10A cells. The findings suggest the acellular fraction of PRBCs does not exhibit any pro-proliferative activity in the cancer cell lines studied. However, these are pioneering issues and require further research."
https://openalex.org/W4284966285,"This study addresses the question whether an 'attention reminder' in discrete choice experiments (DCE) affects preferences, willingness to pay (WTP), and attribute non-attendance (ANA). We report on an experiment which elicited preferences for livestock market facilities from 960 randomly selected farm households in Ethiopia. Basic diagnostic comparisons of the estimations showed that taste parameters are significantly different and the WTP values of two (out of eight) facilities are different between before and after the reminder. Latent class model based ANA analysis revealed that the reminder has increased fully compensatory choice behavior [full attention] among sample respondents. The mixed logit models estimated in WTP space also showed that the WTP values are slightly smaller for most of the facilities after the reminder. In terms of relative importance, veterinary clinic, fenced shed, and watering trough facilities are the three livestock market facilities valued most by the farm households both before and after the reminder. Our results imply that researchers studying behaviors of rural communities in developing countries using DCEs might be able to address issues related to heuristics if they reminded respondents of the need to pay attention to all elements in the experiment unless understanding the choice decision making process itself is the point of interest. Empirically, livestock market development initiatives need to take into account farmers' clear and consistent prioritization of the market facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4284966466,"The earth’s geomagnetic field (GMF) is known to influence the behaviour of a wide range of species, but remains one of the most enigmatic of animal senses. Animals are known to utilize the GMF for a wide range of survival capabilities such as navigation and orienteering, migration, territoriality, homing, etc. Despite a lot of study in this regard on vertebrates, little is known about the effects of GMF on felids. Hence, we analyzed the body alignment of the Indian Leopard during defecation, and walking along the trails in the Jhalana Reserve Forest in India. Using circular statistics, we found that the leopards aligned their bodies on the north-south axis during defecation (mean azimuth -176.4°), while no such preference was found when walking (mean azimuth 52.9°). Thus we prove that leopards are sensitive to the GMF during basic physiological activities and in this context show similar behaviour to other vertebrates studied to date."
https://openalex.org/W4284968502,"Solution NMR spectroscopy is a well-established tool with unique advantages for structural studies of RNA molecules. However, for large RNA sequences, the NMR resonances often overlap severely. A reliable way to perform resonance assignment and allow further analysis despite spectral crowding is the use of site-specific isotope labeling in sample preparation. While solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis has several advantages, RNA length and availability of isotope-labeled building blocks are persistent issues. Purely enzymatic methods represent an alternative and have been presented in the literature. In this study, we report on a method in which we exploit the preference of T7 RNA polymerase for nucleotide monophosphates over triphosphates for the 5’ position, which allows 5’-labeling of RNA. Successive ligation to an unlabeled RNA strand generates a site-specifically labeled RNA. We show the successful production of such an RNA sample for NMR studies, report on experimental details and expected yields, and present the surprising finding of a previously hidden set of peaks which reveals conformational exchange in the RNA structure. This study highlights the feasibility of site-specific isotope-labeling of RNA with enzymatic methods."
https://openalex.org/W4284968826,"The prognosis of the patients with inoperable or advanced granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) is still poor, and therefore it is important to establish a novel treatment strategy. Here we investigated the in vitro effects of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat (PS) on two GCT cell lines (KGN and COV434). GCT cell lines were found to be susceptible to PS treatment and it inhibited cell growth mainly by apoptosis. In cell cycle analysis, PS reduced only the ratio of S phase in GCT cell lines. Combined treatment of PS with a deubiquitinase inhibitor, VLX1570 enhanced the expression of p21, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-9, heme oxygenase-1, and the acetylation of histone H4 and α-tubulin, leading to an additive anti-proliferative effect on KGN and COV434. The gene set enrichment analysis revealed that PS treatment suppressed DNA replication- or cell cycle-related gene expression which led to chemotherapeutic cell death and in addition, this treatment induced activation of the gene set of adherens junction towards a normalized direction as well as activation of neuron-related gene sets that might imply unexpected differentiation potential due to epigenetic modification by a HDAC inhibitor in KGN cells. Exposure of KGN and COV434 cells to PS increased the expression of E-cadherin, one of the principal regulators associated with adherens junction in quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis. In the present study, we indicate a basis of a novel therapeutic availability of a HDAC inhibitor for the treatment of GCTs and further investigations will be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4284970919,"The impacts of early pregnancy and young motherhood on everyday life, including interpersonal and individual behavior, are not well-known. Passive digital sensing on mobile technology including smartphones and passive Bluetooth beacons can yield information such as geographic movement, physical activity, and mother-infant proximity to illuminate behavioral patterns of a mother's everyday in Nepal. We contribute to mixed-methods research by triangulating passive sensing data (GPS, accelerometry, Bluetooth proximity) with multiple forms of qualitative data to characterize behavioral patterns and experiences of young motherhood in the first year postpartum. We triangulated this digital information in a constant comparative analysis with in-depth interviews, daily diaries, and fieldnotes. We reveal typical behavioral patterns of rural young mothers and highlight opportunities for integrating this information to improve health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4284971629,"Elephants show a strong selection towards areas with high foraging opportunities at the landscape level making top-down decisions by first selecting patch types within landscapes and finally species within them. Understanding forage selection in a multi-use landscape is critical for prioritising patches for habitat management, ensuring availability of selected forage, helping in minimizing pressure on food crops and subsequent negative interactions with people. We assessed dry season forage selection in a multi-use landscape of West Bengal state, India. Relative forage use and relative plant species availability ratio were calculated to assess forage selection in a multi-use landscape comprising of the forest, tea estates, agricultural land, and human settlement. Forage use was assessed using the opportunistic feeding trail observation method (150.01 km). Stratified random sampling was used to assess plant species availability using the quadrat method (123 plots of 0.1 ha each). Among 286 plant species recorded, 132 plant species were consumed by elephants. A majority (80.21%) of plant species were consumed more than the proportional availability thereby showing selective foraging during the dry season in the study area. From forest to semi-open forest and open forest, canopy layer tree density and the total number of species decreased whereas invasive species density increased. This indicates the high impact on the forage species availability for elephants and the requirement of appropriate habitat management strategies. The presence of 32.14% of the selected forage species in human-use landscape alone demands the development of conservation interventions. This is the first study to assess forage selection by elephants in a multi-use landscape and used to prioritise conservation and management strategies at a landscape level."
https://openalex.org/W4284973423,"We study the U.S. Supreme Court dynamics by analyzing the temporal evolution of the underlying policy positions of the Supreme Court Justices as reflected by their actual voting data, using functional data analysis methods. The proposed fully flexible nonparametric method makes it possible to dissect the time-dynamics of policy positions at the level of individual Justices, as well as providing a comprehensive view of the ideology evolution over the history of Supreme Court since its establishment. In addition to quantifying individual Justice’s policy positions, we uncover average changes over time and also the major patterns of change over time. Additionally, our approach allows for representing highly complex dynamic trajectories by a few principal components which complements other models of analyzing and predicting court behavior."
