https://openalex.org/W2076142853,"The intranuclear position of many genes has been correlated with their activity state, suggesting that migration to functional subcompartments may influence gene expression. Indeed, nascent RNA production and RNA polymerase II seem to be localized into discrete foci or 'transcription factories'. Current estimates from cultured cells indicate that multiple genes could occupy the same factory, although this has not yet been observed. Here we show that, during transcription in vivo, distal genes colocalize to the same transcription factory at high frequencies. Active genes are dynamically organized into shared nuclear subcompartments, and movement into or out of these factories results in activation or abatement of transcription. Thus, rather than recruiting and assembling transcription complexes, active genes migrate to preassembled transcription sites."

https://openalex.org/W2105788966,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short ( approximately 22-nt) noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate expression of their mRNA targets. Since their discovery as regulators of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans, hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in both animals and plants. Here, we report a technique for visualizing detailed miRNA expression patterns in mouse embryos. We elucidate the tissue-specific expression of several miRNAs during embryogenesis, including two encoded by genes embedded in homeobox (Hox) clusters, miR-10a and miR-196a. These two miRNAs are expressed in patterns that are markedly reminiscent of those of Hox genes. Furthermore, miR-196a negatively regulates Hoxb8, indicating that its restricted expression pattern probably reflects a role in the patterning function of the Hox complex."
https://openalex.org/W2025645148,"In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), transcription factors are known to be deregulated by chromosomal translocations, but mutations in protein tyrosine kinases have only rarely been identified. Here we describe the extrachromosomal (episomal) amplification of ABL1 in 5 of 90 (5.6%) individuals with T-ALL, an aberration that is not detectable by conventional cytogenetics. Molecular analyses delineated the amplicon as a 500-kb region from chromosome band 9q34, containing the oncogenes ABL1 and NUP214 (refs. 5,6). We identified a previously undescribed mechanism for activation of tyrosine kinases in cancer: the formation of episomes resulting in a fusion between NUP214 and ABL1. We detected the NUP214-ABL1 transcript in five individuals with the ABL1 amplification, in 5 of 85 (5.8%) additional individuals with T-ALL and in 3 of 22 T-ALL cell lines. The constitutively phosphorylated tyrosine kinase NUP214-ABL1 is sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. The recurrent cryptic NUP214-ABL1 rearrangement is associated with increased HOX expression and deletion of CDKN2A, consistent with a multistep pathogenesis of T-ALL. NUP214-ABL1 expression defines a new subgroup of individuals with T-ALL who could benefit from treatment with imatinib."
https://openalex.org/W2116905957,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a fatal disease of unknown etiology characterized by impaired regulation of pulmonary hemodynamics and vascular growth, is associated with low levels of pulmonary nitric oxide (NO). Based upon its critical role in mediating vasodilation and cell growth, decrease of NO has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. We evaluated mechanisms for low NO and pulmonary hypertension, including NO synthases (NOS) and factors regulating NOS activity, i.e. the substrate arginine, arginase expression and activity, and endogenous inhibitors of NOS in patients with PAH and healthy controls. PAH lungs had normal NOS I–III expression, but substrate arginine levels were inversely related to pulmonary artery pressures. Activity of arginase, an enzyme that regulates NO biosynthesis through effects on arginine, was higher in PAH serum than in controls, with high-level arginase expression localized by immunostaining to pulmonary endothelial cells. Further, pulmonary artery endothelial cells derived from PAH lung had higher arginase II expression and produced lower NO than control cells in vitro. Thus, substrate availability affects NOS activity and vasodilation, implicating arginase II and alterations in arginine metabolic pathways in the pathophysiology of PAH."

https://openalex.org/W2172145396,"In extinction, an animal learns that a previously conditioned stimulus (CS+) no longer predicts delivery of a salient reinforcer (unconditioned stimulus, UCS). Rodent studies indicate that extinction relies on amygdala-prefrontal interactions and involves formation of memories that inhibit, without actually erasing, the original conditioning trace. Whether extinction learning in humans follows similar neurobiological principles is unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure human brain activity evoked during olfactory aversive conditioning and extinction learning. Neural responses in orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala were preferentially enhanced during extinction, suggesting potential cross-species preservation of learning mechanisms that oppose conditioning. Moreover, by manipulating UCS aversiveness via reinforcer inflation, we showed that a CS+ retains access to representations of UCS value in distinct regions of ventral prefrontal cortex, even as extinction proceeds."
https://openalex.org/W2031840166,"Obesity and stress inhibit insulin action by activating protein kinases that enhance serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and have been thus associated to insulin resistance and the development of type II diabetes. The protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) is activated by free-fatty acids, and its activity is higher in muscle from obese diabetic patients. However, a molecular link between PKCθ and insulin resistance has not been defined yet. Here we show that PKCθ phosphorylates IRS1 at serine 1101 blocking IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of the Akt pathway. Mutation of Ser1101 to alanine makes IRS1 insensitive to the effect of PKCθ and restores insulin signaling in culture cells. These results provide a novel mechanism linking the activation of PKCθ to the inhibition of insulin signaling.

Insulin regulates blood glucose uptake and metabolism by binding to the insulin receptor (IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; IKK, IκB kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and activating its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The IR phosphorylates downstream targets such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, which mediate most of the biological actions of insulin (1Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). IRS1 is the best-studied IR kinase substrate. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS1 interacts with Src homology domain-2-containing proteins such as the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, SHP2, Nck, and others (1Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K leads to stimulation of Akt, which contributes to increased glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis (2Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E.

Prolonged activation of the insulin receptor, free fatty acids, and cellular stress can result in serine phosphorylation and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, thereby attenuating insulin signaling (1Zick Y.

However, it has been difficult to determine which serine residues are the most relevant for different physiological or pathological stimuli. Extensive analysis suggests that phosphorylation of mouse IRS1 at Ser307 (Ser312 in human IRS1) by JNK is important for inflammatory stimuli-mediated inhibition of IRS1 function and in mouse models of obesity-driven type II diabetes (4Aguirre V.

Chronic elevation of plasma free fatty acid levels has been linked to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and correlates with obesity and type II diabetes (14Dresner A. Laurent D. Marcucci M. Griffin M.E. Dufour S. Cline G.W. Slezak L.A. Andersen D.K. Hundal R.S. Rothman D.L. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

High plasma free fatty acid concentrations have also been associated with increased expression and activation of PKCθ, the most abundant PKC isoform in skeletal muscle (16Qu X. Seale J.P. Donnelly R. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Itani S.I. Pories W.J. Macdonald K.G. Dohm G.L.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). This novel PKC isoform can be activated by different intracellular fatty acid metabolites such as fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglycerol, as well as by phorbol esters (TPA) (20Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50230-50236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Since IRS1 is the major mediator of the insulin response in the muscle (22Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that that PKCθ activation may down-regulate insulin signaling by affecting serine phosphorylation of IRS1 (11Greene M.W. Morrice N. Garofalo R.S. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Yu C. Chen Y. Cline G.W. Zhang D. Zong H. Wang Y. Bergeron R. Kim J.K. Cushman S.W.

Fatty acids can induce IRS1 phosphorylation at Ser307 in muscle, with a concomitant reduction in its tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS1-associated PI3K (21Yu C. Chen Y. Cline G.W. Zhang D. Zong H. Wang Y. Bergeron R. Kim J.K. Cushman S.W. Cooney G.J. Atcheson B. White M.F. Kraegen E.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50230-50236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). However, PKCθ is not likely to directly phosphorylate IRS1 at Ser307 because it is not a proline-directed kinase. One possibility is that, as described in T cells (23Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), PKCθ activation in the muscle stimulates JNK and IKKβ, two reported Ser307 kinases. This hypothesis would be consistent with studies showing that fat-induced insulin resistance is blocked in JNK1 and IKKβ knock-out mice (12Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar, 24Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Another possibility, explored in this report, is that PKCθ may directly phosphorylate and inhibit IRS1 function. Here we demonstrate that PKCθ inhibits insulin signaling by phosphorylating IRS1 at a serine 1101. Ser1101 phosphorylation in muscle cells is induced by insulin, phorbol esters, free fatty acids, and TNFα and contributes to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and signaling to the PI3K/Akt cascade. Furthermore, we show that mutation of Ser1101 to alanine makes IRS1 refractory to the inhibitory effect of PKCθ on insulin signaling. Reagents—Insulin and arachidonic and oleic acids were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin and bisindolylmaleimide I were purchased from Calbiochem. All antibodies used in this study, except for the PKCθ antibody (BD Biosciences-Transduction Laboratories), were from Cell Signaling Technology. The phosphospecific IRS1(S1101) antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated Ser1101 (see supplementary Table I) and following methods described before (25Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23534-23541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). PKCθ kinase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and other PKC enzymes were obtained from PanVera (now Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Differentiation—Murine C2C12 myocytes and 3T3 L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation was induced according to published protocols (26Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

After differentiation, cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight prior ligand stimulation and preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min as indicated in the figure legend to Fig. 1. Cells were then lysed, and extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting as described below. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-IR/IRS1 and wild-type CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using Polyfect (Qiagen). Animals and Treatment—C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice including Akt2 (27Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L.

Male mice of age 6–8 weeks were fasted for 12 h and injected intraperitoneally with insulin at 1 unit/kg body weight in phosphate-buffered saline or with phosphate-buffered saline alone (total volume of 100–200 μl) for 20 min before sacrifice. The muscle gastrocnemii were then isolated and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in –80 °C before use. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Muscle tissue was cut into small pieces on ice, resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 5 mm Na3VO4, 20mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 200 nm okadaic acid) and Polytron-homogenized. The samples were spun at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. 2 mg of protein from the supernatant was diluted in lysis buffer to 500 μl and immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-IRS-1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated IRS1 complexes from muscle and cultured cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting as described (29Li Y. Eitan S. Wu J. Evans C.J. Kieffer B. Sun X. Polakiewicz R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6255-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assays—PKC and Akt kinases (50 milliunits per assay, normalized for equivalent specific activity) and 200 μm ATP were incubated with 10 μg of purified GST-IRS1-C (900–1235) or paramyosin-MARCKS (amino acids 149–160 of MARKCS) fusion proteins at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 μl (final volume) of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). Lipid mix (0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylserine and 0.05 mg/ml diglycerides) was added in the PKC kinase assays. The reaction was terminated with 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH6.8, 6% w/v SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% w/v bromphenol blue), and samples were immunoblotted as described (29Li Y. Eitan S. Wu J. Evans C.J. Kieffer B. Sun X. Polakiewicz R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6255-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The paramyosin-MARCKS fusion protein was prepared by incubating the MARKCS peptide with bacterially expressed paramyosin and isolated using the IMPACT-CN system (New England Biolabs). The GSK3β-paramyosin fusion protein was from Cell Signaling Technology. Expression Constructs—The wild-type IRS1-HA cDNA construct was kindly provided by Michael J. Quon. A point mutaion of Ser1101 to alanine was generated using site-directed mutagenesis by Bio S&T Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Wild-type murine PKCθ was cloned into pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) to create PKCθ-YFP fusion protein. Site-directed mutagenesis generated the dominant negative PKCθ construct by changing lysine 409 to arginine in the ATP binding domain. Constitutively active PKCθ was created by changing alanine 148 to glutamate in the pseudo-substrate domain. All point mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The PKCθ mutations have been characterized functionally before (30Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role of the PI3K/Akt cascade in insulin signaling prompted us to search for potential serine phosphorylation sites in IRS1 embedded within a putative Akt phosphorylation motif. We searched for such motifs within the IRS1 sequence using the Scansite program (scansite.mit.edu) (31Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Scansite predicted with high stringency at least three potential Akt sites in human IRS1, Ser307, Ser330, and Ser1101 (Ser302, Ser325, and Ser1095 in mouse IRS1, respectively). Earlier studies have proposed that Ser307 and Ser330 were involved in positive regulation of human IRS1 (8Paz K. Liu Y.F. Shorer H. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Quan M. Kanety H. Seger R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28816-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recently, the phosphorylation of Ser307 (Ser302 in mouse/rat IRS1) has been confirmed (32Giraud J. Leshan R.L. Lee Y.H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 3447-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We focused on Ser1101 located at the COOH-terminal domain of human IRS1, which is highly conserved in mouse IRS1 as well as in human and mouse IRS-2 (supplemental Table I). To determine whether Ser1101 is phosphorylated in vivo, we raised an anti-IRS1-Ser1101 phosphopeptide antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). This antibody was tested using extracts from C2C12 muscle cells (Fig. 1A, right panel) and 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1A, left panel) stimulated with insulin. Extracts were prepared, and IRS1 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the phospho-Ser1101 antibody. Ser1101 became phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation within 15 min. Because of the high homology around the Ser1101 site, the anti-phospho-Ser1101 antibody also detected Ser1149 in human IRS2 immunoprecipitated from CHO-IR-IRS2 cells stimulated with insulin (data not shown). To verify the specificity of the phospho-Ser1101 antibody, CHO cells overexpressing IR and IRS1 were transfected with a wild-type HA-tagged IRS1 construct or a HA-tagged-IRS1 with Ser1101 mutated to alanine (S1101A). Insulin stimulated Ser1101 phosphorylation of wild-type IRS1 but not of the S1101A IRS1 protein (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the anti-phospho-Ser1101 antibody was specific for IRS1 phosphorylated at Ser1101. We then asked whether the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates Ser1101 phosphorylation. Differentiated C2C12 myocytes were stimulated with insulin for 15 min after 30-min preincubation with inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin), PKC (bisindoleimide I), and MEK1/2 (U0126). Ser1101 phosphorylation was not inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 1C), or by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt and the ERK pathways do not regulate this site. Instead, Ser1101 phosphorylation was blocked by the PKC inhibitor, bisindoleimide I (Fig. 1C). Consistently, the phorbol ester (TPA), which activates classical and novel PKCs, induced the phosphorylation at Ser1101 without activating Akt (Fig. 1D). Ser1101 phosphorylation in differentiated C2C12 cells was also stimulated by free fatty acids (arachidonic acid and oleic acid) and TNFα without inducing Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Due to the sequence homology around Ser1101 and Ser1149 the signal detected in Fig. 1, C and D, could also derive from IRS2. Altogether these results suggest that Akt is not involved in Ser1101 phosphorylation. Proline-directed kinases known to phosphorylate IRS1 are unlikely to phosphorylate Ser1101 because it is not followed by a proline. Instead, a PKC isoform or downstream basophilic kinase responsive to fatty acids and TNFα is likely to phosphorylate Ser1101. We thus tested several PKC isoforms for their ability to phosphorylate Ser1101in vitro. A GST-IRS1 fusion protein containing the COOH terminus of IRS1, including Ser1101, was incubated with purified, active PKC isoforms α, β1, β2, γ, η, ζ, ϵ, δ, or θ (Fig. 2A). Upon completion, the reactions were immunoblotted with the anti-phospho-IRS1 Ser1101 antibody. PKCθ potently phosphorylated Ser1101in vitro (Fig. 2A). PKCδ and -γ also phosphorylated Ser1101, though less effectively, whereas all the other PKC isoforms did not. All PKC isoforms used were equally active phosphorylating a peptide containing the PKC site Ser152/156 of the MARCKS protein (33Herget T. Oehrlein S.A. Pappin D.J. Rozengurt E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), chemically fused to the paramyosin protein. PKCθ also phosphorylated full-length IRS1 pulled down from unstimulated CHO/IR/IRS1 cells at Ser1101 (data not shown). The Akt kinase did not phosphorylate full-length or the GST-COOH-terminal IRS1 proteins at Ser1101, although it was active on a known substrate, a GSK3β peptide including Ser9 (data not shown). Based on these results PKCθ, but not Akt, is a good candidate to be an IRS1 Ser1101 kinase. We then investigated the role of PKCθ in the phosphorylation of Ser1101 within cells. CHO-IR/IRS1 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged IRS1 alone or together with a GFP-tagged dominant negative mutant of PKCθ. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated HA-tagged IRS1 at Ser1101, which was reduced to background levels in the presence of co-expressed dominant negative PKCθ (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Endogenous and transfected PKCθ was detected with a PKCθ antibody (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Differentiated C2C12 also expressed detectable levels of endogenous PKCθ (data not shown). Phosphorylation of Ser1101 was also detected in IRS1 immunoprecipitated from muscle extracts of wild-type and Akt2 knock-out mice injected with insulin. However, no phospho-Ser1101 immunoreactivity was observed in muscle extracts of PKCθ knock-out mice (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that Ser1101 phosphorylation is a physiological event mediated by PKCθ in vivo and further confirmed that Akt2, the Akt isoform involved in glucose metabolism in liver and muscle (27Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), has no role in Ser1101 phosphorylation. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active GFP-tagged PKCθ in CHO-IR/IRS1 cells induced the phosphorylation of co-transfected wild-type IRS1 at Ser1101 in an insulin-independent fashion (Fig. 3A). Along with Ser1101 phosphorylation, expression of active PKCθ attenuated the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cotransfected wild-type IRS1 but not of S1101A IRS1 (Fig. 3A). To further examine the role of Ser1101 as a mediator of PKCθ inhibitory signal, we used wild-type CHO cells, which express very low levels of endogenous IRS1. Consistent with its effect on IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, constitutively active PKCθ reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). This effect of active PKCθ on insulin signaling was blocked by overexpression of S1101A-IRS1 but not wild-type IRS1 (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that Ser1101 phosphorylation is necessary for the inhibitory effect of PKCθ on insulin signaling. What is the physiological role of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser1101? Our results suggest that Ser1101 phosphorylation could be an inhibitory feedback signal, as shown for phosphorylation of other serines in IRS1 (4Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Indeed, skeletal muscle of PKCθ knock-out mice displayed a hypersensitive insulin response measured by elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 (Fig. 3C). This indicates that PKCθ plays a significant role down-regulating the insulin stimulus. Under pathological conditions that keep PKCθ activity chronically elevated, for instance high free fatty acid levels, preexisting Ser1101 would strongly attenuate insulin signaling (17Itani S.I. Pories W.J. Macdonald K.G. Dohm G.L. Metabolism. 2001; 50: 553-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 caused by overexpression of catalytically active PKCθ probably mimics this scenario (Fig. 3A). In contrast, in a recent study overexpression of dominant negative PKCθ in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice was shown to cause obesity associated with insulin resistance (34Serra C. Federici M. Buongiorno A. Senni M.I. Morelli S. Segratella E. Pascuccio M. Tiveron C. Mattei E. Tatangelo L. Lauro R. Molinaro M. Giaccari A. Bouche M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We cannot explain this discrepancy, but we speculate it could be due to nonspecific or compensatory mechanisms related to overexpression of the dominant negative kinase. Our results, however, are in agreement with earlier and recent studies suggesting that PKCθ mediates inhibitory effects of free fatty acids on insulin signaling (21Yu C. Chen Y. Cline G.W. Zhang D. Zong H. Wang Y. Bergeron R. Kim J.K. Cushman S.W. Cooney G.J. Atcheson B. White M.F. Kraegen E.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol.

O'Brien W.R. Littman D.R. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It is possible that PKCθ also regulates IRS1 via Ser1101-independent mechanisms. PKCθ could directly phosphorylate other sites in IRS1 (11Greene M.W. Morrice N. Garofalo R.S. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or it could regulate other inhibitory kinases such as JNK and/or IKK complexes (23Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Whether and how these kinases work coordinately to inhibit IRS1 under physiological and pathological conditions remain to be studied. Other important questions remain open: how does insulin activate PKCθ in skeletal muscle, and whether phosphorylation of Ser1101 and other sites in IRS1 is coordinated? Our results suggest that PKCθ is a Ser1101 kinase in muscle cells, but we cannot completely rule out other kinases acting downstream to PKCθ. It is also likely that other kinases may phosphorylate Ser1101 in cells where PKCθ is not abundantly expressed. Such kinases would predictably prefer basic amino acid-containing motifs like the one around Ser1101. For example, PKCδ is highly homologous to PKCθ and can phosphorylate Ser1101in vitro (Fig. 2A). Moreover, free fatty acids infusion activates PKCδ together with inhibition of insulin signaling in the liver (35Boden G. Cheung P. Stein T.P. Kresge K. Mozzoli M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E12-E19Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similarly to PKCθ (Fig. 3), transfection of a catalytically active PKCδ construct blocks IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (11Greene M.W. Morrice N. Garofalo R.S. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The same report identified multiple sites in IRS1 phosphorylated by PKCδ and PKCθ in vitro, but in contrast to our results (Fig. 2A), Ser1101 was not among them. Overall, this study establishes a direct and novel mechanistic connection between the activation of PKCθ and inhibition of insulin signaling through phosphorylation of Ser1101, a novel regulatory site in IRS1.

https://openalex.org/W2087243573,"Chromatin insulators demarcate expression domains by blocking the cis effects of enhancers or silencers in a position-dependent manner. We show that the chromatin insulator protein CTCF carries a post-translational modification: poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation mark, which exclusively segregates with the maternal allele of the insulator domain in the H19 imprinting control region, requires the bases that are essential for interaction with CTCF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis documented that the link between CTCF and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation extended to more than 140 mouse CTCF target sites. An insulator trap assay showed that the insulator function of most of these CTCF target sites is sensitive to 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. We suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation imparts chromatin insulator properties to CTCF at both imprinted and nonimprinted loci, which has implications for the regulation of expression domains and their demise in pathological lesions."

Herein, the effects of tyrosine nitration on α-syn fibril formation, lipid binding, chaperone-like function, and proteolytic degradation were systematically examined by employing chromatographically isolated nitrated monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric α-syn. Nitrated α-syn monomers and dimers but not oligomers accelerated the rate of fibril formation of unmodified α-syn when present at low concentrations. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that nitrated monomers and dimers are incorporated into the fibrils. However, the purified nitrated α-syn monomer by itself was unable to form fibrils. Nitration of the tyrosine residue at position 39 was largely responsible for decreased binding of nitrated monomeric α-syn to synthetic vesicles, which correlated with an impairment of the nitrated protein to adopt α-helical conformation in the presence of liposomes. The chaperone-like activity of α-syn was not inhibited by nitration or oxidation. Furthermore, the 20 S proteasome and calpain I degraded nitrated monomeric α-syn, although at a slower rate compared with control α-syn.

The formation of α-syn fibrils has been extensively studied in vitro, confirming the formation of dimers, oligomers, protofibrillar structures, and mature linear fibers (15Krishnan S. Chi E.Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), although the precise sequence of events that leads to protein aggregation in vivo is not well defined. Post-translational modifications of α-syn may be responsible for the formation of proteinaceous inclusions. Antibodies that specifically recognize tyrosine-nitrated epitopes in α-syn decorate α-syn fibrils in LBs and Lewy neurites (20Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Although these observations indicate that α-syn is a target for reactive nitrogen species in vivo, it remains unclear whether this post-translational modification is a primary event that leads to aggregation of α-syn or whether it occurs upon the reaction of reactive nitrogen species with preformed fibrils. Data gathered in simple in vitro systems appear to indicate that the latter is more likely because exposure of α-syn to nitrating agents such as peroxynitrite, myeloperoxidase plus hydrogen peroxide and nitrite, or tetranitromethane inhibit fibril formation (21Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Yamin G. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, these results appear to be in conflict with previous data indicating that the same chemical treatments result in the formation of α-syn dimers via dityrosine cross-linking, and these dimers readily serve as seeds to initiate the process of fibril formation (15Krishnan S. Chi E.Y. Wood S.J. Kendrick B.S. Li C. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Wypych J. Randolph T.W. Narhi L.O. Biere A.L. Citron M. Carpenter J.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy data gathered in a cellular model system indicate that α-syn inclusions formed upon exposure of cells to nitrating oxidants contain fibrils (23Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these intracellular inclusions are decorated with specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize nitrated α-syn, and tyrosine residues are essential for the formation of these inclusions as transfection with α-syn with all four tyrosine residues mutated to phenylalanine fails to generate aggregates upon exposure to nitrating species (21Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In part, these uncertainties may result from the presence of multiple species such as nitrated monomers and nitrated and un-nitrated dityrosine-cross-linked dimers and oligomers, as well as methionine-oxidized species in the reaction mixture. Therefore, to evaluate the role of tyrosine nitration upon α-syn aggregation, the nitrated monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric species were isolated after chemical treatments. By employing the purified fractions, the effect of nitration and stable cross-linked oligomers on fibril formation was evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of nitration on the putative functions of α-syn, such as binding to lipid vesicles (4Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Expression and Purification of α-syn—The Y39F human α-syn mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (21Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) or Y39F α-syn cDNAs subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pRK172 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h before harvesting. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in high salt lysis buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 100 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, applied to a Mono Q column, and eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. The proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline followed by a second purification through the Mono Q column. Finally, the purified protein was dialyzed against the desired working buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Nitration and Oxidation of α-syn—Peroxynitrite was synthesized as described previously (27Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-syn (10 mg/ml) was diluted into nitration buffer (200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), and peroxynitrite was added under vigorous vortexing in three bolus additions to achieve a final 5 m excess of the protein concentration. Nitration of α-syn with tetranitromethane was performed as described previously (28Cassina A.M. Hodara R. Souza J.M. Thomson L. Castro L. Ischiropoulos H. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) with a protein: tetranitromethane molar ratio of 1:40. Oxidation of α-syn was achieved by incubating the protein in the presence of 1 mm H2O2 and 200 nm human myeloperoxidase and full oxidation of the four methionine residues was assessed by mass spectrometry. Separation of Different Nitrated α-syn Species—α-syn treated with a nitrating agent was run through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The peaks corresponding to the nitrated monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric α-syn species were collected in separate fractions, concentrated using 5000-Da MWCO filter tubes (Millipore), run on 12% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against nitrotyrosine raised in our laboratory. Assembly and Fibril Formation of α-syn—α-syn fibril assembly was performed as described previously (21Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated α-syn or the monomerically nitrated α-syn at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was exchanged in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.04% sodium azide. For the seeding experiments, increasing amounts of the nitrated monomer, dimer, or oligomer were added to untreated α-syn, keeping the total protein concentration at 5 mg/ml. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for a total of 5 days with continuous shaking at 1000 rpm. Each assembly reaction was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil to prevent condensation of samples. Assessment of α-syn Fibrils by Centrifugal Sedimentation—Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min after assembly incubation. Supernatants and pellets were separated, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min. α-syn proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal blue. In some experiments, the pellet was washed twice with sodium acetate buffer and then subjected to Western blot analysis using a nitrotyrosine antibody. Assessment of the Formation of Amyloidogenic Fibrils Using Thioflavin T—A filtered (0.2 μm) aqueous solution of thioflavin T (Sigma) was prepared at 10 μm in 90 mm glycine NaOH buffer (pH 8.5) prior to measurements. At various time points, aliquots of the α-syn incubation samples were diluted to 10 μm in 100 μl of water, and then 100 μlofthe 10-μm thioflavin T solution was added. Fluorescence measurements were conducted in black 96-well plates using a SpectraMax Gemini fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and SoftMax Pro 4.0 software (λex = 450 nm, λem = 490 nm). Immunoelectron Microscopy—After assembly of α-syn into fibrils, samples were prepared for electron microscopy analysis as described previously (21Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For direct inspection of α-syn fibril formation, samples were applied to 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grids and were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were also analyzed using immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) techniques to determine the presence of nitrated filaments within the assembled structures. α-syn samples were applied to 300-mesh carbon-coated grids, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and immunostained with primary monoclonal antibody nSyn14, which specifically recognizes nitrated α-syn (20Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Samples were then decorated with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to 5-nm gold particles and were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. A JEOL 1010 electron microscope (Peabody, MA) was used to examine these samples with magnifications up to ×200,000. Chaperone-like Activity Assay—The insulin assay was performed as described previously (8Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine insulin, 0.15 mg/ml in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was incubated with 20 mm DTT at 25 °C in the absence or presence of unmodified, nitrated, or oxidized α-syn (50 μm). Aggregation of the insulin B chain after reduction with DTT was followed by monitoring of light scattering at 360 nm. Binding of α-syn to Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles—Unilamellar lipid vesicles were synthesized as follows. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) in specially packaged glass vials containing 25 mg sealed under argon. Phospholipids were dissolved in cyclohexane, mixed in 1:1 ratio (in the case of mixed POPA/POPC unilamellar lipid vesicles), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6) using mild bath sonication for 10 min. To minimize spontaneous oxidation of lipids, all manipulations were performed under argon. Homogeneous unilamellar lipid vesicles were made using a syringe extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) and a 100-nm filter. Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphate assay (29Morrison W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 41: 218-224Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 30Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). POPC or POPC/POPA unilamellar lipid vesicles at a concentration of 20 mg/ml were incubated with either untreated α-syn or nitrated monomeric α-syn (at 1 mg/ml) for 2 h in buffer A. Samples were then loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, equilibrated with buffer A, and eluted using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min following absorbance at 210 and 280 nm. The protein and lipid fractions were collected, SDS-PAGE was performed, and the fractions were stained with colloidal blue (Invitrogen). The area under the curve of the protein peaks was integrated to calculate the fraction bound to unilamellar lipid vesicles. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The circular dichroism spectra of untreated or nitrated monomeric α-syn, in the presence or absence of unilamellar lipid vesicles (2 mg/ml), were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were collected at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette containing the sample at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml protein in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.6). Degradation of α-syn by the 20 S Proteasome and Calpain I—The 20 S proteasome and calpain I were from Calbiochem. Assays were performed as described previously (26Mishizen-Eberz A.J. Guttmann R.P. Giasson B.I. Day 3rd, G.A. Hodara R. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lynch D.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Liu C.W. Corboy M.J.

Untreated or nitrated monomeric α-syn at 500 nm was incubated with 10 nm 20 S proteasome at 37 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). The proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, was used at a 50 μm concentration. For calpain I studies, α-syn protein (0.1 μg/μl) was incubated with calpain I (1 units/ml) in buffer B (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 5 mm DTT) at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of calcium (1 mm final). Aliquots were taken at different time points, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating the sample to 100 °C for 5 min. Protein degradation was assessed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody to α-syn, Syn 208 (32Giasson B.I. Jakes R. Goedert M. Duda J.E. Leight S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were analyzed using NIH Image. Mass Spectrometry Studies—Mass spectrometry was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source, and the spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode as described previously (33Souza J.M.

Chromatographic Separation of α-syn Modified Species— A major obstacle in studying the biochemical and biophysical properties of nitrated α-syn is obtaining a homogeneous preparation of modified protein. Therefore, after the reaction of recombinant α-syn with nitrating agents such as peroxynitrite or tetranitromethane, the resulting α-syn nitrated monomers as well as nitrated dimers covalently linked by the formation of dityrosine and higher molecular mass oligomers were separated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). The chromatographic elution profile and the corresponding SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of the isolated fractions (Fig. 1) indicate that the different species were successfully separated with minimal cross-contamination. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified nitrated monomer revealed the presence of mono-, di-, and tri-nitrated species. Digestion with trypsin and cyanogen bromide followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of peptides revealed that all four tyrosine residues could potentially be nitrated (data not shown and 31). α-syn proteins nitrated at Tyr-39 as well as at Tyr-125, Tyr-133, or Tyr-136 have been detected in LBs of human brains affected with Parkinson disease (20Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Effect of Nitration on α-syn Fibril Formation—Purified tyrosine-nitrated α-syn monomers were unable to assemble into fibrils as assessed by the thioflavin T assay and sedimentation (Fig. 2, A and C, respectively). These results are consistent with previous observations (21Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Yamin G. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, when unmodified α-syn was co-incubated with increasing amounts of the tyrosine-nitrated α-syn monomers in ratios of 1:10, 1:5, and 1:1, a significant change in the kinetics of fibril formation was observed. Specifically, a shorter lag phase and an increase in the velocity of fibril assembly and intensity of thioflavin T fluorescence were observed (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, extensive washing of the protein in the pellet fraction followed by blotting with anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies revealed that nitrated monomers are present in the pellet fraction after 96 h of incubation (Fig. 2D). However, the 1:1 mixture showed lower thioflavin T fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2A) despite the presence of α-syn in the pellets after sedimentation analysis (Fig. 2C) and the presence of fibrils upon IEM evaluation (Fig. 3). To explain this apparent discrepancy, the interference of free 3-nitrotyrosine with thioflavin T fluorescence was examined (Fig 2B). At the pH used in the thioflavin T assay, 3-nitrotyrosine shows a maximal absorption at 422 nm, close to the wavelength used to excite thioflavin T (450 nm). Because the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data indicated that at least two nitrated tyrosine residues were present per α-syn molecule, the 1:5 and 1:1 samples represent ∼70 and 350 μm 3-nitrotyrosine, respectively. Fig. 2B shows that thioflavin T fluorescence of preformed α-syn fibrils was markedly inhibited in the presence of 350 μm free 3-nitrotyrosine, whereas 70 μm had minimal effect. These data indicate that the loss of thioflavin T fluorescence observed in the 1:1 ratio is due to fluorescence quenching by 3-nitrotyrosine.Fig. 3Immunoelectron microscopy using mouse monoclonal antibody nSyn14 against nitrated α-syn. Unmodified α-syn showed no gold labeling, serving as a negative control (A). Positive staining for nitrated α-syn monomers was observed along the fibrils as shown in the 1:10 and 1:1 ratio of nitrated monomers to unmodified α-syn micrographs (B and C, respectively, gold labeling indicated by arrowheads). Nitrated α-syn dimers were also observed along the fibrils (D) at a ratio of 1:10 nitrated dimers to unmodified α-syn. Scale bar, 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Co-incubation of unmodified α-syn with nitrated α-syn dimers in a 1:10 ratio significantly accelerates the rate of fibril formation and markedly increases total fluorescence (Fig. 2A). However, the sedimentation assay does not show evidence of a significant increase of α-syn in the pellet fraction as compared with unmodified α-syn incubated alone or after co-incubations of unmodified α-syn with a nitrated α-syn monomer (Fig. 2C). These results imply that nitrated dimers promote a more organized assembly of α-syn into filaments rich in β-sheet conformation. Interestingly, agitation for 96 h resulted in the formation of α-syn dimers (Fig. 2C), which were not present before incubation either in the unmodified α-syn preparation (not shown) or in the purified nitrated α-syn monomer fraction (Fig. 1). These dimers appeared in the pellet fraction, with the exception of the nitrated α-syn monomer fraction incubated alone, where they remained soluble (Fig. 2C). The co-incubation of nitrated oligomers with unmodified α-syn inhibited both thioflavin T fluorescence and the formation of a protein pellet after sedimentation (Fig. 2, A and C). Under these conditions, electron microscopy analysis failed to detect fibrils (data not shown). Because the fraction of oligomeric α-syn contains some dimers (Fig. 1C), these data suggest that oligomeric α-syn species have a predominant effect in inhibiting fibril formation. IEM Analysis—To confirm the data from the thioflavin T and sedimentation studies, we performed IEM analyses. These studies revealed the presence of monomerically nitrated α-syn in fibrils composed of unmodified α-syn (Fig. 3, B and C). Similarly, nitrated α-syn dimers incorporate into fibrils as revealed by the presence of gold labeling along the fibrils (Fig. 3D). Nitrated α-syn Monomer Shows Decreased Binding to Lipid Vesicles—The interaction of α-syn with lipid vesicles is believed to play a role in regulation of neurotransmission at presynaptic terminals. Binding preferably occurs to vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, which leads to a significant increase in α-helical conformation of α-syn (4Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Purified nitrated α-syn monomers were incubated with POPC or a mixture of POPC/POPA unilamellar lipid vesicles at room temperature for 2 h in a 20:1 (lipid:protein) mass ratio, and binding was studied by gel filtration chromatography. In agreement with previous results, SDS-PAGE analyses of the fractions eluted from the column revealed that neither unmodified α-syn nor the purified nitrated α-syn monomer binds to POPC vesicles (Fig. 4A). However, when incubated with POPC/POPA vesicles, 85% of unmodified α-syn eluted with the vesicle fraction, whereas the remaining unbound protein was below the detection limit of colloidal blue staining (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, a significant amount of nitrated α-syn monomers were detected in the unbound fraction (Fig. 4A). Only 55% of nitrated α-syn binds to POPC/POPA vesicles (Fig. 4B). Because the N-terminal segment of the protein is responsible for binding to vesicles (4Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), we employed the Tyr-39 to phenylalanine-mutated α-syn (Y39F) to investigate the functional consequence of nitration of this residue. The unmodified Y39F mutant showed the same extent of binding to POPC/POPA vesicles as the unmodif"

Here we show that Pdgfc−/− mice die in the perinatal period owing to feeding and respiratory difficulties associated with a complete cleft of the secondary palate. This phenotype was less severe than that of Pdgfra−/− embryos. Pdgfc−/− Pdgfa−/− embryos developed a cleft face, subepidermal blistering, deficiency of renal cortex mesenchyme, spina bifida and skeletal and vascular defects. Complete loss of function of both ligands, therefore, phenocopied the loss of PDGFR-α function, suggesting that both PDGF-A and PDGF-C signal through PDGFR-α to regulate the development of craniofacial structures, the neural tube and mesodermal organs. Our results also show that PDGF-C signaling is a new pathway in palatogenesis, different from, and independent of, those previously implicated."

PKC is also a subfamily of the AGC serine/threonine kinases, which are involved in proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and cell-type specific functions (14Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 15Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Based on structural features and cofactor requirements, PKC isoforms are classified into three categories; conventional or classical isoforms (cPKCs: α, βI, βII, and γ) depend on diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+ for their activation, novel isoforms (nPKCs: δ, ϵ, η, and θ) depend on DAG, but not Ca2+, and atypical isoforms (atypical PKC isoforms: ζ and λ/ι) do not require either DAG or Ca2+. Cross-linking of high-affinity IgE receptors (FcϵRI) expressed on the surface of mast cells activates Akt (16Kitaura J. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kawakami Y. Kikkawa U. Kawakami T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and various PKC isoforms including PKCβI and PKCβII (17Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Hartman S.E. Lowell C.A. Siraganian R.P. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7423-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Importantly, Akt in mast cells is involved in FcϵRI-induced production of cytokines such as IL-2 through the activation of such transcription factors as NF-κB, NF-AT, and AP-1 (16Kitaura J. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kawakami Y. Kikkawa U. Kawakami T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and PKCβ is also required for FcϵRI-induced degranulation and cytokine production (18Nechushtan H. Leitges M. Cohen C. Kay G. Razin E. Blood. 2000; 95: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have found that cPKC isoforms, particularly PKCβII, can regulate Akt activity by directly phosphorylating the critical residue Ser-473 in vitro and in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells. By contrast, PKCβ is not required for Ser-473 phosphorylation in mast cells stimulated with stem cell factor (SCF) or IL-3, in serum-stimulated fibroblasts, or in antigen receptor-stimulated T or B cells. Therefore, PKCβII functions as a cell type- and stimulus-specific PDK2.

Briefly, pMX-puro plasmids harboring wt or mutant PKCβI, PKCβII, or HA-tagged Akt cDNAs were transfected into packaging cells to generate recombinant retroviruses.

Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Alternatively, reaction mixtures were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose filters, and the radioactivity of filters after washing in phosphoric acid was quantified. Synthetic peptides used in in vitro kinase assays were prepared in-house or purchased fromA&A Laboratories (S473tide and T308tide) or from Upstate (Crosstide), and their sequences are as follows: 1) ECVDSERRPHFPQFSYSASSTA (the underlined S indicates Ser-473, in single-letter amino acid code), used in Ser-473 phosphorylation experiments (Fig. 2a); 2) S473tide for Ser-473 phosphorylation: RRPHFPQFSYSA (Ser-473 is underlined); 3) T308tide for Thr-308 phosphorylation: KTFCGTPEYLAPEVRR (Thr-308 is underlined); Crosstide for Akt assay: GRPTSSFAEG. Measurement of Histamine and Cytokines—IgE-sensitized cells were stimulated with antigen. Histamine secreted for 45 min was measured by on-column high performance liquid chromatography. IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-α secreted for 20 h were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Pharmingen). Akt Is Phosphorylated in Response to Phorbol Ester and Interacts Physically with cPKC Isoforms in Mast Cells—We first tested whether Akt phosphorylation can be induced by phorbol ester, a DAG analogue. Immunoblot analysis of BMMC derived from wt mice demonstrated that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) rapidly induces Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 (Fig. 1a), suggesting that PMA-responsive PKC (conventional and/or novel) isoforms can activate Akt. Interestingly, Ser-473 phosphorylation was substantially reduced in BMMC from PKCβ–/–mice. We then assessed whether Akt is physically associated with such PKCs. Immunoblotting of Akt immunoprecipitates showed that cPKCs (i.e. α, βI, and βII. γ is not expressed in BMMC) were coprecipitated with Akt, and PKCβII association was particularly robust and inducible by FcϵRI stimulation with IgE and antigen (Fig. 1b). Conversely, Akt was detected in immune complexes precipitated by anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβI, or anti-PKCβII (data not shown), and these interactions were direct (supplementary Fig. S1). A small amount of ILK was also coimmunoprecipitated with Akt. By contrast, PKCϵ, PKCθ, PKCζ, or c-Raf1 was not detected in Akt immunoprecipitates, although these kinases were abundantly expressed in mast cells. cPKC Isoforms Can Phosphorylate Akt on Ser-473 in Vitro— Given the physical association between Akt and cPKCs, we examined whether Akt serves as a phosphorylation target for cPKC isoforms. First, we tested whether synthetic peptides corresponding to the Akt C-terminal 22 residues encompassing Ser-473 can be phosphorylated by recombinant PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII. The non-phosphorylated (NP) peptide (or S473tide) was phosphorylated by these kinases with an order of PKCα ≥ PKCβII > PKCβI in potency (Fig. 2a), while the Ser-473-phosphorylated (pS) peptide was not phosphorylated by any of these isoforms despite the presence in this peptide of four Ser and one Thr residues as potential phosphorylation sites. We then tested whether these cPKCs can phosphorylate Akt. As shown in Fig. 2b, Akt was not phosphorylated on Thr-308 by these PKC isoforms, although the latter enzymes phosphorylated themselves on Thr-497 (PKCα) or Thr-500 (PKCβI and PKCβII) in their activation loop under the same conditions. Strikingly, Akt Ser-473 was phosphorylated by PKCα and PKCβII in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2b). Ser-473 phosphorylation by PKCβI was weaker and saturated at lower levels than that by PKCα or PKCβII and did not correlate with its autophosphorylating potency. These results indicate that the cPKCs, particularly PKCα and PKCβII, have a vigorous PDK2 activity in vitro and they can phosphorylate Akt on Ser-473 without prior phosphorylation on Thr-308, consistent with previous studies showing that Ser-473 phosphorylation is independent of Thr-308 phosphorylation (8Alessi D.R.

Akt Catalytic Activity and Ser-473 Phosphorylation Are Reduced in FcϵRI-stimulated PKCβ–/–Mast Cells—BMMC are immature mast cells widely used for studies of FcϵRI signal transduction. Cell surface expression of FcϵRI and c-Kit was comparable between wt and PKCβ–/–BMMC, and cell viability was not affected by PKCβ deficiency (data not shown). Antigen stimulation of IgE-sensitized wt BMMC induced Ser-473 phosphorylation (Fig. 3a). Remarkably, Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation levels were lower in unstimulated PKCβ–/–BMMC than in unstimulated wt cells, and IgE/antigen-induced peak Ser-473 phosphorylation levels were also drastically (50–80%) reduced in PKCβ–/–BMMC at all antigen concentrations tested. Similar, but more dramatic, reduction was observed in IgE/antigen-stimulated PKCβ–/–cells (Fig. 3a, lower panel (the SCF-FLMC part), and data not shown) when BMMC and FLMC that had been cultured in the presence of SCF were used. SCF induces maturation of immature mast cells. Consistent with a significant role for Ser-473 phosphorylation in Akt activation, Akt activation induced by IgE/antigen stimulation, as assessed by its ability to phosphorylate its substrate, BAD or Crosstide, was also reduced in PKCβ–/–BMMC (Fig. 3, b and c). By contrast, FcϵRI-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation was not reduced in PKCϵ–/–or PKCθ–/–BMMC compared with their wt controls (supplementary Fig. S2), although these nPKC isoforms are expressed in BMMC. These results, together with the reduced Ser-473 phosphorylation in PMA-stimulated PKCβ–/–BMMC (Fig. 1a), demonstrate the selective ability of PKCβ relative to the nPKC isoforms to regulate Ser-473 phosphorylation in mast cells. Consistent with previous results that Ser-21 of GSK-3α is a phosphorylation target of Akt (27Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 28Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), Ser-21 phosphorylation was substantially reduced in PKCβ–/–BMMC (Fig. 3d). Reconstitution with PKCβII, but Not PKCβI, Can Restore FcϵRI-induced Akt Ser-473 Phosphorylation and IL-2 Production in PKCβ-deficient Mast Cells—PKCβI and PKCβII were generated by alternative splicing (29Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and PKCβ–/–mice lack the expression of both isoforms. To test whether defects in Akt phosphorylation and activity in PKCβ–/–BMMC are direct effects of the deficiency of PKCβI and/or PKCβII, we reconstituted these cells with PKCβIorPKCβII by retroviral transduction. Under the current transduction experiments, which require SCF to drive cell cycling to promote retroviral integration in BMMC leading to further differentiation of mast cells, Akt phosphorylation on Thr-308 was minimally affected by PKCβ deficiency (see the rightmost eight lanes in Fig. 4a), although reconstitution with either PKCβIorPKCβII enhanced Thr-308 phosphorylation in PKCβ–/–cells. The increased Thr-308 phosphorylation seemed to be due to overexpression of PKCβI or PKCβII. Indeed, immunoblot analysis using recombinant PKCβI and PKCβII as a reference revealed overexpression of PKCβI and PKCβII in the reconstituted cells (wt PKCβI, 200 ng/106 cells; kinase-dead (KD) PKCβI, 50 ng; wt PKCβII, 250 ng; KD PKCβII, 19 ng in reconstituted cells versus PKCβI, 1.25 ng; PKCβII, 50 ng in non-transfected wt BMMC). Reconstitution with wt PKCβII restored Ser-473 phosphorylation to a full extent, while reconstitution with wt PKCβI at comparable expression levels failed to do so (Fig. 4b). By contrast, expression of KD mutants of PKCβI or PKCβII in PKCβ–/–cells failed to reconstitute Akt phosphorylation, indicating that the catalytic activity of PKCβII is required for Ser-473 phosphorylation. Taking into consideration our immunoblotting data that the BMMC used express 40-fold more PKCβII (50 ng/106 cells) than PKCβI (1.25 ng/106 cells), these results (Fig. 4b) and the stronger in vitro Ser-473 phosphorylating activity of PKCβII versus PKCβI (Fig. 2, a and b) suggest that Ser-473 phosphorylation and hence Akt catalytic activity are mainly under control of the enzymatic activity of PKCβII in FcϵRI-stimulated BMMC. Another potential interpretation of the reconstitution experiments, which does not contradict the notion of PKCβII-dependent Akt regulation is that PKCβ expression permits mast cell precursors to respond better to SCF or IL-3. However, there is no indication that PKCβ is involved in SCF or IL-3 signaling (Ref. 18Nechushtan H. Leitges M. Cohen C. Kay G. Razin E. Blood. 2000; 95: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Although a reduction in Thr-308 phosphorylation in PKCβ–/–cells was much smaller than that in Ser-473 phosphorylation, there is a possibility that autophosphorylation of Akt contributes to Ser-473 phosphorylation (13Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) in mast cells. To assess this possibility, we sought to measure Ser-473 phosphorylating activity of PKCβII under conditions that minimize the autophosphorylation of the transduced Akt. We transduced wt and PKCβ–/–BMMC with a HA-tagged KD (K179M) Akt mutant. For a comparison, HA-tagged wt Akt and T308A mutant Akt were also transduced. Ser-473 phosphorylation of HA-tagged wt and T308A was reduced in PKCβ–/–cells compared with wt cells (Fig. 4c), just like that of endogenous Akt protein in non-transfected cells. Importantly, Ser-473 phosphorylation of HA-tagged K179M Akt was robustly induced in wt cells upon FcϵRI stimulation (Fig. 4c), ruling out the possibility that Ser-473 phosphorylation is a result of mainly autophosphorylation. By contrast, Ser-473 phosphorylation of HA-tagged K179M Akt was almost abrogated in PKCβ–/–cells (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that Ser-473 is predominantly phosphorylated by PKCβII in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells. Experiments using protein phosphatase inhibitors indicate that dephosphorylation at Ser-473 is not regulated by PKCβ (supplementary Fig. S3a). Because the evidence described above indicates that PKCβII is a major PDK2 in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells, we determined kinetic parameters of S473tide phosphorylation by PKCβII. The Km and Vmax values were in a similar range as those for T308tide phosphorylation by PDK1 (Km = 873.6 ± 250.7 μm; Vmax = 77,286 ± 7,767 μmol/min for S473tide phosphorylation by PKCβII versus Km = 933.1 ± 261.9 μm; Vmax = 20,100 ± 2,027 μmol/min for T308tide phosphorylation by PDK1), supporting the physiological relevance of our in vitro data. To further address the physiological relevance of PKCβII-mediated Akt regulation, PKCβ–/–BMMC transduced with PKCβI or PKCβII were stimulated with IgE and antigen. The cells reconstituted with either PKCβIorPKCβII released histamine as well as did the wt BMMC (Fig. 5a). Reconstitution with wt PKCβII robustly restored IL-2 production in PKCβ–/–BMMC, whereas that with PKCβI did not (Fig. 5b). Consistent with the role of Akt in FcϵRI-induced IL-2 production (16Kitaura J. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kawakami Y. Kikkawa U. Kawakami T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), these results indicate that PKCβII-dependent Akt activation is crucial for FcϵRI-induced IL-2 production. PKCα Is Not a Major Regulator of Akt Ser-473 Phosphorylation in FcϵRI-stimulated Mast Cells—Given the strong in vitro PDK2 activity of PKCα (Fig. 2, a and b) and without access to PKCα–/–mice, we tested effects of small interfering RNA-mediated PKCα knock-down on Akt phosphorylation. PKCα knock-down did not significantly affect Ser-473 phosphorylation in wt or PKCβ–/–BMMC (supplementary Fig. S4a). Furthermore, Gö-6976 (cPKC inhibitor) treatment of PKCβ–/–BMMC minimally affected Ser-473 phosphorylation, whereas the same treatment substantially reduced it in wt BMMC (supplementary Fig. S4b). These results are consistent with the predominant role of PKCβII as the PDK2 among the cPKCs expressed in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells. PKCβ-mediated Akt Ser-473 Phosphorylation Is Dependent on Stimulus and Cell Type—To extend our inquiry into the role of PKCβII as the regulator of Ser-473 phosphorylation, we next stimulated mast cells with SCF or IL-3, two major mast cell growth factors. In contrast with FcϵRI stimulation (Fig. 3a), SCF and IL-3 induced robust Ser-473 phosphorylation in PKCβ–/–cells similar to that observed in wt cells (Fig. 6a). When splenic T and B cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 and anti-μ monoclonal antibodies, respectively, Akt was phosphorylated on Ser-473 at similar levels in wt and PKCβ–/–mice (Fig. 6b and data not shown). When mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stimulated with serum, we observed similarly robust Ser-473 phosphorylation in wt and PKCβ–/–cells (Fig. 6c). These results indicate that there must exist multiple kinases that have PDK2 or Ser-473 kinase activity. Unlike PDK1 that was extensively characterized, the identity of PDK2 has been enigmatic. Three classes of PDK2 candidates have been proposed (10Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/66/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar): 1) several distinct kinases including ILK, 2) peptide-induced conversion of PDK1 to PDK2 (30Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and 3) Ser-473 autophosphorylation following Thr-308 phosphorylation (13Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, none of these hypotheses could fully explain the PDK2 activity in several cellular systems. Recent reports suggested that a constitutively active PDK2 distinct from ILK, PDK1, or Akt is localized to the plasma membrane (4Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25643-25646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Hodgkinson C.P. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10351-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In one study, PDK2 activity was found in a complex with PKCζ (33Hodgkinson C.P. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10351-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By contrast, Ser-473 phosphorylation in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells was staurosporine-sensitive (supplementary Fig. S3b), and PKCζ was not found in Akt immune complexes from mast cell lysates (Fig. 1b). Our data also demonstrate that defects in Ser-473 phosphorylation in PKCβ-deficient mast cells are partial (up to 80% reduction) and depend on cell types and stimuli. These studies collectively point to the existence of multiple PDK2 enzymes. Our data in favor of the hypothesis that PKCβII serves as a major PDK2 in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells are extensive. First, PMA could induce Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473. Second, PKCβII was physically associated with Akt, and this association was direct and augmented upon FcϵRI stimulation. Third, consistent with previous studies that Ser-473 phosphorylation takes place at the plasma membrane (7Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), a substantial fraction of PKCβII was membrane-associated in mast cells. Fourth, PKCβII could phosphorylate Akt on Ser-473, and enzymatic kinetics of S473tide phoshorylation by PKCβII were similar to those of T308tide phosphorylation by PDK1. Fifth, Ser-473 phosphorylation was impaired in FcϵRI-stimulated PKCβ–/–mast cells and this phosphorylation was restored by reconstitution with PKCβII. Sixth, Ser-473 phosphorylation of the HA-tagged KD Akt was almost abrogated in FcϵRI-stimulated PKCβ–/–mast cells (Fig. 4c), whereas it was nearly intact in wt cells, excluding the possibility of Akt autophosphorylation as the major mechanism for Ser-473 phosphorylation. A residual and delayed Ser-473 phosphorylation of HA-tagged KD Akt in FcϵRI-stimulated PKCβ–/–cells (Fig. 4c) could be due to other PDK2 activities or a residual autophosphorylating activity of the mutant Akt, although the latter possibility is less likely given the lack of kinase activity of K179M Akt (34Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Our in vitro results indicate that PKCα has a PDK2 activity. However, the extremely low Ser-473 phosphorylation of HA-tagged KD Akt in PKCβ–/–mast cells and the results with PKCα small interfering RNA and Gö-6976 indicate that the role of PKCα (40 ng/106 cells) as PDK2 is at best minor in FcϵRI-stimulated mast cells. This could be due to a much lower ratio of membrane versus cytosolic PKCα (∼0.5%) compared with that of PKCβII (20–70%; 50 ng/106 cells) (Ref. 23Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Yao L. McHenry R.W. Newton A.C. Kang S. Kato R.M. Leitges M. Rawlings D.J. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9470-9475Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and data not shown). Deficiency of PKCθ (8 ng/106 cells) or PKCϵ (0.05 ng/106 cells) did not affect Ser-473 phosphorylation. Expression levels of the other novel or atypical PKC isoforms in BMMC are less than 1 ng per 106 cells (data not shown). Another kinase with PDK2 activity in mast cells might be ILK, which was detected at a low level in Akt immunoprecipitates. However, ILK activity was not reduced in PKCβ–/–mast cells (data not shown). Overall, these data favor the hypothesis that PKCβII is a major PDK2 in FcϵRI-activated mast cells. This study demonstrates that Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation is regulated by PKCβII in a cell type/stimulus-specific manner and suggests that there are multiple Ser-473 kinases that are used in a cell type/stimulus-specific manner. This is in stark contrast with Thr-308 phosphorylation, which is executed by an evolutionally conserved kinase PDK1 regardless of stimuli that elicit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. These results may provide a foundation to search for compounds that inhibit PKCβII or other kinase(s) that function as a cell type/stimulus-specific PDK2. Akt is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers and diabetes. Inhibition of a cell type/stimulus-specific regulator of Akt rather than that of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PDK1 arm of Akt activators may broaden our choices of strategies to treat these diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1974869115,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal type of gynecologic cancer in the Western world. The high case fatality rate is due in part because most ovarian cancer patients present with advanced stage disease which is essentially incurable. In order to obtain a whole genome assessment of aberrant gene expression in advanced ovarian cancer, we used oligonucleotide microarrays comprising over 40 000 features to profile 37 advanced stage papillary serous primary carcinomas. We identified 1191 genes that were significantly (P<0.001) differentially regulated between the ovarian cancer specimens and normal ovarian surface epithelium. The microarray data were validated using real time RT–PCR on 14 randomly selected differentially regulated genes. The list of differentially expressed genes includes ones that are involved in cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, apoptosis and migration. In addition, numerous genes whose function remains to be elucidated were also identified. The microarray data were imported into PathwayAssist software to identify signaling pathways involved in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis. Based on our expression results, a signaling pathway associated with tumor cell migration, spread and invasion was identified as being activated in advanced ovarian cancer. The data generated in this study represent a comprehensive list of genes aberrantly expressed in serous papillary ovarian adenocarcinoma and may be useful for the identification of potentially new and novel markers and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer."

The pathway is accompanied by posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation and glycation, each of which has been shown to promote tau fibrillization in vitro when present at high stoichiometry. To clarify the site-specific impact of posttranslational modification on tau fibrillization, the ability of recombinant full-length four repeat tau protein (htau40) and 11 pseudophosphorylation mutants to fibrillize in the presence of anionic inducer was assayed in vitro using transmission electron microscopy and laser light scattering assays. Tau glycated with d-glucose was examined as well. Both glycated tau and pseudophosphorylation mutants S199E, T212E, S214E, double mutant T212E/S214E, and triple mutant S199E/S202E/T205E yielded increased filament mass at equilibrium relative to wild-type tau. Increases in filament mass correlated strongly with decreases in critical concentration, indicating that both pseudophosphorylation and glycation promoted fibrillization by shifting equilibrium toward the fibrillized state. Analysis of reaction time courses further revealed that increases in filament mass were not associated with reduced lag times, indicating that these posttranslational modifications did not promote filament nucleation. The results suggest that site-specific posttranslational modifications can stabilize filaments once they nucleate, and thereby support their accumulation at low intracellular tau concentrations.

At least 15 of these sites fill in hierarchical fashion as neurofibrillary lesions mature, suggesting a sequential correlation between site occupancy and neuritic lesion development (14Augustinack J.C.

Ihara Y. Miyamoto E. Miyakawa T. Dementia. 1996; 7: 177-181PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to serving as a marker for diseased neurons, hyperphosphorylation neutralizes the microtubule binding activity of tau, yielding a cytosolic population available for aggregation (16Bramblett G.T.

Phosphorylation may also directly promote fibrillization, but in vitro this reaction requires stoichiometries of phosphorylation well above average levels observed in filamentous tau (20Alonso A. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 21Alonso A.D. Grundke-Iqbal I. Barra H.S. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Part of the experimental challenge stems from the diversity of tau phosphorylation sites, each of which may enhance or depress fibrillization (22Schneider A. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the difficulty of recapitulating the precise pattern found in disease. To overcome these limitations, and to investigate the contribution of individual sites, phosphorylation has been mimicked by mutation of hydroxyamino acids into negatively charged Asp or Glu residues. The resultant “pseudophosphorylation” mutants imitate phosphorylation-induced changes in the structure and microtubule-binding function of tau (23Leger J. Kempf M. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8441-8446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24Eidenmuller J. Fath T. Hellwig A. Reed J. Sontag E. Brandt R.

Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and reportedly can promote or inhibit tau fibrillization depending on the sequence context investigated (24Eidenmuller J. Fath T. Hellwig A. Reed J. Sontag E. Brandt R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13166-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Eidenmuller J. Fath T. Maas T. Pool M. Sontag E. Brandt R. Biochem.

Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the mechanisms through which phosphorylation or phosphorylation mimicry modulates fibrillization have not been explored. In addition to being phosphorylated, AD-derived tau protein is glycated (5Ledesma M.D. Bonay P. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Yan S.D. Chen X. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Godman G. Zou Y.S. Scott C.W. Caputo C. Frappier T. Smith M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As with phosphorylation, glycation has been implicated in events that may contribute to tau fibrillization and neuronal death (32Smith M.A. Tabaton M. Perry G. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 217: 210-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Smith M.A. Taneda S. Richey P.L. Miyata S. Yan S.D. Stern D. Sayre L.M. Monnier V.M. Perry G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), decrease its affinity for tubulin (5Ledesma M.D. Bonay P. Avila J. J.

Again the mechanisms underlying the effect on tau aggregation have not been investigated. Fibrillization of purified recombinant tau preparations is slow and essentially undetectable when assayed over a period of days (38King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 39King M.E. Gamblin T.C. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but can be greatly accelerated by the addition of exogenous inducers. Among these, anionic surfactants (including fatty acids) have emerged as especially useful agents because of their efficacy with full-length tau protein under near-physiological conditions of temperature, pH, ionic strength, reducing environment, and tau concentration (38King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar). Anionic surfactants act in micellar form to stabilize assembly competent intermediates on their surfaces, which then accumulate to sufficient concentrations so that the barrier to filament nucleation is overcome (41Chirita C.N. Necula M. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Using this approach, differences in fibrillization efficiency among individual tau isoforms can be quantified in as short as 5 h (39King M.E. Gamblin T.C. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here we extend the approach by investigating the fibrillization properties of glycated tau and pseudophosphorylation of tau mutants that mimic occupancy of sites known to be filled in disease (14Augustinack J.C. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) using quantitative transmission EM and static light scattering assays. The results show that glycation and phosphorylation mimicry influence tau aggregation through mechanisms that include filament stabilization. Materials—Stocks of alkyl sulfate detergent C18H37SO4Na (Research Plus, Bayonne, NJ) were prepared in 1:1 H2O/isopropyl alcohol. AA (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) was dissolved in ethanol (333 mm) and stored at –80 °C until used. Dithiothreitol was from Sigma, d-glucose was from Fisher Chemicals (Fair Lawn, NJ), and uranyl acetate, glutaraldehyde, and 300-mesh copper formvar/carbon-coated grids were from EM Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—Vector pT7C-htau40 served as a template for synthesis of all mutants using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (42Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol.

Double mutants C291A/C322A, S396E/S404E, and I277P/I308P were each prepared in an htau40 background as described previously (28Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Necula M. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 333: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Gamblin T.C. King M.E. Kuret J. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14203-14210Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Tau Purification—Recombinant wild-type tau protein (htau40) and all tau mutants were purified as described previously (42Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The quality of all preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and final protein concentrations were calibrated on the basis of optical density (42Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Tau Glycation—Aliquots of recombinant C291A/C322A and assembly incompetent I277P/I308P double mutants (20 μm) were incubated in the presence and absence of 10 mm d-glucose in assembly buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 7 days, at 37 °C, in the presence of protease inhibitors (aprotinin and leupeptin; 0.02 mg/ml each) and 0.02% NaN3 (31Ledesma M.D. Medina M. Avila J. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1996; 27: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine aggregation behavior, aliquots of glycation reactions were diluted to 4 μm tau and subjected to the tau aggregation assays described below. Where indicated, glycation products were separated from unincorporated glucose by desalting chromatography (Bio-Rad Econo-Pac 10DG) prior to dilution and assay. To estimate glycation stoichiometry, tau was glycated as described above except that radiolabeled d-[U-14C]glucose (10 Ci/mol) served as carbohydrate donor. Aliquots of the glycation reaction were removed as a function of time and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (15% final concentration, 15 min on ice; Ref. 45Illenberger S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Preuss U. Stamer K. Baumann K. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Godemann R. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1495-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid pellets were harvested by centrifugation (15,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), washed five times with 1 ml of 10 mm d-glucose, 15% trichloroacetic acid, then resuspended in 1 m NaOH and subjected to scintillation spectroscopy. Protein was estimated in parallel using the Coomassie Blue binding method with recombinant htau40 as standard (19Li G. Yin H. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15938-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tau Aggregation Assays—All tau preparations (4 μm) were incubated (25 °C) in assembly buffer containing dithiothreitol (5 mm) and either AA (75 μm) or C18H37SO4Na (50 μm) inducer. Reaction products were analyzed by two methods. For analysis by transmission EM (46Necula M. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), aliquots (30 μl) were removed, fixed with glutaraldehyde (2%), and adsorbed (1 min) onto 300-mesh formvar/carbon-coated copper grids. The grids were washed with water, stained (1 min) with 2% uranyl acetate, washed again with water, blotted dry, and visualized using a Phillips CM 12 microscope operated at 65 kV. Two to 10 random images from each experimental condition were captured on film at 22,000-fold magnification, digitized, calibrated, and imported into Optimas 6.5.1 for quantitation of filament length and number as described previously (46Necula M. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interfacial filament concentration (Γf) is defined as the summed lengths of all filaments >50 nm in length per unit area of grid surface, and is reported in units of length/field ± S.D. or as a percentage of wild-type htau40 control values ± S.D. Right angle laser light scattering (LLS) assays were performed as described previously (47Gamblin T.C. King M.E. Dawson H. Vitek M.P. Kuret J. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), except that the contribution of micellization to scattering intensity was controlled in parallel reactions containing htau40I277P/I308P, an assembly incompetent mutant of htau40 (48von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). When employed as light scattering control, htau40I277P/I308P was preincubated in exact parallel with experimental conditions (including glycation and desalting procedures described above). We refer to this assay as the corrected LLS assay (43Necula M. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 333: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Aggregation reactions (200 μl) were transferred to quartz cuvettes (3 × 3-mm internal diameter) and illuminated with light from an argon laser (λ = 488 nm; Edmund Scientific). The scattered light was captured at an angle of 90° to the incident light using an EDC1000HR digital camera operated at an aperture of f8 and exposure times ranging from 50 to 400 ms (47Gamblin T.C. King M.E. Dawson H. Vitek M.P. Kuret J. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Captured images were imported into Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and the intensity of scattered light was estimated as described previously (47Gamblin T.C. King M.E. Dawson H. Vitek M.P. Kuret J. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The scattering intensity captured at zero exposure time (dark current) was subtracted from all measurements, which were then normalized for exposure time so that the arbitrary units of light scattering intensity reported always corresponded to a 200-ms exposure at aperture f8. Scattering intensities from parallel reactions containing htau40I277P/I308P were then subtracted from all values to yield In (90°), the net right angle light scattering intensity. In (90°) values are directly proportional to Γf values determined by the transmission EM assay (43Necula M. Kuret J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 333: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Assembly-critical Concentration Determination—Tau samples (2–4.5 μm, final concentrations) were added from serially diluted stocks to assembly buffer at room temperature and incubated for 26 h in the presence of 50 μm anionic surfactant C18H37SO4Na and in the absence of agitation. Samples were analyzed by laser light scattering as described above. The net intensity of scattered light corresponding to fibrillization was plotted against tau concentration. Critical concentration for assembly was estimated from the abscissa intercept after least squares linear regression and expressed as ± S.E. of the estimate. Analytical Methods—Sigmoidal reaction progress curves were fit to the Gompertz function (49Winsor C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1932; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),y=ae−e−((t−ti)b)(Eq.1) where y is total filament length (50 nm cutoff) or light scattering intensity measured at time t, ti is the inflection point corresponding to the time of maximum growth rate, a is the maximum total filament length or light scattering at equilibrium, and b = 1/kapp, where kapp is the proportional growth rate of the filament population in units of time–1 (49Winsor C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1932; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lag times, defined as the time when the tangent to the point of maximum polymerization rate intersects the abscissa of the sigmoidal curve (50Evans K.C. Berger E.P. Cho C.G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), were calculated as ti – b (49Winsor C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1932; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filament length distributions calculated as described previously (41Chirita C.N. Necula M. Kuret J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1704-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were fit to the exponential function,y=aebx where y is the percentage of all filaments filling a bin of length interval x, and b is a constant (slope parameter) with units of length–1. All parameters estimated by linear or non-linear regression are reported ± S.E. Impact of Phosphorylation Mimicry on Tau Fibrillization— The distribution of phosphorylation sites on authentic AD-derived tau protein reported from mass spectroscopic methods (10Hanger D.P.

Because of the large number of individual sites, and the even larger number of potential combinations, only a subset of these were modeled in a full-length, htau40 isoform background by pseudophosphorylation mutagenesis and kinetic analysis (Table I). These 12 sites, which spanned the proline-rich, microtubule-binding, and Cterminal tau domains where phosphorylation sites cluster (Fig. 1), were selected because alone or in combination they compose phosphoepitopes that have been studied extensively by immunohistochemistry and shown to be occupied in nearly all tauopathies investigated to date (1Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Moreover, the temporal correlation between their occupancy and neuritic pathogenesis has been quantified (14Augustinack J.C. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 15Kimura T. Ono T. Takamatsu J. Yamamoto H. Ikegami K. Kondo A. Hasegawa M. Ihara Y. Miyamoto E. Miyakawa T. Dementia. 1996; 7: 177-181PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore 11 mutant proteins containing selected single, double, and triple pseudophosphorylation mutations in 12 positions were prepared along with wild-type htau40 and characterized for fibrillization activity.Table IPseudophosphorylation mutants examined in this workSitesProbeaSite-selective immunological probes of phosphorylation occupancy (AT8, AT100, etc.) are reviewed in Ref. 1.AD stagebRefs. 14 and 15.TauopathyaSite-selective immunological probes of phosphorylation occupancy (AT8, AT100, etc.) are reviewed in Ref. 1.Ser199, Ser202, Thr205AT8LateAllThr212, Ser214AT100LateThr231, Ser235AT180; TG3EarlySer26212E8EarlyMostSer396, Ser404AD2; PHF1LateAllSer409EarlySer422AP422MidAlla Site-selective immunological probes of phosphorylation occupancy (AT8, AT100, etc.) are reviewed in Ref. 1Buee L.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether low-stoichiometry site-specific pseudophosphorylation could replicate the effects of nonspecific high-stoichiometry phosphorylation, the ability of each of the mutant constructs to fibrillize under standard, near-physiological conditions of pH, ionic strength, and bulk tau concentration (4 μm) was determined relative to wild-type recombinant htau40 in the presence of AA inducer. All preparations fibrillized with untwisted morphology as described previously (41Chirita C.N. Necula M. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), with no morphological differences apparent among samples except mutant 235, which formed a mixture of typical untwisted filaments and small (<50 nm in length) amorphous aggregates (data not shown). Despite similarities in morphology, significant differences in extents of fibrillization were apparent when reaction products were assayed by quantitative EM. Greatest differences were observed with mutants 212, 214, 212/214, and 199/202/205, which accumulated 2–3-fold as much filamentous tau as did wild-type htau40 and mutants 231, 262, 396/404, 409, and 422 (Fig. 2A). To confirm these findings, the amount of filamentous pseudophosphorylated tau at equilibrium relative to wild-type htau40 was estimated using a second inducer (C18H37SO4Na). Results showed that pseudophosphorylation mutants differentially fibrillized in response to C18H37SO4Na inducer as well. Indeed, when the equilibrium levels of fibrillization attained with AA and C18H37SO4Na inducers were compared, a linear relationship was found with nearly identical rank orders of mutant fibrillization levels (Fig. 2B). When equilibrium levels of fibrillization attained with C18H37SO4Na were compared by EM and corrected LLS (a solution-based assay method), again a consistent rank order of fibrillization levels was observed (Fig. 2C). The only exception was mutant 235, which formed both filamentous and nonfilamentous aggregates. Because the EM assay only measures filaments, whereas LLS detects all aggregates in solution, the LLS assay overestimated filament mass for this mutant. Together these results suggested that low-stoichiometry pseudophosphorylation could recapitulate the effects of nonspecific phosphorylation on tau fibrillization levels at equilibrium, and that they were addit"
https://openalex.org/W2049018391,"The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a component of the epithelial cell tight junction. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 as an interaction partner for the CAR cytoplasmic domain. CAR and MUPP1 were found to colocalize at the tight junction, to coprecipitate from epithelial cells, and to interact in vitro. The interaction was found to specifically involve the PDZ-binding motif within the CAR C terminus and MUPP1 PDZ domain 13. In transfected cells, CAR recruited MUPP1 to cell-cell contacts. The inhibition of CAR expression with small interfering RNA inhibited MUPP1 localization to the tight junction. The results indicated that CAR interacts with MUPP1 and is involved in MUPP1 recruitment to the tight junction. The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a component of the epithelial cell tight junction. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 as an interaction partner for the CAR cytoplasmic domain. CAR and MUPP1 were found to colocalize at the tight junction, to coprecipitate from epithelial cells, and to interact in vitro. The interaction was found to specifically involve the PDZ-binding motif within the CAR C terminus and MUPP1 PDZ domain 13. In transfected cells, CAR recruited MUPP1 to cell-cell contacts. The inhibition of CAR expression with small interfering RNA inhibited MUPP1 localization to the tight junction.

CAR also functions as a transmembrane component of epithelial tight junctions (TJs) (5Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The TJ is the apical-most component of the junctional complex of epithelia and endothelia and is critical in maintaining and restricting the paracellular flow of ions and solutes. Though CAR localizes to the TJ, the nature of its interactions with other TJ-associated proteins remains unclear. Several PDZ domain-containing proteins have been localized to the cytoplasmic region of the TJ. These include the structurally related membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted proteins, the partitioning proteins, and the multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1). These proteins likely function to link TJ-associated transmembrane proteins to intracellular signaling molecules. The CAR C terminus resembles hydrophobic C-terminal peptide motifs known to interact with PDZ protein domains, such as those contained within membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins and other scaffolding proteins localized to the TJ region. CAR associates with ZO-1, as demonstrated by coprecipitation from polarized epithelia and by the relocalization of ZO-1 that occurs in CAR-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (5Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). CAR may also interact with a component of the adherens junction, β-catenin, as has been reported in A549 cells (6Walters R.W. Freimuth P. Moninger T.O. Ganske I. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Cell. 2002; 110: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast-two-hybrid studies have shown that CAR interacts with Ligand of Numb-X (LNX) (7Sollerbrant K. Raschperger E. Mirza M. Engstrom U. Philipson L. Ljungdahl P.O. Pettersson R.F. J.

To define the associations mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of CAR, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified MUPP1 as a CAR-interacting protein. The localization of MUPP1 to the area of the TJ was disrupted when CAR was absent, although the distribution of other TJ-associated components such as ZO-1 remained unchanged. Taken together, these data indicate that CAR interacts directly with MUPP1 and that this interaction is involved in restricting MUPP1 to the cytoplasmic region of the TJ. Cell Culture—CHO cells stably transfected with cDNA constructs encoding human CAR (CHO-CAR cells), CAR lacking its cytoplasmic tail (CHO-CARΔtail), CAR with deletion of its hydrophobic C-terminal motif (CHO-CARAQS), or with vector alone (CHO-pcDNA) were cultured in nucleoside-free α-minimum essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (5Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin.

CHO cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of pGW1-HAMUPP1 using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science) and assayed 48 h later. Double-stranded siRNAs targeted against human CAR (sense, 5′-GGUGGAUCAAGUGAUUAUU-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAUAAUCACUUGAUCCACC-3′), GAPDH, and a control with no similarity to any human gene sequence were designed and synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX). Caco-2 cells grown on collagen-coated chamber slides were transfected with duplex siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were assayed 24–48 h following transfection.

Mouse anti-ZO-1 and rabbit anti-proteasome subunit antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc.. Antibodies to HA, GAPDH, early endosome antigen-1, Rab7, lysosomal integral membrane proteins-II (LIMP II), and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP I) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Oregon Green-conjugated anti-HA antibody was purchased from Clontech. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—DNA encoding the mCAR1 cytoplasmic domain (CCHRK → DGSIV) was inserted into plasmid pGBKT7 (Clontech), in-frame with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain. The resulting plasmid (CAR-BD) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an 11-day mouse embryo library constructed in pGADT7 using protocols provided with the Clontech Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 was transformed with both library and bait plasmids, and ∼2.5 × 106 dual transformants were screened for growth on medium deficient in histidine and adenine and for production of β-galactosidase. Library plasmids were recovered from putative positive clones and further tested to eliminate any that induced GAL4 activation independently of any bait plasmid, in the presence of binding domain alone, or in the presence of binding domain fused to a nonspecific control protein (human lamin C). Of 11 cDNAs that were obtained, one encoded PDZ domain 13 of MUPP1; the other 10 encoded a PDZ domain derived from another protein. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—CHO cells plated on glass chamber slides or siRNA-transfected Caco-2 cells on collagen-coated chamber slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). All cells were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were captured with an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY). Caco-2 cells grown on transwell inserts were permeabilized with methanol for 5 min at -20 °C, washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-CAR RmcB and polyclonal anti-MUPP1 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubated with anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-rabbit Texas Red in 10% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were captured with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Exton, PA). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with RNA STAT 60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and treated with DNase (Ambion). For complementary DNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was used in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm oligo(dT), 0.1 volume of 10× buffer (supplied by manufacturer), and 2500 units/ml murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 1 cycle in a thermal cycler at 42 °C for 50 min, followed by a 15-min incubation at 70 °C. PCR was carried out with TaqDNA polymerase (Roche) for 25 cycles with primers to CAR (sense primer 5′-GCT TAG TCC CGA AGA CCA-3′ and antisense 5′-GTG GCA CAT CTT CCC TGA-3′) and those to GAPDH (sense primer 5′-ACC ACC AAC TGC TTA GCA-3′ and antisense 5′-CCC TGT TGC TGT AGC CAA-3′) added simultaneously to the PCR. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Lysates of CHO cells transiently transfected with HA-MUPP1 were prepared with 0.1% Triton X-100 extraction buffer containing phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cells were collected with a rubber policeman in lysis buffer and sonicated briefly. Insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation for 5min at 4 °C. For coimmunoprecipitation of MUPP1 and CAR followed by immunoblotting for CAR, lysates were incubated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody, anti-CAR monoclonal antibody RmcB, or control monoclonal antibody MOPC 21 for 1 h at 4 °C. For coimmunoprecipitation of MUPP1 and CAR followed by immunoblotting for MUPP1, lysates were incubated with anti-MUPP1 polyclonal antibody, RmcB, or control MOPC 21 overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose G beads were added for an additional 1 h. After centrifugation, the beads were washed in cell lysis buffer and then heated at 95 °C for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Following a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was run on a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing Twenn-20 (TBS-T) with 5% milk and probed with rabbit anti-CAR or blocked in 10% donkey serum and probed with anti-sheep MUPP1 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody to rabbit or sheep immunoglobulin (Jackson ImmunoResearch), developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to film. Streptag-SUMO-hCAR Fusion Protein—A bacterial expression vector encoding the full-length human CAR cytoplasmic domain was constructed and expressed in a modified pET expression vector (provided by Steven Weeks, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA) encoding a linear fusion consisting of an N-terminal streptactin-tag (IBA-GmbH) for affinity purification followed by SUMO (Invitrogen) linked to the cytoplasmic domain of CAR. The cytoplasmic domain of CAR was amplified by PCR and cloned into the modified pET vector between a BSAI site created at the 3′-end of SUMO, and an XhoI site using the following primers, sense primer, 5′-TTTTTTGGTCTCACATGTGCTGTCGTAAAAAGCGC-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-TTTTTTCTCGAGCTATACTATAGACCCATCCTTGCT-3′. The pET-CAR expression vector was introduced into competent Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen). Overnight cultures grown in LB were diluted 1:5 into a final culture volume of 25 ml. At an A600 of 0.6 the culture was exposed to 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fisher), and bacteria were collected after 4 h. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 2 ml of a 50% slurry of Streptactin-MacroPrep beads (IBA-GmbH) for 2 h. at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein was eluted from the beads with 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The desthiobiotin was removed by dialyzing the protein into 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.7. In Vitro Binding Assays—GST fusion proteins expressed in E. coli were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). SUMO or SUMO-hCAR (1 μg) was added to a pull-down buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5% fetal bovine serum) and incubated with GST, GSTMUPP1PDZ10, or GST-MUPP1PDZ12–13 bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation, washed in pull-down buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Following a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was run on a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C and incubated with anti-Streptavidin monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, samples were run on 4–15% gels and stained with Coomassie Blue to control for loading of GST and GST fusion proteins. Identification of MUPP1 as a CAR Binding Partner—To identify the proteins that interact with the C-terminal tail of murine CAR1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. The mCAR cytoplasmic domain was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain, and used as bait to screen an 11-day mouse embryo library. A cDNA encoding the thirteenth PDZ domain of the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 was isolated; the two-hybrid interaction with the CAR C terminus appeared to be specific (Table I).Table ISpecificity of MUPP1-CAR interaction in yeast S. cerevisiae AH109 was transformed with MUPP1 PDZ domains 12 and 13 in the activation domain vector pGBKT7, and the mCAR cytoplasmic domain in the binding domain vector pGADT7, or with control plasmids containing no insert, human lamin C, SV40 T antigen (T Ag), or murine p53. GAL4 activation was determined by the identification of Ade+/His+/LacZ+ transformants.Activation domainBinding domainGAL4 activationpGBKT7-MUPP1pGADT7-CAR+pGBKT7-MUPP1None-pGBKT7-MUPP1pGADT7-lamin-NonepGADT7-CAR-pGBKT7 (no insert)pGADT7-CAR-NonepGADT7-T Ag-pGBKT7-p53NonepGBKT7-p53pGADT7-CAR-pGBKT7-p53pGADT7-T Ag+ Open table in a new tab Direct in Vitro Interaction between CAR and MUPP1—The yeast two-hybrid screen indicated that the CAR cytoplasmic domain interacts directly with PDZ domain 13 of MUPP1. We tested whether a GST fusion protein containing MUPP1 PDZ domain 13 could precipitate the CAR cytoplasmic domain prepared as a streptactin-tagged SUMO fusion protein (SUMO-hCAR). MUPP1 GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with SUMO-hCAR in buffer containing detergent and bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed, and precipitated proteins were blotted for streptactin. A GST protein containing MUPP1 PDZ domains 12 and 13 (MUPPPDZ 12–13) precipitated SUMO-hCAR but not streptacin-tagged SUMO (Fig. 1). GST alone, or a control fusion protein containing MUPP1 PDZ domain 10, did not precipitate SUMO-hCAR. These results confirm that the CAR C terminus interacts directly with MUPP1. CAR Associates with MUPP1 and Recruits MUPP1 to Intercellular Junctions—In a human polarized epithelial cell line, Caco-2, both CAR and MUPP1 were localized to the apical region of the lateral cell membrane as determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A). ZO-1 colocalized with both CAR and MUPP1 (not shown), consistent with previous reports that all three proteins are components of the epithelial tight junction. When CAR was precipitated from Caco-2 cell lysates with monoclonal antibody RmcB, MUPP1 was detected in the precipitates by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-MUPP1 antibody (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that CAR and MUPP1 are physically associated at the tight junction of human epithelial cells. CHO cells do not naturally form tight junctions and do not express many tight junction components. When HA-tagged human MUPP1 was introduced into CHO cells engineered to express human CAR (CHO-hCAR), CAR and MUPP1 could be coprecipitated with either anti-CAR or by anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3), and HA staining was seen exclusively at cell borders (Fig. 4A). In sparsely plated cultures, staining for both CAR and HA-MUPP1 was accentuated at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 4B). In contrast, HA-tagged MUPP1 introduced into control CHO cells (CHO-pcDNA) was expressed in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 4A) with no staining at cell junctions. These results indicated that transfected MUPP1 and CAR associate in non-polarized CHO cells and suggested that association with CAR recruits MUPP1 to sites of intercellular contact.Fig. 4CAR recruits MUPP1 to cell junctions.A, CHO cells stably transfected with pcDNA vector or with pcDNA encoding full-length or truncated hCAR (Δtail, AQS) were transiently transfected with HA-MUPP1, and 48 h later stained with polyclonal anti-CAR and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. B, CHO-hCAR cells plated at low density were transiently transfected with HA-MUPP1 and stained 48 h later with polyclonal anti-CAR and monoclonal anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Association with MUPP1 Depends on the CAR C Terminus— HA-MUPP1 introduced into CHO cells expressing truncated human CAR, with deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain (CARΔtail) or deletion of the C-terminal DGSIV motif (CARAQS), was expressed throughout the cytoplasm, with no localization to cell-cell contacts (Figs. 4A). Unlike full-length CAR, CARΔtail and CARAQS did not coprecipitate with MUPP1, and MUPP1 did not coprecipitate with truncated CAR (Fig. 3). Thus, the association between CAR and MUPP1, and recruitment of MUPP1 to sites of cell contact, depends on the presence of the putative PDZ-binding motif at the CAR C terminus. Given the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen, and the in vitro pull-down experiment shown above, it is likely that CAR association with MUPP1 involves an interaction between the C-terminal motif and MUPP1 PDZ domain 13. Localization of MUPP1 in the Absence of CAR—The experiments in CHO cells indicated that CAR recruits MUPP1 to sites of contact between transfected CHO cells. To determine whether endogenous CAR is involved in MUPP1 recruitment to the tight junction of polarized epithelial cells, we used RNA interference technology to silence CAR expression. siRNAs specific to CAR were transiently transfected into Caco-2 cells. RT-PCR was performed at 48-h post-transfection to determine the extent of CAR mRNA knockdown by siRNA transfection. Caco-2 cells transfected with a control siRNA with no sequence similarity to any human gene sequence showed a high level of CAR expression, indicating that transfection of cells with a nonspecific siRNA had no effect on CAR mRNA expression (Fig. 5A, right). However, transfection of cells with a siRNA specific for CAR significantly reduced endogenous CAR mRNA levels (Fig. 5A, left). To determine whether the decrease of mRNA levels resulted in a reduction in protein expression, control and CAR siRNA-transfected lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. CAR protein expression was significantly reduced in CAR siRNA-transfected cells compared with controls (Fig. 5B). Immunoblots were stripped and reprobed for GAPDH to control for equal protein loading. The residual levels of CAR mRNA and protein most likely reflect the limitation of silencing by transient transfection in this cell type. To establish whether the loss of CAR expression by siRNA transfection would affect the localization or expression of TJ-associated proteins, particularly MUPP1, we performed immunostaining and Western blot analysis. Lysates from CAR or control siRNA-transfected Caco-2 were collected and probed with antibodies to several TJ proteins including ZO-1 and MUPP1. Down-regulation of CAR had no effect on the expression of either ZO-1 or MUPP1 (Fig. 5B). Loss of CAR expression also did not affect the distribution of ZO-1 as assessed by immunostaining (Fig. 6A). Several other TJ and adherens junction proteins were unaffected by CAR silencing, including ZO-2, junctional adhesion molecule-1, claudin-1, and β-catenin (data not shown). In cells transfected with a nonspecific siRNA, MUPP1 distribution remained intact, as characterized by a continuous ring circumscribing each cell (Fig. 6B). In contrast, MUPP1 was dramatically relocalized to punctate bodies within the cytoplasm in cells transfected with a siRNA directed against CAR (Fig. 6B). As determined by serial confocal cross-sections, these areas of punctate MUPP1 staining resided in the apical-most domain of the epithelium (within 1.75 μm) with little localization below the level of the apical TJ (data not shown). To determine whether these bodies resulted from the relocalization or recycling of MUPP1 through endocytic vesicles or from its being targeted for degradation, we attempted to stain MUPP1 intracellular bodies with antibodies specific for endosomal markers and for components of the ubiquitin degradation pathway. MUPP1-positive bodies did not express the early endosome marker early endosome antigen 1 (13Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P.

Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), the lysosomal markers LIMP II (Fig. 7), or the late endosome/lysosomal marker LAMP I (data not shown) (15Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MUPP1-positive bodies did not colocalize with internalized fluorochrome-labeled dextran (data not shown), further indicating that MUPP1 was not relocalized to endocytic compartments. MUPP1-positive intracellular bodies did not stain with antibodies specific for ubiquitin or the 26 S proteasome (data not shown). These data indicated that CAR is involved in the localization of MUPP1 to the TJ and that in the absence of CAR, MUPP1 may be retargeted to specialized vesicles within the cytoplasm. We found that the CAR cytoplasmic domain interacts with the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1. The interaction specifically involves the PDZ-binding motif within the CAR C terminus and MUPP1 PDZ domain 13. In transfected cells, localization of CAR to cell-cell contact appears to recruit MUPP1. In polarized epithelial cells, endogenous CAR and MUPP colocalize and are physically associated within the tight junction. Inhibition of endogenous CAR expression in polarized epithelia by siRNA transfection leads to relocalization of MUPP1. MUPP1 localizes to the TJ and interacts with junctional adhesion molecule and with members of the claudin family of transmembrane proteins (11Hamazaki Y. Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 455-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Jeansonne B. Lu Q. Goodenough D.A. Chen Y.H. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2003; 49: 13-21PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of CAR within the TJ by siRNA transfection led to pronounced relocalization of MUPP1 from the apical TJ complex to punctate bodies within the apical domain. We were unable to identify or define the nature of the MUPP1 bodies, and it remains unclear whether they result from recycling of MUPP1 from the TJ or the whether targeting of MUPP1 to the TJ is disrupted in the absence of CAR. MUPP1 is known to interact with the junctional adhesion molecule and claudin-1, and it is not known whether loss of these components would have a similar effect. The evidence in CHO cells indicates that CAR is capable of recruiting MUPP1 to sites of cell contact and therefore may indicate that loss of CAR leads to improper targeting of MUPP1 to the TJ. Other junctional proteins including junctional adhesion molecule, claudin-1, and ZO-1 have been shown to reside in unique storage organelles following a calcium switch (17Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the absence of CAR leads to the destabilization of the junction and relocalization of MUPP1 to similar organelles. The loss of membrane-associated MUPP1 has been postulated to correlate with the transforming ability of two viral oncoproteins, adenovirus E4-ORF1 and high risk Papillomavirus type 18 E6 (10Lee S.S. Glaunsinger B. Mantovani F. Banks L. Javier R.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9680-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the presence of E4-ORF1, MUPP1 has been noted to relocate to intracellular bodies within the cytoplasm similar in appearance to those induced by silencing of endogenous CAR. In addition to TJ proteins, MUPP1 interacts with several important mediators of cellular signaling, which may indicate its role as an adaptor for intracellular signaling molecules. By yeast two-hybrid screening, MUPP1 interacts with serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C receptors (18Parker L.L. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Shieh B.H. J. Biol.

It remains to be determined whether the effects of CAR on cell proliferation are mediated through its interaction with MUPP1 or other junctional proteins.

Acute insulin infusion in the third cerebral ventricle inhibits endogenous glucose production (GP), whereas acute leptin infusion stimulates gluconeogenesis but does not alter GP because of a compensatory decrease in glycogenolysis. Because melanocortin agonists also stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, here we examined whether central melanocortin blockade modifies the acute effects of leptin on GP, on gluconeogenesis, on glycogenolysis, and/or on the hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Systemic or central administration of leptin alone did not alter GP, despite increasing both the rate of gluconeogenesis and the expression of Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK. When activation of the central melanocortin pathway was prevented, the effects of leptin on gluconeogenesis, Glc-6-Pase, and PEPCK were abolished, and a marked suppression of glycogenolysis resulted in decreased GP. We conclude that leptin regulates hepatic glucose fluxes through a melanocortin-dependent pathway leading to stimulation of gluconeogenesis and a melanocortin-independent pathway causing inhibition of GP and glycogenolysis.

Leptin, the 167-amino acid polypeptide product of the ob gene, is secreted by the adipose tissue and acts mainly on the central nervous system to regulate energy balance (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4580) Google Scholar). Leptin regulates food intake and body adiposity partly via activation of melanocortin receptors in the hypothalamus and in other areas within the central nervous system (2Seeley R.J. Yagaloff K.A.

Similarly, bi-directional modulation of the activity of the central melanocortin pathway leads to significant changes in hepatic and peripheral insulin action (15Obici S. Feng Z. Tan J. Liu L. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the prolonged administration of either leptin or melanocortin agonists or antagonists also impacts on the distribution of body adiposity and on lipid homeostasis (10Barzilai N.

Feng Z. Tan J. Liu L. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to delineate the acute effects of leptin and melanocortins on metabolic fluxes prior to the onset of changes in energy balance, body composition, and lipid storage. In this regard, acute administration of leptin to postabsorptive rats causes a marked redistribution of intrahepatic glucose fluxes, with a marked increase in the relative contribution of gluconeogenesis and a parallel decrease in the contribution of glycogenolysis to hepatic glucose output (5Rossetti L.

This effect is seen following either systemic or central administration of the hormone (5Rossetti L. Massillon D. Barzilai N. Vuguin P. Chen W. Hawkins M. Wu J. Wang J. J. Biol.

Leptin appears to exert its pleiotropic behavioral, metabolic, and neuroendocrine actions via multiple and partly divergent central pathways (19Bjorbaek C. Kahn B.B. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2004; 59: 305-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 20Myers Jr., M.G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2004; 59: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). For example, it has been suggested that leptin controls the hypothalamic melanocortin pathway and energy balance via STAT3-dependent 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GP, glucose production; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IV, intravenous; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Glc-6-Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FFA, free fatty acids; α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. signaling and the NPY pathway, reproductive function, and glucose homeostasis via STAT3-independent signaling (20Myers Jr., M.G.

Maratos-Flier E. Neel B.G. Schwartz M.W. Myers Jr., M.G. Nature. 2003; 421: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Furthermore, leptin and insulin receptors appear to share mechanisms of signal transduction such as the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (22Niswender K.D. Morton G.J. Stearns W.H. Rhodes C.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Schwartz M.W. Nature. 2001; 413: 794-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 23Niswender K.D. Morrison C.D. Clegg D.J. Olson R. Baskin D.G. Myers Jr., M.G. Seeley R.J. Schwartz M.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These observations are intriguing because these two hormones have partly overlapping and partly divergent physiological actions (24Baskin D.G. Figlewicz L.D. Seeley R.J. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Schwartz M.W. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 25Kim Y.B. Uotani S. Pierroz D.D. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B.

Of particular interest, the acute ICV administration of insulin markedly inhibits endogenous glucose production (GP) via a PI3K-dependent mechanism (27Obici S. Zhang B.B. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), whereas the acute administration of leptin stimulates gluconeogenesis and liver PEPCK expression (5Rossetti L. Massillon D.

To delineate the contribution of the central melanocortin pathway to the acute effects of leptin on glucose homeostasis, we first examined whether and how the central activation of the melanocortin pathway modulates glucose fluxes, and then we examined the contribution of the central melanocortin pathway to the acute effects of systemic and ICV leptin on glucose kinetics. Our results reveal specific and potent melanocortin-dependent and melanocortin-independent effects of leptin on hepatic glucose fluxes. Animals and Experimental Design—Ten-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were housed in individual cages and subjected to a standard light-dark cycle (0600–1800/1800–0600). Three weeks prior to the in vivo studies (see Fig. 1B), all of the rats received implantations of ICV catheters by stereotaxic surgery as previously described (6Liu L. Karkanias G.B. Morales J.C. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Wang J. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31160-31167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). One week before the pancreatic insulin clamp protocols, the rats received additional catheters in the right internal jugular and left carotid artery as previously described (5Rossetti L. Massillon D.

The rats were fed a standard chow (catalog number 5001; Purina Mills Ltd.) and were allowed to recover completely before initiation of all in vivo studies. Insulin Action Studies—The rats (n = 79) were implanted with chronic catheters as previously described (6Liu L. Karkanias G.B. Morales J.C. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Wang J. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31160-31167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). After full recovery from the catheterization, the animals were randomized into eight groups receiving the following infusions for the duration of the in vivo study (6H; see Fig. 1C): 1) ICV vehicle, 2) ICV α-MSH (3 μg/6 h), 3) ICV leptin (1.5 μg/6 h), and 4) IV leptin (3 μg/kg·min); each of the above infusions were performed in the absence or presence of ICV SHU9119 (1 μg/6 h). At t =–2 h (Fig. 1C), a primed continuous infusion of ICV solutions was initiated and maintained throughout the duration of the study. Plasma glucose was measured periodically initiating at the onset (t = 2h) of the ICV infusion and lasting throughout the duration of the study. Plasma samples for the determination of insulin, leptin, and nonesterified fatty acid concentration were obtained at the onset (t = –2 h) and at 30-min intervals during the study. At t = 0, a primed continuous infusion of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified [3-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 40 μCi of bolus, 0.4 μCi/min for duration of the study) was initiated and maintained for the last 4 h of the study. Samples for determination of [3H]glucose specific activity were obtained at 10-min intervals throughout the infusions. Finally, at t = 2 h, a pancreatic insulin clamp study was initiated and maintained for 2 h. During this procedure, a primed continuous infusion of regular insulin (3 milliunits/kg·min) was administered, and a variable infusion of 25% glucose solution was started at t = 2 and periodically adjusted to clamp the plasma glucose concentration at ∼7mm. The rate of insulin infusion was designed to obtain physiological hyperinsulinemia (see Table I). To control for possible effects of the ICV injections on endocrine pancreas, somatostatin (3 μg/kg/min) was co-infused with insulin to inhibit endogenous islets secretion. At the end of the in vivo studies, the rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital 55 mg/kg body weight, intravenously), and tissue samples were freeze-clamped in situ with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen. All of the tissue samples were stored at –80 °C for subsequent analysis.Table ICharacteristics of the experimental groups before and during the pancreatic clamp studiesIVICVVehicleLeptinLeptin and SHU9119VehicleLeptinLeptin and SHU9119BasalBody weight (g)322 ± 20303 ± 12301 ± 5286 ± 12283 ± 24302 ± 8Glucose (mm)8.1 ± 0.27.9 ± 0.18.2 ± 0.28.1 ± 0.28.2 ± 0.28.4 ± 0.1Insulin (ng/ml)2.3 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.2Leptin (ng/ml)1.5 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.3Adiponectin (ng/ml)5.2 ± 0.54.5 ± 0.54.7 ± 0.44.9 ± 1.03.9 ± 0.74.4 ± 1.0FFA (mm)1.0 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1ClampGlucose (mm)7.6 ± 0.18.0 ± 0.27.6 ± 0.37.7 ± 0.27.9 ± 0.37.9 ± 0.3Insulin (ng/ml)2.6 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.73.1 ± 0.52.5 ± 0.33.4 ± 0.7Leptin (ng/ml)1.2 ± 0.234.8 ± 4.342.9 ± 2.41.7 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.2FFA (mm)0.8 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The ICV vehicle was artificial cerebrospinal fluid, whereas the IV vehicle was isotonic saline.

Analytical Procedures and Calculations—Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA).

Plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were determined an enzymatic method by an automated kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Waco Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). The radioactivity of [3-3H]glucose in plasma was measured from supernatants of Ba(OH)2 and from ZnSO4 precipitates (Somogyi procedure), after each was evaporated to dryness for the removal of tritiated water. The hepatic [14C]phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and [3H/14C]UDP glucose specific activities were obtained by two sequential chromatographic separations, as previously described (28Giaccari A. Rossetti L.

Open table in a new tab Gene Expression—Glc-6-Pase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression was measured by quantitative real time PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from rat livers using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was then synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using the Superscript III First Strand kit (Invitrogen). Samples of RNA in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted (“no reverse transcriptase controls”) were also included. The cDNA and reverse transcriptase controls were diluted 1:20 with PCR grade water and 2 μl from each sample was used for PCR in a total volume of 20 μl. The FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) and a LightCycler 2 instrument (Roche Applied Science) were used in all experiments. Either 18 S or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression was routinely measured for normalization purposes. The primers used were: 5′-GCGACCGTCCCCTTTGCATCTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCACCAAACACTCCCCCTCCTCC-3′ for Glc-6-Pase; 5′-GCCTCCTCAGCTGCATAATGGTCT-3′ and 5′-GAATGCTTTCTCGAAGTCCTCTTCTG-3′ for PEPCK; 5′-AGGGTTCGATTCCGGAGAGG-3′ and 5′-CAACTTTAATATACGCTATTGG-3′ for 18 S; and 5′-CGACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAAC-3′ and 5′-ACTCCACGACATACTCAGCACC-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The copy mRNA number was calculated from standard curves obtained using plasmid DNA standards of known copy number for the each gene of interest. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. To investigate the mechanism by which leptin regulates glucose kinetics independently of its pleiotropic actions on energy balance and body composition, we examined whether and how acute modulation of the activity of central melanocortin receptors affect the action of leptin on hepatic and peripheral glucose fluxes. ICV catheters were implanted in male Sprague-Dawley rats by stereotaxic surgery (6Liu L. Karkanias G.B. Morales J.C. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Wang J. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31160-31167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All of the infusion studies were performed ∼3 weeks later following complete recovery from the operation (Fig. 1A). Activation of Central Melanocortin Receptors Leads to a Marked Increase in Liver Gluconeogenesis—We first examined whether stimulation of central melanocortin receptors per se alters insulin action on glucose metabolism. To this end, four groups of conscious rats received an ICV infusion of either vehicle, α-MSH (agonist of the melanocortin receptors), SHU9119 (antagonist of the melanocortin receptors), or both α-MSH and SHU9119 (34Fan W. Boston B.A. Kesterson R.A. Hruby V.J. Cone R.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar) in combination with pancreatic insulin clamp studies (Fig. 1B). The plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, and FFA concentrations were similar in the four groups prior and during the clamp procedure. During physiologic hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin ∼400 pm), the rate of glucose infusion required to maintain the plasma glucose concentration at basal levels was decreased (by 25%) by ICV α-MSH, and this decrease was completely abolished by the concomitant ICV infusion of SHU9119. The two major effects of insulin on glucose metabolism are to stimulate the uptake of glucose into peripheral tissues (mostly in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) and to diminish the production of glucose by the liver. The rate of tissue glucose uptake (Rd) in rats receiving ICV α-MSH (22.8 ± 1.7 mg/kg·min) was similar to that of rats receiving ICV vehicle (21.9 ± 1.4; p = not significant) (Fig. 1C). Conversely, ICV α-MSH impaired the action of insulin in inhibiting GP (Fig. 1D). Importantly, SHU9119 per se did not modify the effect of insulin on GP, but it blocked the effect of ICV α-MSH. In Fig. 1D, the effect of insulin on GP is expressed as a percentage of inhibition from basal levels. Insulin inhibited GP by 58 ± 4% in the presence of ICV vehicle but by only 20 ± 10% when ICV α-MSH was infused (p < 0.01 versus vehicle). When SHU9119 was co-infused ICV, α-MSH failed to alter the inhibitory action of insulin on GP (64 ± 11%), whereas SHU9119 alone did not alter hepatic insulin action (60 ± 11%). Thus, the stimulatory effect of the central administration of α-MSH on GP is specific because the selective inhibition of central melanocortin receptors is sufficient to negate the effects of ICV α-MSH on hepatic insulin action. In the presence of physiological hyperinsulinemia, ICV α-MSH caused a 2-fold increase in the rate of GP (Fig. 2A) as compared with the ICV vehicle-infused group. This effect was abolished by the concomitant administration of SHU9119, whereas the ICV administration of an equal dose of the melanocortin antagonist per se did not modify GP. To further delineate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of α-MSH on GP, we estimated the in vivo flux through glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 2B) and the relative contributions of glycogenolysis (Fig. 2C) and gluconeogenesis (Fig. 2D) to glucose output. Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the final step in the dephosphorylation of glucose-6-phosphate derived from either gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis to glucose. The increase in GP caused by α-MSH was paralleled by a 2.4-fold increase in the flux through glucose-6-phosphatase, an effect that was also negated by the co-infusion of SHU9119. The marked effects of ICV α-MSH on GP and glucose-6-phosphatase flux were entirely accounted for by a 3.4-fold increase in the rate of gluconeogenesis when compared with the vehicle-infused group (9.3 ± 2.0 versus 2.7 ± 0.5 mg/kg·min; p < 0.01), whereas the rates of glycogenolysis were not significantly affected. The stimulatory effect of ICV α-MSH on gluconeogenesis was prevented by the ICV co-infusion of a melanocortin receptor antagonist. Finally, we examined whether changes in the expression of the liver gluconeogenic enzymes Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK could mediate these changes in hepatic glucose fluxes. Central activation of melanocortin receptors led to increased hepatic expression of Glc-6-Pase (2.4-fold; Fig. 2E) and PEPCK (2-fold; Fig. 2F). These transcriptional changes were also negated by the central administration of SHU9119 (Fig. 2, E and F). Overall, we describe a potent and rapid stimulatory effect of the central melanocortin pathway on gluconeogenesis and on hepatic Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK mRNA. Importantly, we have also identified a dose of the melanocortin receptor antagonist SHU9119 that specifically blocks the effects of ICV α-MSH but has no direct actions on liver glucose fluxes or gene expression. The latter observation provides an attractive experimental tool to delineate the contribution of central melanocortin receptors to the rapid metabolic actions of leptin. Melanocortin-independent Effects of Systemic Leptin on Hepatic Glucose Fluxes—We next examined whether and how central antagonism of melanocortin receptors alters the effects of systemic leptin on hepatic glucose fluxes. To this end, three groups of conscious rats received a systemic infusion of either vehicle, leptin, or systemic leptin and ICV SHU9119 in combination with pancreatic insulin clamp studies (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table I). The plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, and FFA concentrations were similar in the three groups prior and during the clamp procedure (Table I). During physiologic hyperinsulinemia (∼400 pm plasma insulin), the rate of glucose infusion required to maintain the plasma glucose concentration at basal levels was not affected by leptin alone, but it was significantly increased (by 75%) by the concomitant ICV infusion of SHU9119. The rates of glucose uptake (Rd) were similar in rats receiving systemic vehicle or leptin with or without ICV SHU9119 (p = not significant) (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the coinfusion of systemic leptin and ICV SHU9119 significantly enhanced the action of insulin in inhibiting GP (Fig. 3B). In Fig. 3B, the effect of insulin on GP is expressed as the percentage of inhibition from basal levels. Insulin inhibited GP by 55 ± 5% in the presence of vehicle. Although leptin alone did not alter hepatic insulin action (47 ± 4%), when ICV SHU9119 was co-infused systemic leptin resulted in enhanced suppression of GP (by 79 ± 6%; p < 0.01 versus vehicle). Thus, the central administration of an antagonist of the melanocortin receptors unveils a potent melanocortin-independent effect of systemic leptin on hepatic insulin action. To further delineate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of systemic leptin on GP, we estimated the in vivo flux through glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 4B) and the relative contributions of glycogenolysis (Fig. 4C and Table II) and gluconeogenesis (Fig. 4D) to glucose output. In the presence of physiological hyperinsulinemia, leptin did not modify the rate of GP as compared with the vehicle-infused group. However, the concomitant administration of systemic leptin and ICV SHU9119 markedly decreased GP (Fig. 3A). The decrease in GP caused by the combination of leptin and SHU9119 was paralleled by a marked decrease in the flux through Glc-6-Pase. Consistent with our previous report (5Rossetti L. Massillon D.

We expressed green fluorescent protein-tagged IP3R1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and observed the lateral diffusion by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. IP3R1 showed lateral diffusion with an effective diffusion constant of ∼0.3 μm2/s. Depletion of actin filaments increased the diffusion constant of IP3R1, suggesting that the diffusion of IP3R1 is regulated negatively through actin filaments. We also found that protein 4.1N, which binds to IP3R1 and contains an actin-spectrin-binding region, was responsible for this actin regulation of the IP3R1 diffusion constant. Overexpression of dominant-negative 4.1N and blockade of 4.1N binding to IP3R1 increased the IP3R1 diffusion constant. The diffusion of IP3R type 3 (IP3R3), one of the isoforms of IP3Rs lacking the binding ability to 4.1N, was not dependent on actin filaments but became dependent on actin filaments after the addition of a 4.1N-binding sequence. These data suggest that 4.1N serves as a linker protein between IP3R1 and actin filaments. This actin filament-dependent regulation of IP3R1 diffusion may be important for the spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar) and located on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IP3, which is generated in response to various extracellular stimuli, binds to IP3Rs and induces Ca2+ release (IP3-induced Ca2+ release; IICR) (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 2Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). IICR plays crucial roles in various neuronal activities. For example, mouse strains mutated in the IP3R type 1 (IP3R1) gene display severe ataxia and epileptic seizures (3Matsumoto M. Nakagawa T. Inoue T. Nagata E. Tanaka K. Takano H. Minowa O. Kuno J. Sakakibara S. Yamada M. Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Fukuuchi Y. Furuichi T. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Noda T.

Science. 1998; 282: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). IICR is also known to be involved in long term potentiation and long term depression in the hippocampal CA1 area (6Fujii S. Matsumoto M. Igarashi K. Kato H. Mikoshiba K. Learn. Mem. 2000; 7: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Nishiyama M. Hong K. Mikoshiba K. Poo M.M. Kato K. Nature. 2000; 408: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and in long term depression in cerebellar Purkinje cells (8Inoue T. Kato K. Kohda K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5366-5373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, IICR in neurons is highly restricted spatially (9Finch E.A. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Takechi H. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), although the ER is spread throughout the cell, and the induction of synaptic plasticity (11Miyata M. Finch E.A. Khiroug L.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and regulation of nerve growth (5Takei K. Shin R.M. Inoue T. Kato K. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1998; 282: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) require spatially restricted IICR. Some ER Ca2+-handling proteins including IP3Rs show uneven distribution patterns (12Papp S. Dziak E. Michalak M. Opas M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and this heterogeneity is postulated to be responsible for the spatially and temporally heterogeneous Ca2+ signaling patterns. Thus, targeting of IP3Rs to specific regions in the cell may be one of the important factors in the spatial regulation of IICR; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatial regulation of IICR remain to be elucidated. The dynamics of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) have been intensively studied. In addition to an elaborate mechanism for insertion and removal from the plasma membrane (13Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the lateral diffusion of AMPAR on the plasma membrane is regulated actively, especially by local Ca2+ signals (14Borgdorff A.J. Choquet D. Nature. 2002; 417: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 15Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). All of the dynamics of AMPAR have been implied to play important roles in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Thus, the distribution pattern of IP3Rs and their dynamics in dendrites is also considered to be important for the fine tuning of Ca2+-dependent events, such as synaptic plasticity, that are little understood to date. We have shown the existence of vesicular ERs that are transported along dendrites bi-directionally with a fast velocity (0.2–0.3 μm/s) (16Bannai H. Inoue T. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), in addition to the ER in reticular structure. In this study, we focused on the dynamics of ER membrane proteins in the reticular ER in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons and observed their diffusive movements using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique. To our surprise, the diffusive movement of IP3R1 was regulated through actin filaments, and this regulation was not seen for other ER membrane proteins such as sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) and IP3R type 3 (IP3R3). Furthermore, we found that the actin-spectrin-binding protein 4.1N, which binds to the C terminus of IP3R1 (17Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K.

A monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/Zeo+-mRFP) was generated by inserting a fragment encoding mRFP (21Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S.

To construct a chimeric cDNA GFP-IP3R3-CTT14aa, we synthesized primers 1 (5′-CATGAGCCGGGGACATCCTCCTCAC-3′), 2 (5′-CAACAACGCACAGAATCTAGC-3′), 3 (5′-GACAAGATGGACTGTGTCTC-3′), 4 (5′-GAGGATGTCCCCGGTCATGCAGTTC-3′), and 5 (5′-TGCTTCATCTCTGGCCTGGAG-3′). First, cDNA sequences encoding amino acids 2735–2740 of IP3R1 and amino acids 2666–2670 of IP3R3 were amplified by PCR with primer set 1 and 2 and primer set 3 and 4, and pBlueBac4.5-C12 and pcDNA3.1/Zeo+-EC3 as templates, respectively. The PCR products were mixed, denatured, annealed, and reamplified using primer set 2 and 5 to create a chimeric sequence. The chimeric product and the original pcDNA3.1/Zeo+-EC3 were both digested with SacII and XbaI and ligated together to obtain the full-length chimera GFP-IP3R3-CTT14aa in pcDNA3.1/Zeo+. Primary Culture and Transfection of Hippocampal Neurons—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from the hippocampi of 1-day-old Wistar rats, as described previously (16Bannai H. Inoue T. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cells were plated on poly-l-lysine (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)-coated coverslips at a density of 3.2 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in Neurobasal Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5 mm l-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque), 2.5% (v/v) B-27 (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (250 units/ml penicillin and 250 μg/ml streptomycin). The cultures were transfected with 10 μg of the DNAs, usually on days 4–5 in vitro, using a standard calcium phosphate method (22Köhrmann M. Haubensak W. Hemraj I. Kaether C. Leβmann V.J. Kiebler M.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were used for cytochemistry or imaging experiments 2–3 days after the transfection. Time Lapse Imaging and Photobleaching Experiments—For the time lapse imaging experiments, the culture medium was supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Fluorescence images of the cells were taken under a confocal scanning microscope (FV-300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus) with a 60× objective (NA 1.4 or 1.45, oil immersion, UplanApo; Olympus). The temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a heating chamber that surrounded the microscope stage. The GFP signal was excited at 488 nm, and emission was detected through a 510–550-nm bandpass filter. The FRAP technique was carried out as follows. An image was taken before the photobleaching (Before) with a low laser power (6% of full power) and a scanning area (66 × 88 μm), and the center area of the field of view was bleached out with continuous high power (100%) laser scanning with a scanning area (20 × 27 μm) for 40 s. The laser power and scanning area were then returned to the initial settings, and the fluorescence recovery into the photobleached area was monitored every 5 s for 5 min. The images were stored at a resolution of 600 × 800 pixels. The images shown in Figs. 1 (A and B) and 3A were processed after digital smoothing to reduce the noise level. The smoothing filter is implemented using 3 × 3 spatial convolutions, where the value of each pixel in the selection is replaced with the weighted average of its 3 × 3 neighborhood. Center pixels are weighted 4-fold more than surrounding pixels.Fig. 3The Deff of GFP-IP3R1 is dependent on actin filaments, whereas that of GFP-SERCA2a is not.

Inoue T. Tashiro T. Okamoto K. Komiya Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 65: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we quantified the movement of ER proteins as the apparent velocity of the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which was effective for comparing the speed of protein diffusion under the same experimental conditions, but we could not compare them to the diffusion constants of other proteins reported in the literature. To solve this issue, we adopted a different approach that enabled direct estimation of the effective diffusion constants (Deff) of ER proteins from the FRAP results. We adopted a theory described by Siggia et al. (23Siggia E.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bekiranov S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1761-1770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in which the movement of proteins on the ER membrane is simulated by diffusion in random media. Throughout this study, we considered the ER networks in neuronal dendrites to be one-dimensional along dendrites, because the thicknesses of the target dendrites were much thinner than the photobleached length. We thus simulated the axial movement of the fluorescent signals as one-dimensional diffusion using the model proposed by Siggia et al. (23Siggia E.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bekiranov S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1761-1770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To convert the basic data set, which consisted of a prebleach image and a series of postbleach images of 12-bit precision, to a series of one-dimensional data sets, the following arrangements were carried out. During the experiments, the cells were placed so that the dendrites lay horizontally in the image frame. During the analysis, the image was rotated if necessary to ensure that the target dendrite was horizontal (parallel to the x axis; Fig. 1A). A sufficiently large rectangular strip was then selected, including the bleached region of the dendrite, with its long axis in the x direction, and further analysis was performed within this rectangle (Fig. 1B). The fluorescence intensity data in the rectangle was compressed in the y direction by averaging to create one-dimensional data sets (“line compress”), which were stacked to create a two-dimensional data set (the second axis represents time; Fig. 1C). To reduce noise, four contiguous pixels along the x axis were further averaged to make a “binned” pixel strip of N pixels (Fx(t)). The background fluorescence, which included the offset of the analog/digital conversion added in reading the photomultiplier output of the confocal scanner, was obtained by averaging the pixel intensities over a region of the image that did not contain any cell structures. The time constant of the photobleaching during the acquisition of the postbleach images was estimated by fitting the fluorescence intensity decay of the entire cell area to an exponential function. We calculated the theoretical time course using Equations 1 and 2, which are derived from Equations 11 and 12, respectively, of Siggia et al. (23Siggia E.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bekiranov S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1761-1770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by slight modifications to introduce the photobleach correction, ji+1/2=0.5Deffe−T/τ(ρ¯i+1+ρ¯i)((ρ/ρ¯)i+1−(ρ/ρ¯)i) Eq.1 ρi(t+δ)=ρi(t)+δ(ji+1/2−ji−1/2) Eq.2 where T is the time lapse interval, τ is the photobleach time constant, jx(t) is the current of the fluorescence, and ρx(t) is the fluorescence density to which the raw data Fx(t) was fitted.(ρ¯)corresponds to the initial fluorescence distribution calculated from the prebleach image. The actual pixel values obtained in experiments were used as a boundary condition (F0(t) and FN–1(t)) for every time step, which effectively canceled the fluorescent decrease of the surrounding nonbleached areas during the photobleaching. We calculated ρx(t) recursively with different values of the Deff and determined the value that best fitted the real data Fx(t). All of the analyses were performed using custom-made software (TI Workbench) running on a Macintosh computer. We have reported the existence of vesicular ERs, which are transported along dendrites, in addition to the reticular ER structure in hippocampal neurons (16Bannai H. Inoue T. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the total fluorescence signal of reticular ER was about 700-fold larger than that of vesicular ERs in dendrites (data not shown); we assumed that the effect of signal arising from the vesicular ER was negligible in this study. The data were expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using StatView (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). A comparison between the two groups was performed by an unpaired t test. Differences with p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Drug Preparation and Immunocytochemistry—Stock solutions of latrunculin A (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen), jasplakinolide (1 mm; Invitrogen), and nocodazole (10 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at –20 °C. The final concentrations of latrunculin A, jasplakinolide, and nocodazole in the culture medium were 1 μg/ml, 10 μm, and 30 μg/ml, respectively. To apply the drugs to the cells, a certain quantity of medium containing twice the final concentrations of the drugs was added to an equal volume of the culture medium. Cultured neurons were incubated with latrunculin A and nocodazole for 1 h each or with jasplakinolide for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To confirm that the cytoskeleton was disrupted or polymerized, fixed cells were stained with Alexa 594-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) or an anti-tubulin antibody (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with the anti-tubulin antibody (1:500 dilution) or Alexa 594-conjugated phalloidin (1:40 dilution). Alexa 488-conjugated IgGs (Invitrogen) were used as the secondary antibody for the anti-tubulin antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Five μg DNA/10-cm diameter culture dish was transfected using TransIT transfection regents (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested 1 day after transfection, and the lysates were prepared as previously described (24Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7932-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. The lysates were preincubated with 5–10 μg of an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science) or an anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The complexes were then centrifuged and washed with buffer three times. The proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and the membranes were probed with an anti-enhanced green fluorescent protein antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) and an anti-HA antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Movement of GFP-tagged ER Membrane Proteins in Dendrites—Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP-tagged IP3R1 (GFP-IP3R1) or GFP-tagged SERCA2a (GFP-SERCA2a) to observe the dynamics of ER membrane proteins in dendrites (Fig. 1A). A segment of each dendrite was photobleached, and the recovery of fluorescence into the bleached area was measured. As shown in Fig. 1B, both GFP-IP3R1 and GFP-SERCA2a gradually migrated into the photobleached area from both ends. The movements of these proteins were also visualized by constructing “compressed images” from time lapse image stacks (Fig. 1C; refer to Experimental Procedures). This apparent diffusive nature allowed us to measure the effective diffusion constant (Deff) by fitting to a diffusion model, which was specialized for modeling diffusion in a straight tubular structure, such as a dendrite (see “Experimental Procedures”). To examine the validity of this model in neuronal dendrites, we measured the Deff of a smaller ER protein, GFP-tagged mouse major histocompatibility complex class I H2Ld (GFP-H2Ldin) (19Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in dendrites and compared this Deff with that reported for the same protein in non-neuronal cells. The diffusion coefficient of GFP-H2Ldin has been reported to be ∼0.40 μm2/s in the absence of interaction with the transporter associated with antigen processing 1 complex in L or EE2H cell lines (19Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In dendrites of hippocampal neurons, in which no mRNA for transporter associated with antigen processing 1 is detected (26Neumann H. Schmidt H. Cavalie A. Jenne D. Wekerle H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the Deff of GFP-H2Ldin was 0.46 ± 0.13 μm2/s (n = 25). The similarity between the Deff values shows that our model adequately calculates the diffusion constants in dendrites. Interestingly, the Deff of GFP-IP3R1 (0.26 ± 0.10 μm2/s, n = 18) was significantly smaller than those of GFP-SERCA2a (0.47 ± 0.13 μm2/s, n = 11) and GFP-H2Ldin (0.46 ± 0.13 μm2/s, n = 25) (Fig. 2). GFP-IP3R1 Diffusion Is Sensitive to Actin Filament-destabilizing or -stabilizing Drugs—The diffusion of plasma membrane proteins is regulated by the cytoskeleton, especially actin filaments (27Choquet D. Triller A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 28Haggie P.M. Stanton B.A. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5494-5500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the slow diffusion of IP3R1 was caused by an interaction with the cytoskeleton and tested this possibility by disturbing microtubules and actin filaments pharmacologically. Nocodazole (30 μg/ml) was used to disrupt microtubules, and latrunculin A (1 μg/ml) and jasplakinolide (10 μm) were used to disrupt and stabilize actin filaments, respectively. The effectiveness of the treatments with these compounds was confirmed by cytochemistry in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. After treatment with nocodazole, anti-tubulin antibody staining in neurons was reduced (data not shown). Latrunculin A reduced the density of actin filaments, whereas jasplakinolide turned individual bundles of actin filaments thick and dense (Fig. 3A). Treatment with nocodazole decreased the Deff of GFP-IP3R1 and GFP-SERCA2a to 0.16 ± 0.06 μm2/s (n = 10) and 0.33 ± 0.08 μm2/s (n = 9), respectively (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the integrity of microtubules is an important determinant for the diffusion rate of ER proteins. To our surprise, manipulation of actin filaments only affected the diffusion rate of IP3R1. The Deff of GFP-IP3R1 was increased by latrunculin A treatment and decreased by jasplakinolide treatment to 0.40 ± 0.13 μm2/s (n = 9) and 0.18 ± 0.07 μm2/s (n = 15), respectively (Fig. 3B). However, the Deff of GFP-SERCA2a remained unchanged after treatments with latrunculin A and jasplakinolide at 0.43 ± 0.16 μm2/s (n = 9) and 0.45 ± 0.13 μm2/s (n = 17), respectively (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the movement of GFP-IP3R1 is negatively regulated through actin filaments, whereas that of GFP-SERCA2a is not. We decided to concentrate on investigating the actin-mediated molecular mechanisms that specifically regulate the diffusion of IP3R1. 4.1N Binding Regulates the Diffusion Rate of GFP-IP3R1—We recently found that protein 4.1N, an actin-spectrin-binding protein, binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 via its C-terminal domain, and regulates IP3R1 localization in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (17Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because 4.1N is expressed in central nervous system neurons, including those in the hippocampus, and its expression has also been shown in cultured hippocampal neurons (29Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.U. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we therefore considered 4.1N to be a good candidate for the actin-mediated control of IP3R1 diffusion. To test this possibility, we investigated the effects of DsRed2 (a red fluorescent protein)-tagged 4.1N fusion proteins on the Deff of GFP-IP3R1. Overexpression of DsRed2-tagged full-length 4.1N (DsRed2–4.1N-FL) or DsRed2 alone had little effect on the Deff of GFP-IP3R1 (0.25 ± 0.09 μm2/s, n = 21) and (0.24 ± 0.13 μm2/s, n = 11), respectively (Fig. 4). Next, we analyzed the effect of overexpression of a dominant-negative form of 4.1N, namely a C-terminal domain of 4.1N (4.1N-CTD) that lacks the actin-spectrin-binding domain (17Zhang S. Mizutani A.

We have shown that two structural features of the Vps10p domain, the N-terminal propeptide and the C-terminal segment of ten conserved cysteines (10CC), are key elements in the function of Sortilin. The propeptide has two functions. (i) It binds the mature part of Sortilin and prevents ligands in the biosynthetic pathway from binding to the uncleaved proreceptor, and (ii) it facilitates receptor transport in early Golgi compartments by a mechanism that does not depend on its ability to prevent ligand binding. In contrast, other Vps10p domain receptors, such as SorLA and SorCS3, do not need their propeptide for normal and swift processing. The 10CC segment constitutes an exchangeable module containing five conserved disulfide bridges, and using module-shuffling and truncations, we have shown that the 10CC segment is a major ligand-binding region in Sortilin.

The five currently known family members are Sortilin (∼100 kDa) (1Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H. Røigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

Their common characteristic and the hallmark of the family is the so-called Vps10p-D, named after the yeast sorting protein Vps10p, which contains two copies of a similar domain in its luminal part. Each family member contains a single Vps10p-D situated at the receptor N terminus. In Sortilin, which can be considered the archetypal member, the Vps10p-D makes up the entire luminal receptor, whereas additional unrelated ectodomains are found in the other four. Thus, the mutually very homologous SorCS1–3 all comprise a leucine-rich segment between the Vps10p-D and the plasma membrane (4Hermey G. Riedel I.B. Hampe W. Schaller H.C. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas SorLA contains a cluster of the ligand-binding low density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats, additional elements typical of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, and adjacent to the membrane, a domain of fibronectin type-3 repeats also found in neuronal adhesion molecules (2Jacobsen L.

Following the ectodomains and the transmembrane segment, each receptor carries a short (50–80 amino acids) cytoplasmic domain comprising typical motifs for interaction with cytosolic adaptor molecules. Functional sorting sites, e.g. dileucines, acidic clusters, and tyrosine-based motifs, involved in endocytosis and intracellular transport have so far been established in Sortilin (8Nielsen M.S.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and at least one of the receptors, SorCS1, is transcribed with alternative cytoplasmic tails, giving rise to differentially expressed and sorted receptor isotypes (10Hermey G.

The physiological role(s) of the Vps10p-D receptors is far from clarified, but recent findings indicate that the receptors serve important and diverse functions inside as well as outside of the nervous system. Thus, Sortilin may be part of the machinery that governs cell survival in developing neuronal tissue and a key determinant in the induction of post-traumatic neuronal apoptosis (11Nykjær A. Lee R.

Information at the molecular and cellular level confirms that the receptors are multifunctional, bind several different ligands, and they engage in intracellular sorting as well as in endocytosis and signal transduction. Sortilin, for instance, mediates rapid endocytosis of lipoprotein lipase (15Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol.

The existence of differentially expressed SorCS1 isoforms and the fact that both Sortilin and SorLA bind, and to some extent share, a variety of ligands, including receptor-associated protein (RAP), neurotensin, lipoprotein lipase, apolipoproteins, and elements of the plasminogen activator system, adds to the picture of considerable functional diversity (1Petersen C.M.

Although the composite family receptors may have more than one ligand-binding domain, SorLA, for instance, has at least two (7Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22788-22796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Vps10p-D is the only luminal domain in Sortilin and is a key element in the function and processing of the Vps10p-D receptors (20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Overall, there is only a modest sequence similarity between the Vps10p-Ds from Sortilin, SorLA, and the three SorCS molecules, but they all share two distinct structural features: (i) an N-terminal propeptide outlined by a consensus sequence for cleavage by proteases of the subtilisin family of proprotein convertases and (ii) a ∼120 amino acid, C-terminal segment (designated 10CC) containing ten conserved cysteines. Previous studies have established that Sortilin is synthesized as a precursor (pro)protein. The inert precursor is converted in the trans-Golgi to the mature ligand-binding receptor by furin-mediated cleavage and subsequent dissociation of a 44-residue propeptide (20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Vps10p-Ds of SorLA, SorCS1, and SorCS3 are similarly processed, and similar to Sortilin, the Vps10p-D of SorLA needs propeptide cleavage to expose its ligand-binding region, which is inaccessible in the unprocessed precursor (7Jacobsen L.

Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, propeptide cleavage conditions both Sortilin and SorLA for ligand binding, and their propeptides bind the mature receptors with high affinity and inhibit binding of all currently known Vps10p-D ligands. These findings imply that the propeptides might be types of “intrinsic” chaperones that assist in protein folding or serve to prevent the newly synthesized Vps10p-D receptors from premature interaction with ligands in the biosynthetic pathway. The 10CC segment is situated at the C terminus of the Vps10 domain. Compared with the rest of Vps10p-D, 10CC is very similar in all the receptors, both in terms of primary structure and with respect to the number (ten) and spacing of the contained cysteines. In a functional context, it is remarkable that many of the ligands that target Vps10p-Ds interact with more than one receptor, e.g. neurotensin, RAP, and apolipoprotein. Moreover, all ligands compete for binding, and the propeptides of Sortilin and SorLA both inhibit binding of any known ligand to either of the two receptors (7Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22788-22796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This implies that the binding sites within the Vps10p-D(s) are closely situated and located in a region with a relatively high degree of structural conservation. The 10CC segment complies with these requirements better than any other part of the Vps10p-D and is therefore a candidate structure for interaction with ligands. The present study was undertaken to map key elements in the functional organization of Sortilin (in particular) and of Vps10p-Ds (in general). We have determined the disulfide bridge pattern of Sortilin and of the SorLA Vps10p-D and have shown that the conserved cysteines form five disulfide bonds within the 10CC module. We present strong evidence that the 10CC module constitutes the major binding region of the Vps10p-D, and using mutational analysis of recombinant peptides, we have mapped the receptor-binding segment in the Sortilin propeptide. Finally, by analysis of soluble minireceptors in transfected cells, we demonstrated that Sortilin, in contrast to SorLA and SorCS3, depends on its propeptide to expedite transport in the biosynthetic pathway. Receptor cDNA Constructs, Protein Expression, and Purification— The human cDNA constructs encoding full-length Sortilin and the soluble luminal domain of Sortilin (s-Sortilin, residues Met-33-Ser723) (20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and the construct encoding the Vps10p-D of SorLA (Vps10p-SorLA, Met-28-Glu731) (7Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22788-22796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have been described elsewhere. Similar constructs for the expression of the luminal part of SorCS3 (s-SorCS3, Met-41-Ser1084) (5Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and of the following receptor proteins were generated (residue numbers refer to the primary structure of corresponding wild-type receptors): (i) minireceptors without propeptide, i.e. s-Sortilinwp (Ser45-Ser723), Vps10p-SorLAwp (Ser54-Glu731), s-SorCS1wp (Ser78-Gly1067), s-SorCS3wp (Ala93-Ser1084); (ii) s-Sortilin in which the wt-propeptide (Gln1-Arg44) was exchanged for the propeptide of SorCS1 (Gly1-Arg77) or of SorCS3 (Gly1-Arg92); (iii) receptors containing disrupted cleavage sites, i.e. s-SorCS3 (89RSGG92) and s-Sortilin (41RWGG44); (iv) a modified Vps10p-SorLA (Glu1-Pro675) containing a deletion in the C-terminal part of the 10CC module; and (v) a soluble s-Sortilin chimeric receptor (Sort/SorLA10CC) in which the Sortilin 10CC module (residues Cys579-Ser723) was exchanged for that of SorLA (Cys597-Glu731) (see Fig. 6A). Following amplification by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides, constructs encoding receptors without signal and propeptide were inserted into the pSecTag2B expression vector comprising a murine Ig κ chain signal peptide (Invitrogen). The expression vector pcDNA4/Myc-HisC (Invitrogen) was used for the remaining SorCS3 constructs, and all other constructs were inserted in pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-) (Invitrogen). Transfected CHO-K1 cells were cultured in serum-free HyQ-CCM5 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) and selected at 500 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Soluble Sortilin minireceptor and Vps10p-SorLA were purified from culture medium by affinity chromatography using immobilized RAP and SorLA-propeptide (7Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S.

Propeptides and Ligands—The wt propeptides of Sortilin (20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), SorLA (7Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7390-7396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were constructed as GST fusion proteins. The SorCS3-propeptide (Gly1-Arg92) as well as the SorLA mutant GST-propeptides (covering Glu1-Leu21, Gly19-Ala38, and Gly36-Arg53) were generated by a similar approach. Truncated Sortilin-propeptides (Gln1-Arg41, Gln1-Pro37, Gln1-Ala32, Gln1-Arg28, Gln1-Gly22, and Gln1-Arg16) were generated from the pGEX4T-1 Sortilin wild-type construct (Gln1-Arg44) using a GEX forward primer and appropriate C-terminal deletion primers, and the resulting PCR fragments were ligated back into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The construct harboring residues Trp17-Pro37 was generated from the Gln1-Pro37 construct using a primer deleting the 16 N-terminal residues. All constructs were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain and affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Separation of given peptides from their GST fusion part was achieved by thrombin-mediated cleavage. The Sortilin propeptide fragment Gly22-Arg28 was produced as a synthetic peptide. Recombinant RAP(His6) was prepared and purified as described by Ellgaard et al. (21Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thøgersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor was from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). The prodomain of human nerve growth factor (residues Glu1-Arg102) was generated from the American Type Culture Collection clone number 521534 (Manassas, VA), ligated into pGEX4T-2, expressed in E. coli BL21, and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. Disulfide Bridge Mapping—l-[35S]Cysteine-labeled s-Sortilin (107 counts/min) was purified from the medium of biolabeled CHO transfectants, mixed with 250 μg of unlabeled s-Sortilin in 100 mm NH4HCO3, and digested with trypsin (6 h) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The digest was separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column using an Amersham Biosciences system consisting of a 2249-gradient pump connected to a 2510 Uvicord S.D. detector (22Sørensen E.S. Højrup P. Petersen T.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The peptides were separated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a stepwise linear gradient of acetonitrile developed over 50 min (0–5 min, 0%; 5–40 min, 0–50%; 40–50 min, 50–95%) at a flow rate of 0.85 ml/min. The column was operated at 40 °C, and the peptides were monitored in the effluent by measuring the absorbance at 226 nm. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to liquid scintillation counting to identify [35S]cysteine-containing dipeptides and subsequently characterized by Edman sequence analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A major fraction eluting at the end of the gradient contained a high proportion of the radioactivity. This fraction was subjected to digestion (6 h, 55 °C) with thermolysin in 100 mm pyridin-acetate (pH 6.5) containing 5 mm CaCl2 using a 1:50 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio and separated as described above. Automated Edman sequence analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with an on-line high pressure liquid chromatograph. Part of the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative sample, left over after on-line injection, was used for identification of the dipeptide-phenylthiohydantoin-cysteine by liquid scintillation. Mass spectra were acquired with Bruker BIFLEX matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 1-m flight tube, a refractor, a 337-nm nitrogen laser, and a 1 GHz digitizer. Thin film matrix surfaces were prepared using the fast evaporation technique (23Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (642) Google Scholar) from α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) dissolved in acetone/water (99:1) to 30 μg/μl. A 0.5-μl volume of the analyte (0.1–10 pmol/μl) was deposited on the matrix surface and allowed to dry onto the crystals. Spectra were obtained by averaging 10–30 spectra. Spectra were calibrated externally using the calibration constants of angiotensin II, adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39, and the bee venom mellitin (all from Sigma). Metabolic Labeling, Affinity Precipitation, and Deglycosylation— CHO transfectants were biolabeled in Nunclon multidishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (Sigma), using 200 μCi of l-[35S]cysteine and l-[35S]methionine/ml of medium (Pro-mix; Amersham Biosciences). The medium was subsequently recovered, and following a wash in balanced salt solution (BSS, 4 °C), the cells were lysed and harvested at 4 °C in 1% Triton X-100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteMini; Roche Applied Science). Alternatively, for chase experiments, the labeled cells were washed and reincubated in unsupplemented full medium for given periods of time prior to recovery of cell lysates and medium. For immunoprecipitation, each cell lysate and its corresponding medium was diluted to 1 ml (lysis buffer and medium at 1:5) and added to 50 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) precoated with receptor-specific antibodies. After 2 h of incubation, the precipitation was completed by pelleting and washing the beads in 1 ml of 0.05% Tween 20 BSS. Deglycosylation (overnight) using glycosidase-F and endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H) (both from Roche Applied Science) was performed as described previously (20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Deglycosylated and untreated precipitates were prepared for SDS-PAGE by boiling the beads for 3 min in 100 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% SDS sample buffer. Binding of ligands to soluble receptors of biolabeled CHO cultures was assessed by pull-down experiments. Medium and cell lysates were diluted as described above and preincubated with uncoupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) or glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) prior to incubation with RAP-Sepharose or GST fusion peptide (prodomain of NGF) bound to glutathione-Sepharose, respectively. After 4 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted, and unbound receptors were recovered from the supernatants by immunoprecipitation (described above). The beads were washed in 0.05% Tween 20 BSS and resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using diphenyloxazole-fluorographed gels exposed at -70 °C. Quantitation of 35S-labeled protein bands was performed by phosphorimaging (FLA-3000/LAS 1000, Fuji imager system). Biosensor Measurements—All measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument using CM5 sensor chips maintained at 20 °C. The sensor surface was under a continuous flow (5 μl/min) of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.0 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20. The carboxylated dextran matrix of flow cells 1–4 was activated by injection of 0.2 mN-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 mN-hydroxy-succimide in water (240 μl). A 10 mm sodium acetate solution (pH 4.0) of 10–30 μg/ml purified receptor (s-Sortilin, Vps10p-SorLA, s-SorCS3, or similar constructs) was then injected over flow cells 2–4 at 5 μl/min, and the remaining binding sites in all four flow cells were subsequently blocked by injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The amount of immobilized protein, as determined by the relative response, varied between 60 and 80 fmol/mm2. Binding of ligands was determined by injecting 40-μl aliquots (0.01–5 μm ligand, 5 μl/min) through all flow cells. Unless otherwise stated, the samples were dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, which was also used as running buffer. The surface plasmon resonance signal is expressed in relative response units; i.e. the difference in response between the immobilized protein flow cell and the corresponding control flow cell (i.e. flow cell 1, activated and blocked but without protein). Regeneration of the sensor chip after each cycle of analysis was performed with 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 4.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20. The BIAevaluation 3.1 software was used to determine kinetic parameters. Immunocytochemistry and Cross-linking—CHO transfectants expressing s-Sortilin minireceptors were incubated in medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml BFA. After 1 h, the cells were washed and then either fixed immediately in 4% formaldehyde buffer (pH 7.0) or reincubated for an additional h in medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, but not BFA, prior to fixation. The fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer, washed in BSS, and subsequently incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in BSS. Sortilin was labeled using protein A-purified rabbit anti-Sortilin Ig (20Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as primary and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig as secondary antibodies. Mouse anti-GS28 (Stressgen Biotechnologies) was used as a cis-Golgi marker and was stained by Cy™5-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a laser scanning confocal unit (LSM510; Carl Zeiss) attached to an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 63× 1.2 NA plan C-Apochromat objective. CHO cells expressing s-Sortilin with or without its propeptide were biolabeled for 2 h in the presence of BFA as described above. For cross-linking of minireceptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with or without 0.1 or 1.0% digitonin (Sigma) and then finally incubated (60 min, 4 °C) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm of the chemical cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce). Alternatively, for cross-linking of labeled receptors localizing in downstream (Golgi) compartments, the cells were resuspended in fresh medium (without BFA) for 1.5 h at 37 °C prior to wash and incubation with the cross-linker at room temperature. Mapping of Binding Segments in the Sortilin Propeptide— The propeptide of Sortilin (Gln1-Arg44) binds to the mature receptor with high affinity (Kd ∼5 nm) and inhibits binding of all known ligands, and early in the synthetic pathway, the propeptide moiety is thought to interact with segments of the Vps10p-D to prevent premature ligand bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2110559333,"Cytoprotection during the heat shock response is a complex phenomenon involving multiple inducible mechanisms. We have examined the interaction of two key molecular components in the response, heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK). Whereas both HSF1 and ERK are required to protect cells against apoptosis, ERK activation is paradoxically antagonistic to trans-activation of hsp promoters by HSF1 and HSP accumulation during heat shock. We have found that the two pathways interact directly and that heat shock causes the physical association of ERK1 with HSF1, an interaction that promotes the kinase activity of ERK in heat-shocked cells. ERK activation results in the recruitment of the phosphoserine binding protein 14-3-3ϵ in a manner dependent on previous HSF1 phosphorylation by ERK. The effects of 14-3-3ϵ binding on HSF1 were complex, however, depending on extracellular conditions, in that HSF1-14-3-3 binding at 37 °C led to the cytoplasmic sequestration and repression of HSF1, whereas heat shock overrode these effects and caused quantitative nuclear localization of HSF1. Although the effects of 14-3-3ϵ binding to HSF1 were overridden acutely by stress, during recovery from heat shock, 14-3-3ϵ association again led to enhanced cytoplasmic localization of HSF1, implicating a role for ERK/14-3-3ϵ in HSF1 deactivation in recovering cells. Association of HSF1 with ERK and 14-3-3ϵ during heat shock may thus modulate the amplitude of the response and lead to efficient termination of HSP expression on resumption of growth conditions.

The heat shock response is induced by stress and protects cells from a range of extracellular stresses (1Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Disruption of hsf1 (hsf1-/-) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to a profound loss of thermotolerance and markedly increased susceptibility to heat-induced apoptosis (10McMillan D.R. Xiao X.

Nature. 2000; 407: 693-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, cellular HSF1 exists in a transcriptionally repressed state (12Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Such HSF1 is monomeric, constitutively phosphorylated, and unable to bind the cis-acting heat shock elements located in the promoters of hsp genes (14Voellmy R. Crit. Rev.

Induction of transcriptional activity by heat shock then results in the conversion of HSF1 from inactive monomer to a DNA-binding trimer (12Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Westwood T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Activation of HSF1 by stress is a multistep process involving trimerization, acquisition of heat shock element-binding activity, novel phosphorylation, and trans-activation of hsp genes (14Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 18Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 269: 1409-1410Crossref Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Trimerization of HSF1 is governed by leucine zipper domains in the N terminus and is subject to intramolecular negative regulation by a fourth leucine zipper domain in the C terminus (12Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone HSP90 functions as the principal repressor of HSF1 in unstressed cells and plays a major role in retaining HSF1 in an inactive state; HSF1 trimerization is accompanied by the sequestration of HSP90 in protein aggregates and escape from HSP90-containing HSF1 complexes in response to stress (13Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar).The ERK pathway is regulated downstream of a number of transmembrane receptors and couples extracellular signals to intracellular events controlling the activity of transcription factors that mediate cell proliferation (19Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 81-113Google Scholar, 20Kyriakis J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 29-48PubMed Google Scholar, 21Raman M. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R886-R888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ERK itself is a component of a three-kinase cascade at the membrane consisting of the sequential activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (Raf-1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK2) and finally ERK/MAPK itself (19Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 81-113Google Scholar, 20Kyriakis J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 29-48PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by MEK2 is an essential step in ERK activation (20Kyriakis J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 29-48PubMed Google Scholar). Raf-1 is activated at the membrane by association with Ras proteins (22Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Ras is in turn coupled to transmembrane receptor occupancy through receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of phosphotyrosine-binding adaptor proteins that activate Ras and permit it to associate with Raf-1 at the membrane (23Tsuchiya S. Ogura K. Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Terasawa H. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Aimoto S. Ohta H. Inagaki F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As mentioned below, ERK activation downstream of growth factor binding represses HSF1 (24Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HSF1 seems to exert a reciprocal influence on cell proliferation in that HSP70, a major product of HSF1 transcriptional activity, inhibits the ERK pathway through effects on at least one step in the pathway, the Raf-1 step in ERK signaling (25Song J. Takeda M. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).HSF1 is also subject to additional layers of regulation, including up-regulation through binding the apoptosis modulator DAXX and modulation by ERK (26Boellmann F.

The regulatory domain of HSF1 functions as a molecular switch coupling hsp gene transcription to cellular conditions, repressing C-terminal trans-activation domains under growth conditions, and causing powerful stimulation of the same activation domains under stress conditions (30Knauf U.

ERK1 and GSK3 phosphorylate HSF1 on serine residues within a proline-rich region (RVKEEPPS303PPQS307PRV) of the regulatory domain (6Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol.

Recent studies show that phosphorylation on serine and threonine is converted into an intracellular signal by association with regulatory proteins that recognize serine/threonine phosphorylated domains (35Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The first such proteins to be identified were those of the 14-3-3 family, which bind to a wide array of cellular proteins (36Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 37Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). At least seven 14-3-3 genes exist in vertebrates, and these give rise to nine protein isoforms (α, β, δ, ϵ, γ, η, σ, τ, ζ) (38Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Patel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5706-5709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are predominantly dimeric within the cell and bind either to multiple sites within single proteins such as c-Raf1 or act as a bridge, with one 14-3-3 dimer binding to two different proteins (39Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 dimers may thus act as molecular scaffold proteins, bringing together proteins that interact functionally and effecting phosphorylation-dependent cell regulation (39Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). We have shown that HSF1 binds to 14-3-3 after exposure of Go cells to mitogens (24Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ERK activation by mitogenic stimulation and consequent phosphorylation of serines 303 and 307 led to direct HSF1 association with 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3ζ. 14-3-3 binding inhibits both the transcriptional activity and nuclear accumulation of HSF1 in HeLa cells at 37 °C (24Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that 14-3-3ϵ mediates interaction between phospho-Ser-307, Ser-303-HSF1, and CRM1 and thus contributes to cytoplasmic sequestration and transcriptional repression after ERK activation.In this study, we have examined the impact of heat shock on this form of cell regulation. We find that the association of both ERK and 14-3-3 (ϵ and ζ) with HSF1 is strongly activated by heat shock. Binding of each protein is largely independent of the other and high avidity binding of each protein requires serines 303 and 307 of HSF1. HSF1-ERK association in heat-shocked cells promotes ERK activity and leads to phosphorylation of HSF1 itself on serine 307. This phosphorylation in turn promotes HSF1 association with 14-3-3ϵ. Our data do not support the existence of a ternary complex between HSF1, ERK, and 14-3-3ϵ and instead suggest that the proteins may compete for binding to the region of HSF1 spanning serines 303 and 307. HSF1 association with 14-3-3ϵ in heat-shocked cells seems to be involved in the attenuation of HSF1 activity during recovery and leads to accelerated cytoplasmic localization of HSF1.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs—HSP70B promoter luciferase reporter construct (pGLHSP70B) and other expression plasmids derived from wild-type and mutant HSF1 (pcDNA3.1 HSF1wt; pcDNA3.1 S303A, pcDNA3.1 S307A, pcDNA3.1 S303A/S307A, HSF1wt-GFP), pcDNA3.1 HA-14-3-3ϵ, and pGEX-4T 14-3-3ϵ have been described previously (6Chu B.

NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. HeLa cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in six-well plates were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends in triplicate using FuGENE6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (24Wang X.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). pCMV-lacZ plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. pcDNA3.1 empty vector was used as a blank plasmid to balance the amount of DNA introduced in transient transfection. Cells were harvested after 24 h of transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays were then performed according to the Promega protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Results were expressed as relative luciferase activity of the appropriate control.Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase and S6 Kinase Assays—After experiments, cells (2 × 106) were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed in 1.0 ml of Buffer A (10 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin, and 4 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, pH 7.0) with the use of a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were clarified at 60,000 rpm, and supernatants were aliquoted for subsequent protein and kinase assays before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. For ERK/MAPK assay, 5 μl of sample was added to 25 μl of MAPK Buffer B (60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mm MOPS, 15 mm MgCl, 150 μm [32P]ATP, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) containing either myelin basic protein at 200 μg/ml or consensus MAPK peptide (APRTPGGRR; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 1 mm. Incubations were performed for 20 min at 30 °C. Samples were then collected on P81 filters; filters were allowed to dry and were then washed three times in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphoric acid. Filters were counted by Cerenkov counting. Assays were carried out on triplicate samples. For S6 kinase assay, samples were prepared as above and assayed in Buffer B plus 250 μm protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 μm consensus S6 kinase peptide (RRRLSSLRA; Upstate Biotechnology). Assays were carried out as for ERK.Protein Interaction in Vivo—To facilitate detection of 14-3-3-HSF1 and ERK1-HSF1 complexes formed in vivo, 14-3-3ϵ and ERK1 were expressed in cells as GST fusion proteins through a modified pEF1-BOS vector, and bound proteins were analyzed using GSH-linked-Sepharose pull-down assays as described previously (43Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were transfected with a total of 0.5 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 24 h later, cells were incubated in fresh complete medium or were serum-starved, depending on the experiment. Cells were then lysed in extraction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). For immunoprecipitations under stringent conditions, the extraction buffer was supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 0.5 m NaCl. 14-3-3ϵ-GST fusion proteins were purified using preequilibrated GSH-Sepharose, and incubations were performed for 16 h at 4 °C (43Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After three washes with extraction buffer, GSH-Sepharose-bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli SDS-loading buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 5% glycerol), separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Immunoblot detection was performed with the antibodies dissolved in 5% dried skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline and developed using alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Antibodies for GST (Z-5), 14-3-3 ϵ (SC-1020), 14-3-3 (pan-14-3-3, K-29), and ERK2 (SC-1647) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For detection of HSF1, a mixture of anti-HSF1-specific antibodies, consisting of A68–3 (6Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), SPA-950 (Stressgen), and SC-13516/8061 (Santa Cruz) was used. Anti-active ERK1/2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase polyclonal antibodies were from BIOSOURCE International. For re-blotting, membranes were incubated in 25 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at ambient temperature.In Vitro Translation and GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion protein, 14-3-3ϵ-GST, and control GST protein were purified from bacterial lysates using standard methods. HSF1wt and mutant were produced by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine (>1000 μCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) according to manufacture's protocol using the T7-TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) with pcDNA3.1 HSF1wt and pcDNA3.1 HSF1 303A/307A expression plasmid. GST alone was used as a negative control. 14-3-3ϵ-GST or GST (total protein, 1.5 mg) were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with the appropriate extract buffer containing protease inhibitors. The beads were then incubated with various in vitro-translated 35S-labeled proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. Finally, the beads were washed extensively and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and x-ray film autoradiography.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy and co-localization studies were carried out as described previously (24Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, after transfection of HeLa cells growing on four-chamber tissue culture slides with GFP-HSF1 constructs or HA-14-3-3ϵ, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies, anti-HA, anti-14-3-3ϵ, and antibody binding was detected using Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). In all experiments, cells were then counter-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche) to visualize the nucleus. Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a RT color SPOT digital camera and processed using SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.).RESULTSERK Activity in Heat-shocked Cells—We first examined the kinetics of ERK activation by heat in murine and human cells (Fig. 1). We measured the electrophoretic mobility of ERK1 and ERK2 from 0 to 60 min of heat shock at 43 °C as an indicator of upstream activation of the kinase (Fig. 1A). Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is accompanied by phosphorylation through the upstream kinase MEK2 and results in decreased electrophoretic mobility (20Kyriakis J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 29-48PubMed Google Scholar). There was a rapid (within 10 min) and prolonged electrophoretic mobility shift in ERK1 and ERK2 in NIH-3T3, HeLa, and SCC cells that persisted until 60 min of heating (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5, anti-ERK1/2 immunoblot). The electrophoretic mobility shift in ERK after heat shock was not as profound as the shift induced by exposure of cells to the positive control condition using 100 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 1A, lane 2, anti-ERK1/2 immunoblot). In addition to ERK, we also probed the blots for HSF1, which also underwent a profound shift in electrophoretic mobility detectable after 10 min and increasing to 60 min of heat shock (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5, anti-HSF1 immunoblot). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced a mobility shift in HSF1, most noticeably in NIH 3T3 cells, but less profound than the effect of heat shock (Fig. 1A, lane 2, anti-HSF1 immunoblot), which also underwent a larger electrophoretic mobility shift after heat shock (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5, anti-HSF1 immunoblot). Alterations in ERK electrophoretic mobility were correlated with a large increase in ERK kinase activity in extracts from the heat-shocked cell (Fig. 1B). Using two substrates, ERK activation was observed in each case by 10 min and slightly preceded the onset of a large increase of p90 S6 kinase (RSK2) activity assayed in parallel in the same extracts (Fig. 1B).Heat Shock Causes the Association of HSF1 with ERK1 and Activation of Cellular ERK—Because the kinetics of ERK activation and HSF1 hyperphosphorylation are strongly correlated, we examined potential interaction between these two molecules (Fig. 2). We have examined the binding of HSF1 to an ERK1-GST fusion protein overexpressed in cells, followed by GST pull-down in cell extracts (Fig. 2). Examining the top, we observed minimal ERK-HSF1 association in unstressed cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1), but detected binding immediately after 60 min at 43 °C (Fig. 2A, lane 2) when ERK activity is high (Fig. 1). Binding decays again on recovery at 37 °C for 6 h after heat shock (Fig. 2A, top, lane 3). This pattern is amplified when HSF1 is overexpressed in the cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). We also examined a briefer exposure of the film to luminescent antigen to compare relative HSF1-ERK1 association between cells overexpressing HSF1 (Fig. 2A, second blot). Under these assay conditions, HSF1-ERK1 association in wild-type cells was not seen (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). However, this exposure illustrates the point that binding is highest in heat-shocked cells overexpressing wild-type HSF1 (Fig. 2A, HSF1wt, lane 5). We compared binding to HSF1wt with a mutant form of HSF1 with serines 303 and 307 mutagenized to alanine (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–9); serine 307 is an in vivo substrate for ERK, and the region spanning serines 303 and 307 has been shown to be a binding site for 14-3-3ϵ (24Wang X. Grammatikakis N. Siganou A. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6013-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 303/307 to alanine inhibited HSF1 association with ERK by 60–70% (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–9). We were also able to detect the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 in the complex (Fig. 2A). HSP70 was highest in the cells recovering from heat when intracellular HSP70 levels are expected to be highest. HSP90 levels in the ERK1-HSF1 complex were lowest immediately after heat shock when ERK1-HSF1 association is highest (Fig. 2A). It is not clear from these data whether the HSP90 is directly associated with ERK or indirectly through HSF1. However, HSP90 is a known HSF1-associated protein and dissociates from HSF1 after heat shock (13Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1"
https://openalex.org/W2169068990,"The DNA damage checkpoint kinase, CHK2, promotes growth arrest or apoptosis through phosphorylating targets such as Cdc25A, Cdc25C, BRCA1, and p53. Both germline and somatic loss-of-function CHEK2 mutations occur in human tumours, the former linked to the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and the latter found in diverse types of sporadic malignancies. Here we examined the status of CHK2 by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses in 53 breast carcinomas previously characterized for TP53 status. We identified two CHEK2 mutants, 470T>C (Ile157Thr), and a novel mutation, 1368insA leading to a premature stop codon in exon 13. The truncated protein encoded by CHEK2 carrying the 1368insA was stable yet mislocalized to the cytoplasm in tumour sections and when ectopically expressed in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, we found CHEK2 to be subject to extensive alternative splicing, with some 90 splice variants detected in our tumour series. While all cancers expressed normal-length CHEK2 mRNA together with the spliced transcripts, we demonstrate and/or predict some of these splice variants to lack CHK2 function and/or localize aberrantly. We conclude that cytoplasmic sequestration may represent a novel mechanism to disable CHK2, and propose to further explore the significance of the complex splicing patterns of this tumour suppressor gene in oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1972343603,"We investigated whether protein stability controls antigen presentation using a four disulfide-containing snake toxin and three derivatives carrying one or two mutations (L1A, L1A/H4Y, and H4Y). These mutations were anticipated to increase (H4Y) or decrease (L1A) the antigen non-covalent stabilizing interactions, H4Y being naturally and frequently observed in neurotoxins. The chemically synthesized derivatives shared similar three-dimensional structure, biological activity, and T epitope pattern. However, they displayed differential thermal unfolding capacities, ranging from 65 to 98 °C. Using these differentially stable derivatives, we demonstrated that antigen stability controls antigen proteolysis, antigen processing in antigen-presenting cells, T cell stimulation, and kinetics of expression of T cell determinants. Therefore, non-covalent interactions that control the unfolding capacity of an antigen are key parameters in the efficacy of antigen presentation.

To fit into the MHC grooves, protein Ags must possess adequate sequences that adopt an appropriate extended conformation (1Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L.

Therefore, efficiency of Ag processing depends on a complex interplay between APC processing capacity and the intrinsic characteristics of an Ag, which control the unfolding capacity. In other words, the stability of a protein Ag may be a critical issue for its processing to occur efficiently. Two types of interactions govern the structural stability of a protein. First, covalent interactions are assured by the polypeptide chain and the intramolecular disulfide bridges. Their influence on Ag presentation efficacy was previously suggested from experiments performed with HEL derivatives, which differed in their stability by the deletion of one intramolecular disulfide bond or addition of intramolecular chemical cross-links (22So T. Ito H.O. Koga T. Watanabe S. Ueda T. Imoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32136-32140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31So T. Ito H. Hirata M. Ueda T. Imoto T. Immunology. 2001; 104: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult fully to appreciate the impact of such important modifications on Ag structure. The second type of stabilizing interaction involves non-covalent contacts, which include hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions. It remains to be demonstrated that such non-covalent stabilizing contacts, which contribute to the stabilization of the 3D structure of a protein Ag, control presentation efficacy. In this study, we compared the T cell stimulation capacity of four protein variants that shared similar 3D structure, biological activity, and T epitope pattern but differed in stability. The four proteins include the structurally well defined snake toxin α, a neurotoxin with four disulfide bonds (32Zinn-Justin S. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Bontems F. Menez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11335-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and three chemically synthesized derivatives that differ from toxin α by at most two substitutions introduced in the stabilizing core (L1A, L1A/H4Y, and H4Y). These mutations were anticipated to increase (H4Y) or decrease (L1A) the Ag non-covalent stabilizing interactions, H4Y being naturally and frequently observed in neurotoxins (33Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Inc, New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar). Our data show that the non-covalent interaction-based stability of the Ag controls processing in APCs, T cell stimulation, and kinetics of expression of T cell determinants. Our findings suggest that natural mutations that are silent for the biological activity, structure, or T epitope pattern of a protein can alter its network of stabilizing interactions, which might affect the way it is perceived and treated by the immune system. Some microorganisms may exploit such mutations to escape the immune system. Toxins—The toxin derivatives were synthesized on a 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using procedures described previously (34Mourier G. Servent D. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Analytical standard chemicals were from Sigma. Peptide synthesis chemicals were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. The Fmoc/tert-butyl strategy was followed using a rink amide resin (0.47 mmol/g) and a 20-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acids. Polypeptides were cleaved from the resin, and the side chain-protecting moieties were removed with 5% triisopropylsilane in 90% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Then, the peptides were precipitated with diethyl ether and solubilized in 10% acetic acid. After lyophilization, the crude materials were solubilized in 0.1% TFA and purified by HPLC on C18 reverse phase columns (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The elution was carried out with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% TFA. Then, the four disulfide bonds were made in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing glutathione ([reduced/oxidized] = [4 mm/2 mm]). The folded proteins were subsequently purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Mass determination was performed on a Quattro II electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK). Reduced and carboxamidomethylated (RCM) toxin α and its RCM derivatives were obtained by reducing the disulfide bonds with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; 5 eq) in a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 6 m urea. After 5 min of incubation, the free thiols were blocked with 10 eq of iodoacetamide. The denatured proteins were subsequently purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Biophysical Characterization—CD measurements were performed at 37 °C using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 Dichrograph. Proteins were diluted in 5 mm MES/phosphate buffer pH 7. A 2-mm pathlength quartz cell and 50 μg/ml protein were used for far-UV measurements (190–260 nm), whereas a 10-mm cell and 0.5 mg/ml of protein were used for near-UV CD studies (250–320 nm). A spectral bandwidth of 2 nm and an integration time of 0.5 s were used, and each spectrum was recorded at 37 °C as an average of four scans. Molar ellipticities θ (deg ·cm2·dmol-1) are measured. Acid-induced unfolding was monitored at 37 °C by recording the molar ellipticity of the proteins as a function of pH. The proteins were diluted in 5 mm MES/phosphate buffer and different pH values were produced by addition of NaOH or HCl. Far-UV spectra were recorded at each pH value. The molar ellipticities at 198 nm were extracted to build the secondary structure denaturation curves as a function of pH. Heat-induced unfolding was monitored as a function of temperature by recording the molar ellipticity of the proteins at 198 nm for the main β-sheet secondary structure. The temperature-increasing rate was 1.5 °C/min and the proteins were in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7 and 4.3. Thermal stability measurements were performed by differential scanning calorimetry with an MC-2 calorimeter (MicroCal). The cell volume was 1.22 ml. Samples were dissolved in a 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and dialyzed against the same buffer, used as a reference for measurements. The protein concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml. Temperature scans were performed at rates of 1.5 K/min from 15 °C to 108 °C. The analysis of the unfolding transitions was performed after subtraction of the heat capacity of the solvent. Determination of the melting temperature (m.p.) was as described previously (35Alexander P. Fahnestock S. Lee T. Orban J. Bryan P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3597-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Nicotinic Receptor Affinity Measurements—Competition experiments were performed at equilibrium with AChR from Torpedo marmorata AChR (2 nm) and [3H]α (27 Ci/mmol, 5 nm) and varying amounts of each toxin. After 18 h at 20 °C, the mixture was filtered through Millipore filters (HAWP) that had been soaked in Ringer buffer. The filters were washed with 10 ml of Ringer buffer, dried, and counted on a Rackβ scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences). Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined from competition experiments (36Ishikawa Y. Menez A. Hori H. Yoshida H. Tamiya N. Toxicon. 1977; 15: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of Toxin α and of the Three Toxin Derivatives to the Monoclonal Anti-toxin Antibodies Mα1 and Mα2–3—Microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated overnight with the wild-type toxin (0.1 μg/well) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, and saturated with 0.3% bovine serum albumin. The plates were washed, and a fixed amount of either mAb Mα1 or mAb Mα2–3 was added in the presence of various dilutions of each protein. Ag proteins and mAbs were diluted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the wells were washed, and a goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Immunotech, Marseille, France) was added for 30 min. The plates were washed, and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid was added. Coloration was developed for 30 min, and the absorbance was measured at 414 nm. The concentrations of mAb Mα1 and Mα2–3 used in these experiments were those giving an absorbance value of 0.6 in the absence of competitor. T Cell-stimulating Assays—Serial dilutions of the different Ags were incubated in microculture wells (Nalge Nunc International) with either 5 × 104 living A20 cells or 2 × 105 fixed A20 cells in the presence of 5 × 104 T1C9 or T1B2 hybridoma cells (37Maillère B. Cotton J. Mourier G. Léonetti M. Leroy S. Ménez A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5270-5280PubMed Google Scholar). For T1C9, presentation is restricted to the MHC molecule of the I-Ed haplotype and recognizes the region 24–36 of toxin α, whereas for T1B2, presentation is restricted to the MHC molecule of the I-Ad haplotype and recognizes the thiol-dependent epitope 32–49 of toxin α. Cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. The presence of IL-2 in the culture supernatants was evaluated by determining the proliferation of an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T cell line using [methyl-3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol). The data are expressed in counts per minute. Fixation of APCs was performed by incubating 2 × 107 A20 cells with 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 1 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of a 0.2 m glycine solution and extensive washings. Kinetics of Ag Presentation and Effect of Inhibitors on Ag Presentation—Kinetic experiments were performed in 96-well microfilter plates (MADV N65; Millipore). A20 cells (2 × 105/well) were cultured at 37 °C with a fixed amount of the different Ags (5 μm for presentation to T1B2, 10 μm for presentation to T1C9). At different times, A20 cells were washed by extensive filtering and treated with 0.05% glutaraldehyde (50 μl/well) for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2 m glycine (100 μl/well for 2 min), and the reagents were removed by filtering before the addition of either T1B2 or T1C9 (5 × 104/well). After 24 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were recovered and assayed for IL-2 content as described above. The effect of inhibitors on Ag presentation was assessed in U-bottom microculture wells (Nalge Nunc International). A20 cells (105/well) were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of serial dilutions of either αL1A or αH4Y and of fixed amounts of leupeptin (10 μm), pepstatin (0.1 μm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 μm). After 16 h, cells were washed, and 5 × 104 T1C9 were added per well. After 24 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were recovered and assayed for IL-2 content as described above. Stability to Reduction and to Proteolysis by Cathepsin L—Reduction was carried out by incubating each protein (0.5 μg/μl) with various concentrations of TCEP for 24 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. The samples were diluted to 1/10 in 0.1% TFA and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. The disappearance of the oxidized form of the toxins was followed as a function of TCEP concentrations. Susceptibility of the proteins to proteolysis was assessed using lysosomal cathepsin L (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The Ags (0.5 μg/μl) were incubated with 1.5 munits of enzyme in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for 4 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped using 0.1% TFA, and proteolysis was monitored by reversed-phase HPLC. In Vivo Processing of Two Derivatives—αL1A and αH4Y were tritiated by replacing a hydrogen atom of an aromatic residue with a tritium, through the catalytic dehalogenation of an iodinated precursor (38Menez A. Morgat J. Fromageot P. Ronseray A. Boquet P. Changeux J. FEBS Lett. 1971; 17: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 2 × 107 cpm of each tritiated derivative (specific activity, 14.5 Ci/mmol) were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 107 A20 cells in 2 ml of culture medium. The cells were spun down and washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin before lysis in cold non-denaturing lysis buffer containing 1% TX-100 for 30 min on ice (39Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelic E.C. Springer T.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W.A. Current Protocols in Immunology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and supernatants were incubated for 2 h with a toxin-specific polyclonal Ab complexed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pfizer, Täby, Sweden). Immunoprecipitates were collected, boiled in reducing Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by 10–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. 1000 cpm and 2000 cpm of unprocessed native [3H]αL1A and [3H]αH4Y were also included in the gels as a control. The gels were then blotted onto a PVDF membrane before quantitive auto-radiographic scanning for 300 min on a β-Imager (Biospace, France). The Selected Protein Ag Has a High Thermodynamic Stability—Various structurally unrelated proteins have been extensively studied regarding class II MHC processing and presentation. These include hen egg lysozyme, ovalbumin, ribonuclease A, and cytochrome c. To establish a framework of comparison for our selected Ag model, a snake neurotoxin named toxin α (α), we monitored the CD ellipticity at a wavelength that is the most characteristic of the secondary structure of all these proteins as a function of temperature, at pH 7 (not shown). We found that ribonuclease A unfolds at a relatively low temperature (m.p., 57 °C), whereas hen egg lysozyme, ovalbumin, cytochrome c and toxin α unfold with higher m.p. of 72 °C, 73 °C, 72 °C and ≥85 °C, respectively. These proteins possess unrelated structures, distinct T cell epitopes, and differential presentation mechanisms, making it difficult to identify a possible correlation (if any) between their different stabilities and presentation efficacies. To minimize the number of parameters to be considered in a comparative study, we prepared Ags of different stability but similar 3D structures and identical T-cell epitopes. Design and Synthesis of Three Derivatives of Toxin α—Previous reports have shown that protein stability can be enhanced or decreased as a result of a small number of mutations (40Akasako A. Haruki M. Oobatake M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18686-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Fagain C.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 42Matsumura M. Yasumura S. Aiba S. Nature. 1986; 323: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Stearman R.S. Frankel A.D. Freire E. Liu B.S. Pabo C.O. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7571-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have attempted to modulate the conformational stability of toxin α by introducing at most two substitutions in its amino acid sequence. The overall folding of this 61-residue protein consists of three major loops rich in β-pleated sheet that are locked by three disulfide bridges and one short C-terminal loop locked by a fourth disulfide bridge (Fig. 1A). The three major loops protrude from a small globular core, which contains the disulfides. In this core region, we identified four buried residues that are involved in numerous interactions and therefore may play a key role in the stability of the tertiary structure of the toxin. These are tyrosine 24, asparagine 60, histidine 4, and leucine 1. The first two residues are highly conserved in various three-fingered toxins (33Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Inc, New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar), a situation that may reflect their critical involvement in the maintenance of the tertiary structure of the three-fingered fold. We therefore avoided substituting them. The two other residues are more variable and distant from the region 24–49, which has been previously shown to contain the T-cell epitopes of toxin α in the H-2d haplotype (37Maillère B. Cotton J. Mourier G. Léonetti M. Leroy S. Ménez A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5270-5280PubMed Google Scholar, 44Léonetti M. Pillet L. Maillère B. Lamthanh H. Frachon P. Couderc J. Ménez A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4214-4221PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to preserve the integrity of the toxin structure and to avoid modifying its T-cell epitopes, we substituted only the residues at positions 1 and 4. The side chain of Leu1 was “shaved” and replaced by a methyl group (Ala), a strategy anticipated to suppress most of the interactions in which the leucine was involved (Fig. 1B). No such mutation has been observed in other neurotoxins (33Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Inc, New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar). Histidine at position 4 was mutated into tyrosine for three reasons. First, such a substitution has sometimes been observed to increase protein stability (45Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Nakamura H. Ikehara M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 28: 117-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, a tyrosine residue at position 4 is naturally observed in nine other neurotoxins (33Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Inc, New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar). Third, in agreement with this latter general observation, examination of toxin α 3D structure suggested that substitution H4Y might increase local hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 1B) and toxin stability. Finally, the two substitutions L1A and H4Y were combined in a third derivative. The three toxin derivatives were synthesized by chemical means, refolded and purified by HPLC. Purity and homogeneity were then assessed by mass spectrometry and non-reducing SDS-PAGE (see supplemental figure). Toxin α and Its Three Derivatives Share Similar Structural and Biological Properties—The CD spectra of the three derivatives superimposed well with that of the wild-type toxin (Fig. 2A). In the far-UV, we observed the same large positive band at 198 nm and the same negative signal at 215 nm, suggesting that the predominant β-sheet secondary structure present in the native toxin has not been altered by the substitutions. The near-UV CD profiles of the wild-type toxin α and of its three derivatives also compared well, suggesting a preservation of the 3D structure (data not shown). A slight difference was observed around 280 nm in the two mutants possessing the mutation H4Y. This variation reflects the dichroic contribution of the additional aromatic residue. Indirect information on the structure of the derivatives was derived from their ability to bind to three conformation-sensitive macromolecular targets: two toxin α-specific mAbs, Mα2–3 (46Trémeau O. Boulain J.C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Mα1 (47Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Couderc J. Faure G. Liacopoulos P. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the physiological target of the neurotoxins, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) (36Ishikawa Y. Menez A. Hori H. Yoshida H. Tamiya N. Toxicon. 1977; 15: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The toxin binds to the AcChR and Mα2–3 through highly overlapping regions, which involve residues of the three loops. Mα1 binds to an opposite region of the toxin, its epitope involving residues from the N-terminal region and the large turn between loops I and II. It has been established that the N-terminal residue is critically involved in the Mα1 epitope, ruling out the possibility of using this Ab to probe the epitope structure once substitutions have been introduced at position 1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the binding of tritiated toxin α to AcChR was inhibited by similar amounts of the four proteins. In addition, the four toxins competed with similar efficiency for binding to the mAb Mα2–3 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the regions by which the toxin binds to the receptor and Mα2–3 were unaffected by the presence of any of the substitutions. The toxin and the derivative α H4Y were also equipotent in binding to Mα1 (Fig. 2D), indicating that this substitution had no structural effect on the Mα1 epitope, despite the close topographical proximity of position 4 (48Zinn-Justin S. Roumestand C. Drevet P. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6884-6891Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As a whole, the three derivatives possess structural and biological properties that are highly similar to those of the parent protein. Native and Substituted Toxins Have Different Thermal Stabilities at Neutral and Acidic pHs—The conformational stability of toxin α and its three derivatives was first examined at neutral pH, by monitoring changes in CD spectra, as a function of a linear temperature gradient. Fig. 3A shows that the derivative αL1A unfolds at a temperature ∼15 °C lower than that at which toxin α unfolds. This result indicates that the substitution of Leu1 has impaired the conformational stability of the molecule. In contrast, the CD-derived m.p. values that characterize toxin α and the two derivatives αL1A,H4Y and αH4Y were so close to each other that they could not be determined accurately enough. Instead, they could be measured using differential scanning calorimetry. The thermograms showed clear differences between the four toxins (Fig. 3C). Asymmetry of the curves as well as the observation of an irreversible aggregation prevented an accurate calculation of the ΔH values. The qualitative thermal stability order was: αL1A (75.3 °C) < αL1A,H4Y (88.4 °C) < α (92 °C) < αH4Y (98.6 °C). Thus, the substitution of histidine 4 by a tyrosine increased the stability of toxin α so much that when introduced concomitantly with the L1A substitution, it compensated the decrease in stability that was caused by this single substitution. We also investigated the conformational stability of the four proteins at pH 4.3 (Fig. 3B), which is approximately that within lysosomes (49Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this pH, the thermal stability followed th"

Res. 2004; 161: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Human Class I HDACs are generally nuclear proteins homologous to the yeast protein Rpd3 (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8). Class II HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, and -9) are related to HDA1 and often demonstrate regulated nucleocytoplasmic flux. Class III HDACs are structurally and phylogenetically distinct, being most similar to the NAD+-dependent yeast SIR2 proteins. HDAC7 is a nuclear encoded Class II HDAC having a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and a large, highly divergent N-terminal domain implicated in muscle differentiation (10Dressel U. Bailey P.J. Wang S.C. Downes M. Evans R.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17007-17013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic sequestration of HDAC7 can be enhanced by 14-3-3 protein interactions (11Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and observed during T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis (8Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163-169): 115-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were first characterized as intracellular organelles responsible for energy production through the coupling of oxidative phosphorylation to respiration. More recently, mitochondria have been implicated in genetically programmed cell death (12Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) whereby release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial inner membrane space factors (13Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) facilitates the progression of the apoptotic cascade. Dysregulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic program has been linked to both enhanced cell death (14Jordan J. Cena V. Prehn J.H. J. Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 59: 129-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as hyperproliferative growth (15Hu W. Kavanagh J.J. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Here we describe the novel discovery that the nuclear encoded Class II human histone deacetylase HDAC7 localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane space (IMS) of several human cell lines, in particular, prostate cancer epithelial cells. Upon induction of the apoptotic cascade, HDAC7 is released from mitochondria and, along with nuclear HDAC7, is redistributed to the cytoplasm. These results highlight a previously unrecognized link between mitochondria, histone deacetylases, and the initiation of apoptosis. Antibodies and Reagents—Mitochondrial lysate (M22430), ProLong® antifade reagent (P7481), and anti-oxidative complex V (3D5) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Antibodies to HDAC7 (H-273), Tom20 (F-10), AIF (E-1), cytochrome c (6H2), and Smac/DIABLO (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GFP-Bax was a kind gift from Dr. Tomas Vomastek, University of Virginia. HDAC7-FLAG was a kind gift from Dr. Eric Verdin, UCSF. C4-2 cells were originally obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Leyland Chung, University of Texas Southwestern. Other cell lines were obtained from laboratory frozen stocks and maintained as follows: MRC5CV1 (15% FBS in RPMI, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids), AT5BIVA (20% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 0.1% hydrocortisone), PC-3 (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS), and SQ20B (20% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 0.1% hydrocortisone). Site-directed Mutagenesis—HDAC7-R8P site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using Stratagene QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol using the following PAGE-purified primers: forward primer, 5′-GGTGGGCCAGCCGCCCCCAGTGG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CCACTGGGGGCGGCTGGCCCACC-3′. PCR cycling parameters were as follows: denaturing at 95° C for 50 s, annealing at 60° C for 50 s, and extension for 9 min at 68° C. Confocal and Non-confocal Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was carried out using an Olympus BX61 laser scanning confocal microscope using ×60 oil immersion objective with standard lasers and filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red analysis. 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) staining was used for non-confocal identification of nucleic acid content. Subsequent confocal image acquisition and analysis were carried out using the Fluoview™ software package. Routine non-confocal indirect immunofluorescence was performed on a Nikon E600 microscope according to standard protocols using fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunologicals) and appropriate optical filter sets. Non-confocal image acquisition and analysis was performed using MetaVue™ (version 5.0.3) imaging analysis software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Computer Amino Acid Analysis—TopPredII and Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plotting and mitochondrial targeting peptide prediction were performed online. 2R. Bakin and M. Jung, personal communication. Cell Transfections—Routine Lipofectin (Invitrogen) transfection of GFP-Bax was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. GFP-HDAC7 stable C4-2 cells were selected for G418 and pooled as mass populations. Western Blotting—Protein samples were run on 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE Tricine minigels (Invitrogen), blotted to nitrocellulose, and blocked in 5% blocking buffer (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature, washed in 0.1% SDS, Tween. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature and washed in 0.1% SDS, Tween. Blots were developed in ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film (Amersham Biosciences). Mitochondria Isolation, Permeabilization, and Subfractionation— Mitochondria were isolated from 80% confluent C4-2 cell monolayers using a Pierce mitochondrial isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (16Schulz I. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 280-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), cells were plated on glass coverslips for 3 days and then treated with either 0.01 or 0.5% saponin in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Routine indirect immunofluorescence was subsequently carried out using the appropriate primary and secondary fluorescent antibodies. Mitochondrial subfractionation was carried out on freshly isolated mitochondria. Isolated mitochondria were immediately subfractionated according to protocols established by Greenawalt (17Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified mitochondria were resuspended in isolation medium (70 mm sucrose, 220 mm d-mannitol, 2 mm HEPES, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH) at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. An equal volume of stock 1.2% digitonin medium was then added and stirred gently on ice for 15 min. Three more volumes of isolation medium were then added and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The sediment consisted of the crude mitoplast (i.e. inner membrane and matrix components) fraction. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 144,000 × g for 60 min. Pelleted material contained mitochondrial outer membranes, whereas the remaining fluid consisted largely of soluble inner membrane proteins. Imaging of Live Cells—All live imaging was carried out using a Nikon TE300 live imaging system with ×60 oil immersion objective using MetaMorph 6.1 software (Universal Imaging Corporation). Mito-Tracker Red® was added to culture medium for 30 min according to the manufacturer's protocols. Mitochondrial Localization of Mammalian HDAC7—Nuclear encoded proteins destined for mitochondria contain cleavable N-terminal signaling peptides of degenerate amino acid length and composition that are necessarily removed after mitochondrial import (18Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). N-terminal primary amino acid analysis of human HDAC7 identified a novel mitochondrial targeting presequence (20Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar) in both mammalian isoforms of HDAC7 that was not present in any other known human HDAC (Fig. 1A). This presequence was moderately conserved in both rat and mouse, albeit with divergent N-terminal amino acid additions of unknown biological significance. Mitochondrial targeting presequences often exhibit a conserved amphipathic α-helix containing clustered positively charged hydrophobic and hydroxylated amino acid residues (21Schwer B. North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). HDAC7 secondary structure analysis of the N terminus revealed a clustering of basic amino acids commonly observed in amphipathic α-helical structures, including the NAD+-dependent and mitochondrial localized human Class III deacetylase SIRT3 (Fig. 1B). Confocal laser microscopy of untreated human prostate epithelial C4-2 cells revealed robust and distinct colocalization of endogenous HDAC7 with the mitochondria-specific proteins Hsp60, Tom20, and AIF (Fig. 2A). Similar mitochondria-specific localization of HDAC7 was observed in other human cell lines including AT5BIVA and MR5CV1 fibroblasts as well as PC-3 epithelial cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that mitochondrial HDAC7 localization may be a general biological phenomenon of human cells. Live imaging of stable expression of N-terminal GFP-tagged HDAC7 (GFP-HDAC7) similarly exhibited colocalization with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker Red (Fig. 2C). HDAC7 Is N-terminally Processed in Mitochondria—By an incompletely understood mechanism, three peptidases mediate a physiologically necessary endoproteolytic cleavage of both nuclear and mitochondria-encoded precursor polypeptides destined for mitochondrial residence (22Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 23Ito A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Failure to remove such targeting presequences has been implicated in human disease including the pathophysiology of Friedreich ataxia (24Patel P.I. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Branda S.S. Cavadini P. Adamec J. Kalousek F. Taroni F. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22763-22769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial processing peptidase initially cleaves the vast majority of N-terminal mitochondrial targeting presequences. Based on additional uncharacterized protein targeting motifs downstream of the mitochondria-processing peptidase site, inner membrane peptidase and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase subsequently process specific subsets of precursor polypeptides destined for various mitochondrial subcompartments. Amino acid sequencing predicts an approximate molecular mass of around 100 and 96 kDa for HDAC7a and HDAC7b, respectively. Analysis of HDAC7 protein expression in C4-2 cells consistently failed to identify an HDAC7 species of this size. Suggesting that the majority of HDAC7 in C4-2 cells is proteolytically processed in mitochondria, we routinely observe a truncated form of HDAC7 (∼80 kDa) in both C4-2 mitochondrial preparations as well as commercially available heart mitochondrial protein lysates (Fig. 3A). Current mitochondrial presequence processing site motifs are ill defined, thus precluding site-directed mutagenesis analysis. As mitochondrial import of HDAC7 is a prerequisite for N-terminal proteolytic processing of HDAC7, we reasoned that mutation of structurally important basic amino acid residues in the N-terminal presequence α-helix would attenuate mitochondrial import and thus prevent processing of full-length HDAC7. Transient overexpression of C-terminal FLAG-tagged HDAC7 containing the R8P mutation (HDAC7-R8P) in parental C4-2 cells resulted in expression of only unprocessed, full-length HDAC7 (Fig. 3B). As a control, we similarly transfected the HDAC7-R8P mutant into C4-2 cells stably expressing wild type HDAC7-FLAG. Here, both the unprocessed form of HDAC7-R8P (Fig. 3B, upper band) as well as the mitochondrially processed form (Fig. 3B, lower band) of wild type HDAC7 were observed. In sum, we demonstrate that HDAC7 mitochondrial import is dependent upon a structurally intact targeting presequence and that localization of HDAC7 to mitochondria results in proteolytic removal of the targeting presequence. HDAC7 Is a Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Space Protein— Undefined cryptic secondary targeting peptides within the mitochondrial targeting presequence dictate which subcompartment will eventually receive a protein. Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plotting and TopPred II software analysis (26Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) both identify HDAC7 as a relatively hydrophilic protein with no significant regions of hydrophobicity commonly associated with membrane proteins (data not shown). Mitochondrial subfractionation of untreated C4-2 mitochondria reveals that HDAC7 colocalizes with known soluble mitochondrial IMS proteins AIF and Smac/DIABLO (Fig. 4A). Tom20 and the oxidative phosphorylation complex V served as controls for the outer membrane and inner membrane/matrix (e.g. mitoplasts) compartments of mitochondria, respectively. If HDAC7 is a soluble mitochondrial IMS protein, permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane should result in release of HDAC7. Mitochondrial outer membranes were selectively permeabilized with either the mild detergent saponin (16Schulz I. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 280-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or transient overexpression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (27Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Bax recruitment to mitochondria has been shown to trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization resulting in the release of pro-apoptotic IMS proteins. Saponin membrane permeabilization resulted in a substantial loss of canonical mitochondrial HDAC7 staining and default relocalization of HDAC7 to punctate nuclear bodies that intensified with increased detergent concentration (Fig. 4B). Finally, GFP-Bax overexpression promoted mitochondrial release of AIF, cytochrome c, and HDAC7 in addition to nuclear DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4C). In sum, we demonstrate that HDAC7 is a soluble mitochondrial IMS protein the retention of which is dependent upon an intact mitochondrial outer membrane. Moreover, HDAC7 mitochondrial release closely parallels the translocation dynamics of several recognized IMS proteins implicated in programmed cell death. Cytoplasmic Sequestration of HDAC7 under Pro-apoptotic Conditions—Seminal studies of HDAC7 have demonstrated regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling resulting in the differentiation of myocytes (11Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic relocalization of HDAC7 has additionally been implicated in thymocyte cell death (8Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163-169): 115-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these reports and our demonstration that HDAC7 can localize to multiple subcellular compartments, including the mitochondrial IMS, we further characterized the translocation dynamics of HDAC7 under pro-apoptotic conditions. Although still competent for apoptosis as evidenced by GFP-Bax transient overexpression, a variety of known apoptosis agents including Fas-L, LY294002, forskolin, serum starvation, ionizing radiation, and cisplatin failed to readily induce mass apoptosis in these cells as measured by PARP and Bid cleavage as well as H2A.X phosphorylation (data not shown). We demonstrate that a reliable initiator of the apoptotic cascade in C4-2 cells was the aminoglycoside and protein translation inhibitor hygromycin. 48-hour treatment with 100 μg/ml hygromycin readily and reproducibly induced both PARP and Bid cleavage as well as phosphorylation of H2A.X (Fig. 5a). We next treated C4-2 cells with 100 μg/ml hygromycin for 48 h and fractionated cells into cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and nuclear components. Results demonstrate a near complete redistribution of HDAC7 from mitochondrial to cytoplasmic pools (Fig. 5b). Finally, we demonstrate via live cell imaging of hygromycin-treated C4-2 cells stably expressing GFP-HDAC7 a near complete redistribution of GFP-HDAC7 in the cytoplasm after 9 h (Fig. 6). This was most dramatic in the low percentage of cells where GFP-HDAC7 initially was localized to the nucleus. Cytoplasmic HDAC7 sequestration remained unchanged for the remainder of the 48-h experiment (data not shown). Here we report the localization of a Class II HDAC to the mitochondrial IMS of normally growing human prostate epithelial cells. Similar to other nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins, we demonstrate that mitochondrial import of HDAC7 results in N-terminal truncation and residence in the inner membrane space. Similar to other pro-apoptotic mitochondrial IMS proteins, HDAC7 is released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm upon onset of programmed cell death where it is sequestered exclusively in the cytoplasm. Here we describe the novel finding of a human Class II HDAC localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane space of human prostate cancer cells. As we observe similar localization of HDAC7 in other human cell lines including AT5BIVA and MR5CV1 fibroblasts as well as PC-3 and LNCaP (data not shown) prostate cancer cells, we propose that such a phenomenon is likely not the exception to the rule. Similar to other mitochondrial nuclear encoded proteins, HDAC7 contains a targeting presequence that is necessarily proteolyzed by mitochondrial enzymes by an incompletely understood mechanism. Suggestively, HDAC7 is sequestered in a mitochondrial compartment shown previously to contain several pro-apoptotic proteins and displays translocation dynamics in response to apoptotic stimuli similar to those of other reported pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. As apoptosis is an evolutionarily well conserved mechanism, it would not be surprising to find HDAC7 in the mitochondria of other human cell types. A recent report implicates HDAC7 in thymocyte apoptosis (5Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here, HDAC7 nuclear export during T cell receptor activation derepresses expression of the orphan receptor Nur77 leading to apoptosis. Highlighting a potential pro-apoptotic role of cytoplasmic (or at least non-nuclear) HDAC7, it was further demonstrated that a triple HDAC7 mutant unable to exit the nucleus (and thus unable to enter the cytoplasm) suppressed T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis (5Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). HDAC7 has been shown to inhibit the expression of Nur77 via the transcription factor MEF2D. Interestingly, the MEF2D binding domain lies in the same N-terminal region of HDAC7 that contains the mitochondrial targeting presequence. Mitochondrial targeting presequences normally consist of a positively charged motif of 20–60 residues, often followed by vaguely defined intramitochondrial sorting peptides. Although not the focus of this study, it seems reasonable to conclude that the presequence does not extend into the NLS as HDAC7 demonstrates nuclear localization. Western blotting of stably transfected GFP-HDAC7 C4-2 cells for GFP detects an ∼35-kDa band (data not shown). GFP is a 27-kDa protein suggesting that the additional 8 kDa (∼70 amino acids) originates from the mitochondrial targeting presequence of HDAC7. These values are entirely compatible with our data. The significance of the N-terminal extensions of mouse and rat HDAC7 is unknown with respect to mitochondrial localization and function. As we routinely observed N-terminally tagged GFP-HDAC7 in the mitochondria of cells, we speculated that N-terminal peptide additions to the targeting presequence may not ultimately affect mitochondrial import. One interesting observation is that whereas we often observed HDAC7 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of both live and fixed cells, when HDAC7 is localized to mitochondria it is often robust and exclusively mitochondrial. Although the specific cellular condition(s) regulating HDAC7 mitochondrial import are unknown, this observation is likely because of either enhanced HDAC7 mitochondrial import or attenuated release. As 14-3-3 proteins favor cytoplasmic sequestration of phosphorylated HDAC7, and mitochondria are located in the cytoplasm, it is tempting to speculate that kinase activity might ultimately enhance mitochondrial import. Finally, mitochondrially processed HDAC7 is still technically competent for cytonuclear flux as both the NLS and nuclear export sequence remain intact. Indeed, the NLS is now at a more N-terminal site, introducing the concept that mitochondrial processing might be revealing an otherwise masked NLS. This brings up the interesting possibility that mitochondrial processed HDAC7 might have enhanced nuclear import capabilities relative to full-length, unprocessed HDAC7. We were initially surprised to identify HDAC7 in mitochondria as previous reports have shown dramatic cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of HDAC7. Curiously, whereas we observed occasional nondescript localization of HDAC7 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of individual cells (Fig. 6), when we did observe mitochondrial HDAC7 in individual cells it was robust and exclusively mitochondrial more often than not. On rare occasions, we observed both punctate mitochondrial localization of GFP-HDAC7 in a background of general cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2C, top image, lower right GFP-positive cell). Integrating our data into current models of HDAC7 cellular localization, we propose that mitochondrial HDAC7 localization can, at least under certain cellular conditions, be obscured by a more intense general cytoplasmic HDAC7 signal. Furthermore, as the GFP tag was N-terminal in our studies and all known mitochondrial imported proteins had their N-terminal targeting peptide removed via endoproteolytic cleavage, we propose that the cytoplasmic and nuclear GFP-HDAC7 that we observed at no time resided in the mitochondrial inner membrane space. Importantly, this species of HDAC7 is competent to enter mitochondria as the targeting presequence would still be intact. In this model, mitochondria could act as an irreversible intracellular reservoir (at least in non-apoptotic cells) to sequester HDAC7 that would otherwise be available for cytonuclear flux, and this may offer a novel method of epigenetic regulation of the genome. As mitochondrial HDAC7 likely is involved in different biological events relative to unprocessed, full-length HDAC7, we speculate that the repertoire of interacting proteins might be considerably different from those previously reported for non-mitochondrial HDAC7 (10Dressel U. Bailey P.J. Wang S.C. Downes M. Evans R.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17007-17013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As HDAC7 is a regulated phosphoprotein and can exist in either cytoplasmic, nuclear, or mitochondrial compartments of individual cells or even the same cell, we conclude that the regulation of HDAC7 intracellular localization is likely quite complex. In sum, we have demonstrated the novel finding that HDAC7 can localize to mitochondria in addition to previous reports demonstrating cytoplasmic and nuclear HDAC7 localization. As mentioned earlier, mitochondrial release of N-terminally processed HDAC7 and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration might be directly involved in programmed cell death under apoptotic conditions. Although we readily observed PARP and Bid cleavage as well as H2A.X phosphorylation in response to hygromycin treatment, we routinely failed to observe H2B phosphorylation. H2B phosphorylation has recently been proposed as a definitive marker of commitment to apoptosis (28Cheung W.L. Ajiro K. Samejima K. Kloc M. Cheung P. Mizzen C.A. Beeser A. Etkin L.D. Chernoff J. Earnshaw W.C. Allis C.D. Cell. 2003; 113: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Although this marker may eventually become apparent at later time points, under the conditions and time points at which we observed HDAC7 translocation to the cytoplasm, commitment to apoptosis might not be assured. Taken together, as HDAC7 appears to be the only known HDAC localized to mitochondria, we speculate that HDAC7 has a unique and complex role in normal cellular function, quite possibly apoptosis. Future studies are under way to identify cytoplasmic substrates and further characterize the significance of mitochondrial HDAC7 in the process of programmed cell death. We thank Dr. Tomas Vomastek for the GFP-Bax expression vector and Dr. Eric Verdin for the wild type HDAC7-FLAG expression vector."

The present study tested whether the mevalonate-isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which affects inflammation in many types of tissues, tonically regulates microglial activation. This question takes on added significance given the potential use of statins, drugs that block the rate-limiting step (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase)) in mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis, in AD treatment. Both mevastatin and simvastatin caused a concentration- and time-dependent activation of microglia in cultured rat hippocampal slices. This response consisted of a transformation of the cells from a typical resting configuration to an amoeboid, macrophage-like morphology, increased expression of a macrophage antigen, and up-regulation of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. Evidence for proliferation was also obtained. Statin-induced microglial changes were blocked by mevalonate but not by cholesterol, indicating that they were probably due to suppression of isoprenoid synthesis. In accord with this, the statin effects were absent in slices co-incubated with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a mevalonate product that provides for the prenylation of Rho GTPases. Finally, PD98089, a compound that blocks activation of extracellularly regulated kinases1/2, suppressed statin-induced up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α but had little effect on microglial transformation. These results suggest that 1) the mevalonate-isoprenoid pathway is involved in regulating microglial morphology and in controlling expression of certain cytokines and 2) statins have the potential for enhancing a component of AD with uncertain relationships to other features of the disease.

Neuroepidemiology. 1998; 17: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that statins, a family of compounds that inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase: HMG-CoA reductase), decrease the incidence of the disease (11Wolozin B.

These observations have led to an extensive and ongoing evaluation of statins as preventive treatments for Alzheimer's disease (13Stuve O. Youssef S. Steinman L. Zamvil S.S. Curr. Opin.

Mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor, the synthesis of which is blocked by statins, is converted into several bioactive compounds. Among these, the isoprenoids are of particular importance because, among other functions, they provide for the covalent addition of lipid moieties (prenylation) to regulatory proteins (17Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and thereby affect critical cell functions. Prenylation by the mevalonate products farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, for example, contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cell migration in various types of tissue (18Huang K.C.

Several studies have used statins to investigate the roles of cholesterol and protein prenylation in the regulation of immune cell properties, including cell morphology, migration, and secretion of cytokines. The results have not been consistent; although some experiments found that statins induce proinflammatory responses (22Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Murray J.L. Youssef S. Rankin B.M. Kowala M. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), others indicate that the drugs have direct anti-inflammatory (23Weitz-Schmidt G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 482-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and immunomodulatory (24Youssef S. Stuve O. Patarroyo J.C. Ruiz P.J. Radosevich J.L. Hur E.M. Bravo M. Mitchell D.J. Sobel R.A. Steinman L. Zamvil S.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) actions. Whether statins also influence the activation of microglia, the resident cells mediating inflammatory responses in brain, is unknown, although the question is of evident importance for the use of the drugs in AD. Microglial activation, along with classic features of the immune response, including increases in proinflammatory cytokines and the presence of complement proteins, are found in the brains of patients with AD (see Ref. 25Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R.

Possibly related to this, epidemiological studies suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the risk and slow the progression of the disease. On the other hand, accumulating evidence points to the conclusion that microglia help to clear extracellular amyloidogenic peptides, an activity that would presumably retard the development of AD-related pathology (26Brazil M.I. Chung H. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16941-16947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Beneficial activation of microglia has thus been proposed as a rationale for therapeutic vaccination (27Schenk D.B. Yednock T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23 (683-674): 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Morgan D. Expert Rev. Vaccines. 2003; 2: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The present study explored the effects of inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase on microglial morphology and expression of the cytokine TNF-α using a novel cultured brain slice preparation. This preparation has been used previously to study pathologies associated with the aged human brain (29Bednarski E. Ribak C.E. Lynch G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4006-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bi X. Yong A.P. Zhou J. Ribak C.E. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8832-8837Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), including an intense microglial reaction to suspected causes of age-related pathology such as amyloid-β peptide uptake by neurons (31Bi X. Gall C.M. Zhou J. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and partial lysosomal dysfunction (32Bi X. Liu J. Zhou J. Sharman K. Song Z. Lynch G. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2001; 27 (Program No. 963.17)Google Scholar). Cultured slices thus provide a convenient system with which to test whether protracted exposure to statins triggers brain inflammatory reactions. Our results indicate that statins elicit microglial activation, as evidenced by transformation to macrophage morphology and up-regulation of the cytokine TNF-α, and that this effect is likely due to suppression of the mevalonate pathway and of its geranylgeranyl products. Preparation and Maintenance of Hippocampal Slice Cultures—Organotypic hippocampal cultures were prepared using the technique of Stoppini et al. (33Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were harvested from brains of 9–12-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups under sterile conditions. Slices (400-μm thick) were cut perpendicular to the long axis of hippocampus using a McIllwain tissue chopper and collected into a cutting medium consisting of minimum Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen), 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm Tris base, 10 mm glucose, and 3 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2). Slices were positioned onto 30-mm cell culture inserts (Millicell-CM, Millipore, Bedford, MA) that were placed in 6-well culture trays with 1 ml of growth medium/well (growth medium: 50% basal medium eagle, 25% Earle's balanced salt solution, 25% horse serum, and the following supplements: 136 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5mm NaHCO3, 3 mm glutamine, 40 mm glucose, 0.5 mm ascorbic acid, 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3 at 23 °C), 1 mg/liter insulin, 25 mg/liter penicillin). Each of the above components was purchased from Sigma. The cultures were incubated at 36 °C with a 5% CO2-enriched atmosphere, and the medium was changed every other day until use, generally 12–14 days later. Hippocampal slices maintained in vitro for 12–14 days were exposed to medium containing mevastatin (0.01–50 μm), simvastatin (0.01–10 μm; both were from Calbiochem), or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1%) for 0–6 days. In some experiments, the aforementioned chemicals were applied in the presence of mevalonate (100 and 500 μm), cholesterol (100 μm; both are from Sigma; these concentrations were chosen according to the literature (34Eberlein M. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Goppelt-Struebe M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 35Ikeda U. Shimpo M. Ikeda M. Minota S. Shimada K. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)), or of inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), PD98059 (25 μm), or the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, SB233580 (20 μm; both were purchased from Calbiochem). For assessment of overall cell proliferation, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (10 μm; Sigma) was added to culture medium 24 h before the slices were fixed. Immunocytochemistry—Following treatment, slices were thoroughly washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 12–16 h in cold 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose for 1–2 h, and then carefully removed from the insert membranes. Serial sections (25-μm thick) were cut parallel to the broad face of the explant, using a freezing microtome. Immunocytochemistry was performed using the standard avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC) method using the reagents and instructions of the VECTASTAIN® Elite ABC kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Briefly, free-floating sections were preincubated with 10% normal horse serum in phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with the monoclonal antibody ED-1 (1:1000), with the monoclonal anti-CD11b antibody OX-42 (1:1000; both were from Serotec, Oxford), or with a polyclonal goat against TNF-α antibody (1:1000; Sigma) in 5% normal horse serum overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed in phosphate buffer, incubated in biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (for ED-1 and OX-42) or anti-goat IgG (for TNF-α) (both used at 1:400) for 2–3 h, washed in phosphate buffer, incubated in the avidin-biotin complex solution for 45 min, and then processed for diaminobenzidine reaction. After final rinses in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), air-dried, dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol, and coverslipped (clearing solvent; Stephens Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) with Permount (Fisher Scientific). For BrdUrd staining, DNA was denatured with 2 m HCl for 30 min at 37 °C, and the antigens were unmasked by incubation with 0.1% pepsin. Sections were blocked in 10% normal horse serum (room temperature for 1 h) followed by incubation with monoclonal mouse anti-BrdUrd (1:200; Sigma). Subsequently, tissues were further processed for immunostaining following the aforementioned procedures. Methods for Quantification of Microglia Structural Features—Images of ED-1, TNF-α, and BrdUrd immunostaining in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 region and in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus of cultured hippocampal slices were visualized using a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop 2; ×10 objective, 0.75 optovar). Images of tissue sections were digitized and scanned with a Zeiss digital photo camera (AxioCam Hrc) and an automated image-scanning program, KS 400 (Zeiss). An automated in-house computer program was used to enhance image contrast, extract ED-1, TNF-α, or BrdUrd immunopositive particles, and measure their relevant parameters. Computed measures consisted of: the number of particles (immunolabeled cells), total area, and average area per particle. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance using Prism V. 3. Immunoblotting—Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried out following conventional procedures. Control and experimental slices were collected in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl harvest buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm leupeptin, pH 7.4, centrifuged, and sonicated after resuspension in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.4). Proteins (40–60 μg) from each sample were denatured by boiling for 5 min in sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%), after which the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against TNF-α (1:5000) or monoclonal antibodies against diphosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:10,000; both antibodies are from Sigma) for a 12–16-h incubation at room temperature; the blots were then stained to less than maximum intensity with anti-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugates, using a nitro-blue tetrazolium substrate system (Bio-Rad). Images were analyzed by densitometry using the NIH Image system (version 1.60). Preparation of Membrane Fractions—Membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (36Bi X. Bi R. Baudry M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 144: 203-217PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal slices treated with mevastatin (0.1, 1, 5 μm) or vehicle only (0.1% Me2SO) were homogenized in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membrane and cytoplasm proteins were denatured in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE; immunoblotting for Rho was carried out as described above using an anti-Rho antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as means ± S.E. analysis of variance and two-tail Student's t tests were performed for statistical analysis as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statins Activate Microglia in Cultured Hippocampal Slices— Mevastatin and simvastatin, two inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, were used to test for interactions between cholesterol metabolism and microglia activation. The antibody ED-1, which predominately labels activated macrophages and microglia (37Woods A.G. Poulsen F.R. Gall C.M. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Kato H. Kogure K. Araki T. Itoyama Y.

Microglia in the Regenerating and Degenerating Nervous System. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 275-305Google Scholar), recognized few cells in untreated cultured slices (Fig. 1A). The immunopositive elements had a thin cell body with twisted fine processes (Fig. 1A, inset), a morphology corresponding to that associated with resting microglia. Six-day treatment with 10 μm mevastatin caused a large increase in the number of ED-1-labeled cells (Fig. 1D), along with pronounced morphological changes. As shown in Fig. 1D (inset), cells in the treated slices were amoeboid, notably devoid of processes, and in general resembled macrophage-like mononuclear cells. These effects could not be detected at 0.1 μm (Fig. 1B), were evident at 1.0 μm (Fig. 1C), and were maximal at 10 μm (Fig. 1D). Higher concentrations (≥25 μm) decreased the number of stained cells, with the remainder having features of dying microglia (Fig. 1, E and F). Typical results obtained with OX-42, a monoclonal antibody against a second microglial marker (Cd11b), are described in Fig. 2. In accord with earlier work (40Huh Y. Jung J.W. Park C. Ryu J.R. Shin C.Y. Kim W.K. Ryu J.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 349: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this antibody provides a near complete image of resting microglia, as can be seen by the labeling of fine details in the ramified processes (Fig. 2A, arrows). Six-day treatment with 10 μm mevastatin greatly increased the density of labeling, causing the normally unlabeled cell bodies (Fig. 2A, arrowheads) to become almost completely filled with immunoreactive products (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the thin twisted processes found in resting cells were either altogether absent or reduced to stubby, unramified elements (Fig. 2B, arrows). These effects, although more dramatic, were comparable with those obtained with ED-1. Fig. 3 summarizes the changes in the number of ED-1-positive cells and the area they occupied in field CA1 and dentate gyrus of statin-treated slices. Mevastatin at 0.1 μm had no significant effect on the number (1.1 ± 0.1 times control, p > 0.1, n = 19) or size (total area) of immunopositive microglia (Fig. 3, A and B). Both measures were significantly increased at 1.0 μm. The number of labeled cells doubled (2.1 ± 0.2 times control, p < 0.001, n = 19), whereas the area they occupied increased by 197 ± 18%. As shown in the figure, the effects of the statin at 10 μm appeared to be larger in the pyramidal cell fields than in the dentate gyrus. This variation was highly significant for both number and area when measured at higher concentrations (at 5 μm, p = 0.003 for area and 0.048 for number; at 10 μm, p < 0.0001 for area and p = 0.0014 for number; Mann-Whitney test). Higher concentrations elicited smaller increases in cell number than were found at 10 μm (data not shown), confirming the impression gained from survey micrographs. A comparison of Fig. 3, A and B, suggested that statins had a larger effect on the area occupied by activated microglia than they did on cell number. A test of this point is summarized in Fig. 3C. The ratio of the two measures was significantly greater than that found in untreated slices at all mevastatin concentrations greater than 0.1 μm and, as shown, increased in a dose-dependent manner. This provides evidence that mevastatin not only increased the number of immunopositive microglia but also enlarged individual cells. The above-described morphological changes were evident at 48 h and reached a maximum at 96 h (not shown). Cell Division in Statin-treated Slices—Microglia retain the capacity to divide and migrate in adult brain, and this could account for their increased numbers in statin-treated slices. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing BrdUrd (10 μm) uptake in control and mevastatin-treated slices. Fig. 4 summarizes the results obtained following a six-day treatment. Significant differences from control slices were not observed with 0.01 or 0.1 μm concentrations, but treatment with 1 μm caused a significant increase in the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells in both CA1 and dentate gyrus (p < 0.01 for both regions). The results for the numbers of BrdUrd-labeled cells were variable, and the increases in this measure appeared to be smaller than those for the numbers of ED-1-positive cells. Unexpectedly, mevastatin at 5 and 10 μm had smaller effects than at 1 μm and did not increase cell numbers above control values (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the increase in ED-1-immunopositive microglia produced by low concentrations of mevastatin is in part due to proliferation and in part to activation, and thus labeling, of the extant population of microglia. Only the latter effect was obtained with higher concentrations of the statin. Statins Up-regulate TNF-α Expression—Activation of macrophages, including microglia, involves up-regulation of cytokines as well as the morphological changes described above. The release of these toxic agents is generally assumed to mediate the contribution of inflammation to the progression of various diseases, including AD; thus, it was of interest to determine whether statin-induced changes in microglia extended to cytokine expression. Fig. 5 describes results for TNF-α, an important central nervous system cytokine. Very few cells were immunopositive for TNF-α in control slices, but this changed dramatically after a 6-day treatment with mevastatin (10 μm). As shown (Fig. 5A, bottom panels), a substantial proportion of the cells in statin-treated slices were positive for the cytokine, and these cells had the amoeboid morphology associated with activated microglia. Comparison of ED-1 and TNF-α staining on the same sections showed that nearly all TNF-α-positive cells were also labeled by ED-1, and this was confirmed in merged images. Quantitative analyses indicated that the threshold for statin-induced increases in the cytokine was below 0.1 μm (Fig. 5B). The incidence of labeled cells at this concentration was greater than in control slices (CA1: 4.2 ± 1.6 times control, n = 9 versus n = 13), and this difference was highly significant (p = 0.013, U test, two tails). The effects at 1.0 μm were less variable, but not markedly greater, than at 0.1 μm and highly significant. Higher statin concentrations produced very large (10–25-fold) increases in the number of TNF-α-positive microglia (Fig. 5B). The number of TNF-α labeled cells in the pyramidal cell region was smaller than that for ED-1 labeled cells, suggesting that only a subset of activated microglia expressed the cytokine, as expected from the micrographs in Fig. 5A. Interestingly, the regional differences in the numbers of ED-1-positive cells were not observed with TNF-α-positive cells, as is evident in the CA1 versus dentate gyrus comparison shown in Fig. 5B. This suggests that field CA1 has a population of statin-sensitive microglia that is not present in the dentate gyrus. Statin-induced changes in the levels of TNF-α were further analyzed by immunoblotting. Levels of the cytokine in cultured slices maintained for 2–3 weeks under control conditions were undetectable (Fig. 6A, cont), and a similar conclusion was reached using reverse transcription-PCR. 2X. Bi, J. Zhou, and G. Lynch, unpublished observation. Six-day incubations with mevastatin or simvastatin (10 μm) induced a marked increase in TNF-α levels (Fig. 6A, Mev and Sim); quantitative analysis revealed an approximately 10-fold increase in TNF-α levels induced by mevastatin (Fig. 6B). Immunoblot experiments showed that statin-induced increases in the cytokine were evident after 2 days and approached a maximum 2 days later (Fig. 6C), a time course comparable with that for the number of ED-1 immunopositive microglia. Links between Mevalonate-Isoprenoid Biosynthesis and Microglia—HMG-CoA reductase is an early step in cholesterol synthesis and, as might be expected from this, statins block the synthesis of several intermediary, biologically active steroids, in addition to reducing cholesterol production. Replacement treatments were used to determine whether reductions in an intermediate product, rather than reduced cholesterol levels, were involved in statin-induced microglia changes. Western blot analysis showed that mevalonate, an immediate product of HMG-CoA reductase, by itself had no effect on TNF-α levels but completely blocked mevastatin-induced increases in the cytokine (Fig. 6, A and B, Mnt and Mev/Mnt). The effects of replacement on statin-induced microglial transformation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Fig. 7, A and B, are, respectively, photomicrographs of ED-1-immunostained sections through a control slice and a slice treated with mevastatin for 6 days; massive changes in microglial morphology and an apparent increase in the numbers of labeled cells can be seen. As shown in Fig. 7C, adding 100 μm cholesterol to the culture medium did not detectably alter the changes in ED-1-immunopositive microglia produced by a 6-day treatment with mevastatin. The labeled cells were densely labeled and ovalshaped; note also that the twisted dendritic processes typical of resting microglia were almost completely absent. In marked contrast, mevalonate (500 μm) completely blocked micr"

The amino acid l-kynurenine (l-Kyn) 1The abbreviations used are: l-Kyn, l-kynurenine; KA, kynurenic acid; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; hKAT-I, human KAT-I; PLP, 5′-pyridoxal phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine phosphate; ttGlnAT, T. thermophilus glutamine:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. is a key metabolite along this pathway, standing at the central branching point of the metabolic cascade (4Stone T.W. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2001; 64: 185-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Indeed, l-Kyn undergoes different fates: i) it can be transformed to either 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine or anthranilic acid and conveyed into the flux of freshly synthesized NAD, or ii) it can be used for the synthesis of kynurenic acid (KA). A major role in the central nervous system is ascribed to KA. In fact, it represents the only known endogenous antagonist of the excitatory action of excitatory amino acids, showing the highest affinities for the glycine modulatory site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (5Perkins M.N.

Its inhibitory action underlies its neuroprotective and neurolectic properties; indeed, low endogenous brain KA level profoundly influences vulnerability to excitotoxic attacks (11Stone T.W.

On the other hand, a KA increase significantly correlates with schizophrenia (15Erhardt S. Schwieler L. Engberg G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 527: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and cognitive impairment (16Baran H. Cairns N. Lubec B. Lubec G.

Brain Res. 1992; 588: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggesting an additional role of KA in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and mental retardation. The KA requirement in the central nervous system is satisfied by the in situ irreversible transamination of l-kynurenine, catalyzed by kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs) (Fig. 1). The catalyzed reaction proceeds first through the transaldimination between the l-Kyn α-amino group and the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor following the classical mechanism reported for aminotransferases (19Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar); however, the subsequent catalytic events leading to the kynurenic acid formation are far from fully elucidated. KATs belong to the α-family of PLP-dependent enzymes and are considered members of aminotransferases fold type I subfamily (20Jensen R.A. Gu W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). So far two KAT isozymes, termed KAT-I and KAT-II, have been identified in rat (21Okuno E. Du F. Ishikawa T. Tsujimoto M.

Brain Res. 1991; 542: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) brains and have been extensively characterized. Both isozymes are capable of catalyzing the transamination of l-Kyn and to a lesser extent 3-hydroxy-kynurenine to kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid, respectively, using many different α-ketoacids as amino group acceptors (25Guidetti P.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 730-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). KAT-I, also known as glutamine transaminase K, (27Cooper A.J. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2554-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cooper A.J.L. Neurochem.

J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 730-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Of functional relevance, KAT-I also displays cysteine conjugate β-lyase activity (29Perry S. Harries H. Scholfield C. Lock T. King L. Gibson G. Goldfarb P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and has been shown to activate sulfur- and selenium-conjugated compounds (30Commandeur J.N. Andreadou I. Rooseboom M. Out M.

Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This observation indicates an additional important role for KAT-I in the bio-activation of environmental pollutants contributing to liver- and kidney-associated carcinogenesis (28Cooper A.J.L. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 44: 557-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the kidney and the liver show much greater KAT activity than the brain, the emphasis of KAT research has been placed on the enzymes in the central nervous system, paralleling the investigation of the pivotal role of KA therein. We report here the crystal structure of human KAT-I (hKAT-I) at a resolution of 2.0 Å in its PLP and PMP forms as well as in complex with the competing substrate phenylalanine. Our results represent the first crystal structure of a human KAT to be reported, thus shedding more light into the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of hKAT-I may contribute to the rational design of selective inhibitors of high medical interest in a number of pathological conditions in humans. Construction of Recombinant Transfer Vector for hKAT-I—The open reading frame for hKAT-I (NP_872603) was amplified from human liver cDNA (Clontech) using a specific forward (5′-CTCGAGATGGCCAAACAGCTGCAG, XhoI site underlined) and reverse (5′-AAGCTTAGAGTTCCACCTTCCACTT, Hind III site underlined) primers pair. The PCR product was inserted into a TOPO TA cloning vector and then subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen). The recombinant transfer vector (pBlueBac-HsKAT I) was sequenced for frame verification of the inserted DNA sequence. Production of Recombinant Baculoviruses for the Expression of hKAT-I in Insect Cells—pBlueBac-HsKAT I was co-transfected with linearized Bac-N-Blue™ viral DNA (AcMNPV, Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus), in the presence of InsectinPlus™ insect cell-specific liposomes, to Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculovirus was purified by plaque assay procedure. Blue putative recombinant plaques were transferred to 12-well microtitre plates and amplified in Sf9 cells. Viral DNA was isolated for PCR analysis to determine the purity of recombinant viruses. High titer viral stocks for individual recombinant viral strains were generated by amplification in Sf9 cell suspension cultures according to the manufacturer's instructions. hKAT-I Expression and Purification—Sf9 cells were cultured at 27 °C in an Ultimate Insect™ serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 units of heparin/ml (Sigma) in culture spinner flasks with constant stirring at 80 rev/min. When the cell density reached 2 × 106 cells/ml, they were inoculated with the high titer viral stocks of the hKAT-I expressing recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of six viral particles per cell. At day 4 after hKAT-I recombinant baculovirus inoculation, Sf9-infected cells from a 2-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation (800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). The pellet was dissolved in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm PLP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with a final pH of 7.4. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and assayed for KAT-I activity. Soluble proteins in supernatant were precipitated with 65% saturated ammonium sulfate. Protein precipitate was re-dissolved in 10% saturated ammonium sulfate and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column. A linear gradient from 10 – 0% of ammonium sulfate in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used for protein elution. The hKAT-I active fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and separated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography applying a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) in the same phosphate buffer. The active fractions were pooled again, concentrated, and then separated by a Superdex™ 200 gel filtration column. The hKAT-I active fractions were finally collected and concentrated. The purified protein content was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purity of the enzyme was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The concentration of the purified hKAT-I stock was adjusted to 20 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), aliquoted, and frozen at -80 °C. Crystallization—Crystals of the PLP form of human hKAT-I have been obtained using the vapor diffusion technique in hanging drop. 2 μl of a protein solution at a concentration of 20 mg/ml were mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 4.5 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) and equilibrated against 500 μl of a reservoir solution at 4 °C. Yellow crystals grew to a maximum dimension of 0.3 × 0.5 × 0.7 mm in about 2 weeks. In the effort to obtain the complex with l-kynurenine, crystals of the PLP form of hKAT-I were soaked overnight at 4 °C in their crystallization solution containing 3 mm l-kynurenine. A few minutes after soaking, the crystals became colorless, indicating the formation of the PMP form for which the structure is reported in the present study. The crystals of the hKAT-I·Phe complex were obtained by soaking crystals of the PLP form in their crystallization solution with the addition of 2.5 mm phenylalanine at 4 °C overnight. Data Collection—All data collections were performed at 100 K. Crystals were directly taken from the crystallization droplet and flash frozen under a liquid nitrogen stream. Diffraction data for the PLP form were collected up to 2.0 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation at the ID14 EH1 beam line, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Systematic absences and diffraction symmetry suggested a trigonal P3221 or P3121 space group with the following cell parameters a = b = 146.4 Å and c = 67.5 Å containing one molecule in the asymmetric unit with a corresponding solvent content of 72%. X-ray diffraction data sets for the PMP form of the enzyme and for the hKAT-I·Phe complex were collected up to 2.9 Å and 2.7 Å resolution respectively, using in house equipment (RIGAKU RU300 rotating anode and RAXIS IV+ area detector). Data processing was performed with the programs of the CCP4 suite (32Number Collaborative Computing Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nakai T. Kawaguchi S. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The program AmoRe (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) was employed to calculate both cross-rotation and translation functions in the 10–4 Å resolution range. The rotation function gave a clear solution, which was subject to the translation function calculation performed in both the P3221 and P3121 space groups. Only for the former was a clear solution identified, unambiguously allowing us to assign P3221 as the correct space group. The initial model was subjected to iterative cycles of crystallographic refinement with the program REFMAC (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) alternated with graphic sessions for model building using the program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). A random sample containing 834 reflections was set apart for the calculation of the free R-factor (37Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were manually added at positions with density >4 sigma in the Fo - Fc map, considering only peaks engaged in at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom or a solvent atom. The procedure converged to an R-factor and free R-factor of 0.192 and 0.227, respectively, with ideal geometry. The structures of the PMP form and of the hKAT-I·Phe complex were refined using (as the starting model) the final coordinates of the PLP form of the enzyme from which all solvent molecules were removed. In both cases the crystallographic refinement was carried out by means of the program REFMAC alternated with sessions of model building. 564 and 722 randomly chosen reflections were excluded from the refinement of the PMP and hKAT-I·Phe structures, respectively, and were used for the free R-factor calculation. For the PMP structure, a careful inspection of the electron density in the enzyme active site has been performed when the R-factor dropped to a value of 0.25 at 2.9 Å. No electron density compatible with either the substrate l-Kyn or the product KA was observed, and the enzyme was unambiguously identified as being in the PMP form. In the case of the hKAT-I·Phe structure, the ligand was manually modeled based on both the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps only when the R-factor dropped to a value of 0.26 at 2.7 Å resolution. For both the PMP and hKAT-I·Phe structures, solvent molecules were manually added following the same criteria adopted for the PLP form. The crystallographic refinement converged to an R-factor and an R-free of 0.17 and 0.22 for the PMP form, and an R-factor and R-free of 0.175 and 0.23 for the hKAT·Phe complex. In all the three structures the residues 1–3 and 149–151 were not visible in the electron density map. Residues numbered 1*–422* refer to the crystallographically related subunit building the hKAT-I functional homodimer. The results of refinement are summarized in Table I. Deposition—The atomic coordinates of hKAT-I in the PLP and PMP forms and in complex with phenylalanine, have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) (accession codes 1W7L, 1W7N, and 1W7M, respectively). Overall Quality of the Model—The three-dimensional structure of the recombinant human kynurenine aminotransferase I has been solved by means of the molecular replacement technique at a resolution of 2.0 Å. A monomer is present in the asymmetric unit and the functional homodimer could be observed in the crystal lattice, resulting from the application of the crystallographic 2-fold axis. An excellent electron density map allowed the modeling of 415 residues of 422, one PLP, and 305 solvent molecules in the PLP form. The final model of the PMP form contains 415 residues, one PMP, and 197 solvent molecules, whereas the hKAT-I·Phe complex consists of 415 residues, one PLP molecule, one l-Phe molecule, and 202 solvents. The stereochemistry of the models has been assessed with the program PROCHECK (38Laskowsky R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of the PLP form, 90% of the residues were in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. Pro123, Pro183, and Pro186 were all recognized as cis residues. Although Phe278 falls in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot in all three structures solved, the excellent electron density allowed us to unambiguously assign the observed conformation. All the figures have been generated with the programs MOLSCRIPT (39Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and BOBSCRIPT (40Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—The hKAT-I protein architecture reveals the prototypical fold of aminotransferases subgroup I (19Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 41Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), characterized by an N-terminal arm, a small domain, and a large domain (Fig. 2). The N-terminal arm consists of a random coiled stretch made of residues 4–17. The small domain (residues 18–43 and 302–421) folds in a 5-stranded mainly antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices. The large domain (residues 44–301) shows a conserved α/β topology, where a sharply twisted 7-stranded β-sheet inner core is nested into a conserved array of eight α-helices contributed from both the interior and the exterior of the molecule. As observed in other subgroup I aminotransferases, the functional unit of hKAT-I consists of a homodimer with subunits related by a dyad axis, with its two active sites located at the domain interface in each subunit, and at the subunit interface in the dimer (Fig. 3). Helices H2 and H13 participate in dimer stabilization as they are located around the 2-fold axis. Moreover, a relevant contribution toward the stability of the hKAT-I dimer is provided by its N-terminal arms. Mutational analysis carried out on pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase demonstrated that the integrity of the N-terminal region is of crucial importance for the enzymatic activity (42Fukumoto Y. Tanase S. Nagashima F. Ueda S. Ikegami K. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our crystallographic dimer, two strong salt bridges are established between Arg8 and Asp113 (at a distance of 3.5 Å) and between Arg9 and Glu114 (at a distance of 3.1 Å) of the opposite subunits; such interactions, while providing a major contribution to the dimer stability, lock the N-terminal arms in the observed conformation. The PLP Binding Site—The active site contains one PLP molecule covalently linked to Lys247 and is hosted in a deep cleft at the domain interface built up by residues from both subunits (Fig. 3). Each PLP cofactor sits in a binding pocket defined by two regions contributed by residues of the large domains of both subunits (Fig. 4). The bottom of the PLP binding pocket is entirely defined by residues of the large domain of the corresponding monomer. With the exception of Lys247 and Gly100, all of these residues stand at or close to the edge of the inner core β-sheet, pointing toward the domain interface and facing the re-face of the PLP-ring. Distinct arrays of residues form the lateral walls of the PLP binding pocket. In particular, the stretch 34–37, together with the side chains of Arg398, Asn181, and Asn185 of the large domain, builds up one of the pocket walls. The opposite wall consists of residues Tyr101 and Tyr128 of the same monomer and of residues Phe278*, His279* and Tyr63* of the other subunit. As a consequence, the PLP-pyridine ring can be seen as laterally clamped by a set of hydrophilic residues on one side and by numerous aromatic residues on the other one (Fig. 4). In its PLP form, hKAT-I carries the PLP molecule covalently bound in the active site by a Schiff-base linkage to the catalytic Lys247 (Fig. 4A). This results in the presence of an internal aldimine double bond (C4′=N) whose plane forms an angle of 123.0° with the pyridine ring of PLP. Several other residues contact the PLP molecule, participating in its recognition and binding. The phosphate group of the cofactor is engaged in a number of interactions with residues building up the strictly conserved “PLP-phosphate binding cup” featuring PLP-dependent enzymes (43Denesyuk A.I. Denessiouk K.A. Korpela T. Johnson M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, its OP1 oxygen makes a set of hydrogen bonds with Ser244 (2.6 Å), Gly100 (with its backbone nitrogen atom at 2.8 Å), and with the solvent molecule W7 (3.1 Å). The hydroxyl group of Tyr63* makes a hydrogen bond with the PLP OP2 atom (distance of 2.5 Å). A further hydrogen bond involves W34 located at 2.67 Å. Finally, the PLP OP3 atom makes interactions with Lys255 (at 2.7 Å from the NZ atom) and with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Gly100 and Tyr101 (distances of 3.2 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively). The PLP phenolic oxygen is held in place by its interactions with Tyr216 (at 2.7 Å from its OH atom) and with Asn185 (at a distance of 2.8 Å with its NH1 atom). Moreover, the N1 atom of the PLP pyridine moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic oxygen atoms of Asp213. Several hydrophobic interactions participate in the further stabilization of PLP. In particular Phe125 and Val215 sandwich the pyridine moiety of the cofactor from its si-face and re-face, respectively. Substrate Recognition and Implications for Catalysis—We have been unable to produce crystals of the hKAT-I in complex with the physiological substrate l-Kyn. Attempts at obtaining the structure of hKAT-I·l-Kyn complex invariably yielded crystals of the PMP form (Fig. 4B), emphasizing that our crystal form is catalytically competent. However, to describe the ligand binding site in hKAT-I, we solved the structure of the Michaelis complex with l-phenylalanine, which has been reported to inhibit hKAT-I by behaving as a very poor substrate and competing with l-Kyn for binding to the enzyme active site (26Baran H. Okuno E. Kido R. Schwarcz R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 730-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the hKAT-I·Phe structure (Fig. 4C), l-Phe lies just above the PLP molecule on its si-face. Several residues structurally conserved throughout aminotransferases described so far define the ligand binding site and contact l-Phe. In particular, Asn185 establishes a hydrogen bond with the ligand α-carboxylate moiety, which is further stabilized by Arg398. Such a conserved bonding scheme at the l-Phe carboxylic side results in the positioning of the substrate α-amino group just above the PLP C4′ reactive center. A remarkable structural trait of the ligand binding site in hKAT-I consists of a series of aromatic residues, including Tyr63*, His279*, Phe278*, Tyr101, Phe125, and Trp18, that is reminiscent of a crown (Fig. 4A). In the hKAt-I·Phe structure (Fig. 4C), l-Phe is sandwiched between Phe125 and His279*, in which the aromatic planes perpendicularly contact the ligand aromatic ring (distances for the closest pair of atoms being: 3.2 Å for l-Phe CE2-NE2 His279*, and 3.6 Å for l-Phe CE2–CZ Phe125). A further aromatic contact is provided by Phe278* (closest distance of 3.3 Å) oriented with its aromatic ring almost perpendicular to the ligand ring. Notably, Phe278* is the only residue falling in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot in hKAT-I structures, suggesting that the observed conformation is functional to substrate recognition and catalysis. A major question in kynurenine aminotransferases catalysis concerns the different substrate specificities of the isozyme. Understanding the molecular determinants resulting in l-Kyn recognition by hKAT-I will prove to be critical for the rational design of selective inhibitors of potential medical interest. Sequence alignment of subgroup I aminotransferases from different species revealed that a tyrosine residue peculiarly features human and rodent l-kynurenine aminotransferases (Tyr101 in hKAT-I). In hKAT-I we observed a striking conformatio"
https://openalex.org/W2114933935,"The vectors for gene delivery are usually classified as viral and nonviral vectors. While the viral vectors are very efficient in transducing cells, safety concerns regarding their use in humans make nonviral vectors an attractive alternative. Among the nonviral vectors, the lipoplexes (complexes of cationic liposome/pDNA) are the most studied and represent the most promising approaches for human clinical trials. However, an inflammatory response is invariably associated with administration of the lipoplexes, which must be avoided in the clinical application. Here, we have successfully developed a nonimmunostimulatory vector for gene therapy. The vector possesses dual functions of: 1) efficiently delivering a gene to target cells and 2) codelivering DNA and inflammatory suppressors into the immune cells where the released suppressor can inhibit cytokine production. The inflammatory suppressors successfully delivered by the vector included glucocorticoids, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), an NF-kappaB inhibitor, and a natural compound from an herbal medicine. Intravenous injection of the vector dramatically suppressed the cytokine production induced by CpG motif pDNA, including TNF-alpha, IL-12 and IFN-gamma. This new gene vector has a great potential in clinical gene therapy. Another potential use of the vector is codelivery of an enhancer candidate, acting at the transcriptional and translational levels to improve the efficiency of gene transfer by the nonviral vector. Moreover, the unique feature of this vector is that it can be used as an easy and powerful tool for in vivo screening of anti-inflammatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2015604190,"In normal cells p53 activity is tightly controlled and MDM2 is a known negative regulator. Here we show that via its acidic domain, Daxx binds to the COOH-terminal domain of p53, whose positive charges are critical for this interaction, as Lys to Arg mutations preserved, but Lys to Ala or Ser to Glu mutations abolished Daxx-p53 interaction. These results thus implicate acetylation and phosphorylation of p53 in regulating its binding to Daxx. Interestingly, whereas Daxx did not bind to p53 in cells as assessed by immunoprecipitation, MDM2 expression restored p53-Daxx interaction, and this correlated with deacetylation of p53. In p53/MDM2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DKO MEF), Daxx repressed p53 target promoters whose p53-binding elements were required for the repression. Coexpression of Daxx and MDM2 led to further repression. p53 expression in DKO MEF induced apoptosis and Daxx expression relieved this effect. Similarly, in HCT116 cells, Daxx conferred striking resistance to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. As p53 is required for 5-fluorouracil-induced cell death, our data show that Daxx can suppress cell death induced by p53 overexpression and p53-dependent stress response. Collectively, our data reveal Daxx as a novel negative regulator of p53. Importantly, posttranslational modifications of p53 inhibit Daxx-p53 interaction, thereby relieving negative regulation of p53 by Daxx.

Importantly, posttranslational modifications of p53 inhibit Daxx-p53 interaction, thereby relieving negative regulation of p53 by Daxx. The critical role of p53 in tumor suppression is manifested in frequent mutations of the p53 gene in cancers (∼50% of all human cancers) and in its inactivation in many other cancers by cellular or viral oncogenes and other epigenetic alterations (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). p53-deficient mice develop normally, although such mice exhibit higher incidence of tumors than their wild-type counterparts, demonstrating a critical role for p53 in suppressing tumors (2Donehower L.A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar). p53 exerts its tumor suppression function by activating expression of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis (3Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), and it can also induce apoptosis directly by binding to Bcl-2 family proteins and triggering cytochrome c release (5Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Inducing growth arrest and cell death by p53 can impact negatively on normal cell growth and organismal development. Indeed, deletion of the mdm2 gene, whose product is a negative regulator of p53, results in embryonic lethality, but deletion of both p53 and mdm2 simultaneously completely rescues such lethal phenotype (6Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 7Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 activity must be tightly controlled under physiological conditions. In addition to MDM2, numerous cellular and viral proteins interact with p53 and these proteins can positively or negatively modulate p53-mediated biological effects. Recently, we and others demonstrated that the transcriptional corepressor Daxx interacts with p53 (8Zhao L.Y. Colosimo A.L. Liu Y. Wan Y. Liao D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11809-11821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5356-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Ohiro Y.

Biol. 2003; 23: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the biological significance of this interaction remains to be explored. Daxx was initially identified as a binding protein of Fas death domain and was shown to potentiate Fas-mediated apoptosis (11Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies implicate Daxx in promoting apoptosis in diverse stress conditions (12Zhong S.

Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, homozygous deletion of the Daxx gene in mice results in embryonic lethality and widespread apoptosis was observed in Daxx-deficient embryos and cells (16Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating that Daxx has anti-apoptotic function and is critical for organismal development. The anti-apoptotic property of Daxx was confirmed in a recent study. Reducing Daxx expression by small interfering RNA sensitized apoptosis by multiple death stimuli (17Chen L.Y. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7108-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Biochemically, Daxx may act as a transcription regulator that can repress or activate transcription (18Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell.

Thus, Daxx might regulate cellular processes by modulating transcription of specific genes under different conditions. Daxx has been found to partition in large multiprotein complexes that include core histones and histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylases; DKO MEF, p53-/- mdm2-/- double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; IP, immunoprecipitation; CBP, CREB-binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP associated protein; TAD, transactivation domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; SD, synthetic dropout medium; aa, amino acid(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylases; DKO MEF, p53-/- mdm2-/- double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; IP, immunoprecipitation; CBP, CREB-binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP associated protein; TAD, transactivation domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; SD, synthetic dropout medium; aa, amino acid(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.

As Daxx associates directly with a number of DNA-binding transcription factors, including Pax3 and -5 (18Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G.

Virol. 2003; 77: 11809-11821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5356-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Ohiro Y. Usheva A. Kobayashi S. Duffy S.L. Nantz R. Gius D. Horikoshi N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is likely that Daxx represents a crucial link between DNA-binding factors and transcription regulatory complexes. Whereas this model might provide a framework for better understanding the roles of Daxx in apoptosis and other cellular mechanisms, it remains contentious regarding the biological significance of Daxx-p53 interaction. In particular, it was shown that tumor-derived p53 mutants, but not the wild-type protein, interacted with Daxx (10Ohiro Y. Usheva A. Kobayashi S. Duffy S.L. Nantz R. Gius D. Horikoshi N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We report here that both wild-type p53 and its mutants interacted effectively with Daxx in vitro. Daxx-p53 interaction was strongly influenced by posttranslational modifications of the p53 COOH-terminal regulatory domain. Cellular oncoprotein MDM2 enhances Daxx-p53 interaction in vivo. We also provide evidence that Daxx inhibited both p53 transcriptional and apoptotic activities. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Various DNA fragments spanning different regions of the Daxx open reading frame were fused either to the yeast Gal4 activation domain (TAD) in plasmid pGAD-C(x) or to Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) in plasmid pGBDU-C(x). Similarly, various WT and mutant p53 constructs were fused with Gal4 TAD. Yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted as described (25Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—The tumor cell lines HCT116, HCT116 p53-/- (26Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S.

Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with various DNA constructs using the Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen). Expression of Daxx in Insect Cells—The Daxx-coding sequence was cloned into the EcoRI site of pFastBacHTa (donor vector, Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus expressing Daxx was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac kit according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (25Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were infected with Daxx recombinant virus and harvested at 72 h postinfection. Daxx with the amino-terminal His6 tag was purified from the infected insect cells using nickel-nitrilotri-acetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) with binding and washing buffers containing 5 and 10 mm imidazole (Sigma), respectively. His-Daxx was eluted with buffer containing 0.2 m imidazole. Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma Igepal CA-630), 150 mm KCl) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (16 μg of benzamidin HCl/ml, 10 μg of phenanthroline/ml, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell suspension was frozen at -80 °C and thawed at room temperature. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was precleared with Protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by a 2-h incubation with Protein G-agarose. The antibody-conjugated beads were washed 4 times with Buffer B and then 1 time with RIPA (1% (w/w) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate), and finally resuspended in SDS gel loading buffer. In some experiments, FLAG-tagged proteins were precipitated using anti-FLAG antibody (M2) conjugated to agarose beads and the precipitated proteins were eluted using buffer B containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Previously published protocols were used (8Zhao L.Y. Colosimo A.L. Liu Y. Wan Y. Liao D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11809-11821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Zhao L.Y. Liao D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13171-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, DKO MEF cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the indicated plasmids and 24 h later were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were then incubated with blocking buffer (2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). After incubation with primary antibodies (anti-p53 (DO-1) or anti-MDM2 (SMP14 or N20), Santa Cruz, all 1:200 dilution), the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes. The cells were washed and mounted in medium VectorShields containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—DKO MEF (p53- and MDM2-deficient) cells were cultured in a 24-well plate. The luciferase reporter constructs pWAF1-Luc and pWAF1mut-Luc were described previously (28Zhao L.Y. Liu Y. Bertos N.R. Yang X.J. Liao D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8316-8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). p53AIP1-Luc contains the p53 DNA-binding elements within the intron 1 of the human p53AIP1 gene as described (29Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The control reporter carries the luciferase gene from the sea pansy (Promega). Reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into cells alone or with other plasmids as indicated in the figures. Transfected cells were harvested 24 h posttransfection and processed for dual luciferase assays (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against the sea pansy luciferase activity. Apoptosis Assay—HCT116 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids for GFP-CRM1 (marker), FLAG-Daxx, and MDM2. The amount of DNA in each transfection was balanced with empty expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1). Cell cultures were then treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (0.4 mm, final concentration) 12 h after transfection. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and mounted on antifade medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 24 h after transfection. Cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope and were considered apoptotic if they had condensed or fragmented nuclei that also exhibited rounded and shrunken morphology as revealed by the GFP-CRM1 marker. Five random fields under a ×20 objective were photographed. The green cells (total transfected cells) and apoptotic green cells were counted and percent of apoptotic cells was calculated. Stable Transfections and Flow Cytometry Analysis—HCT116 cells were transfected with FLAG-Daxx expression vector or empty vector (pcDNA3.1). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split and grown under G418 (0.6 mg/ml) selection until visible colonies appeared. Colony isolation and expansion were done as described previously (30Jiang C. Liao D. Genomics. 1999; 62: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Several independent clones were grown and either treated with Me2SO or 5-FU. Cells (both floating and adherent) were collected at specific time points after treatment and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells in suspension were fixed by adding an equal volume of cold (-20 °C) 100% ethanol for at least 1 h with intermittent pipetting for suspending the cells. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 300 × g and then resuspended in a solution with RNase A (0.5 mg/ml, final concentration) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then stained with propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Samples were analyzed with a FACSort instrument (BD Biosciences). Daxx Binds to p53 in Vitro—Because we have identified an interaction between Daxx and E1B 55-kDa oncoprotein and that Daxx and p53 colocalized in the nucleus in 293 cells (8Zhao L.Y. Colosimo A.L. Liu Y. Wan Y. Liao D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11809-11821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we wondered whether Daxx could also bind directly to p53. To detect a potential interaction between Daxx and p53, we first tested their interaction in vitro. When the extract of insect Sf9 cells expressing Daxx was mixed with purified WT p53, Daxx was precipitated along with p53 in an IP assay using DO-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Reciprocally, p53 was precipitated from the same mixture using anti-Daxx antibody M112 (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Yeast two-hybrid assays were used to map the regions required for Daxx-p53 interactions. As shown in Fig. 1, B–E, full-length Daxx (panel B, sector 1) and Daxx fragments lacking the COOH terminus (aa 1–501 and 1–574, sectors 7 and 10) specifically interacted with p53, but not other Daxx fragments (aa 516–740 (sector 4), 1–130, 129–396, and 621–740 (data not shown)). Deletion of the acidic domain (aa 434–496) from Daxx abolished its interaction with p53 (Fig. 1B, sector 15). Thus, Daxx sequence between 400 and 501 encompassing the acidic domain is required for binding to p53 (summarized in panel C). Conversely, p53 constructs with progressive deletions from the NH2 terminus up to residue 253 were able to bind to Daxx (sectors 1–4 in panel D). Further deletion from the NH2 terminus abolished p53-Daxx interaction (sectors 5 and 6, panel D). These deletion mutants were all well expressed in yeast (Fig. 1H, lanes 1–5). p53 NH2-terminal TAD (aa 1–145) and the DBD (aa 76–315) did not interact with Daxx (data not shown, see panel E). Point mutations in the p53 NH2 terminus (L22Q/W23S and K24T) did not affect Daxx-p53 interaction (panel F, sectors 6 and 7). Likewise, mutations in the core domain (V143A, R175H, R273H, “hot spots” of tumor-derived mutations, sectors 2, 3, and 5, panel F), except hot spot mutation R248W (sector 4), did not affect binding of p53 to Daxx (Fig. 1F). These p53 mutants were expressed at similar levels in yeast (Fig. 1H, lanes 13–18). The results contrast that from a recent report indicating that tumor-derived mutants, but not wild-type p53, interacted with Daxx (10Ohiro Y. Usheva A. Kobayashi S. Duffy S.L. Nantz R. Gius D. Horikoshi N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, COOH-terminal truncations of p53 abolished p53-Daxx interaction (aa 1–315 and 1–355, see Fig. 1G). Therefore, the p53 COOH-terminal regulatory domain is required for binding to Daxx, and mutations in the NH2 terminus or core domain do not affect binding of p53 to Daxx in yeast. The data also indicate that some part of the DBD of p53 may also be involved in binding to Daxx, as the Daxx-binding region maps to residues 253–385 in p53; this region includes part of the DBD and most of the COOH-terminal domain of p53. In the case of the p53 R248W mutant, it is possible that this mutation might alter the conformation of the COOH-terminal domain so that Daxx can no longer bind to p53. Positive Charges of the COOH-terminal Domain of p53 Are Critical for Daxx-p53 Interaction—The Daxx-binding region of p53 is important in regulating p53 activity. It was shown that this domain might negatively regulate the p53 transactivation function (31Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, it contains sites of acetylation by PCAF and p300/CBP as well as phosphorylation (32Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 33Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). To assess potential roles of acetylation and phosphorylation in regulating Daxx-p53 interaction, we mutated known and potential acetylation and phosphorylation sites within the Daxx-binding region of p53 and assayed the interaction of Daxx with such p53 mutants. As shown in Fig. 1G, any COOH-terminal truncation before residue 371 abolished Daxx-p53 interaction, whereas residues after 385 were dispensable for binding (sectors 2–5 in Fig. 1G). Mutation of any block of lysines surrounding PCAF (K320) and p300/CBP (Lys-372 and -381) acetylation sites (34Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar, 35Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) into positively charged arginine did not affect interaction (sectors 6–9, 12, and 35–38). Nonetheless, when all seven lysines at 319–321, 372, 373, 381, and 382 were changed into arginine (K7R), p53-Daxx interaction was notably reduced (sector 13). Significantly, Daxx-p53 interaction was abolished when any block of lysines were mutated into neutral residue alanine, which presumably mimics acetylated lysine (sectors 10, 14, 16, 18, and 20). Moreover, mutation of lysine residues into negatively charged glutamic acid also abolished Daxx-p53 interaction (sectors 11, 15, 17, 19, and 21). However, mutation of the potential phosphorylation sites into alanine did not affect Daxx-p53 interaction (sectors 25–29 in Fig. 1G). Strikingly, mutation of Ser-376 to glutamic acid that mimics phosphorylated residues severely inhibited the Daxx-p53 interaction (sectors 32 and 33), whereas similarly mutated Ser-392 did not affect p53-Daxx interaction (sector 31) (Ser-376 and Ser-392 are documented phosphorylation sites of p53 (32Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar)). All of the p53 constructs shown in Fig. 1G exhibited interaction with p300 in yeast two-hybrid assays (data not shown). In addition, we have examined expression of these p53 mutants in yeast and found that they were all expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1H). Thus, negative interaction results of some p53 mutants were because of specific mutations, not because of protein instability in yeast. Collectively, these results indicate that positive charges in the p53 COOH terminus play a critical role in mediating Daxx-p53 interaction, but lysine is preferred over arginine for this binding, indicating that Daxx-p53 interaction is specific and is not purely mediated by opposite static electric charges. Because mutation of either PCAF or p300/CBP acetylation sites into alanine is sufficient to inhibit Daxx-p53 interaction, acetylation by either acetylase could potentially block the binding of Daxx to p53. In addition, phosphorylation within the Daxx-binding region of p53 may also inhibit binding of Daxx to p53. Therefore both acetylation and phosphorylation might dissociate Daxx from p53. MDM2 Restored Daxx-p53 Interaction in the Cell—Previous attempts by us and others to recover Daxx-p53 interaction in cell extracts by immunoprecipitation were unsuccessful (10Ohiro Y. Usheva A. Kobayashi S. Duffy S.L. Nantz R. Gius D. Horikoshi N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2L. Y. Zhao, J. Liu, G. S. Sidhu, Y. Niu, Y. Liu, F. Wang, and D. Liao, unpublished data. Because Daxx-p53 interaction was readily detected using recombinant Daxx and p53 purified from insect cells as well as in yeast (Fig. 1), posttranslationally modified p53 in the cell might prevent p53 from binding to Daxx. Indeed, Daxx purified from insect Sf9 cells does not bind to p53 purified from cultured human cells (data not shown). If acetylation of p53 inhibits Daxx-p53 interaction, overexpression of proteins that influence acetylation of p53 might affect binding of Daxx to p53. HDAC1 has been found to deacetylate p53 (37Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Likewise, MDM2 inhibits p53 acetylation (38Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar) and also facilitates HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of p53 (39Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). To assess whether these proteins might affect Daxx-p53 interaction, FLAG-Daxx (aa 1–574) was cotransfected into p53-deficient HCT116 cells along with various combinations of p53, MDM2, and HDAC1. Expression of p53, Daxx, HDAC1, and MDM2 in transfected cells was determined by Western blot (Fig. 2A). The cell extracts were then subjected to IP using anti-FLAG M2 beads. Strikingly, only in the presence of transfected MDM2 was Daxx-p53 interaction restored (lanes 6 and 10, Fig. 2B). We then examined the status of p53 acetylation in cell extracts. Approximately equal amounts of p53 protein was loaded (Fig. 2C) and the rabbit antiserum that recognizes p53 acetylated at Lys-373 and -382 was used to detect acetylated p53. As shown in Fig. 2C, the presence of MDM2 resulted in deacetylation of p53 (compares lanes 2 and 4 with other lanes), suggesting that MDM2 might restore Daxx-p53 interaction at least in part by inhibiting p53 acetylation. Sequence Determinants of Daxx-p53 Interaction in the Cell—Having shown that MDM2 is critical for Daxx-p53 interaction in the cell, we wished to determine what sequences of Daxx are required for binding to p53 in vivo. Various Daxx constructs with the NH2-terminal FLAG tag were cotransfected with vectors for p53 and MDM2 into p53-null HCT116 cells and expression of these proteins in the transfected cells was examined (Fig. 3A). The cell extracts were subjected to IP with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads and the coprecipitated proteins were analyzed using anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 3B). Full-length Daxx led to abundant p53 coprecipitation (lanes 1 and 2). Daxx constructs aa 1–574, 1–501, and a construct with deletion of aa 191–242 (a putative amphipathic helix (18Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar)) bound to p53 less effectively than wild-type Daxx (lanes 4, 6, and 10). In addition, the Daxx construct with a deletion between aa 502 and 574 exhibited weak binding to p53 (Fig. 3B, lane 16). The Daxx NH2-terminal domain (aa 1–130) and the COOH-terminal constructs (aa 516–740 and 573–740) did not bind to p53. These results indicate that the acidic domain of Daxx is required for binding to p53, consistent with the results obtained from yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1). To examine whether MDM2 was present in the same FLAG-Daxx immunocomplexes, the same membrane shown in Fig. 3B was stripped and reprobed with anti-MDM2 antibody. MDM2 was coprecipitated with WT Daxx and its fragments (aa 1–574 and 1–502, Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Evidently, more MDM2 was precipitated with WT Daxx than with the two Daxx fragment"
https://openalex.org/W2035480642,"Caspase activation and apoptosis are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In view of the finding that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes caspase-mediated cleavage in the cytoplasmic region, we analyzed amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) production in human neuronal and nonneuronal cells expressing wild-type APP and the caspase-cleaved form of APP (APPDeltaC). Biochemical analyses, including immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry, revealed that APPDeltaC-expressing cells secrete increased levels of amino-terminally truncated Abeta5-40/42 and reduced levels of Abeta1-40/42, compared with wild-type APP-expressing cells. We propose that Abeta5-40/42 is derived from alternative beta-cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase-like protease(s), based on data from treatment of cells with inhibitors of BACE and alpha-secretase. Apoptosis induction resulted in this alternative cleavage of APP in wild-type APP-expressing cells. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of the AD brain with an end-specific antibody to Abeta5-40/42 revealed peptide deposits in vascular lesions with amyloid angiopathy. The data collectively suggest that caspase cleavage of APP leads to increased production and deposition of Abeta5-40/42 in the AD brain, and highlight the significance of amino-truncated Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD."

In contrast, the calcium-activated, cyclosporine A-regulated MPT in rat liver mitochondria was also blocked with inhibitors of cytochrome bc1.

Mitochondrial function, including ion transport, biogenesis, and ATP formation, requires an intact mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), which depends upon the generation of an electrochemical proton gradient (ΔμH+) across the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Although many studies have considered that the MPT is due to the formation of a preformed pore complex between the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes involving the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the voltage-dependent anion channel, cyclophilin D (CyD), and a number of accessory proteins (11Crompton M.

J. 2002; 367: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), an alternative view has been that the MPT is not the result of opening of a preformed pore, but the result of increased membrane permeability caused by oxidative damage to pre-existing membrane proteins including the ANT (8Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 9Fagian M.M. Pereira-da-Silva L. Martins I.S. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19955-19960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CsA inhibits the MPT has been attributed to its inhibitory effect on the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of CyD, which is believed to be required for the formation of an ANT/CyD protein complex required for MPT activation (14Woodfield K Ruck A Brdiczka D.

However, this MPT model has been questioned by a report showing that when CyD was overexpressed and targeted to mitochondria, it protected cells from oxidants, indicating that it was inhibiting rather than activating the MPT (18Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although in direct contrast to this Li et al. (19Li Y. Johnson N. Capano M. Edwards M. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) recently found that overexpression of mitochondrial CyD rendered mitochondria more susceptible to the MPT and cells more sensitive to oxidant-mediated injury. The controversy concerning the role of the ANT and CyD in the MPT is further compounded, first, by the recent finding that the MPT was found to be inducible in mitochondria taken from the livers of mice with genetically inactivated ANT isoforms (20Kokoszka J.E. Waymire K.G. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Cai J. Jones D.P. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), and second, although CsA blocks the MPT in some cases, it is ineffective at MPT inhibition in others (21Yang J.H. Gross R.L. Basinger S.F. Wu S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1655-1664PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sultan A. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This led He and Lemasters (23He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 24He L. Lemasters J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16755-16760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to propose an alternative model of the MPT that would account for some of these inconsistencies (9Fagian M.M. Pereira-da-Silva L. Martins I.S. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19955-19960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Their model envisaged both a “CsA-regulated” and an “unregulated” form of MPT based on a study showing two possible conductance modes for the MPT. One mode was activated by Ca2+ and inhibited by CsA, and the other was unregulated. The dualistic model of He and Lemasters (23He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 24He L. Lemasters J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16755-16760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) thus reconciles two apparently divergent ideas on the MPT where both the ANT and CyD play an important regulatory role. However, other investigators have considered models of MPT that may involve the ANT and CyD but feature mitochondrial respiratory components other than the ANT as crucial MPT regulators; for example, the work of Fontaine and co-workers (25Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Whereas we have previously shown that mitochondrial ROS activates the MPT in vivo after GSH depletion and proposed the redox target(s) include the ANT (28Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1263-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These varied and somewhat controversial reports on the molecular composition and regulation of the MPT indicate that definitive knowledge on this phenomenon is lacking and suggest that concerted efforts should be made to advance our understanding of this crucial mitochondrial event associated with cell death. In this study we show that cytochrome bc1 is a key regulatory component of the MPT in rat liver mitochondria (RLM) and in leukemic CEM and HL60 cells. Our results indicate a fundamental role for ISP subunit movement in ROS-mediated MPT activation in cells, whereas investigations with RLM indicate that cytochrome bc1 may possess a MPT channel-like function, suggesting that cytochrome bc1 is involved in two distinct pathways to the MPT. Materials—All of the chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma. Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bongkrekic acid (BgK) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Stigmatellin was obtained from Fluka Biochemika, and 2-methoxy antimycin A3 (2-MeAA) was obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories. Cell Culture—CEM and HL60 cells (HL60 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 protein were used because of their sensitivity and reproducibility to GSH-induced redox stress (28Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P.

Whiteman M. Rose P. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49079-49084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were passaged daily to maintain them in log phase and kept at a concentration between 2.5-5 × 105/ml. Mitochondrial Isolation and Swelling Test—RLM were isolated by conventional differential centrifugation from the livers of male adult Sprague-Dawley rats fasted overnight. Large amplitude swelling was measured by spectrophotometry in a Beckman DU 640 by recording absorbance change at 540 nm. Isolated rat liver mitochondria (∼1 mg/ml) were suspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer consisting of mannitol (220 mm), sucrose (70 mm), Hepes (2 mm), EGTA (0.5 mm), and bovine serum albumin (0.1%) for all experiments. Measurement of GSH—The CEM cells were treated with diethyl maleate (5 mm) for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. GSH levels were measured by the monochlorobimane method (30Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The amount of acid-insoluble protein was determined by the Bradford method with γ-globulin as a standard. Measurement of ROS Production—After treatment with DEM (1 mm) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min, the cells were stained with 10 μm DCFDA for 15 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm glucose, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using WinMidi software. DCFDA is a nonfluorescent ester of the dye fluorescein. DCFDA is cleaved by intracellular esterases and entrapped within the cell as the oxidant-sensitive dichlorofluorescein. ROS oxidize DCF to the fluorescent product fluorescein (31Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). The green fluorescence of fluorescein was measured using the FL-2 setting (log mode) after the cell debris was electronically gated out. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—ΔΨm was measured with the fluorescent lipophilic cationic dye TMRM (250 nm) that accumulates within mitochondria according to the ΔΨm. After treatment with DEM for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, the cells were stained with TMRM for 15 min, and red fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using the FL-3 setting. The protonophore CCCP (10 μm) was used to dissipate the chemiosmotic proton gradient (ΔμH+) and served as a control for loss of ΔΨm. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Electron Microscopic Examination of Cells—HL60 or CEM cells in the logarithmic proliferation phase were treated with DEM (5 mm) with or without the respiratory complex inhibitors stigmatellin (5 μm), antimycin A (5 μm), or 2-MeAA (5 μm) as described in the figure legends. The cells were 1) fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h, 2) washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetraoxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, and 3) dehydrated with graded series of ethanol and embedded in LX112. Thin sections were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate. Specimens were examined on a JEOL 1000× electron microscope operating at 80 KV. Cytochrome bc1 Activity Measurements—Cytochrome bc1 activity in CEM cells was determined as described previously (29Armstrong J.S. Whiteman M. Rose P. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49079-49084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytochrome bc1 complex activity from digitonin-permeabilized and sonicated CEM and HL60 cell fractions were assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1% (w/v) and 0.01% Tween 20 at 23 °C, using 50 μm 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol (decylubiquinol) as substrate and 50 μm cytochrome c. Decylubiquinonol was synthesized in the laboratory from decylubiquinone by reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) (31Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of cytochrome c was monitored in a spectrophotometer at 550 versus 539 nm in dual wavelength mode. The data are expressed as percentages of control activity and were determined from five individual isolations that were assayed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for unpaired data, and p values <0.05 were considered significant. The data are presented as means ± S.E. GSH Depletion Mediates ROS Increase in CEM and HL60 Cells That Is Decreased by Inhibition of Cytochrome bc1—Fig. 1A shows representative ROS production, and Fig. 1B shows mean ROS production, respectively, in CEM cells after treatment with 5 mm DEM with or without the respiratory complex inhibitors. Increased DCF fluorescence, a measure of ROS production (29Armstrong J.S. Whiteman M. Rose P. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49079-49084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Armstrong J.S. Whiteman M. Yang H. Jones D.P. Sternberg P. IOVS. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), was determined by a shift in DCF fluorescence to the right after DEM treatment (Fig. 1A, panel 1). The figures show that DEM treatment causes a time-dependent increase in ROS production. GSH levels were determined on aliquots of CEM cells treated with 5 mm DEM. Fig. 1B (inset) shows that a time-dependent loss of GSH occurs in CEM cells after cells were treated with 5 mm DEM. Approximately 90% of GSH is lost after DEM treatment for 30 min, at which time ROS increase occurs (Fig. 1B). The Distal Ubiquinol Oxidation Site of Cytochrome bc1 Is the Predominant Site of ROS Production after GSH Depletion—To determine the major mitochondrial site of ROS production after GSH depletion in CEM cells, we pharmacologically inhibited respiratory complex I (NADH ubiquinone-dehydrogenase), respiratory complex II (succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)), and respiratory complex III (cytochrome bc1) because these respiratory sites are well known to be involved in mitochondrial ROS production (33Boveris A.

The cells were co-incubated with DEM with either rotenone (5 μm), thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) (5 μm), stigmatellin (5 μm), myxothiazol (5 μm), antimycin A, and 2-MeAA (control for antimycin A, which does not inhibit respiration). Rotenone selectively blocks NADH ubiquinone-dehydrogenase (37Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), TTFA blocks SDH (38Ramsay R.R. Ackrell B.A. Coles C.J. Singer T.P. White G.A. Thorn G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), stigmatellin and myxothiazol block the ubiquinol oxidation (Qo) site of cytochrome bc1 at the distal and proximal niches, respectively (39Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and antimycin A blocks the ubiquinol reduction Qi site of cytochrome bc1 (33Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 34Lenaz G. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Myxothiazol, which binds to the proximal niche of the Qo ubiquinol oxidation site of cytochrome bc1, and antimycin A, which binds to the Qi site, inhibited ROS formation (Fig. 1A, panels 2 and 4), whereas stigmatellin, which binds to the distal niche of the Qo site, completely blocked DEM-mediated ROS increase (Fig. 1A, panel 3). The experiment with stigmatellin was extended up to 90 min, but we did not observe any increase in ROS production (data not shown). To confirm that antimycin A inhibited ROS production, we used the structural analog 2-MeAA as a control (this compound does not inhibit respiration) (40Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y. Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). 2-MeAA did not inhibit ROS production in DEM-treated CEM cells compared with antimycin A (Fig. 1A, panel 5). Rotenone and TTFA did not significantly alter ROS increase compared with DEM treatment alone (Fig. 1A, panels 6 and 7). These results indicate that the Qo distal site of cytochrome bc1 is a key source of ROS production because its inhibition abolished ROS production. However, because inhibition of the proximal Qo and the Qi sites of cytochrome bc1 also reduced ROS production, this further implicates the cytochrome bc1 as a key ROS-generating site in our experimental setting. An identical set of experiments was performed using HL60 cells with similar results (data not shown). Cytochrome bc1 Activity Required for ROS Production after GSH Depletion—The role of cytochrome bc1 in ROS production in CEM cells was confirmed by determining cytochrome bc1 activity in isolated membrane fractions from CEM cells incubated with DEM, DEM + stigmatellin, DEM + myxothiazol, DEM + rotenone, DEM + TTFA, DEM + antimycin A, and DEM + 2-MeAA. Fig. 1C shows means ± S.E. percentage activity of cytochrome bc1 in CEM cells treated with DEM with or without respiratory inhibitors. The results show that cytochrome bc1 enzyme activity was not significantly different in CEM cells treated with DEM with or without rotenone, TTFA, or 2-MeAA compared with controls, whereas the compounds stigmatellin, myxothiazol, and antimycin A inhibited cytochrome bc1 enzyme activity ∼95%. ROS Production by Cytochrome bc1 Mediates Cell Death by Activation of the MPT—ΔΨm was determined in CEM cells, after treatment with DEM (5 mm) to deplete GSH, by monitoring the fluorescence of the cationic potentiometric dye TMRM. Fig. 2A shows representative TMRM flow cytometric histograms of the CEM cell population monitored every 30 min for 150 min with or without the inhibitors used in the ROS experiments. Loss of ΔΨm is indicated by a shift left of the cell population on the x axis of the histogram (log scale). Fig. 2B shows the percentage (mean ± S.E.) of CEM cells with intact ΔΨm after treatment with DEM with or without inhibitors. Fig. 2A shows that the cytochrome bc1 inhibitors stigmatellin (5 μm) (panel 3) and antimycin A (5 μm) (panel 4) and the ANT inhibitor BgK (50 μm) (panel 8) blocked the loss of ΔΨm after GSH depletion (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas rotenone (panel 7), TTFA (panel 6), and the antimycin A analog 2-MEAA (panel 5) did not prevent the loss of ΔΨm. Surprisingly, myxothiazol (Fig. 2, A, panel 2, and B, top panel), which reduced ROS production, did not prevent DEM-mediated loss of ΔΨm; paradoxically, this inhibitor increased the rate of loss of ΔΨm compared with DEM treatment alone. The classical MPT inhibitor CyA did not inhibit the loss of ΔΨm induced by GSH depletion, even at concentrations up to 10 μm (data not shown). Inhibition of Cytochrome bc1 with Stigmatellin or Antimycin A Protects Mitochondrial Ultrastructure in Response to GSH Depletion—To confirm the protective effect of stigmatellin and antimycin A on mitochondrial integrity, electron microscopy (EM) was performed to visualize mitochondrial ultrastructure after GSH depletion. Fig. 2C shows representative electron micrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure in control cells (top left panel), cells treated with DEM for 150 min (top right panel), cells treated with DEM for 150 min with 5 μm stigmatellin (bottom left panel), and cells treated with DEM for 150 min with 5 μm antimycin A (bottom right panel). The figure indicates that stigmatellin and antimycin A preserved mitochondrial ultrastructure structure compared with DEM treatment alone. Structural and functional studies were also performed using the HL60 B cell line to determine whether the results observed with CEM cells were a general or cell-specific phenomenon. HL60 cells were treated with DEM (5 mm), and EM and ΔΨm values were determined every 30 min for a total of 150 min. The results show a time-dependent loss of ΔΨm that corresponds with significant ultrastructural changes in mitochondria. At 150 min, mitochondrial ultrastructure in HL60 cells was similar to that observed in CEM cells, including increased electron opacity of mitochondrial inner membrane and cristae. These structural changes were prevented by coincubation of cells with DEM and stigmatellin or antimycin A but not with 2-MeAA (Fig. 3C). Cytochrome bc1 Inhibition Is Required for Protection against ROS-mediated Cell Death—Because inhibition of cytochrome bc1 prevented loss of ΔΨm, we determined cell viability after incubation of CEM cells with 5 mm DEM with or without 5 μm of cytochrome bc1 inhibitors (stigmatellin, antimycin A and myxothiazol) or cyclosporin A (1-10 μm). Cell viability was performed every 30 min for 150 min using trypan blue exclusion. Cells treated with either DEM alone or DEM with rotenone, TTFA, or 2-MeAA lost cell viability over a similar time, whereas BgK prevented the loss of cell viability (Fig. 4A). Of the cytochrome bc1 inhibitors, stigmatellin blocked the loss of cell viability induced by DEM, and antimycin A reduced the rate at which cells died, whereas myxothiazol did not prevent the loss of cell viability (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the inhibition of ROS formation by stigmatellin or antimycin A protects against redox-dependent cell death. BgK, also prevented the loss of cell viability; however, myothiazol, which reduced ROS production but did not preserve ΔΨm after GSH depletion, did not prevent the loss of cell viability. CyA, even over a range of concentrations (1-20 μm), did not prevent the loss of cell viability after GSH depletion (data not shown). Cell death was not inhibited by broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone or the caspase 3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO, suggesting that the predominant death pathway was by necrosis (data not shown). Inhibition of Cytochrome bc1 Blocks the Ca2+-activated MPT in RLM—Because inhibition of cytochrome bc1 prevented the redox-activated MPT in cells in situ, we determined whether inhibition of cytochrome bc1 would also prevent the MPT induced by Ca2+ in RLM. Fig. 5A shows a representative example of the effect of different respiratory complex inhibitors on the Ca2+ activated MPT in RLM. Stigmatellin (1 μm, trace a) and rotenone (1 μm, trace b) completely prevented mitochondrial swelling induced by 100 μm Ca2+ with similar potency as CsA (1 μm, trace c). TTFA did not prevent mitochondrial swelling (trace d). Fig. 5B shows a representative example of the effects of antimycin A (1 and 10 μm, traces a and c, respectively) and myxothiazol (1 μm, trace b) on the Ca2+ activated MPT in RLM. Fig. 5B (trace d) shows the effect of 2-MeAA on Ca2+-induced swelling of RLM; this trace also represents the profile of RLM swelling induced by Ca2+ alone. These results indicate that electron flux through cytochrome bc1 and the NADH:ubiquinine dehydrogenase regulates the Ca2+-activated MPT in RLM. In this study we show that mammalian cytochrome bc1 is a key regulator of the MPT in CEM and HL60 cells and RLM. In cells, mitochondrial ROS generated during ISP movement at the Qo site of cytochrome bc1 activates the MPT, which is insensitive to CsA and results in necrosis. In contrast, in RLM the MPT is activated by Ca2+ load and is blocked by inhibitors of the Qo site of cytochrome bc1 but is sensitive to CsA. These results indicate that cytochrome bc1 plays a key role in regulation of the regulated MPT in RLM and the unregulated MPT in cells. DEM was used to deplete cellular GSH and induce redox stress in CEM and HL60 cells as previously shown (28Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1263-1265Crossr"

In this study we characterize ATP hydrolysis by human MRP4 expressed in insect cells. MRP4 hydrolyzes ATP (Km, 0.62 mm), which is inhibited by orthovanadate and beryllium fluoride. However, unlike ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, which is equally sensitive to both inhibitors, MRP4-ATPase is more sensitive to beryllium fluoride than to orthovanadate. 8-Azido[α-32P]ATP binds to MRP4 (concentration for half-maximal binding ∼3 μm) and is displaced by ATP or by its non-hydrolyzable analog AMPPNP (concentrations for half-maximal inhibition of 13.3 and 308 μm). MRP4 substrates, the prostaglandins E1 and E2, stimulate ATP hydrolysis 2- to 3-fold but do not affect the Km for ATP. Several other substrates, azidothymidine, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, and methotrexate do not stimulate ATP hydrolysis but inhibit prostaglandin E2-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. Although both post-hydrolysis transition states MRP4·8-azido[α-32P]ADP·Vi and MRP4·8-azido[α-32P]ADP·beryllium fluoride can be generated, nucleotide trapping is ∼4-fold higher with beryllium fluoride. The divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ support comparable levels of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and trapping. However, Co2+ increases 8-azido[α-32P]ATP binding and beryllium fluoride-induced 8-azido[α-32P]ADP trapping but does not support steady-state ATP hydrolysis. ADP inhibits basal and prostaglandin E2-stimulated ATP hydrolysis (concentrations for half-maximal inhibition 0.19 and 0.25 mm, respectively) and beryllium fluoride-induced 8-azido[α-32P]ADP trapping, whereas Pi has no effect up to 20 mm. In aggregate, our results demonstrate that MRP4 exhibits substrate-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and we propose a kinetic scheme suggesting that ADP release from the post-hydrolysis transition state may be the rate-limiting step during the catalytic cycle.

Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 2Kruh G.D. Belinsky M.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7537-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The MRP family of ABC transporters consists of at least nine members (3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). MRP1, the first member of this family to be characterized (4Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar), transports a range of anticancer drugs out of cells and has been implicated in multidrug resistance (MDR). The preferred substrates for MRP1 are organic anions, e.g. drugs conjugated to glutathione, glucuronate, or sulfate (5Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 6Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Natl.

Biomembr. 2001; 33: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similarly, MRP2 and to a lesser extent MRP3 have also been implicated in MDR (substrates and resistance profiles have been reviewed in Refs. 3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar and 5Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The MRPs fall into two groups on the basis of the degree of amino acid identity and predicted topology of the full-length proteins (3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 6Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP6, and MRP7 all have an extra N-terminal domain (often indicated as TMD0), whereas MRP4, MRP5, MRP8, and MRP9 do not possess the TMD0 (3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 8Bera T.K. Iavarone C. Kumar V. Lee S. Lee B. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6997-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, the former group has a higher amino acid identity with MRP1 (45–58% overall; 61–74% nucleotide binding folds). Nonetheless all MRPs are more homologous to each other than to P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1, and MDR1) or other subclasses of ABC transport proteins (2Kruh G.D. Belinsky M.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7537-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr.

Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar).MRP4 (ABCC4) has garnered a great deal of attention in recent years, because it was demonstrated that this transporter can function as a cellular efflux pump for the anti-human immunodeficiency virus drugs 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) and azidothymidine monophosphate in PMEA-resistant cells (9Schuetz J.D.

High levels of MRP4 severely impair the antiviral efficacy of several nucleoside analogs (10Adachi M. Reid G. Schuetz J.D. Adv. Drug Deliver. Rev. 2002; 54: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, MRP4 has also been implicated in the MgATP-energized transport of cAMP and cGMP (11Wielinga P.R. van der Heijden I.

Reid G. Schuetz J.D. Adv. Drug Deliver. Rev. 2002; 54: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MRP4 does not appear to confer resistance to natural product anticancer agents, although it does appear to confer resistance to the widely used antimetabolite methotrexate (13Chen Z.S. Lee K. Walther S. Raftogianis R.B. Kuwano M. Zeng H. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3144-3150PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, Reid and coworkers (14Reid G. Wielinga P. Zelcer N. van der Heijden I. Kuil A. de Haas M. Wijnholds J. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9244-9249Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that prostaglandins E1 and E2 (PGE1 and PGE2) are transported by MRP4. This suggests a unique and important physiological role for MRP4. Prostaglandins are involved in inflammatory responses (15Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Inflamm. Res. 1998; 47: S78-S87Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and recent studies have suggested that prostaglandins are overexpressed in several tumors (16Sheng H.M. Shao J.Y. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 17Adam L. Mazumdar A. Sharma T. Jones T.R. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of prostaglandins is central to the management of many disease conditions, and the inhibition of the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 has been the principal pharmaceutical approach (18Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar, 19Warner T.D. Mitchell J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9108-9110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The prostaglandins exert their influence outside the cells where they are produced, and the existence of specific energy-dependent pumps involved in their efflux offers unique mechanistic insights and potential drug targets.The reports described above suggest that the putative substrates of MRP4 have interesting physiological effects. There are, however, discrepancies in results from different laboratories vis à vis the primary role of MRP4 and its physiological substrate (see for example Ref. 11Wielinga P.R. van der Heijden I.

Resolving these and other issues necessitates an understanding of the transport mechanism(s). The catalytic cycle and the ATP sites of Pgp and MRP1 have been studied in considerable detail (3Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Curr.

A striking difference between Pgp- and MRP1-mediated ATP hydrolysis is that while the two ATP sites of Pgp are essentially symmetric (25Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), those of MRP1 do not appear to be symmetrical (24Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol.

These findings are consistent with the fact that the two ATP sites of MRP1 are more divergent than those of most ABC transport proteins (4Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar). We have previously reported (28Sauna Z.E. Peng X.H. Nandigama K. Tekle S. Ambudkar S.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that MRP4-mediated ATP hydrolysis, similar to Pgp and MRP1, is sensitive to disulfiram, a drug clinically used to treat alcoholism (29Chick J. Drug Safety. 1999; 20: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which is also an MDR modulator (28Sauna Z.E. Peng X.H. Nandigama K. Tekle S. Ambudkar S.V. Mol.

However, the kinetics of MRP4 ATPase activity, modulation of the activity by transport substrates and the transition-state intermediates has not yet been characterized.We demonstrate an MRP4-mediated, divalent cation-dependent, orthovanadate (Vi)- and beryllium fluoride (BeFx)-sensitive ATP hydrolysis that shows Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The ATP hydrolysis is affected by putative transport substrates of MRP4, and of all the potential substrates tested, the prostaglandins showed the largest stimulation of MRP4-mediated ATP hydrolysis (3- to 4-fold). Moreover, we found a close correlation between these results and previous transport studies to identify substrates of MRP4. The Km values reported for transport of PGE1 and PGE2 are 2.1 and 3.4 μm, whereas the concentrations required for half-maximal stimulation of ATP hydrolysis reported in the present study were 12.15 and 2.9 μm. Using either Vi or BeFx, it was possible to obtain the post-hydrolysis transition states, MRP4·Mg2+-8-azido[α-32P]-ADP·Vi/BeFx. Based on our data, we present a kinetic scheme for MRP4-mediated ATP hydrolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—[α-32P]8-azidoATP (5–10 Ci/mmol) and 8-azidoATP were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc.

The MRP4 cDNA was cloned into the pDest-8 baculovirus vector, and the cloned gene was sequenced in both directions. The sequence of MRP4 in pDest vector was found to be identical to that published (33Lee K. Belinsky M.G. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2741-2747PubMed Google Scholar).

Total protein was estimated using the Amido Black protein method of Schaffner and Weissmann (35Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Crude membranes (10 μg per lane) were electrophoresed on a 7% NuPAGE precast gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Colloidal blue (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following Western blotting to nitrocellulose paper, crude membranes (5 μg of protein/lane) were probed with the polyclonal anti-MRP4 antibody (Kamiya) at a dilution of 1:1000 (9Schuetz J.D.

Following centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min in an RC-M120EX micro-ultracentrifuge (Sorvall, Newtown, CT), the pellet was resuspended in the MgCl2-free ATPase assay buffer containing 10% glycerol and stored at –70 °C. These membranes were used to study [α-32P]8-azidoATP binding, BeFx-induced [α-32P]8-azidoADP trapping, and ATP hydrolysis as described below.ATPase Assays—ATPase activity of MRP4 in crude membranes (10 μg of protein per assay) was measured by the end-point Pi assay as previously described (31Ramachandra M.

MRP4-specific activity was recorded as the Vi- or BeFx-sensitive ATPase activity. The assay measured the amount of Pi released over 20 min at 37 °C in the ATPase assay buffer (50 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2). The assay was carried out under basal conditions or in the presence of putative substrates or modulators. The reaction was initiated with 5 mm ATP and quenched with SDS (2.5% final concentration); the amount of Pi released was quantified using a colorimetric method (31Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D.

The samples were then illuminated with a UV lamp (365 nm) assembly (PGC Scientifics, Gaithersburg, MD) for 10 min on ice. Ice-cold ATP (12.5 mm) was added to displace excess non-covalently bound radionucleotides. Excess unbound nucleotides were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min by using an S120-AT2 rotor in an RC-M120EX micro-ultracentrifuge (Sorvall), and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following electrophoresis on a 7% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) at constant voltage, gels were dried and exposures were made to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) at –70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the MRP4 band was quantified using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences) and the software ImageQuaNT.Vanadate or BeFx-induced 8-Azido[α-32P]ADP Trapping in MRP4 —The MRP4·8-azidoADP·Vi or MRP4·8-azidoADP·BeFx transition states were generated as described previously for Pgp (38Sauna Z.E.

Crude membranes (50 μg of protein per assay) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer containing 50 μm 8-azido[α-32P]ATP (4–6 μCi/nmol) and either 250 μm Vi or 0.2 mm BeSO4 plus 2.5 mm NaF in the dark for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 12.5 mm ice-cold ATP and placing the sample immediately on ice. The samples were then cross-linked by UV illumination, electrophoresed, and analyzed as described above.RESULTSExpression and Identification of Human MRP4 (ABCC4) in High Five Insect Cells—Human MRP4 cDNA was cloned into the pDest-8 baculovirus vector (Invitrogen), and the recombinant virus was used to infect High Five insect cells at an multiplicity of infection of 5. The insect cells were harvested ∼48–54 h post-infection with >70% cell viability, and crude membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis as described previously (34Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Crude membranes prepared from insect cells overexpressing MDR1, MRP1, or MRP4 all showed the presence of overexpressed protein on a Colloidal Blue-stained gel (Fig. 1A). The putative MRP4 band migrated at an apparent molecular mass of ∼150 kDa, similar to the predicted molecular mass. Moreover, immunoblot analysis of crude membranes from MRP4-infected insect cells, with the anti-MRP4 polyclonal antibody, demonstrated that MRP4 was efficiently expressed in the baculovirus heterologous expression system (Fig. 1B). In addition, the anti-MRP4 antibody did not detect any protein in crude membranes prepared with insect cells infected with control baculovirus or those infected with human the MDR1or MRP1 cDNA (Fig. 1B).8-Azido[α-32P]ATP Binds to Human MRP4 —Many laboratories have implicated MRP4 in the MgATP-dependent transport of several physiological substrates such as cyclic nucleotides, steroid conjugates, folates, and the PGE1 and PGE2 (6Borst P.

However, ATP hydrolysis activity attributable to MRP4 and the characteristics of nucleotide binding to the ATP sites have not been studied. Specific binding of nucleotides at the ATP site(s) is a prerequisite for catalysis, and the photoaffinity analog of ATP, 8-azido[α-32P]ATP, has been extensively used to probe the nucleotide binding sites of ABC transporters (24Hou Y.X.

The photocross-linked 8-azido[α-32P]ATP colocalizes with MRP4 as identified by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Moreover, the binding of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP to MRP4 is completely inhibited by ATP. Control insect cells infected with baculovirus alone did not show the 8-azido[α-32P]ATP-labeled band. We also show that the binding of [α-32P]8azidoATP to MRP4 is saturable and that the concentration required for half-maximal binding is 2.9 μm (Fig. 2B). The non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, AMPPNP, is a useful tool that can be exploited to distinguish the effects of nucleotide binding versus nucleotide hydrolysis (38Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc.

Both ATP and AMPPNP inhibit the binding of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP to MRP4 (Fig. 2C), although the concentrations required for 50% inhibition differ by an order of magnitude (13.3 μm for ATP and 308.2 μm for AMPPNP). The fact that AMPPNP has a lower affinity for MRP4 than ATP is consistent with previous findings with Pgp (36Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol.

Because crude membranes were used in the ATPase assay, we measured MRP4-mediated ATP hydrolysis in the presence of ouabain, EGTA, and sodium azide to eliminate Na+, K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and mitochondrial ATPase activities. We found a significant ATPase activity that was sensitive to both Vi and BeFx (Fig. 3, A and B). Although BeFx shows >95% inhibition, Vi inhibits the ATP hydrolysis by 40%. BeSO4 or NaF alone did not inhibit ATP hydrolysis (inset to Fig. 3B). Thus, in the presence of excess NaF, concentration-dependent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by BeSO4 allowed an estimation of the concentration required for half-max"
https://openalex.org/W2072202883,"In neurons, the selective translocation of Tau mRNA toward axons is due to the presence of a nucleotide sequence located in its 3' untranslated region and serving as axonal targeting element. Using this RNA sequence as a probe by a Northwestern approach, we have detected several proteins that interact with the targeting RNA element and could potentially be involved in Tau mRNA translocation, translation halting, and/or stabilization. Among them, two proteins were identified as the interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (Ilf3) and NF90, two isoforms derived from a single gene product through alternative splicing. Each protein comprises two double-stranded RNA binding motifs that can interact with the predicted stem-loop secondary structure of the axonal targeting element. Specific antibodies raised against common or specific peptide sequences showed that both Ilf3 and NF90 are polymorphic proteins that are detected in neuronal nuclei and cell bodies, as well as in the proximal neuritic segments. This observation favors the idea that Ilf3 and NF90 are part of a protein complex that escorts Tau mRNA toward the axon."
https://openalex.org/W2066220463,"Parainfluenza viruses are important causes of respiratory disease in both children and adults. In particular, they are the major cause of the serious childhood illness croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). The infections produced by parainfluenza viruses are associated with the accumulation of ions and fluid in the respiratory tract. It is not known, however, whether this accumulation is because of a direct effect of the viruses on ion and fluid transport by the respiratory epithelium. Here we show that a model parainfluenza virus (the Sendai virus), in concentrations observed during respiratory infections, activates Cl– secretion and inhibits Na+ absorption across the tracheal epithelium. It does so by binding to a neuraminidase-insensitive glycolipid, possibly asialo-GM1, triggering the release of ATP, which then acts in an autocrine fashion on apical P2Y receptors to produce the observed changes in ion transport. These findings indicate that fluid accumulation in the respiratory tract associated with parainfluenza virus infection is attributable, at least in part, to direct effects of the virus on ion transport by the respiratory epithelium.

These findings indicate that fluid accumulation in the respiratory tract associated with parainfluenza virus infection is attributable, at least in part, to direct effects of the virus on ion transport by the respiratory epithelium. The volume of fluid in the respiratory tract is determined by the balance between the rate of fluid secretion and the rate of fluid absorption by the respiratory epithelium. The secretion of fluid is due to the movement of Cl– into the lumen through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein Cl– channels and Ca2+-activated Cl– channels in the apical membranes of the epithelial cells and is driven by the Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter in their basolateral membranes (1Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The absorption of fluid is because of the movement of Na+ across the apical membrane through epithelial Na+ channels (1Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C.

Given the importance of ion transport across the respiratory epithelium in determining the volume of the lung surface fluid, it is not surprising that disturbances in it lead to pathological changes in the volume of lung fluid. Hence excessive activity of epithelial Na+ channels, such as occurs in cystic fibrosis (4Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neill W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), leads to dehydration of the respiratory surfaces, whereas reduced activity of epithelial Na+ channels, such as occurs in pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, is associated with an increase in lung surface fluid (3Kerem E.

Similarly, reduced activity of the epithelial Na+ channels in the respiratory epithelium has been implicated in the development of high altitude pulmonary edema (5Scherrer U. Sartori C. Lepori M.

They are disseminated by large droplet spread and are highly contagious, over 75% of children are infected by parainfluenza viruses at least once during their first 5 years of life (9Chanock R.M. Murphy B.R. Collins P.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1341-1379Google Scholar). The infections caused by them are associated with fluid accumulation in the respiratory tract, which ranges in severity from rhinitis (9Chanock R.M. Murphy B.R. Collins P.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1341-1379Google Scholar) and serous otitis media (14Heikkinen T. Thint M. Chonmaitree T. N. Engl. J.

Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1990; 9: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The question thus arises whether parainfluenza viruses could be directly affecting ion transport by the respiratory epithelium. One common respiratory virus, the influenza virus, has been shown to directly inhibit Na+ absorption by the respiratory epithelium (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This inhibition is because of the binding of the hemagglutinin in the viral coat to a neuraminidase-sensitive receptor in the apical membrane of the epithelium and is mediated by activation of phospholipase Cβ and protein kinase C (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity of their names, which reflects the similarity of the clinical features they produce, influenza viruses and parainfluenza viruses are unrelated (9Chanock R.M. Murphy B.R. Collins P.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1341-1379Google Scholar). Influenza viruses have a segmented genome and replicate in the nucleus, whereas the parainfluenza viruses have a non-segmented genome and replicate in the cytoplasm (9Chanock R.M. Murphy B.R. Collins P.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1341-1379Google Scholar). Thus it is not possible to assume that parainfluenza viruses affect epithelial ion transport in the same way as influenza viruses. In the present study we performed experiments to determine whether parainfluenza viruses rapidly alter ion transport by respiratory epithelia. We found that not only do they inhibit the absorption of the Na+ by these epithelia, they also activate epithelial secretion of Cl–. Furthermore, we found that the mechanism by which parainfluenza viruses alter epithelial ion transport differs markedly from that used by influenza viruses. Viruses—Sendai virus, the gift of Dr. A. Mühlbacher (John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra ACT), was grown for 2 days in the allantoic cavity of 10-day old embryonated eggs from hens. Aliquots of allantoic fluid containing the virus were stored at 80 °C. The viral stock solution was titered on monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (17Fazekas de St. Groth S. Webster R.G. J. Exp. Med. 1966; 124: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—M-1 mouse cortical-collecting duct cells, provided by Dr. C. Korbmacher (University of Erlangen, Germany), were grown to confluence for 3 days on permeable supports (Transwell-Coll, Costar, Cambridge, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100,000 units/liter), streptomycin (100,000 units/liter) and dexamethasone (0.1 μm). Ussing Chamber Experiments—Quackenbush-Swiss mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The trachea were then removed, freed of connective tissue, opened longitudinally, and divided into small pieces that were stored in a chilled solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 3.8 mm KCl, 5 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm calcium gluconate, pH 7.4. Each tracheal piece was mounted in an Ussing chamber (18Mall M. Bleich M. Greger R. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Clin.

The apical and basolateral surfaces of the epithelium were perfused continuously with aerated solutions at a rate of 10–20 ml/min (chamber volume 1 ml) at 37 °C. The bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1.6 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm calcium gluconate, pH 7.4. All experiments were carried out under open circuit conditions. The transepithelial potential difference (Vte) was recorded relative to the serosal side, and current was defined as positive when conventional current flowed in the apical to serosal direction. The transepithelial resistance (Rte) was determined, and the equivalent short circuit current was calculated as described previously (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A.

The Baseline Electrical Properties of Mouse Tracheal Epithelium—The rate at which the tracheal epithelium secretes Cl– ions and absorbs Na+ ions can be measured by determining the current flow generated by the movement of these ions across the epithelium. We can do this by measuring the electrical potential difference across the epithelium (the transepithelial potential, Vte) and the change in the transepithelial potential produced by the passage of a standard test pulse of current. We can then use Ohm's Law to estimate the resistance of the epithelium to the flow of the test pulse of current (the transepithelial resistance, Rte), as well as the current that is required to generate the observed transepithelial potential (the so-called short circuit current, Isc = Vte/Rte). To make these measurements, we placed a small piece of trachea in an Ussing chamber, an organ bath that permits the luminal and interstitial surfaces of the tissue to be superfused by separate solutions and the continuous measurement of transepithelial potential and resistance. Under control conditions, we found the potential difference across the tracheal epithelium to be –7.3 ± 0.6 mV (n = 23), with the lumen being negative to the interstitium and the electrical resistance of the epithelium to be 79.4 ± 5.2 Ω cm2 (n = 23). From these measurements we calculated the short circuit current across the epithelium to be 98.3 ± 7.8 μAcm–2 (n = 23). This current flow was largely because of the transport of Na+ through amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels, as the application of amiloride (10 μm), a selective inhibitor of these channels, to the apical surface of the epithelium reduced the short circuit current by 90.2 ± 6.9 μA cm–2 (n = 23), a 92% reduction. The Effects of Sendai Virus—Exposure of the apical membrane of mouse tracheal epithelium to the Sendai virus (106 pfu/ml) caused the transepithelial potential and the short circuit current to become transiently more negative (Fig. 1A, ΔVte = –1.2 ± 0.2 mV, n = 8; ΔIsc = –43.1 ± 9.0 μA cm–2). This transient occurred within ∼1 min of adding the virus to the epithelium and lasted ∼5 min. It could have been due either to an increase in the rate of Cl– secretion or to an increase in the rate of Na+ absorption. We found that it could not be prevented by inhibiting Na+ absorption by the addition of 10 μm amiloride to the apical membrane (data not shown), and hence could not be attributed to an increase in the rate of Na+ absorption. It could be inhibited, however, by blocking the secretion of Cl– by the addition to the basolateral membrane of 100 μm bumetanide, an inhibitor of the Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter (data not shown). Hence the initial transient stimulation of the short circuit current was because of an increase in the rate of Cl– secretion. We further found that this transient stimulation of short circuit current required an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, as it could be prevented by maneuvers that clamp cytosolic Ca2+ at a low level, such as the removal of extracellular Ca2+ or loading the cytosol with the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (see Fig. 4). Hence the initial increase in short circuit current produced by Sendai virus was because of the activation of Ca2+-activated Cl– channels in the apical membrane of the epithelium.Fig. 4Role of Ca2+ in mediating the effects of the Sendai virus (106 pfu/ml). A and B show the effects of incubation in low (1 μm) extracellular Ca2+ solution on the initial transient increase in short circuit current (Initial ΔIsc) seen following the addition of the Sendai virus and on the amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (Isc-Amil) measured 1 h after the addition of Sendai virus. C and D show the effects of treatment with BAPTA-AM on initial ΔIsc following the addition of Sendai virus and on the amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (Isc-Amil) measured 1 h after the addition of Sendai virus. Initial ΔIsc was measured as the difference between the peak Isc observed following the addition of Sendai and the Isc observed immediately prior to its addition. Statistically significant effects are marked with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After the epithelium had been exposed to the virus for 1 h (Fig. 1A), the transepithelial potential had fallen from –5.6 ± 0.6 mV (n = 8) to –3.3 ± 0.2 mV (n = 8), and the transepithelial resistance had increased from 49.7 ± 5.0 Ω cm2 (n = 8) to 67.5 ± 8.4 Ω cm2 (n = 8). From these measurements we calculated that the short circuit current across the epithelium had declined from –117.7 ± 17.1 μAcm–2 (n = 8) to –52.7 ± 6.6 μA cm–2 (n = 8). This decrease in current flow during prolonged exposure to parainfluenza virus was almost entirely because of a reduction in the rate of amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport (Fig. 1B). In paired control experiments, the ion transport activity of the epithelium did not change over this period (Fig. 1B). The addition of allantoic fluid also did not affect the ion transport activity of the epithelium (data not shown). We further found that, as we had previously observed for influenza virus (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the action of the Sendai virus on the epithelium was not prevented by an UV inactivation of the virus. A UV light-inactivated virus produced an initial transient increase in the short circuit current of 23.4 ± 6.0 μA cm–2 (n = 5) and, after 1 h of exposure, reduced the rate of amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption from –89.4 ± 9.3 μAcm–2 (n = 5) to –50.1 ± 4.2 μA cm–2 (n = 5). To check whether the Sendai virus exerted a nonspecific toxic effect, we examined the other parameters of the function of the tracheal epithelium. In particular, we examined the effect of the virus on (i) the rate of Cl– secretion by the epithelium in response to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP produced by exposure to the activator of the adenylate cyclase forskolin (18Mall M. Bleich M. Greger R. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), (ii) the rate of Cl– secretion in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ produced by the muscarinic agonist carbachol (18Mall M. Bleich M. Greger R. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19Boucher R.C. Gatzy J.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 52: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and (iii) the rate of electrogenic cotransport of Na+ and glucose across the epithelium (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Joris L. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L510-L515PubMed Google Scholar). We found (Fig. 1C) that although exposure to the Sendai virus (106 pfu/ml) for 1 h reduced the response to 100 μm forskolin, it did not affect the response to 100 μm carbachol or the rate of electrogenic glucose transport. The virus thus appears not to have exerted a nonspecific toxic effect. Finally, we examined the dependence of the ion transport effects of the Sendai virus on the concentration of virus bathing the apical membrane. We found that both the initial transient stimulation of the short circuit current (Fig. 1D) and the longer term inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (Fig. 1E) were dependent on the viral concentration over the range 104–106 pfu/ml. By comparison, the levels of the Sendai virus in the lungs of infected mice reach 7 × 106 pfu/g of wet weight of lung tissue or higher (21Ogasawara T. Emoto M. Kiyotani K. Shimokata K. Yoshida T. Nagai Y. Yoshikai Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pena-Cruz V. Bronson R.T. Reiss C.S. McIntosh K. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 165: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Robinson T.W.E. Cureton R.J.R. Heath R.B. J. Med. Microbiol. 1968; 1: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Apical Membrane Target for Sendai Virus—We have previously reported that the effects of the influenza virus on ion transport in the mouse trachea can be inhibited by the treatment of the apical membrane with neuraminidase (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, we found that pre-incubation with neuraminidase (0.1 and 1 units/ml) for 30 min had no impact on the actions of the Sendai virus (data not shown). Because glycolipids have been reported to act as membrane receptors for Paramyxoviruses, including Sendai (24Suzuki T. Portner A. Scroggs R.A. Uchikawa M. Koyama N. Matsuo K. Suzuki Y. Takimoto T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we also examined the possibility that the effects of Sendai virus might be mediated by a glycolipid. We first examined the effect of blocking glycolipid synthesis using PPMP, an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase that requires 24 h or more to be effective (25Barbour S. Edidin M. Felding-Habermann B. Taylor-Norton J. Radin N.S. Fenderson B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because we found that the incubation of the excised tracheal epithelium for 24 h led to an irreversible deterioration of its ion-transporting function, we performed these studies using monolayers of the M1 mouse collecting duct cell line, a cell line that, like the tracheal epithelium, absorbs Na+ through amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (26Letz B. Ackermann A. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Korbmacher C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Cuffe J.E. Bielfield-Ackermann A. Thomas J. Leipziger J. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 77-90Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, M1 cells respond to Sendai virus in a similar manner to tracheal epithelium, showing an initial transient stimulation in short circuit current followed by a longer term inhibition in the amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 2, E and F). We found that preincubation of M1 mouse collecting duct cells in PPMP (20–40 μm) for 24 h almost completely inhibited both the initial transient stimulation of short circuit current (Fig. 2F) and the reduction of the amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 2E) that follows the addition of 106 pfu/ml Sendai to the apical bathing solution. In contrast, the inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive current produced by the influenza virus in M1 cells was not affected by pre-incubation in PPMP (data not shown). We further explored the role of glycolipids in mediating the effects of the Sendai virus by testing the effect of an antibody directed against the ganglioside asialoGM1. This ganglioside has been previously identified as the apical receptor by which many bacterial pathogens evoke mucus and cytokine production by epithelia (28McNamara N. Khong A. McKemy D. Caterina M. Boyer J. Julius D. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19267-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We found that pre-incubation for 20 min in an anti-asialoGM1 antibody in a dilution of 1 in 100 completely inhibited the effects of the Sendai virus (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). Interestingly, as reported in other systems (28McNamara N. Khong A. McKemy D. Caterina M. Boyer J. Julius D. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19267-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), when added to tracheal epithelium at the lower dilution of 1 in 20, the antibody acted as an agonist, evoking a transient stimulation of short circuit current followed by a long term depression of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (Fig. 2C). Sendai Virus Acts by Triggering ATP Release—We next investigated whether the Sendai virus acted by triggering the release of ATP, as has been reported following the exposure of human respiratory cells to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28McNamara N. Khong A. McKemy D. Caterina M. Boyer J. Julius D. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found that enzymatic destruction of ATP secreted from the epithelium by the inclusion in the apical solution of hexokinase plus glucose (30Filippini A. Taffs R.E. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8267-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) completely inhibited the effects of the Sendai virus (Fig. 3, A–C). Furthermore, the effects of the virus were inhibited by the purinergic receptor antagonists, suramin, and PPADS (Fig. 3, C–E). Given that binding of asialoGM1 had been reported to increase intracellular Ca2+ (28McNamara N. Khong A. McKemy D. Caterina M. Boyer J. Julius D. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19267-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the actions of the Sendai virus are mediated by changes in intracellular Ca2+. We did this by incubating the epithelium in a low Ca2+ (1 μm) solution buffered with 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 4, A and B) or by pre-incubating the epithelium with the membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μm) for 30 min (Fig. 4, C and D). We found that both treatments inhibited the initial transient stimulation of short circuit current produced by the Sendai virus (Fig. 4, B and D) but did not affect the longer term inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (Fig. 4, A and C). The findings that the effects of the Sendai virus are mediated by ATP acting on purinergic receptors and that they are mediated in part by increasing intracellular Ca2+ suggested roles also for phospholipase Cβ and protein kinase C. Consistent with this we found that U-73122 (10 μm; Fig. 5, D and F) and edelfosine (10 μm; data not shown), which are blockers of phospholipase C, inhibited the effects of the virus, whereas the inactive isomer of U-73122, U-73343 (20 μm), was without effect (data not shown). We also found that an inhibitor of protein kinase C, BIM I (100 nm), partially inhibited the transient response to the Sendai virus (Fig. 5F), although it did not prevent the inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (Fig. 5E). The increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration that accompanies binding of asialoGM1 has been reported to activate p38 and p42/44 MAP kinases (29Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19267-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We found, however, that neither inhibition of p38 MAP kinase with 25 μm SB-203580 nor inhibition of p42/44 MAP kinase with 25 μm U-0126 interfered with the actions of Sendai virus on ion transport (Fig. 5, A, B, and F). Finally, we examined whether a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein mediates the effects of the Sendai virus. We performed these studies in the presence of BIM I, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, because we have previously found that the B-oligomer of the toxin, which is enzymatically inactive, acts as a hemagglutinin and inhibits amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption in mouse tracheal epithelium as a result of activating protein kinase C (32Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When we added Sendai virus to the tracheal epithelium that had been pre-treated with pertussis toxin in the presence of BIM I (100 nm), we found that the magnitude of the transient stimulation of short circuit current was not different from that observed in the presence of BIM I alone (Fig. 5F). This treatment, however, abolished completely the effects of the Sendai virus on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (Fig. 5C). Exposure of the epithelium to the isolated B-oligomer of the toxin in the presence of BIM I was without effect (data not shown). Thus the action of Sendai virus on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption would appear to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. The Actions of UTP on the Tracheal Epithelium Have a Similar Pharmacology to Those of Sendai Virus—As reported above, the effects of Sendai virus on epithelial ion transport are mediated by the autocrine action of ATP on apical P2Y receptors. Direct activation of these receptors by exogenous nucleotides should therefore reproduce the effects of the virus. We have previously shown that apical UTP (100 μm) causes a rapid stimulation of Ca2+-activated Cl– secretion followed by inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (32Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, compare A with B) in the tracheal epithelium. Furthermore, the P2Y antagonist, suramin, inhibits both the activation of Cl– secretion (data not shown) and the inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption (Fig. 6B) produced by UTP. Both actions of UTP were also blocked by the inhibitor of phospholipase C, U-73122 (32Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). Finally, UTP shows a similar divergence in the mechanisms by which it controls Cl– secretion and Na+ absorption to what we had observed with Sendai virus; treatment of the epithelium with the protein kinase C inhibitor BIM I inhibits the effect of UTP on Cl– secretion but leaves the inhibitory effect of UTP on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption unchanged (32Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). We have found that the mouse parainfluenza virus I (Sendai virus) produces rapid changes in ion transport across mouse tracheal epithelium. We observed these effects at concentrations comparable with those observed in the nasal mucosa and lungs of animals during experimentally induced infections, which reach 7 × 106 pfu/g of wet weight of lung tissue and higher within 3 days of inoculation with the virus (21Ogasawara T. Emoto M. Kiyotani K. Shimokata K. Yoshida T. Nagai Y. Yoshikai Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Robinson T.W.E. Cureton R.J.R. Heath R.B. J. Med. Microbiol. 1968; 1: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Prince G.A. Ottolini M.G. Moscona A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12446-12451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, the nature of the changes in ion transport observed, viz. an increase in Cl– secretion together with an inhibition of Na+ absorption, suggests that they may play a significant role in the fluid accumulation in the respiratory tract that accompanies parainfluenza infections (9Chanock R.M. Murphy B.R. Collins P.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1341-1379Google Scholar, 23Robinson T.W.E. Cureton R.J.R. Heath R.B. J. Med. Microbiol. 1968; 1: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because these effects of Sendai virus were also observed in the M1 collecting duct cell line, it would seem that they are not mediated by immune cells in the tracheal mucosa. The mechanism by which Sendai produces its effects is summarized in Fig. 7. It first binds to a glycolipid, which may be asialoGM1, although our findings with the anti-sialoGM1 antibody are also consistent with the weak agonist activity of this antibody having desensitized the glycolipid target for Sendai virus. The binding of the virus then triggers an ATP release leading to the autocrine activation of apical P2Y receptors and activation of phospholipase Cβ. The pathways that activate Cl– secretion inhibit amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption then diverge. The activation of Cl– secretion is dependent on an increase in intracellular Ca2+ as well as on the activation of protein kinase C, whereas the inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption is independent of increases in intracellular Ca2+ and the activity of protein kinase C. It is noteworthy that this divergence in the regulation of these two ion transport processes is also observed when apical P2Y receptors are directly stimulated by UTP or ATP (this work and Refs. 32Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and 34Mall M. Wissner A. Kühr J. Gonska T. Brandis M. Kumzelmann K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effects of the Sendai virus on epithelial ion transport differ markedly from those of influenza viruses (i) Sendai virus acts via a neuraminidase-insensitive glycolipid, whereas the influenza receptor is neuraminidase-sensitive (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); (ii) Sendai virus produces an initial transient stimulation of Cl– secretion, whereas influenza does not (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); and (iii) although both viruses inhibit the amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption, Sendai virus does so via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, whereas influenza does so via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and protein kinase C (16Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ability of the Sendai virus to evoke Cl– secretion is reminiscent, however, of the ability of rotaviruses to trigger Cl– secretion by the intestinal epithelium. This action of rotaviruses is apparently because of a viral nonstructural protein, NSP4, activating phospholipase Cβ, which then increases intracellular Ca2+ and triggers Cl– secretion by intestinal villus cells (35Ball J.M. Tian P. Zeng C.Q. Morris A.P. Estes M.K. Science. 1996; 272: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 36Cook D.I. Young J.A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 443: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 37Morris A.P. Estes M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G303-G310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether ATP release mediates these actions of NSP4, although the present findings suggest that this possibility should be considered. The present findings also need to be considered in the light of the recent report that respiratory syncytial virus infections inhibit the rate of fluid clearance from the airways (38Davis I.C. Sullender W.M. Hickman-Davis J.M. Lindsay J.R. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L112-L120Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In their studies, Davis and colleagues (38Davis I.C. Sullender W.M. Hickman-Davis J.M. Lindsay J.R. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L112-L120Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that 3 days after the infection of mice with respiratory syncytial virus there was a marked inhibition in the rate of clearance of a standardized volume of fluid instilled into the lungs through the trachea. This inhibition was accompanied by a decline in the amiloride-sensitive component of the fluid clearance and was apparently mediated by the secretion of UTP from the respiratory mucosa. From these studies, it was not possible to determine whether these effects were the direct result of the contact of the virus with the epithelium or the consequence of an immune response to the infection. The findings in the present study, however, suggest that they are likely to be because of a direct interaction between the viral particles and the epithelium. The phenomenon that most closely resembles the action of the Sendai virus on epithelial transport is the stimulation of epithelial cytokine and mucus production by exposure to P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria trigger mucus and interleukin production by binding apical asialoglycolipids, leading to the release of ATP, autocrine activation of purinergic receptors, and increased intracellular Ca2+ (28McNamara N.

Taking these reports together with our present finding that the Sendai virus modulates epithelial ion transport we propose that altered epithelial ion transport and the production of mucus and cytokines are all part of a stereotypic response of airway epithelia to contact with pathogens. In this response, an increase in the volume of fluid bathing the surface of the epithelium hydrates the increased amounts of mucus being secreted and leads to an increase in the rate of mucus clearance so as to facilitate transport of the pathogens out of the lung (39Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The possibility that the acute changes in electrolyte transport we have observed form part of a stereotyped epithelial response to pathogens is supported by reports that both P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae inhibit Na+ transport by the respiratory epithelium (40Evans D.J.

A further implication of our findings is that the release of ATP from epithelia, which has been considered to be an epithelial response to mechanical stimuli (44Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1015-1017Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar), may also play a critical role in coordinating epithelial responses to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2008056664,"Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) is a tumour suppressor and signal transducer in genome integrity checkpoints that coordinate cell-cycle progression with DNA repair or cell death in response to DNA damage. Defects of Chk2 occur in subsets of diverse sporadic malignancies and predispose to several types of hereditary carcinomas. However, the status of Chk2 in tumours of the urinary bladder remains unknown. Here, we report that among 58 advanced (grade T2–T4) human bladder carcinomas, immunohistochemical analysis revealed tumour-specific reduction or lack of Chk2 protein in 6 (10.3%) cases. Genetic analysis of the latter subset showed that a Chk2-negative carcinoma #668 harboured a truncating mutation 1100delC, in one Chk2 allele and loss of the corresponding second allele. The 1100delC mutation was also found in the germ line of this patient. Sequencing of TP53 in tumour #668 identified two missense mutations. Furthermore, the vast majority of the tumours showed ‘unscheduled’ activatory phosphorylation on Thr68 of Chk2 in the absence of any DNA-damaging treatment. Our results indicate that the otherwise dormant DNA damage signal transducer Chk2 is aberrantly and constitutively activated in invasive urinary bladder carcinomas, and that such likely proapoptotic checkpoint signalling can be disabled by inactivation of Chk2 and/or p53 tumour suppressors in subsets of these tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1966766316,"As axons mature, neurofilament-M (NF-M) expression rises, contributing to maturation of the axonal cytoskeleton and an expansion in axon caliber. This increase is partly due to a rise in NF-M mRNA stability. Such post-transcriptional regulation is often mediated through the binding of specific proteins to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNAs. Vertebrate NF-M 3′-UTRs are remarkably well conserved, prompting us to test whether similar proteins bind the 3′-UTRs of different vertebrate NF-Ms. Identification of such proteins could lead to insights into the regulation of NF-M expression during development and in response to trauma or disease. Ultraviolet cross-linking analysis of proteins isolated from adult frog (Xenopus laevis), mouse, and rat brains revealed three ribonucleoprotein complexes (97, 70, and 47 kDa) that were present in all species and bound specifically to NF-M 3′-UTRs. Affinity purification of NF-M 3′-UTR-binding proteins from rat brain followed by mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation assays identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and hnRNP E1 as the proteins forming the 70- and 47-kDa complexes, respectively. These RNA-binding proteins of the KH domain family recognize CU-rich motifs identical to ones present in NF-M 3′-UTRs. Ultraviolet cross-linking assays performed on Xenopus embryos at different stages of neural development demonstrated that whereas hnRNP K binding occurred at all stages, hnRNP E binding occurred only at the most mature stages of axon development. Since hnRNP E is known to stabilize mRNAs, these results raise the hypothesis that these proteins may contribute to the increases in cytoplasmic levels of NF-M mRNA that accompany axonal maturation.

They are made of neuronal intermediate filament (nIF) proteins, which include peripherin, α-internexin, and the low, middle, and high molecular mass NF triplet proteins (NF-L, -M, and -H, respectively). In adult neurons, the stoichiometry of these proteins is tightly controlled and if unbalanced can lead to the formation of Lewy bodies and axonal degeneration (1Julien J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). During development, changes in nIF expression are linked to successive phases of axon development, including neurite initiation in PC12 cells (2Helfand B.T. Mendez M.G. Pugh J. Delsert C. Goldman R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5069-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the rapid growth phase of axon elongation (3Walker K.L. Yoo H.K. Undamatla J. Szaro B.G. J.

Such changes in nIF expression are regulated, at least in part, by post-transcriptional mechanisms, which include changes in mRNA stability (9Moskowitz P.F. Oblinger M.M. Mol.

Aberrant post-transcriptional regulation of nIF expression plays a role in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (14Ge W.W. Leystra-Lantz C. Wen W. Strong M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26558-26563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In eukaryotes, the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNAs harbors many of the cis regulatory elements critical for cytoplasmic post-transcriptional control of gene expression (15Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Wickens M.

Among nIFs, the role of the 3′-UTR in post-transcriptional regulation has been studied best for NF-L. Its 3′-UTR contains a 45-nucleotide-long destabilizing element that overlaps with the 3′ end of the coding domain (18Canete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Canete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) have also implicated as yet unidentified poly(C)-binding proteins in the formation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with the NF-L 3′-UTR (21Canete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).NF-M is also post-transcriptionally regulated (9Moskowitz P.F. Oblinger M.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol.

Lett. 1996; 213: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but much less is known about the specific proteins that bind its 3′-UTR than is known for NF-L. Competitive EMSAs have implicated AU-rich element (ARE) RNA-binding proteins (21Canete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and one such protein, Hel-N1 (also known as HuB), binds non-canonical AREs in the NF-M 3′-UTR. It also enhances NF-M translation when transfected into a human teratocarcinoma cell line (22Antic D. Lu N. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTRs of vertebrate NF-Ms, from fish to mammal, contain extensive stretches of exceptionally high conservation (23Roosa J.R. Gervasi C. Szaro B.G. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 82: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Duret L. Dorkeld F. Gautier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that many more trans factors must bind the 3′-UTR than are implied by the presence of the non-canonical AREs. For example, within the domains conserved among vertebrate NF-M 3′-UTRs lies a pyrimidine-rich sequence matching the consensus sequence for binding of hnRNP K homology (KH) domain RNA-binding proteins.In this study, we set out to learn more about which proteins bind the NF-M 3′-UTR in the nervous system. Using EMSA and SDS-PAGE of brain proteins cross-linked to the NF-M 3′-UTR RNA by ultraviolet irradiation, we found evidence for at least three RNP complexes that are conserved between frog and rodent. In Xenopus, formation of one of these conserved complexes was developmentally regulated. These conserved complexes included three specific KH domain proteins (hnRNPs K, E1, and E2) that have been demonstrated to play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation in a variety of non-neuronal systems. Although these KH domain proteins had been previously observed in neurons (25Zhu Y. Sun Y. Mao X.O. Jin K.L. Greenberg D.A. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), their targets in the nervous system were unknown. Our study provides evidence of their binding a specific, developmentally regulated neuronal mRNA, thus offering important clues about their possible functions within the nervous system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Xenopus and Rat NF-M 3′-UTR—The Xenopus NF-M 3′-UTR was extended to its 3′ end by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (26Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4323) Google Scholar) from adult Xenopus laevis brain mRNA using a sense primer (TATGTAATGATGAGGAAGTAT) targeted to the 3′-UTR of the Xenopus NF-M mRNA sequence in GenBank™ (accession number U85969). This sequence was located 230 nucleotides upstream from the 3′ end of the published sequence between positions 2967 and 2988 (27Gervasi C. Szaro B.G. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and four of these clones were sequenced.cDNA from adult Xenopus brain was next used as a template for PCR to obtain three additional cDNA clones that spanned overlapping regions from the full-length Xenopus NF-M 3′-UTR. X1 (684 bp) contained the full-length NF-M 3′-UTR plus the last 100 bp of the coding region (sense primer, GCGCGAATTCAAAGTGGAAGAGCATGAGGAGACTG; antisense primer, GCATGCAAGCTTGATATTTTCAATATAACCTTTTTATTGAG). X2 (557 bp) began at the stop codon at the beginning of the 3′-UTR (sense primer, GCGCGAATTCATAAGAGAAGAGGTACAGCAATTGC) and ended just upstream of the nuclear poly(A) signal (antisense primer, GCATGCAAGCTTGAGCAAGGTTCACTACATAACCCAT). X3 (657 bp) contained the last 100 bp of the coding region and lacked the nuclear poly(A) signal. These PCR products were directionally cloned into pGem-3Z (Promega) after digestion with EcoRI and HindIII to produce compatible ends. An analogous 566-bp cDNA clone (R3) spanning the rat NF-M 3′-UTR (GenBank™ accession number Z12152) from the last 100 bp of its coding region (sense primer, GCGCGAGCTCGTTGAAGAGCATGAGGAGACCTTTG) to the nuclear poly(A) signal (antisense primer, ATGCTCTAGACAAGAACTGCTGTGACATTTAACAT) was obtained from rat brain total RNA by reverse transcription followed by the PCR. This PCR product was directionally cloned into pGem-3Z after digestion with SacI and XbaI to produce compatible overhangs.The sequences of these 3′-UTRs as well as those from human (GenBank™ accession number NM005382), mouse (GenBank™ accession number AK051696), and chicken (GenBank™ accession number X05558) were aligned using ClustalX (28Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35206) Google Scholar) using the default parameters. The first nucleotide of the stop codon preceding each 3′-UTR was designated as the first nucleotide in the alignment. The alignment was further refined manually using the BIOEDIT suite (29Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription Reactions—Sense RNA probes X2S, X3S, and R3S were synthesized by in vitro transcription from X2, X3, and R3, respectively, using T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Nonspecific competitor GFP RNA (570 nucleotides) was synthesized from pGreen-Lantern (Invitrogen) using SP6 polymerase (New England Biolabs). To prepare the templates for in vitro transcription, the Xenopus, rat, and GFP plasmids were linearized with HindIII, XbaI, or BamHI, respectively, and then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. To generate radiolabeled RNA transcripts, 1 μg of each DNA template was added to in vitro transcription reactions (30Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar) containing [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences); non-radioactive competitor RNA probes were synthesized with unlabeled UTP. After purification and removal of unincorporated nucleotides (30Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar), the RNA was resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm potassium acetate, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 175 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A).Preparation of Cytosolic Extracts—Cytosolic protein extracts were prepared from adult brains of X. laevis, rat (Long Evans, Taconic Farms, Taconic, NY), and mouse (C57B1/6, University at Albany Animal Facility, Albany, NY) and from stage 18, 29/30, and 37/38 (31Nieuwkoop P. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1956: 162-188Google Scholar) X. laevis whole embryos. Tissues were homogenized in 2 volumes of ice-cold Buffer A using a PT3000 Polytron (Kinematica AG, Littau-Luzerne, Switzerland) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to isolate the cytosolic phase. This supernatant was then divided into aliquots at a final concentration of 20 μg/μl in Buffer A, 5% glycerol and then at stored –80 °C.RNA EMSA—RNA EMSA was performed by incubating 60 μg of cytosolic extract with 5 × 105 cpm X2S or X3S radiolabeled RNA probe in a reaction volume of 20 μl for 30 min at 20 °C. This incubation was followed by addition of 100 μg of heparin and further incubation for an additional 5 min at 20 °C (18Canete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Smith C.W.J. RNA:Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 109-135Google Scholar). For the competition experiments, unlabeled competitor RNA was added in molar excess (15-, 75-, 150-, and 315-fold) to the radioactive RNA probe in each reaction. Reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed overnight at 4 °C on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 40:1). The gel was dried and exposed overnight to a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences), and the image was acquired using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). A second image was also made using x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.).UV Cross-linking (UVCL) Assay—Radiolabeled RNA-protein complexes were formed by mixing cytosolic extracts with 6.25 × 105 cpm RNA as described for the RNA EMSA (18Canete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Smith C.W.J. RNA:Protein Interactions.

Competition experiments were also performed as described for the RNA EMSA. The RNA-protein complexes were covalently cross-linked by irradiation with ultraviolet light (254 nm, 1650 mJ of total energy; Stratalinker, Bio-Rad) while the samples were kept cool in an ice slurry. Cross-linked samples were incubated with 10 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C to remove the unprotected RNA. Samples were then denatured for SDS-PAGE by boiling for 5 min in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol in upper gel buffer (34Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). 20 μl of this solution was then electrophoretically separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (34Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to a phosphor screen for 48 h or to x-ray film. Apparent molecular weights of the cross-linked complexes were calculated based on their migration relative to low range molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad).Affinity Purification and Identification of RNA-binding Proteins— Proteins that bind the NF-M 3′-UTR were affinity-purified by binding to in vitro transcribed X3S RNA affixed to magnetic streptavidin beads (New England Biolabs). To prepare the affinity matrix, 360 μg (∼1.6 nmol) of in vitro transcribed X3S RNA (made with AmpliScribe T7, Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) was suspended in 200 μl of Incubation Buffer C (IBC: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone) containing 8 nmol of a 3′-biotinylated oligo (5′-TCATGCTCTTCCACTTTGAATTCGCCCATA-3′-biotin) that was complementary to the 5′ end of the X3S probe. The RNA and oligo were then hybridized together by incubating them at 65 °C for 5 min in a water bath that was slowly cooled to room temperature over a 2-h period. The RNA/biotinylated oligo hybrid was then bound to 400 μl of magnetic streptavidin beads (New England Biolabs) that had been prewashed with IBC. The binding reaction was performed by incubating these beads together with the RNA/biotinylated oligo hybrid mixture in a final volume of 400 μl for 2–3 h on a Nutator at room temperature. Prepared beads were stored at 4 °C.Proteins that bind to the NF-M 3′-UTR were purified from 2 mg of adult rat brain cytosolic extract. To clear the extract of proteins that bind nonspecifically to the beads, it was incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C on a Nutator with 600 μl of prewashed beads lacking any RNA. The incubated beads were collected afterward and saved for analysis (BO fraction). The precleared extract was next incubated with beads decorated with the RNA/biotinylated oligo (RNA-beads) to collect proteins that bind to the NF-M 3′-UTR. In this reaction, the extract was divided into four parts that were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with separate 100-μl aliquots of the RNA-beads in a volume of 1 ml of IBC. To remove nonspecifically bound proteins, 100 μl of heparin (50 mg/ml) was added, and the beads were washed six times with 200 μl of IBC. To elute the RNA-binding proteins from the beads, the beads were incubated with 200 μl of prewarmed Buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm NaCl, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone) at 40 °C, which melted the RNA/oligo hybrid to release RNA-protein complexes. The proteins that bound specifically to the RNA were distinguished from those that bound nonspecifically to the beads by analyzing aliquots from all the wash fractions and the eluates on silver-stained 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. To purify the RNA-binding proteins further, the eluates from the RNA beads were pooled, concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (35Sauve D.M. Ho D.T. Roberge M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by staining with BioSafe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. The stained gel was sent to the University at Albany proteomics core facility for protein identification by mass spectrometry. Designated bands were excised and subjected to in situ alkylation of cysteines and in-gel tryptic digestion, and the digest solution was injected onto a nanospray LC-Q-TOF 2 tandem mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass). For protein identification, tandem spectra or MS/MS spectra were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant data base under the Rodent Taxonomy.Western Blots—For Western blots, samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) at 75 V for 3 h at 10 °C (34Neville Jr., D.M.

Neurol. 1994; 343: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies: a 1:1,000 dilution of three separate rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for hnRNP E1 (anti-PCBP1), hnRNP E2 (anti-PCBP2), or both (anti-PCBP1 and -2) (39Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar); a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-hnRNP K (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); or blocking solution without primary antibody that served as a control. After washing, blots were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG, 0.4μg/ml, Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) and then processed for the detection of alkaline phosphatase activity with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium following conventional procedures (30Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of UV Cross-linked RNP Complexes—Radiolabeled RNP complexes were formed as described for the UVCL assay. After UV irradiation and RNase digestion, the volume of the reaction was increased to 500 μl, and 5 μl of anti-hnRNP K or anti-hnRNP E1 and E2 antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a Nutator. The antibody-bound RNP complex was incubated with 50 μlof Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 2 h after which the beads were washed with Buffer A. Immunoprecipitated RNP complexes were eluted by boiling the beads in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and then dried and exposed to a phosphor screen. The images were captured using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager, and then the same gels were exposed to X-Omat x-ray film for 10 days.RESULTSThe 3′-UTRs of NF-M mRNAs Are Highly Conserved and Contain Pyrimidine-rich Sequences That May Function as cis Regulatory Sequences—Because the sequence of the Xenopus NF-M 3′-UTR in GenBank™ (accession numbers U85969/U85970) was nearly 300 nucleotides shorter than that of other vertebrates and lacked a nuclear termination and poly(A) signal, we suspected that more of the 3′-UTR remained to be found. The 3′-UTR was extended to its full length by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and four of these clones were sequenced. We concluded that these clones represented the remainder of the 3′-UTR both because they had a canonical nuclear termination and polyadenylation signal 20 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail and because they yielded a 3′-UTR that was comparable in length (593 nucleotides) to that of other vertebrate NF-Ms (mouse, chick, rat, and human). The full-length Xenopus NF-M mRNA 3′-UTR was remarkably similar to that of other vertebrates along its entire length (Fig. 1), exhibiting numerous blocks of nearly complete identity. Overall the Xenopus NF-M 3′-UTR exhibited 47% identity among all five vertebrates compared (highlighted in black) and an additional 21% identity among four of the five species (highlighted in gray).This high degree of sequence conservation strongly suggests that the NF-M 3′-UTR plays an important functional role, perhaps providing cis elements involved in the recruitment of regulatory trans factors, such as RNA-binding proteins. Consistent with this idea, we found within the conserved regions several pyrimidine-rich stretches (underlined in Fig. 1) that strongly resembled cis elements that bind poly(C)-sensitive RNA-binding proteins (17Wang X.

To test this hypothesis, we performed EMSAs on cytosolic extracts from adult Xenopus brain using two overlapping radiolabeled RNA probes (Fig. 2A). To avoid interference from poly(A)-binding proteins, both probes were terminated just upstream of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. The first probe (X2S) spanned the entire remaining 3′-UTR beginning with the stop codon. The second probe (X3S) spanned this same region but also extended further upstream to include the last 100 nucleotides of the coding domain. We made this second probe because a comparable region of the coding domain of NF-L mRNA is essential for the formation of RNP complexes (18Canete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J.

Upon release of the tubulin monomers from the chaperonin CCT, they are acted upon by each cofactor in the folding pathway through a unique combination of protein interaction domains. Three-dimensional structures have previously been reported for cofactor A and the C-terminal CAP-Gly domain of cofactor B (CoB). Here we report the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of Caenorhabditis elegans CoB and show that it closely resembles ubiquitin as was recently postulated on the basis of bioinformatic analysis (Grynberg, M., Jaroszewski, L., and Godzik, A. (2003) BMC Bioinformatics 4, 46). CoB binds partially folded α-tubulin monomers, and a putative tubulin-binding motif within the N-terminal domain is identified from sequence and structure comparisons. Based on modeling of the homologous cofactor E ubiquitin-like domain, we hypothesize that cofactors B and E may associate via their β-grasp domains in a manner analogous to the PB1 and caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease superfamily of protein interaction domains.

The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells is a network of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. The microtubules, hollow tubes made up of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, provide structural support for the cell and play a role in cell division, cell movement, and intracellular transport. The actin and tubulin subunits from which microfilaments and microtubules are comprised require the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (also known as c-cpn or TriC) for proper folding (1Melki R. Vainberg I. Chow R. Cowan N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the folding of actin and γ-tubulin, which require only chaperonin and ATP, the folding and dimerization of α- and β-tubulin is a complex process involving the additional presence of GTP and five tubulin folding cofactors (2Gao Y. Vainberg I.E. Chow R.L. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2478-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lopez-Fanarraga M. Avila J. Guasch A. Coll M. Zabala J.C. J. Struct.

After release from CCT, quasi-native folding intermediates are captured and stabilized by cofactors A or D (in the case of β-tubulin) or by cofactors B and E (in the case of α-tubulin) (5Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A supercomplex is then formed consisting of cofactors C–E and α- and β-tubulin. Finally, the αβ-tubulin heterodimer is released upon hydrolysis of GTP (7Tian G. Bhamidipati A. Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24054-24058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Fontalba A. Paciucci R. Avila J. Zabala J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 627-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction of cofactor D with native tubulin is regulated by the small G protein Arl2 (9Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Of the five cofactors, structures have been determined only for cofactor A (10Steinbacher S. Nat. Struct.

Qiu S.H. Chen H. Luan C.H. Carson M. Tsao J. Johnson D. Lin G. Zhao J. Thomas W. Nagy L.A. Sha B. DeLucas L.J. Wang B.C. Luo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48596-48601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, a recent study combining modeling and fold prediction tools identified previously unknown domains of cofactors B–E (13Grynberg M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These include a spectrin-like domain in cofactor C, HEAT and Armadillo domains in cofactor D, and leucine-rich repeats in cofactor E. In addition, the N and C termini of cofactors B and E, respectively, were predicted to adopt a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold. Here we report the structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans cofactor B ubiquitin-like (CoB 1The abbreviations used are: CoB, cofactor B; Ubl, ubiquitin-like; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CAP-Gly, glycine-rich cytoskeleton-associated protein; CAD, caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease; CoE, cofactor E; PB1, Phox and Bem1; DCX, doublecortin-like domain. Ubl) domain, which was solved as part of a structural genomics effort directed at novel protein domains from eukaryotic organisms. While its fold closely resembles that of ubiquitin, it is unlikely to function as a ubiquitin-like covalent modifier of other target proteins. Instead, we hypothesize that the domain has separate interaction sites for binding both α-tubulin and cofactor E. Cloning—We developed an Escherichia coli-based expression system to produce the N-terminal half of tubulin folding cofactor B from C. elegans, residues 1–120. PCR was used to amplify a gene fragment coding for the N-terminal 120 amino acids with BamHI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, to facilitate insertion into a modified pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The coding sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—The pQE30T-CoB (1–120) expression construct was transformed into E. coli strain SG13009[pRPEP4] (Qiagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB media containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin until the cell density reached A600 = 0.7. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Following induction, cells were grown for another 5 h, harvested, and stored at –80 °C until processed further. For uniform labeling with 15N, cells were grown in M9 media containing 15N-ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. The recombinant N-terminal domain of CoB was found exclusively in the soluble fraction of the harvested cells and purified by the following procedure. Cell paste from a 1-liter culture was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting protein solution was incubated with Ni+2-NTA resin (Qiagen) in batch mode for 30 min at room temperature, packed into a 5-ml disposable column, and washed with 3 × 10 ml portions of lysis buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 3 × 10 ml portions of elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C. Separation of the fusion tag was performed concurrently with dialysis by addition of a catalytic amount of TEV protease (∼1,000:1). The His8 affinity tag was separated from the recombinant protein using a second Ni+2-NTA column. The TEV cleavage product was incubated with Ni+2-NTA resin as described above and washed with 3 × 10 ml portions of lysis buffer. Target protein that has been separated from the affinity tag no longer interacts with the column and is obtained from the wash fractions. Fractions containing pure target protein were pooled and dialyzed into 2 × 4 liters of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl. Dialyzed protein was concentrated, and purity and identity were verified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. During the course of NMR data collection for structural analysis, signals corresponding to residues at the C terminus gradually became weaker and split into multiple species, suggesting that this portion of the protein may be susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Mass spectrometry revealed a series of species derived from the initial product by removal of varying numbers of amino acids from the C terminus. As described below, residues beyond Val84 are unstructured and highly mobile, making the C terminus more susceptible to degradation. However, chemical shifts of residues 1–115 were unperturbed by heterogeneity at the C terminus, indicating that the protein tertiary structure was unaffected. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance Cryo-Probe™ and processed with NMRPipe software (14Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE values were determined from an interleaved pair of two-dimensional gradient sensitivity-enhanced correlation spectra of [U-15N]CoB Ubl domain acquired with and without a 3-s proton saturation period (15Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Backbone resonance assignments were obtained in a semi-automated manner using the program Garant (16Bartels C. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with peak lists from three-dimensional HNCO, HNCACO, HNCA, HNCOCA, HNCACB, and CCONH spectra generated manually with XEASY software (17Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Sidechain assignments were determined manually using three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and HCCH-TOCSY data and a 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum optimized for aromatic groups. Distance constraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (τmix = 80 ms). The total acquisition time for all NMR spectra was 232 h. Initial structures were generated using the CANDID module of the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA (18Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). NOE peak intensities were converted into upper distance bounds with the CALIBA function of CYANA. Backbone ϕ and ψ dihedral angle constraints were generated from secondary shifts of the 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, and 15N nuclei shifts by the program TALOS (19Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Additional NOE constraints were added in each round of calculations, and structures were generated using a simulated annealing protocol (10,000 steps total). Assignments for consistently violated restraints were reevaluated. Of the final 100 structures calculated, the 20 conformers with the lowest target function values were selected for analysis. Final refinement in explicit solvent with experimental constraints and nonbonded energy terms was performed in XPLOR-NIH (20Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) using a recently described protocol (21Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) that improves the quality of NMR structures in terms of validation criteria such as Ramachandran statistics and Z-scores. Structure Determination—The solution conditions chosen for NMR spectroscopy were 20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% 2H2O. Under these conditions, the number, dispersion, and line widths of the observed signals from a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1) were all consistent with a homogeneous folded protein. The translational self-diffusion coefficient of 1.46 × 10–6 cm2s–1 measured by NMR pulsed field gradient methods (22Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar), which is consistent with molecular mass ≈ 14 kDa, indicated that the protein is monomeric. Using manually obtained peak lists from a complete set of standard triple-resonance 3D NMR spectra, greater than 90% of the backbone 1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments were accurately assigned by the program Garant (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Sidechain assignments were completed by manual analysis of the CCONH and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. An automated procedure for iterative NOE assignment (18Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) was used in generating the structure of the protein. The final structure was generated from 114 dihedral angle constraints and 1732 unique, NOE-derived distance restraints. Molecular dynamics calculations in explicit solvent (21Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) (Table I) were used in the final refinement. Because no long range NOEs were observed for residues 91–120, and 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE values (Fig. 2A) confirmed that those C-terminal residues are dynamically disordered on the picosecond to nanosecond time-scale (23Palmer III, A.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 129-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the final structure calculations included only CoB residues 1–90. Low 15N–1H NOE values for residues at the N terminus (1Melki R. Vainberg I. Chow R. Cowan N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Gao Y. Vainberg I.E.

These dynamic properties are reflected in variations of the local backbone r.m.s.d. values (Fig. 2B) for the ensemble of structures, which is otherwise highly ordered (Fig. 2C). Statistics on experimental constraints, coordinate precision, and stereochemical quality as determined by PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

These secondary structure elements are consistent with those of ubiquitin (26Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol.

The tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions between the buried sidechains of the hydrophobic residues Tyr5, Leu7, Ile9, Leu28, Leu31, Leu35, Met46, Ile48, Leu50, Leu68, Val73, Ile79, and Ala81. In addition, the sidechain of Lys32 is buried within the core. All of these residues except Val73 are located in secondary structure elements. The aromatic ring of Tyr77 is partially exposed, causing extreme upfield shifting of the nearby Arg741HN resonance to 4.9 ppm because of ring current effects. The surface of CoB Ubl is devoid of any large hydrophobic patches like typical chaperones and is instead characterized by charged and polar residues (Fig. 2D). Disordered C-terminal residues of the construct used in this analysis may serve as a flexible linker between the N-terminal Ubl domain and the C-terminal CAP-Gly domain (12Li S. Finley J. Liu Z.J.

However, by dividing the protein in the middle of this intervening sequence (residues 85–135), additional structural elements may have been disrupted. Although chemical shifts and NOE patterns did not indicate any regular secondary structures for residues 85–120, the secondary structure prediction program PSIPRED (27McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar) predicts helices from 104–107 and 112–122. Similar predictions are made for the CoB ortholog sequences. In addition, helical ϕ and ψ angles are predicted for residues 105–107 by the chemical shift analysis program TALOS. A short helical segment at this position would be reminiscent of 310 helices observed at the C termini of elongin B and the DCX domain, both members of the ubiquitin superfamily. The longer putative helix is perhaps an extension of a coiled-coil region predicted for residues 134–157 of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CoB homolog, alp11 (28Radcliffe P.A. Toda T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 752-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a portion of which in turn coincides with the short helix observed in the CAP-Gly domain of C. elegans CoB (12Li S. Finley J. Liu Z.J. Qiu S.H. Chen H. Luan C.H. Carson M. Tsao J. Johnson D. Lin G. Zhao J. Thomas W. Nagy L.A. Sha B. DeLucas L.J. Wang B.C. Luo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48596-48601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, coiled-coil domains are often found proximal to CAP-Gly domains (29Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), so it seems feasible that residues linking the N-terminal Ubl and C-terminal CAP-Gly domains of CoB contain a helical or coiledcoil structure in the intact protein. Cofactor B Orthologs Sequence Comparison—Cofactor B is conserved among eukaryotes as one element of a sophisticated system for the folding and assembly of tubulin heterodimers. Overall sequence conservation among vertebrates is high with 93% sequence identity between human and murine CoB Ubl orthologs. However, the CoB Ubl domain is more divergent than the C-terminal CAP-Gly domain (Fig. 3). Whereas the C. elegans CoB CAP-Gly domain shares 65% amino acid identity with that of Homo sapiens, the corresponding Ubl domains are only 33% identical with only four residues strictly conserved across other species: Lys32, Gly40, Leu68, and Asp83. Of these, all but Asp83 are also conserved in ubiquitin and serve a structural role. In addition to the low sequence identity, the β1–β2 and β3–β4 loops vary in length among CoB sequences. Most notable is an insertion of 24 residues between strands 3 and 4 in the Ustilago maydis sequence compared with the vertebrate and other higher eukaryotic sequences. Structural Comparison to Other Ubl Domains—A search for homologous structures using both VAST (30Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and FATCAT (31Ye Y. Godzik A. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: ii246-ii255Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) revealed a high level of structural similarity to ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like modifier proteins such as Nedd8 and Rub-1. Significant similarity was also found between other members of the ubiquitin superfamily, including elongin B (32Min J.H. Yang H. Ivan M. Gertler F. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), the UBX domains of FAF1 (33Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and p47 (34Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS (Protein Data Bank accession code 1RAX), and the Ubl domain of Hhr23B (35Fujiwara K. Tenno T. Sugasawa K. Jee J.G. Ohki I. Kojima C. Tochio H. Hiroaki H. Hanaoka F. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4760-4767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Sequence similarity between the CoB Ubl domain and these proteins is very low (only 4–16% identity) with a majority of the type-conserved residues belonging to the hydrophobic core. Low sequence similarity has hindered the identification of Ubl domains in CoB sequences from other species, leading to the suggestion that the human (tubulin-specific chaperone B) and S. cerevisiae (Alf1) orthologs lack this N-terminal domain (36Hartmann-Petersen R. Gordon C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, we verified the presence of the Ubl domain in all of the sequences shown by using the Fold and Function Assignment System server (37Rychlewski L. Jaroszewski L. Li W. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), which predicted significant similarity to ubiquitin for all cofactor B sequences in a search of the Pfam data base. A key feature of the backbone structure of the CoB Ubl domain is the flexible loop (residues 52–56) between strands β3 and β4. This loop contains two solvent-exposed Asp residues, which are conserved among the mammalian CoB Ubl domains. Absent in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related modifier proteins, in the UBX, PB1, and caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD) domains this loop is important for interactions with binding partners (34Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 39Otomo T. Sakahira H. Uegaki K. Nagata S. Yamazaki T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of its recurring functional role, a scheme proposed for classification of ubiquitin-like domains would take the length of the β3–β4 loop into account (34Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The UBX domain is defined in part by a conserved Phe-Pro sequence motif in the 4-residue loop; thus, along with other differences, CoB Ubl cannot be categorized as a UBX domain. However, as discussed below, it displays striking similarities to the CAD domain of ICAD and the PB1 domain type I, both of which contain conserved acidic residues within a 5-residue loop (39Otomo T. Sakahira H. Uegaki K. Nagata S. Yamazaki T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The DCX domain was recently reported to be the first known microtubule-binding module with a canonical ubiquitin fold (41Kim M.H. Cierpicki T. Derewenda U. Krowarsch D. Feng Y. Devedjiev Y. Dauter Z. Walsh C.A. Otlewski J. Bushweller J.H. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both the solution structure of the N-terminal DCX domain (one of two homologous tandem domains) from human doublecortin (Protein Data Bank accession code 1MJD) and the crystal structure of the equivalent domain from human doublecortin-like kinase (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1MFW and 1MG4) were determined. Although the DCX and CoB Ubl sequences display only 20% similarity, they are structurally similar with an r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å between the α carbons of 72 equivalent positions (Fig. 4E). Like CoB Ubl, the DCX domain contains a 4-residue β3–β4 loop, whereas it has longer loops on either end of the α-helix. In addition, a short 310 helix is found in an extended C-terminal sequence, and specific interactions with a Trp sidechain anchor the C-terminal helix to the DCX domain. Although the CoB N-terminal construct examined in this study contains a similar sequence extension, none of the analogous stabilizing interactions between the Ubl domain and C terminus appear to be present, as shown by the enhanced mobility detected by NMR. Putative Tubulin-binding Residues—It has been shown that CoB sequesters α-tubulin from the CCT chaperonin and maintains it in an activated quasi-native conformation before passing it on to CoE (6Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). CoB and CoE each contain a Ubl domain and a CAP-Gly domain, though the order of domains is reversed between the two proteins. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in fission yeast, where the CoB ortholog, Alp11, is essential for viability, that the Ubl domain performs the necessary function of CoB (42Radcliffe P.A. Toda T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the CoB CAP-Gly domain, a known plus-end microtubule-binding domain, is not essential and appears to play a role in stabilizing binding to α-tubulin. Thus, it can be inferred that CoB Ubl contains an α-tubulin interaction surface, and by analogy the C-terminal Ubl domain of CoE may display a similar binding site. A comparison of 15 CoB Ubl and 14 CoE Ubl sequences (data not shown) reveals only three solvent-exposed residues that are highly type-conserved in both cofactors: a pair of basic residues in strand 2 (Lys20, Lys21) and a hydrophobic residue (Val38) in the α-helix (Fig. 5). These residues all cluster on the same face, and therefore it is possible that binding of CoB and CoE to α-tubulin involves these conserved residues. Furthermore, each cofactor has an additional conserved basic residue on the same surface, but in different positions on the α-helix, that could also be involved in electrostatic interactions with α-tubulin: Lys34 in CoB and Arg442 in CoE. Because α-tubulin has a negatively charged surface, it is not surprising that a putative α-tubulin-binding surface would contain basic residues. The doublecortin protein is essential for normal development of the cerebral cortex, and a number of disease-causing missense mutations map to the surface of the tandem ubiquitin-like DCX domains that bind microtubules (41Kim M.H. Cierpicki T. Derewenda U. Krowarsch D. Feng Y. Devedjiev Y. Dauter Z. Walsh C.A. Otlewski J. Bushweller J.H. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although there is little sequence conservation between CoB Ubl and DCX, many of the doublecortin mutations are likely to affect the electrostatic potential and cluster in the same region of the C-terminal DCX domain surface as the putative α-tubulin-binding residues of the CoB and CoE Ubl domains described above. Because C-DCX binds to tubulin heterodimers and microtubules rather than free tubulin monomers, the details of those interactions may differ from those of CoB with α-tubulin. However, one of the disease-causing doublecortin substitutions is an Arg residue (Arg196) that is found on strand β2, in a location analogous to the CoB Ubl “KK” motif. Thus, the cluster of basic residues on the CoB surface may serve a common functional role with similar microtubule binding elements of the doublecortin DCX domains. The only known structure of a protein that binds monomeric tubulin is that of cofactor A (10Steinbacher S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1029-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Guasch A. Aloria K. Perez R. Avila J. Zabala J.C. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although its structure, a three-helix bundle, is completely different from that of CoB, like CoB Ubl its surface is highly hydrophilic. Cofactor A binding to β-tubulin, which is highly homologous to α-tubulin, was studied using cofactor A peptides, and three interaction sites were identified (11Guasch A. Aloria K. Perez R. Avila J. Zabala J.C. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These sites contain mostly polar residues, both positively and negatively charged, but also some hydrophobic residues. It is therefore likely that the α-tubulin binding sites of CoB and CoE involve additional charged and nonpolar residues. Also, variation in the specific elements responsible for cofactor-tubulin interactions is to be expected based on previous biochemical studies. The α-tubulin complex with CoE is not as stable as that with CoB, and unlike CoB, CoE binds both free α-tubulin and native tubulin heterodimers (6Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These differences in tubulin binding may arise from sequence features that distinguish the CoB and CoE Ubl domains from each other. For example, residues Glu19 and Pro23 on either side of the “KK” motif common to both proteins are uniquely conserved in CoB and CoE Ubl, respectively. Further structural or biochemical analysis of tubulin-cofactor complexes is needed to confirm functional roles for specific residues. Binding of Cofactor B and Cofactor E—Although the binding of CoB and CoE has been reported in fission yeast (43Radcliffe P.A. Hirata D. Vardy L. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2987-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the interaction has not been mapped to specific domains within either protein. Analysis of the CoB and CoE Ubl sequences revealed numerous basic residues in CoE Ubl that are not conserved in CoB Ubl (Fig. 5). This observation led us to speculate about the potential role for the Ubl domains to mediate the binding of CoB and CoE via electrostatic interactions, in a manner analogous to that of the recently defined PB1 (Phox and Bem1) domains (40Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and CAD domains (39Otomo T. Sakahira H. Uegaki K. Nagata S. Yamazaki T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), both of which display the ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold. PB1 domain heterodimerization is necessary for the function of a wide variety of protein complexes such as Bem1/Cdc24p, p40phox/p67phox, PKCζ/Par6, and MEK5/MEKK2 that are involved in diverse signaling pathways. The PB1 heterodimer is formed via docking of two acidic clusters on the type I domain with two basic clusters on the type II domain (38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, Fig. 6A). The type I PB1 domain is defined by a conserved sequence motif, the “OPCA motif,” made up of acidic residues located in the β3–β4 loop and an α-helix following strand β4 (45Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The only strictly conserved residue in type II PB1 domains is a basic residue found in strand β1. Similar to PB1 domain heterodimerization, the CAD domain of CAD contains two basic clusters that interact with two acidic clusters on the CAD domain of its inhibitor (ICAD-CAD domain) (Fig. 6A). The acidic residues in ICAD-CAD domain are similarly found in the β3–β4 loop and after strand β4. A homology model of CoE Ubl, based on the CoB Ubl structure and a sequence alignment optimized manually on the basis of multiple sequence alignments, was created using the automated model routine of the program Modeller (46Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar, 47Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The CoE Ubl model confirmed the presence of a basic region made up of Lys413 and Arg415 in strand β1, Arg425 and Arg426 in strand β2, Lys435 and Arg442 in helix α1, and Lys445 in the α1–α2 loop (Fig. 6B). Except for Arg425 and Arg426, these residues are conserved only in CoE Ubl and appear to be analogous to the residues of the PB1 and CAD domain basic clusters. Likewise, CoB Ubl contains conserved acidic residues within the β3–β4 loop (Asp54 and Asp55) as previously discussed. Additional acidic residues between strands β4 and β5 (Asp63, Asp70, Asp75) are found on the same face. Although acidic residues are not strictly conserved at these positions across species, a higher proportion of acidic residues than basic residues is found in the β3–β4, β4–α3, and α3–β5 loops of all sequences. Therefore, we hypothesize that, as observed in the PB1 and CAD heterodimers, acidic CoB residues may participate in electrostatic interactions with the basic residues of CoE Ubl. Additional residues, such as the conserved aromatic residue at position 71 of CoB Ubl, may be involved in the binding interface. Because of sequence variations and minor differences in tertiary structure, it is expected that a CoB/CoE complex would necessarily diverge in some respects from the examples set by the PB1 and CAD complexes. The interacting regions of a possible CoB/CoE complex are depicted in Fig. 6B; however, confirmation of this interaction must await further study. The β-Grasp Fold as a Ubiquitous Protein Interaction Domain—The CoB Ubl domain represents yet another example of the ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold as a scaffold for the presentation of residues involved in protein-protein interactions. Although the proposed interactions are electrostatic in nature, like those of the DCX, PB1, and CAD domains, ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like domains, such as UBX (34Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and elongin B (48Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), form complexes stabilized primarily by hydrophobic interactions. The versatility of the β-grasp fold appears to be a direct result of its stable hydrophobic core that requires a minimal level of sequence conservation. Thus, it is likely that as structural genomics efforts continue, many more new Ubl domain protein interactions will be discovered. We thank Adam Godzik for assistance with the cofactor E model and Kelly Kjer for assistance with protein purification."
https://openalex.org/W1965497112,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that regulates the response to cellular insults such as DNA damage and growth factor withdrawal. Transcriptional activity of p53 requires post-translational modification by phosphorylation and acetylation. This study used site-specific antibodies to demonstrate that nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment of PC12 cells results in p53 deacetylation at lysine (Lys) 382. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, measured by a direct fluorescent assay, was increased after NGF treatment and peaked before p53 deacetylation. Inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin blocked the deacetylation of p53 and its transcriptional activity toward a reporter gene construct. Comparison of PC12 with PC12 cells containing a temperature-sensitive, dominant-negative construct showed that p53 deacetylation required functional p53. Inhibitors of MAP kinase that block p53 transactivation and inhibitors of TrkA receptor also abolished HDAC activation, indicating that deacetylation of p53 is an NGF-dependent post-translational mechanism of p53 activation. Finally, NGF or serum withdrawal did not lead to p53 deacetylation. A model is proposed in which the acetylation status of Lys 382 of p53 discriminates between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis."

Indeed, the intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70, has been proposed to bind SHP-1 (9Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, the best evidence of SHP-1-associating molecules in other hemopoietic cells relates to the family of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-containing receptors (10Blery M. Vivier E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 1999; 37: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In particular, ITIM receptors Ly49 and CD66a associate with SHP-1 in subpopulations of primary T cells, but to date there has been no definition of the ITIM receptors that activate SHP-1 in the majority of mouse primary T cells (11Long E.O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 875-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In the first instance, we have exploited SHP-1-deficient moth-eaten T cells to assist in the definition of genuine associations between SHP-1 and TCR signaling components in CD3/TCR-stimulated mouse primary T cells. Our results reveal no binding of the CD3 invariant chains or ZAP-70 to SHP-1 in mouse primary T cells following TCR/CD3 ligation. However, by employing pervanadate (PV) to induce a robust tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in primary T cells, we demonstrated that a glycosylated tyrosyl phosphoprotein of 150 kDa, (pp150) associates with SHP-1 in mouse peripheral T cells. We have identified pp150 as CD22 and confirmed CD22 to be expressed in primary T cells. The expression of CD22 has until now been thought to be restricted to the B cell lineage. However, consistent with CD22 expression in T cells, the co-engagement of CD22 and CD3 results in a raising of TCR signaling thresholds. Remarkably, the absence of CD22 in T cells results in increased responses to CD3 or allogeneic stimulation. These combined findings highlight a previously unrecognized inhibitory role for CD22 in T cells. Cells—C57BL/6J mice heterozygous at the moth-eaten locus were originally obtained from Dr. Leonard Shultz at The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred under pathogen-free conditions as a source of me/me mutants or me/+ controls. me/me mutants or littermate me/+ controls bearing the F5 TCR were as described in Ref. 8Johnson K.G.

CD22 deficient mice (CD22–/–) backcrossed for 10 generations onto the C57/BL6J genetic background were kindly provided by Professor Michael Neuberger, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK. Lymph nodes from 8–12-week old CD22–/– and age-matched control mice were harvested as a source of T cells for proliferation assays. Spleens from 8–12-week old BALB/c mice provided a source of allogeneic feeder cells.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1763-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, and all yeast manipulations were performed according to standard yeast protocols. Competent yeast cells were prepared and transformed using the lithium acetate/Tris-EDTA/polyethylene glycol protocol. The cDNA for the library was generated from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from LSTRA lymphoma cells and synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer. cDNA was unidirectionally cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the yeast cloning vector HybriZAP-2.1 (Stratagene). cDNA library screening was performed using Ylck/BDSHP1SH2 (13Sathish J.G.

Approximately 3 × 109 cells were transformed with 100 μg of LSTRA library DNA and plated on minimal agar containing yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene, one of the reporter genes in the Ylck/BDSHP1SH2 strain. Transformation plates were incubated at 30 °C for 10–14 days. Large colonies were selected from these plates and streaked onto smaller plates with or without methionine but supplemented with histidine. Colonies were left to grow for 3 days and then filter-lifted and screened for protein-protein interactions using the lacZ reporter. β-Galactosidase activity was monitored using a freeze-thaw fracture assay. Positive clones were deemed to be those yeast that only turned blue on media lacking methionine. Library plasmid DNA was recovered from yeast by enzymatic disruption of the cell wall by treatment with Zymolyase®-100T (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA), alkaline lysis extraction, and amplification in Max-Efficiency DH5α™ Escherichia Coli (Invitrogen). Three colonies from each positive hit from the yeast β-galactosidase filter assay were grown for 3 days at 30 °C before DNA was extracted using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were re-introduced into the screening strain or Ylck with the Gal4 binding domain alone to confirm specificity. Sequence data were generated on a 3100 genetic analyzer using ABI Big Dye automated sequencing protocols (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Protein Purification and Identification—A GST fusion protein containing the two SH2 domains of SHP-1 prepared as described previously (17Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was used to isolate the SHP-1-associated pp150 from LSTRA cell lysates. LSTRA lysates (20 mg) were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST or the GST SH2 domain fusion protein (400 μg) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The bound proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, and deglycosylated as described above, resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained. Protein bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) as described (18Peng J. Gygi S.P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 19Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Digested samples were loaded onto a fused silica microcapillary C18 column (Magic, Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) prepared in-house (75-μm inner diameter, 10-cm long). An Agilent 1100 high-pressure liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) was used to deliver a gradient across a flow splitter to the column over 40 min. The column eluant was directed into an LCQ-Deca electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), and the eluting peptides were dynamically selected for fragmentation by the operating software. The acquired tandem mass spectrometer data were analyzed with the non-redundant mouse data base from NCBI using SEQUEST data base search tool for peptide identification (20Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). Proliferation Assays—Splenic T cells from either BALB/c or C57BL/6J mice were stimulated in vitro for 72 h with a titration of plate-bound anti-CD3 in conjunction with either anti-CD22 or isotype control antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Alternatively, lymph node T cells from CD22-deficient and age-matched C57BL/6J control mice were stimulated in vitro for 72 h with a titration of plate-bound anti-CD3 in conjunction with either anti-CD22 or an isotype control antibody. Allogeneic T cell stimulation was performed by incubating lymph node T cells from CD22-deficient and age-matched C57BL/6J control mice with different ratios of irradiated BALB/c spleen stimulator cells. [3H]Thymidine was added at 1 μCi/well for the final 16 h of culture before harvesting, and the incorporated radioactivity was assessed. Flow Cytometry—Splenocytes from BALB/c, C57BL/6J, and CD22-deficient were stained simultaneously with anti-TCRPE and either anti-CD22Bio or isotypeBio antibody for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed twice with Cell Wash (BD Biosciences), and secondary staining with streptavidinRed670 (Invitrogen) was performed for 20 min on ice. The cells were washed and acquired on the flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) and analyzed by CellQuest software. ZAP-70 Is Not a Genuine SHP-1 Binding Ligand—The functional analyses of T cells from SHP-1-deficient moth-eaten mice and T cells expressing a catalytically inactive dominant negative isoform of SHP-1 have demonstrated a role for SHP-1 in contributing to the thresholds of TCR activation (1Zhang J.

Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A corollary to these findings is that SHP-1 must be catalytically active in normal T cells as a consequence of a PY-dependent ligand engagement of its amino-terminal SH-2 domain. To reveal phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that bind to SHP-1 following TCR ligation we performed immunoprecipitations of SHP-1 from primary T cells isolated from SHP-1-deficient and littermate control T cells (Fig. 1A). In control T cells, a PY-containing protein of 72 kDa, established to be ZAP-70 by reprobing, was found co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-1 following CD3 triggering. However, ZAP-70 was also found co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-1 in lysates derived from SHP-1-deficient T cells perhaps because of the inadvertent immunoprecipitation of the activating anti-CD3 antibody, which itself co-immunoprecipitates ZAP-70 (21Straus D.B. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To circumvent spurious co-precipitation, SHP-1-deficient and control thymocytes bearing a transgenic TCR, F5, were stimulated with a cognate peptide presented by YO1 cells (Fig. 1B). SHP-1 immunoprecipitations from peptide/antigen-presenting cell-stimulated thymocytes resulted in no co-immunoprecipitation of ZAP-70, although the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 could be readily detected in a parallel anti-CD3 co-immunoprecipitation following peptide/antigen-presenting cell stimulation. We therefore concluded that the CD3/TCR triggering of mouse primary T cells does not induce the specific association of SHP-1 with CD3 or ZAP-70 proteins. pp150 Is the Major Tyrosine-phosphorylated Protein Associating with SHP-1 in Mouse Primary T Cells—A difficulty in identifying molecules associated with SHP-1 in primary T cells is that the physiological stimuli capable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of putative SHP-1 ligand(s) are unknown presently. However, the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation on a given protein is an outcome of the counteractive effects of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (22Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases by the potent inhibitor, pervanadate (PV), can lead to an accumulation of PY on those proteins, which are the normal substrates of protein-tyrosine kinases (23Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, PV may be utilized to ascertain those molecules potentially capable of associating with SHP-1 under physiological conditions in primary T cells. SHP-1 immunoprecipitations were performed on PV-stimulated splenic T cell blasts derived from a number of mouse strains including C57BL/6J, CBA, NOD, BALB/c, A/J, C3H, SWR, NIH, DBA, FVP, and SJL. The T cell blasts were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to have no B cell contamination (data not shown). The results demonstrated that for the majority of strains the most prominent PY protein consistently associating with SHP-1 in mouse peripheral T cells is one of 150 kDa (pp150), although additional weaker phosphoproteins of 75 and 45 kDa also were occasionally co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 and results not shown). In contrast to all other strains examined, strikingly, T cells from the strain C57BL/6J showed a much reduced level of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp150 associated with SHP-1 despite an equivalent immunoprecipitation of SHP-1 (Fig. 2 and results not shown). The differential association of pp150 and SHP-1 in T cells from C57BL/6J mice may be because of one or more genetic differences in the expression of the pp150 receptor, its ability to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and to associate with SHP-1, or a combination of these possibilities. Furthermore, anti-CD3 stimulation of T cells from the mouse strain BALB/c resulted in no pp150 associating with SHP-1, although pp150 was readily detected in association with SHP-1 following PV treatment of the same T cells (Fig. 3).Fig. 3SHP-1 associated pp150 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon anti-CD3 stimulation. T lymphoblasts from BALB/c mice were either left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 or PV, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either pre-immune (PI) or anti-SHP-1 sera. Immune complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for PY. The blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed for SHP-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) pp150 Is an N-Glycosylated, Membrane-associated Protein—We examined whether pp150 might represent a membrane-associated receptor. As the possession of N-linked carbohydrates is a common feature of plasma membrane receptors, SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from a lysate of T cells of the CBA strain, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to Endo F treatment. pp150 was indeed found to be N-glycosylated, as Endo F treatment accelerated its migration on SDS-PAGE to ∼130 kDa (Fig. 4A). We also performed SHP-1 immunoprecipitations on the P100 (membrane) fraction of PV-stimulated T cells and confirmed that pp150 is a membrane-associated protein (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that pp150 is a cell surface transmembrane receptor with an N-glycosylated extracellular domain. pp150 Is Identified as CD22—Previously, we reported a tyrosyl phosphoprotein around 150–160 kDa associated with SHP-1 in the mouse lymphoma, LSTRA, and it is possible that this protein corresponds to pp150 in primary T cells (17Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To identify pp150, a cDNA library was generated in the yeast-cloning vector, HybriZAP-2.1 using mRNA from the LSTRA cells. The HybriZAP-2.1 vector directs the expression of hybrid proteins encompassing the yeast Gal4 activation domain. The cDNA library was used to transform a stable yeast strain, Ylck/BDSHP1SH2 (13Sathish J.G. Johnson K.G. Fuller K.J. LeRoy F.G. Meyaard L. Sims M.J. Matthews R.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1763-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), that expresses the active form of the protein-tyrosine kinase Lck under a regulatable promoter and a chimeric cDNA encoding the tandem SH2 domains (amino acids 1–222) of SHP-1 fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4. In this yeast trihybrid vector system, the regulatable expression of Lck permits the identification of interactions between the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (13Sathish J.G. Johnson K.G. Fuller K.J. LeRoy F.G. Meyaard L. Sims M.J. Matthews R.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1763-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The transformation of Ylck/BDSHP1SH2 with the LSTRA cDNA library resulted in the identification of partial cDNAs encoding for the ITIM-containing receptors gp49B1, CD72, and CD22 (Table I). All cDNAs encoded for the ITIM-containing cytoplasmic region of each receptor. Of the three proteins, only the known molecular mass of CD22 (150 kDa) (24Torres R.M. Law C.L. Santos-Argumedo L. Kirkham P.A. Grabstein K. Parkhouse R.M. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2641-2649PubMed Google Scholar), as opposed to gp49B1 (49 kDa) (25Castells M.C. Wu X. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8393-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CD72 (45 kDa) (26Nakayama E. von Hoegen I. Parnes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1352-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), is consistent with the size of the major tyrosyl phosphoprotein (pp150) found co-immunoprecipitating with SHP-1 in primary T cells. However, thus far, only CD72 has been reported to be expressed on mouse primary T cells (27Robinson W.H. Landolfi M.M. Parnes J.R. Immunogenetics. 1997; 45: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Table IYeast trihybrid identification of SHP-1 SH2 domain-interacting proteinsCloneEncoded proteinResidue numbersNo. of isolatesA1-4gp49B1235-2804A5CD721-1991A6CD22767-8681 Open table in a new tab To confirm the identity of the LSTRA-derived pp150 protein, we purified this protein by affinity chromatography using a GST fusion protein column containing the SH2 domains of SHP-1 (17Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). LSTRA cell lysates were incubated with the purified GST fusion protein, and the bound protein was deglycosylated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. One major band corresponding to 150 kDa was visualized by silver staining before deglycosylation, and the band decreased to ∼110 kDa after deglycosylation (Fig. 5A). Mass spectrometric analysis identified both bands as CD22 (Fig. 5B), and immunoblot analysis using anti-CD22 antibodies confirmed this finding (Fig. 5C). Because CD22 is tyrosine-phosphorylated constitutively in LSTRA, one might expect SHP-1 to be bound constitutively to CD22 in LSTRA cells. Indeed, this can be readily demonstrated in reciprocal CD22 and SHP-1 immunoprecipitations from untreated LSTRA cells (Fig. 5D). To investigate whether the pp150 detected associating with SHP-1 on primary T cells corresponds to CD22, SHP-1 immunoprecipitations from T lymphoblasts generated from BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains were immunoblotted for CD22. Fig. 6A demonstrates that CD22 is indeed identical to SHP-1 associated pp150. Interestingly, the amount of CD22 associating with SHP-1 is significantly reduced in C57BL/6J-versus BALB/c-derived T cells. This result provides an explanation for the previous finding that the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp150 associating with SHP-1 is reduced in C57BL/6J-derived T cells. The strain differences may reflect a reduction in the T cell expression of CD22 or an inability of CD22 to associate with SHP-1 in T cells of the C57BL/6J strain. To distinguish between these possibilities, CD22 was directly immunoprecipitated from T lymphoblasts generated from BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains and immunoblotted for CD22. Fig. 6B indicates that the level of expression of CD22 is reduced in T cells derived from the C57BL/6J strain. However, the strain differences in CD22 expression are restricted to T lymphocytes, because the level of expression of CD22 in B lymphocytes is equivalent between the two strains (Fig. 6C).

On the other hand, several groups noted that LPA was capable of eliciting one or another of its characteristic cellular or signaling responses in cells in which EGF and PDGF did not elicit such responses (e.g. migration (26Sakai T. de la Pena J.M.

We and others have shown that the antiapoptotic effect of LPA requires ERK1/2 activation (27Sautin Y. Crawford J. Svetlov S. Am. J.

Van Middlesworth L. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 206-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells. In these cells, LPA-elicited phosphorylation of the EGFR was inhibited by AG1478 but not by PTX, raising the question of whether EGFR transphosphorylation is required for ERK1/2 activation. Despite the many reports on GPCR-induced phosphorylation of RTK, the role of such transregulation in the modulation of distinct cellular responses elicited by LPA remains unknown. Rubio et al. (31Rubio I. Rennert K. Wittig U. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) recently provided evidence for a parallel signaling network connecting LPA receptors to EGFR and ERK1/2 activation. These authors, using COS-7 cells, distinguished an EGFR-dependent, AG1478-inhibited basal nucleotide turnover on Ras in addition to an LPA-activated, PTX-sensitive component requiring Gi/o proteins, but not EGFR, both of which were required for the robust activation of ERK1/2. The EGFR-dependent permissive activation of Ras was mediated by the canonical SHC/Grb2/Sos system because SHC phosphorylation was not inhibited by PTX, as has been noted by other investigators too (20Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The mechanism mediating the Gi-controlled increase in Ras nucleotide exchange rate remains unclear but might involve the Ras-GRF/CDC25Mm exchange factor that is directly regulated by the Gβγ subunits (32Mattingly R.R. Saini V. Macara I.G. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G.

In this context, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC seems to be a sensitive indicator whether the EGFR-dependent branch of the parallel pathway is activated by LPA or not. In the present study, we evaluated the role of EGFR transregulation in three distinct ERK1/2-dependent cellular responses (antiapoptosis, migration, and proliferation) elicited by LPA using a receptor add-back model in B82L cells that lack endogenous EGFR. The role of EGFR transregulation was tested by introducing wild-type human EGFR (35Li J. Lin M.L. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol.

Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar), and EGFRY845F with its Src phosphorylation site mutated (38Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that in EGFR-null B82L cells, LPA GPCR are capable of eliciting the three hallmark biological responses independent of the transactivation of PDGFR, ErbB2 and IGF RTK. However, LPA-elicited proliferative and migratory responses, but not the antiapoptotic response, are markedly modulated by EGFR transactivation through a mechanism that does not require EGFR tyrosine kinase activity or a Src phosphorylation site but requires intact autophosphorylation sites to enable tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC for full-blown activation of ERK1/2.

B82L cells were transfected with pREK5-EGFRY5F construct (B82-Y5F), kindly provided by Dr. Ivan Dikic, (Goethe University Medical School, Frankfurt, Germany), or pCDNA3-EGFRY845F (B82-YF), a gift from Dr. Sally Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), and selected by supplementing the medium with 200 μg/ml G418. The G418-resistant cells were used without further subcloning. The medium was changed every other day. Subconfluent cells were washed twice and replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum the night before experiments unless indicated otherwise. RT-PCR Analysis of Receptor Transcripts—Total RNA was isolated from cells with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with oligo-(dT)20 using the ThermoScrip RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesized from 250 ng of RNA was amplified with TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase (PanVera, Madison, WI) using 30 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR primers were used to amplify EGFR (5′-CTGGAAGAGACCTGCATTATCA-3′ and 5′-TCATGCTCCAATAAACTCACTGC-3′, 277 bp), PDGFR (5′-AGATTCACCTGGACTTCCTAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTACAGGAAGCTGTCCTCCACC-3′, 370 bp), and IGFR (5′-ACTTATGCGCATGTGCTGGCAG-3′ and 5′-TCATGTGAGCGTAAGGCTGTCT-3′, 332 bp). PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Measuring LPA Receptor Expression by Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 106 cells using TRIzol reagent and digested with amplification grade DNaseI (Invitrogen). Reverse-transcription of 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was made using ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) with oligo-dT primer. Quantitative PCR was performed applying the real-time SYBR Green PCR technology with the use of an ABI sequence detection system 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The human LPA1-, LPA2-, and LPA3-specific primers were designed with Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems), and their sequences were as follows: LPA1, 5′-CCACCTTCAGGCAGATCCTGTGT-3′and 5′-AGGCAGAGCGGTCAGAGCCTT-3′; LPA2, 5′-TATTCCTGCCGAGATGCTGAG A-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCGGAGACA CATGCA-3′; LPA3, 5′-GGGTCTGGTGGTTCTG CTGCT-3′ and 5′-GAACCAGC GCTTCACGTGTT-3′; and for GAPDH, 5′-AAGCTCA CTGGCATGGCCTT-3′ and 5′-CGGCATGTCAGATCCACAAC-3′. Amplification reaction was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and thermal cycling condition were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Abundance of mRNA was calculated based on cycle threshold values as described previously (39Wang D.A. Du H. Jaggar J.H. Brindley D.N. Tigyi G.J. Watsky M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1646-C1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the expression of LPA receptor mRNA was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression. Every PCR assay was performed at least three times, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparison of mRNA expression for the target genes was evaluated with the use of analysis of variance. Apoptosis Detection by DNA Fragmentation Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—To induce apoptosis, B82L cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α plus 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h. DNA fragmentation was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following the procedure provided with the Cell Death Detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Roche (Indianapolis, IN) as described previously (29Deng W. Balazs L. Wang D.A. Van Middlesworth L. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 206-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Deng W. Wang D.A. Gosmanova E. Johnson L.R. Tigyi G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G821-G829Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was expressed as absorbance units per microgram of protein per minute. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For detection of ERK1/2, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline once, then lysed in ice-cold M-PER (Pierce Chemical) protein extraction buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. For detection of EGFR, PDGFR, or IGFR, cells were lysed in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin. The protein concentration was quantified using the BCA kit (Pierce Chemical). ERK 1/2 and its phosphorylated forms were detected by Western blotting. Twenty micrograms (50 μg for the detection of IGFR) of protein was mixed with an equal amount of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, denatured by boiling for 5 min, followed by separation in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) bovine serum in 10 mm phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature and probed with the primary antibody for 1 h. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 for 1 h, followed by four washes, and developed with the ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA). EGFR, IGFR, ErbB2, and PDGFR were also immunoprecipitated and then probed by Western blotting. In brief, 500 μg of protein/ml of cell lysate was precleared by adding 20 μl of 10% (w/v) protein A/G PLUS-Agarose. After gentle shaking for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg/ml chicken anti-IGFR IgY overnight with agitation followed by addition of 10 μgof rabbit anti-chicken IgG conjugated protein A/G PLUS-Agarose. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting as described above. Proliferation and Wound Healing Migration Assays—LPA-stimulated DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. B82L or B82L-EGFR cells were seeded in 12-well plates. When 70–80% confluent, the cells were washed and transferred into serum-free medium, left overnight, and then exposed to freshly prepared LPA or vehicle. After 16 h of incubation, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml; 25 Ci/mmol) for an additional 8 h, and the radioactivity incorporated was measured by liquid scintillation counting after 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Wound healing migration assays were performed as described previously (40Ray R.M. Patel A. Viar M.J. McCormack S.A. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). B82L cells were seeded to 60-mm dishes, grown to confluence, and serum-starved overnight. The cell monolayer was wounded with a gel-loading microtip. Dishes were washed and exposed to LPA (up to 20 μm) or vehicle, and the area of migration was digitally photographed at desired time intervals with the use of NIH Image software (ver. 1.58). Cell migration was calculated as wound area covered by cells at specific times. Each experiment was carried out three times in duplicate, and each plate had two wounds. Thus, the migration results represent the mean of 12 individual measurements. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. or S.D. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Student's t test was used for comparison between the control and the drug treatment groups. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine whether transfection of the different EGFR mutants had a significant effect on the migration and proliferation of the clones and for the comparison of LPA-induced enhancement of migration and proliferation between the individual cell types. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Profiling of LPA and RTK Receptors in B82L Cells—RT-PCR analysis revealed that B82L cells expressed transcripts for the three LPA receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene family (Fig. 1A). The expression of LPA receptor transcripts determined by quantitative RT-PCR was identical in wild-type B82L cells and in the B82L clones stably expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR (Fig. 1A). In agreement with previous reports (23Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Shultz G. Guderman T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Li J. Lin M.L. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), B82L cells did not express EGFR transcript and protein (Fig. 1, B and C). In B82L cells stably transfected with wild-type EGFR, Western blot analysis readily detected the expression of the receptor protein in the cell lysate (Fig. 1C). Abundant PDGFR and IGFR transcripts were detected in B82L cells (Fig. 1B). We also detected the expression of ErbB2 and PDGFR protein (see below). Although we found IGFR transcripts in B82L cells (Fig. 1B), we detected only trace amounts of IGFR protein using immunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting, although the antibody we used readily detected the mouse IGFR in F32 VIII C4 mouse hybridoma cells used as positive control (C4; Fig. 1D). Although 10 ng/ml IGF induced a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGFR in C4 cells, we failed to detect any increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated IGFR in B82L cells after a 5-min treatment (Fig. 1D). These results discount the IGFR as a major potential target of LPA transphosphorylation in B82L cells. Thus, we focused our studies on the PDGFR and ErbB2 receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1975515506,"Id1 is a helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor that controls growth and survival of neuronal cells. Downregulation of Id1 expression is required to initiate differentiation and cell-cycle withdrawal in primary neuronal culture as well as in PC12 cells. The HIV-1 transactivating factor, Tat, has been suspected of causing neuronal dysfunction that often leads to the development of HIV-associated dementia in AIDS patients. We found that the expression of Tat in PC12 cells promotes serum-independent growth, formation of large colonies in soft agar, and the acceleration of tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, Tat showed the ability to inhibit the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Our results show that the Tat-mediated signaling events, which lead to serum-independent growth and the inhibition of NGF-induced differentiation, have a common cellular target: the upregulation of Id1 expression. In the absence of NGF, expression of Id1 is required to promote serum-independent proliferation of PC12/Tat cells, as the inhibition of Id1 by antisense DNA restored the serum-dependent growth of PC12/Tat cells. In the presence of NGF, Tat utilizes an additional pathway that involves phosphorylation of Stat5a, to upregulate Id1 expression and block neuronal cell differentiation. Suppression of Stat5a by use of its dominant-negative mutant reversed the transient expression of Id1 and the blockage of NGF-mediated differentiation in PC12/Tat cells. Finally, the treatment of PC12 cells with recombinant Tat also enhanced the NGF-induced Id1 expression, further pointing to Id1 as a target for Tat. Taken together, these studies suggest additional targets for Tat action in neuronal cells and provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of neuronal functions."
https://openalex.org/W2143863361,"The nitrogenous pi -acceptor ligand 4-cyanopyridine (4CNPy) exhibits reversible ligation to ferrous heme in the flavocytochrome P450 BM3 (Kd=1.8 microm for wild type P450 BM3) via its pyridine ring nitrogen. The reduced P450-4CNPy adduct displays unusual spectral properties that provide a useful spectroscopic handle to probe particular aspects of this P450. 4CNPy is competitively displaced upon substrate binding, allowing a convenient route to the determination of substrate dissociation constants for ferrous P450 highlighting an increase in P450 substrate affinity on heme reduction. For wild type P450 BM3, Kd(red)(laurate)=82.4 microm (cf. Kd(ox)=364 microm). In addition, an unusual spectral feature in the red region of the absorption spectrum of the reduced P450-4CNPy adduct is observed that can be assigned as a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). It was discovered that the energy of this MLCT varies linearly with respect to the P450 heme reduction potential. By studying the energy of this MLCT for a series of BM3 active site mutants with differing reduction potential (Em), the relationship EMLCT + (3.53 x = Em 17,005 cm)(-1) was derived. The use of this ligand thus provides a quick and accurate method for predicting the heme reduction potentials of a series of P450 BM3 mutations using visible spectroscopy, without the requirement for redox potentiometry."
https://openalex.org/W2037992763,"The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes nine homologues of mammalian glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters. Two of these C. elegans proteins (AAT-1 and AAT-3) have been shown to function as catalytic subunits (light chains) of heteromeric amino acid transporters. These proteins need to associate with a glycoprotein heavy chain subunit (ATG-2) to reach the cell surface in a manner similar to that of their mammalian homologues. AAT-1 and AAT-3 contain a cysteine residue in the second putative extracellular loop through which a disulfide bridge can form with a heavy chain. In contrast, six C. elegans members of this family (AAT-4 to AAT-9) lack such a cysteine residue. We show here that one of these transporter proteins, AAT-9, reaches the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes without an exogenous heavy chain and that it functions as an exchanger of aromatic amino acids. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments demonstrate that AAT-9 displays a substrate-activated conductance. Immunofluorescence shows that it is expressed close to the pharyngeal bulbs within C. elegans neurons. The selective expression of an aat-9 promoter-green fluorescent protein construct in several neurons of this region and in wall muscle cells around the mouth supports and extends these localization data.

The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans contains >750 genes encoding proteins thought to be involved in transmembrane transport processes. This represents ∼4% of the total estimated number of genes. Most of these proteins are functionally not characterized, and their roles are predicted based on phylogenetic inference (1Strange K. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 377-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Among these putative transporter genes, nine encode homologues of heteromeric amino acid transporter catalytic subunits. Mammalian heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, heteromeric amino acid transporters; AAT, C. elegans amino acid transporter catalytic subunit; ATG, C. elegans amino acid transporter glycoprotein subunit; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: HAT, heteromeric amino acid transporters; AAT, C. elegans amino acid transporter catalytic subunit; ATG, C. elegans amino acid transporter glycoprotein subunit; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. are composed of two subunits. In addition to a catalytic subunit (the light chain), there is a type II glycoprotein subunit (the heavy chain). The light chain must associate with the heavy chain for functional expression at the cell surface (2Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This association is stabilized by a disulfide bridge formed between two highly conserved cysteine residues (7Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Only three of the nine C. elegans catalytic subunit homologues display this conserved cysteine. In a previous study (8Veljkovic E. Stasiuk S. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we characterized two of these three catalytic subunits, AAT-1 and AAT-3. These subunits functionally interact with ATG-2, a C. elegans glycoprotein subunit homologue. Because the remaining six light chain homologues, AAT-4 to AAT-9, do not have the conserved cysteine, we hypothesize that these homologues may not need interaction with a heavy chain for functional surface localization. In addition, these six light chain homologues are phylogenetically more distant than AAT-1, AAT-2, and AAT-3 from the mammalian catalytic subunits. Fig. 1 illustrates the phylogenetic relationship between members of the AAT protein family in C. elegans and selected human homologues. We have now observed that AAT-9 (WormBase gene number Y53H1C.1) expressed alone in Xenopus oocyte localizes to the cell surface. We have therefore investigated its putative transport function in this expression system. Our results show that it transports aromatic amino acid substrates most likely by obligatory exchange and displays a substrate-activated anion conductance. Localization experiments in C. elegans showed that it is expressed in some neurons and in muscular cells. Extraction of RNA from mixed stage C. elegans, cDNA synthesis, cloning into an Xenopus oocyte cRNA expression vector, and in vitro cRNA synthesis were all performed as described previously (8Veljkovic E. Stasiuk S. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA for aat-9 (Worm Base gene number Y53H1C.1) was amplified by reverse transcription PCR using the primers 5′-GATCGGCGCGCCATGTCATCAATAGAAGATCTC-3′ (aat-9 forward) and 5′-CTTGCGGCCGCTTACAGACGAGTCATTGGC-3′ (aat-9 reverse) designed according to the predicted initiation and termination sequence of the aat-9 gene. These primers contained restriction sites to facilitate cloning into the cRNA expression vector pSD5easy (9Puoti A. May A. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5949-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Uptakes—Oocyte preparation and cRNA injection were carried out according to previously described procedures (8Veljkovic E. Stasiuk S. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Pfeiffer R. Loffing J. Rossier G. Bauch C.

Briefly, injected oocytes were incubated for 72 h in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH) supplemented with tetracycline (50 mg/l). Then, seven oocytes per condition were washed six times in either +Na+ (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH) or -Na+ (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH) buffer and pre-incubated for 2 min at 25 °C. Subsequently, oocytes were transferred to +Na+ or -Na+ buffer containing the substrate at the indicated concentration with the corresponding radiolabeled tracer for the given time (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). Further oocyte treatment, washing, and individual counting of radioactivity incorporated has been described elsewhere (8Veljkovic E. Stasiuk S. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mean uptake rate of endogenous oocyte transporters (H2O-injected control oocytes) was subtracted (with the exception of results presented in Fig. 4A) from each uptake value obtained from oocytes expressing AAT-9. Concentration Dependence—Uptake experiments to determine concentration-dependence were undertaken at five different concentrations of l-Phe. Values obtained in two different experiments were normalized to the mean uptake rate at 3 mm l-Phe. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fit to the experimental data to obtain an estimate of the apparent substrate affinity using GraphPad Prism version 3.02 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Efflux—For efflux experiments, oocytes were injected with 5 nmol of l-Phe dissolved in water containing 1 nCi of l-[3H]Phe as the tracer. Injected oocytes were transferred to +Na+ solution that was supplemented with 1 mm l-Phe as indicated. Five-microliter aliquots of the incubation solution were taken at 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 60 min and counted by liquid scintillation. The percentage of l-Phe efflux was calculated as described earlier, subtracting the efflux measured in oocytes not expressing the transporter (8Veljkovic E. Stasiuk S. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transstimulation—oocytes expressing AAT-9 were injected with increasing amounts of cold l-Phe (in 50 nl of H2O) and incubated 10 min in ND96 buffer at 16 °C. Oocytes were then washed six times with ND96, and the uptake (1 min) of 1 mm l-Phe was measured as described above. The values obtained in three different experiments were normalized to the uptake measured in the absence of transstimulation (H2O-injected oocytes) and pooled. Electrophysiology—Oocytes expressing the AAT-9 transporter were placed in a small plexiglas superfusion chamber (0.2-ml volume) and continuously superfused (5 ml/min) with +Na+, -Na+ (see above), or -Cl- buffer (equimolar replacement of Cl- by MES). All experiments were performed at 20-22 °C. The substrate application did not exceed 20 s to avoid possible loading of the cell. The long-term stability of the preparations was monitored, and each new test solution was applied only when the holding current had returned to the previous control value. Oocytes were voltage-clamped using a custom-built, two-electrode voltage clamp. Cells were normally clamped at a holding potential of -50 mV (11Forster I. Hernando N. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Current-voltage curves were obtained using a staircase protocol in which the holding potential was stepped up from -120 to + 40 mV in 20-mV steps, each of 100-ms duration. Data were normalized to a values obtained at -100 mV in the +Na+ buffer. Polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide (NH2-SSIEDLPTVGDVAATRHQC-COOH) corresponding to the NH2 terminus of AAT-9. Peptide preparation, rabbit immunization, and antibody purification were made as described (12Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Oocyte treatment, freezing, cutting, and immunostaining were carried out as detailed elsewhere (8Veljkovic E.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An antibody dilution of 1:30 was used. Sections were viewed using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE TE300/200 inverted microscope). The aat-9::gfp transcriptional reporter gene was produced by PCR amplification of a 2.67-kb genomic fragment containing 2.4 kb of a 5′-promoter sequence and 270 bp of the AAT-9 open reading frame using the primers 5′-TTGCATGCAGAATCCGACGCCTTCTTGG-3′ (AAT-9 forward) and 5′-AAGTCGACCTCGAATCGACGTGCCTAGC-3′ (AAT-9 reverse). Conditions for the amplification were 98 °C for 10 s followed by 68 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles. The PCR product was cloned into SphI- and SalI-cut pPD95.69 in-frame with the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-encoding DNA (kindly provided by A. Fire). Transgenic animals were generated by injecting the DNA at the concentration 100 ng/μl into both arms of the syncytial gonad as described (15Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). The plasmid pUNC119 (20 ng/μl) was used as a transformation marker (16Maduro M. Pilgrim D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 977-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard methods were used for laboratory cultivation of the N2 variety of the C. elegans Bristol strain (17Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The animals from one plate were washed three times with 1 ml of 1× PBS buffer. To break the cuticle and permeabilize the animals, 500 μl of freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (2% paraformaldehyde, 12 mm NaOH, and 1 mm HCl in 1× PBS) and 500 μl of 2× RWB buffer (160 mm KCl, 40 mm NaCl, 20 mm EGTA, 10 mm spermidine-HCl, 30 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, and 50% methanol) were added, and the worms were frozen and thawed three times in liquid nitrogen and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The animals were subsequently washed three times with TTB buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA). To permeabilize the cells, the worms were then incubated in TTB buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 2% β-mercaptoethanol for at least 6 h at 37 °C. The worms were washed twice in 4× borate buffer (80 mm H3BO3 and 40 mm NaOH) and incubated with shaking for 15 min at room temperature in 4× borate buffer containing 10 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol. Then, the animals were washed twice with 4× borate buffer and incubated with shaking for 15 min at room temperature in 4× borate buffer containing 10 μl of H2O2. After washing two times with 4× borate buffer, the worms were incubated with shaking for 15 min at room temperature in ABA solution (1× PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin). Overnight incubation in 200 μl of ABA containing an antibody against AAT-9 (1:50 dilution) was performed at 4 °C. The next day the worms were washed three times in PBST (1× PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100), incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 200 μl of ABA with 2 μl of secondary anti-rabbit antibody (donkey anti-rabbit; Alexa-Fluor) and again washed three times in PBST. To stain nuclei, 1:1000 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added in the last washing step. Worms were mounted in Moviol. Fluorescent images were recorded with a Leica DMRA wide field fluorescent microscope equipped with a coded charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-ER) controlled by the Openlab 3.0 software package (Improvision). Localization of the AAT-9 fusion protein was analyzed with a Leica TCS4 confocal microscope. AAT-9 Transports Amino Acids When Expressed Alone in Xenopus Oocytes—Unlike the mammalian light chain subunits of HATs and the C. elegans light chain subunits AAT-1 and AAT-3, which must associate with an exogenous heavy chain subunit to reach the membrane surface, AAT-9 localizes to the plasma membrane of X. laevis oocytes when expressed alone. This finding was shown by immunofluorescence on cryosections of oocytes expressing AAT-9 (Fig. 2) and corroborated by the results of functional uptake experiments (see below). These facts, however, do not exclude the possibility that AAT-9 interacts with an endogenous oocyte protein to reach the oocyte surface. Neuronal and Muscle Cell Localization of AAT-9 in C. elegans—The localization of AAT-9 in vivo was investigated by introducing a construct containing a GFP gene under the control of the aat-9 promoter region by injecting it into the syncytial gonad of C. elegans. The transgenic progeny containing this extrachromosomal aat-9::gfp fusion construct showed a strong specific signal in the neuronal body, the position (lateral to the anterior pharyngeal bulb) and morphology (Fig. 3B, arrow) of which resemble those of the specifically stained neuron detected by immunofluorescence (see below). In addition, a prominent signal was present in a symmetrical pair of neurons also located in the vicinity of the anterior pharyngeal bulb. With processes running toward the tip of the animals extreme anterior (Fig. 3C, arrow), this pair of neurons displays a typical feature of chemosensory neurons exposed to the environment through specialized structures in the cuticle. A less prominent signal was observed in several additional neuronal bodies localized between the two pharyngeal bulbs. In addition, a signal was visible in the body wall muscles around the worm mouth (Fig. 3, B and C, arrowheads). The signal detected in the posterior region (Fig. 3B, asterisk) was considered autofluorescence (as visible in other animals). Immunostaining of AAT-9 in whole wild type worms (Fig. 3D) showed a weak but reproducible signal in at least one anterior neuronal body (arrow) and its process. A strong, non-homogenous, presumably non-specific staining (Fig. 3D, asterisk) was also observed in the head of the worm (as with other antibodies). The extended localization observed with the transcriptional construct suggests that AAT-9 is expressed in several additional neurons and muscle cells, possibly at a lower level than in the neuron labeled by immunofluorescence. AAT-9 Exchanges Aromatic Amino Acids and l-Dopa—Uptake of the amino acid l-Phe was observed in X. laevis oocytes expressing only the AAT-9 transporter (Fig. 4A). Co-expression of C. elegans heavy chain homologues (ATG-1 or ATG-2) further increased this uptake by up to 85%. The substrate selectivity of AAT-9 was investigated using various labeled amino acids. To exclude the effect of endogenous amino acid transporters from Xenopus oocytes and to analyze only the transport induced by AAT-9, the mean values measured for H2O-injected oocytes from the same donor frog were subtracted. Fig. 4B shows the uptake rate of different amino acids relative to that of l-Phe (the mean l-Phe uptake rate was ∼200 pmol/h per oocyte). l-Phe was found to be the preferred amino acid substrate of AAT-9. This protein also transported other aromatic amino acids, namely l-Trp, l-Tyr, and l-dopa (a non-proteogenic neurotransmitter precursor) (Fig 4, B and C). In contrast to l-dopa, l-dopamine was not a substrate for AAT-9. The uptake of l-Val, l-Met, l-Leu, and l-His was not significantly above background, and other proteogenic amino acids did not appear to be transported. The uptake of l-Phe in the absence of sodium (Fig. 4D) was reduced by 50% compared with that observed in the presence of 100 mm NaCl. Interestingly, as detailed later, a reduction of the substrate-induced conductance was also observed in the absence of sodium (Fig. 7B). The time-course of l-Phe uptake at a concentration of 1 mm is shown in Fig. 5A. These data indicated that 1 min was an appropriate incubation time (linear phase) for measuring concentration-dependence. The uptake rate of l-Phe was determined at five different concentrations, background values were subtracted, and the data were normalized to those obtained for 3 mm l-Phe. Because saturation could not be reached, only an approximate apparent Km of ≥0.7 mm could be derived from the fitting of the Michaelis-Menten function (Fig. 5B). Efflux of l-Phe via AAT-9 Is an Obligatory Exchange—Fig. 6A shows the results of efflux experiments on oocytes expressing AAT-9. Oocytes were injected with 5 nmol of l-Phe with a tracer (this results in an intracellular concentration of injected l-Phe of ∼12.5 mm, assuming a distribution volume of ∼400 nl). The amount of substrate efflux was measured at different time points in the presence (Fig. 6A, continuous line) or absence (Fig. 6A, dotted line) of 1 mm l-Phe in the extracellular buffer. In the absence of extracellular substrate, the amount of l-Phe efflux was negligible. In contrast, a rapid efflux of a substantial amount of substrate was observed in the presence of extracellular l-Phe. The question whether substrate influx could take place by facilitated diffusion (without exchange) was addressed using transstimulation as described by Meier et al. (18Meier C. Ristic Z. Klauser S. Verrey F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and is shown in Fig. 6B. The substantial increase in l-Phe uptake with increasing intracellular l-Phe suggests that inward facilitated diffusion is not as efficient as exchange. However, we can not exclude the possibility that facilitated diffusion could take place in the absence of an intracellular ligand (empty carrier switching from an inward facing binding site configuration to an outward facing configuration in the absence of a ligand), because oocytes, like all cells, always contain endogenous amino acids. Substrate-activated Ion Conductance of AAT-9 Transporter Uncoupled from Its Transport Function—The application of a near-saturating concentration of l-Phe to oocytes that expressed the AAT-9 protein and were voltage-clamped at -50 mV resulted in the activation of an inward current (IL-PHE) that was typically 10-fold larger than that observed in non-injected oocytes from the same donor frog (Fig. 7A). To determine the ionic components of this substrate-dependent current, we performed ion substitution experiments over a range of membrane potentials (-120 mV < V < 40 mV) (Fig. 7 B). Recordings obtained in the absence of l-Phe were subtracted, and the currents for the same oocyte were normalized to IL-PHE in the standard external bath solution at a voltage of -100 mV (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, substitution of external Na+ ions with an equimolar concentration of choline resulted in an ∼50% reduction in the current at all potentials without a significant shift in the reversal potential. This result indicated that although external Na+ may contribute to IL-PHE, the conductance pathway was not exclusively selective for this ion. Second, the substitution of 94% of external Cl- with MES resulted in a clear depolarizing shift in the reversal potential from -36 mV to +20 mV, as would be expected if the pathway was selective for Cl- ions and followed a Nernstian relationship for the reversal potential. Moreover, we did not observe a correlation between membrane potential and l-Phe flux by measuring l-Phe uptake on voltage-clamped oocytes (data not shown). This suggested that IL-PHE was thermodynamically uncoupled from the substrate flux. Similar findings with respect to the Cl- component of IL-PHE have been reported for the ASCT-1 amino acid exchanger (19Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and glutamate transporters (20Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). We have characterized a novel C. elegans amino acid transporter, AAT-9, that is a homologue of mammalian heteromeric amino acid transporter light chain subunits. AAT-9 exhibits 28-33% identity with several vertebrate homologues (8Veljkovic E. Stasiuk S. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Unlike the C. elegans proteins AAT-1 and AAT-3 and all mammalian and non-mammalian members of the HAT family characterized to date, AAT-9 can reach the Xenopus oocyte cell membrane and perform transport without interacting with an exogenous heavy chain. The possibility that the AAT-9 transporter interacts with unknown endogenous Xenopus laevis protein(s) that might mediate its functional surface localization is not excluded. The AAT-9 transporter belongs to the subgroup of the AAT family that does not have a conserved cysteine in the second putative extracellular loop. In mammalian homologues, this cysteine forms a disulfide bridge with the heavy chain and stabilizes the subunit interaction. However, whereas AAT-9 does not exhibit this prominent feature of HATs, our results show a further increase in substrate uptake (70-85%; Fig. 4A) by oocytes co-expressing ATG-1 or ATG-2 heavy chains with the AAT-9 light chain. This increase might be due to a non-covalent interaction between the heavy chain and the light chain that stabilizes AAT-9 in the membrane. The nature of the interaction of AAT-9 with C. elegans heavy chains was not investigated in the present study. AAT-9 expressed in Xenopus oocytes specifically transports the aromatic amino acids l-Phe, l-Trp, and l-Tyr as well as l-dopa. Therefore, in terms of substrate selectivity, AAT-9 resembles the mammalian transporter TAT1, which is expressed mostly in kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, and heart (in humans) and in the small intestine (in rats) (22Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17221-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Kim do K. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Kim J.Y. Chairoungdua A. Kobayashi Y. Enomoto A. Cha S.H. Goya T. Endou H. Genomics. 2002; 79: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities between AAT-9 and this transporter are, however, negligible. The previously characterized C. elegans transporters AAT-1/ATG-2 and AAT-3/ATG-2 transport aromatic neutral amino acids as well, but not exclusively as does AAT-9. Transport of these substrates from the inside to the outside (efflux) is a common feature of AAT-9 and rat TAT1. But, in contrast to TAT1, the efflux of substrate mediated by AAT-9 is detectable only in the presence of an extracellular substrate, indicating that the efflux via AAT-9 corresponds to an obligatory exchange. This property of AAT-9 is held in common with AAT-1/ATG-2 and AAT-3/ATG-2, which function as nearly obligatory exchangers. Its approximate apparent affinity of ≥0.7 mm for its preferred substrate, l-Phe, is similar to that determined for human TAT1 (Km of ∼0.45 mm for l-Trp) and probably higher than that of rat TAT1 (Km of ∼5 mm for l-Trp,). Using two independent approaches to identify the in vivo localization of AAT-9, namely immunofluorescence and the expression of a transcriptional GFP fusion construct, we detected a signal in several neurons positioned between the two pharyngeal bulbs and in body wall muscles of the mouth region. The neuronal localization of AAT-9 together with its selectivity for the transport of aromatic amino acids suggests a possible function in providing the cells with precursors of transmitters such as serotonin and/or dopamine. The fact that AAT-9 is localized in possible chemosensory neurons positioned in the vicinity of the anterior pharyngeal bulb suggests a potential role in sensing food or food breakdown products. The role of the AAT-9 amino acid transporter in muscle cells is not yet understood. It is, however, noteworthy that neurons and muscle cells are electrically active cells that conduct action potentials. In this context, AAT-9, acting as a substrate-activated ion channel, might play a role in stabilizing the membrane potential as has been suggested for the anion conductance of excitatory amino acid transporters (24Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). No obvious phenotype was revealed either in our attempt to knock down AAT-9 by feeding wild type worms with bacteria containing an AAT-9 RNA interference construct (data not shown) or in a large genome-wide screening by Kamath et al. (25Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J. Nature. 2003; 421: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). This is not a definitive finding, because it has been recognized that gene silencing by RNA interference feeding is mostly not successful in the case of genes expressed in neurons, 2A. Hajnal, personal communication. and some subtle phenotypes might not have been detected. Creating a real knock-out for aat-9 and establishing particular physiological assays would be challenging but necessary to determine more precisely the physiological role of AAT-9 in C. elegans.
