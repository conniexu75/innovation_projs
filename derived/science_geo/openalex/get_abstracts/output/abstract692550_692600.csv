https://openalex.org/W4224880055,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) editing paves the way for disease modeling of mitochondrial genetic disorders in cell lines and animals and also for the treatment of these diseases in the future. Bacterial cytidine deaminase DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) enabling mtDNA editing, however, are largely limited to C-to-T conversions in the 5'-TC context (e.g., TC-to-TT conversions), suitable for generating merely 1/8 of all possible transition (purine-to-purine and pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine) mutations. Here, we present transcription-activator-like effector (TALE)-linked deaminases (TALEDs), composed of custom-designed TALE DNA-binding arrays, a catalytically impaired, full-length DddA variant or split DddA originated from Burkholderia cenocepacia, and an engineered deoxyadenosine deaminase derived from the E. coli TadA protein, which induce targeted A-to-G editing in human mitochondria. Custom-designed TALEDs were highly efficient in human cells, catalyzing A-to-G conversions at a total of 17 target sites in various mitochondrial genes with editing frequencies of up to 49%."

Xylem sap from R . solanacearum -infected tomato is enriched in the disaccharide trehalose. Water-stressed plants also accumulate trehalose, which increases drought tolerance via abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Because R . solanacearum -infected plants suffer reduced water flow, we hypothesized that bacterial wilt physiologically mimics drought stress, which trehalose could mitigate. We found that R . solanacearum -infected plants differentially expressed drought-associated genes, including those involved in ABA and trehalose metabolism, and had more ABA in xylem sap. Consistent with this, treating tomato roots with ABA reduced both stomatal conductance and stem colonization by R . solanacearum . Treating roots with trehalose increased xylem sap ABA and reduced plant water use by lowering stomatal conductance and temporarily improving water use efficiency. Trehalose treatment also upregulated expression of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent tomato defense genes; increased xylem sap levels of SA and other antimicrobial compounds; and increased bacterial wilt resistance of SA-insensitive NahG tomato plants. Additionally, trehalose treatment increased xylem concentrations of jasmonic acid and related oxylipins. Finally, trehalose-treated plants were substantially more resistant to bacterial wilt disease. Together, these data show that exogenous trehalose reduced both water stress and bacterial wilt disease and triggered systemic disease resistance, possibly through a Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) response pathway. This suite of responses revealed unexpected linkages between plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress and suggested that R . solanacearum- infected plants increase trehalose to improve water use efficiency and increase wilt disease resistance. The pathogen may degrade trehalose to counter these efforts. Together, these results suggest that treating tomatoes with exogenous trehalose could be a practical strategy for bacterial wilt management."

So what are the factors that affect the adoption of new agricultural technology by family farms, and can the adoption of new technology increase the operating income of family farms? Using cross-sectional data from 847 family farms, this study examines the determinants and impacts of multiple new agricultural technologies adoption on family farms' income in China. To account for selection bias from both observable and unobservable factors, an endogenous switching regression model is employed to evaluate the effects of new agricultural technology on family farms' income. The empirical results show that the adoption of new agricultural technology is affected by the endowment of farmers and the characteristics of family farms. After controlling for the selection bias, the adoption of new agricultural technologies has a positive and significant impact on family farms' income. And the impact on the non-adopter family farms is much larger than adopter family farms. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that family farms with a larger area of arable land earn more from the adoption of new technologies than small farms. In all types of technology investigated, the new methods of pest control and the new chemical fertilizer technology have a relatively large impact on family farms' income, while the new mechanical technology has the least impact on family farms' income. The adoption of new technologies by family farms is more important for promoting the progress of agricultural science and technology. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective measures to overcome the obstacles to the adoption of new agricultural technologies and pay more attention to the use of new agricultural technologies to improve agricultural production efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4225733976,"Trillions of microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses exist in the healthy human gut microbiome. Although gut bacterial dysbiosis has been extensively studied in multiple sclerosis (MS), the significance of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) is an understudied and neglected part of the intestinal microbiome in MS. The aim of this study was to characterize the gut mycobiome of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), compare it to healthy controls, and examine its association with changes in the bacterial microbiome. We characterized and compared the mycobiome of 20 RRMS patients and 33 healthy controls (HC) using Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and compared mycobiome interactions with the bacterial microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results demonstrate an altered mycobiome in RRMS patients compared with HC. RRMS patients showed an increased abundance of Basidiomycota and decreased Ascomycota at the phylum level with an increased abundance of Candida and Epicoccum genera along with a decreased abundance of Saccharomyces compared to HC. We also observed an increased ITS2/16S ratio, altered fungal and bacterial associations, and altered fungal functional profiles in MS patients compared to HC. This study demonstrates that RRMS patients had a distinct mycobiome with associated changes in the bacterial microbiome compared to HC. There is an increased fungal to bacterial ratio as well as more diverse fungal-bacterial interactions in RRMS patients compared to HC. Our study is the first step towards future studies in delineating the mechanisms through which the fungal microbiome can influence MS disease."

We have created four secondary indices from six primary indices in order to assess the care quality parameters. We conducted a principal component analysis on incidence, prevalence, mortality, Years of Life Lost (YLLs), Years Lived with Disability (YLDs), and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) to create an index presented by quality-of-care index (QCI) to compare different countries. Results The global QCI scores of respiratory infection, enteric infection, leukemia, foreign body aspiration, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, dermatitis, road injury, and neonatal disorders have improved remarkably. These causes showed equal distribution of qualified care for both sexes. The global trend of QCI score for mental health showed a steady pattern during the same time and disparities favoring females was evident. The quality of care for these causes was notably higher in developed areas. Conclusions The global QCI revealed a universal growth in major causes of death and morbidity in &lt;20y during 28 years. Quality of care is an associate of the level of country’s development. Despite effective interventions, inequities still remain. Implementation of policies to invest in quality improvement and inequality elimination is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4224988899,"Leaves harvested from kratom [ Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.)] have a history of use as a traditional ethnobotanical medicine to combat fatigue and improve work productivity in Southeast Asia. In recent years, increased interest in the application and use of kratom has emerged globally, including North America, for its potential application as an alternative source of medicine for pain management and opioid withdrawal syndrome mitigation. Although the chemistry and pharmacology of major kratom alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, are well documented, foundational information on the impact of plant production environment on growth and kratom alkaloids synthesis is unavailable. To directly address this need, kratom plant growth, leaf chlorophyll content, and alkaloid concentration were evaluated under three lighting conditions: field full sun (FLD-Sun), greenhouse unshaded (GH-Unshaded), and greenhouse shaded (GH-Shaded). Nine kratom alkaloids were quantified using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. Greenhouse cultivation generally promoted kratom height and width extension by 93–114% and 53–57%, respectively, compared to FLD-Sun. Similarly, total leaf area and leaf number were increased by 118–160% and 54–80% under such conditions. Average leaf size of plants grown under GH-Shaded was 41 and 69% greater than GH-Unshaded and FLD-Sun, respectively; however, no differences were observed between GH-Unshaded and FLD-Sun treatments. At the termination of the study, total leaf chlorophyll a+b content of FLD-Sun was 17–23% less than those grown in the greenhouse. Total leaf dry mass was maximized when cultivated in the greenhouse and was 89–91% greater than in the field. Leaf content of four alkaloids to include speciociliatine, mitraphylline, corynantheidine, and isocorynantheidine were not significantly impacted by lighting conditions, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine was below the lower limit of quantification across all treatments. However, mitragynine, paynantheine, and corynoxine concentration per leaf dry mass were increased by 40%, 35%, and 111%, respectively, when cultivated under GH-Shaded compared to FLD-Sun. Additionally, total alkaloid yield per plant was maximized and nearly tripled for several alkaloids when plants were cultivated under such conditions. Furthermore, rapid, non-destructive chlorophyll evaluation correlated well (r 2 = 0.68) with extracted chlorophyll concentrations. Given these findings, production efforts where low-light conditions can be implemented are likely to maximize plant biomass and total leaf alkaloid production."
https://openalex.org/W4224994275,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health concern and the number one cause of death in South Africa. Social protection programmes can strengthen the resilience of TB patients, their families and households. This study aimed to get a better understanding of the role of social protection and other forms of support in relation to the burden of TB on patients and their households in South Africa.This is a cross-sectional exploratory qualitative study using a phenomenological approach to focus on the lived experiences and perceptions of TB patients and healthcare workers. We interviewed 16 patients and six healthcare workers and analysed data thematically.The challenges faced by participants were closely related to household challenges. Participants reported a heavy physical burden, aggravated by a lack of nutritious food and that households could not provide the food they needed. Some needed to resort to charity. At the same time, households were significantly affected by the burden of caring for the patient-and remained the main source of financial, emotional and physical support. Participants reported challenges and costs associated with the application process and high levels of discretion by the assessing doctor allowing doctors' opinions and beliefs to influence their assessment.Access to adequate nutritious food was a key issue for many patients and this need strained already stretched households and budgets. Few participants reported obtaining state social protection support during their illness, but many reported challenges and high costs of trying to access it. Further research should be conducted on support mechanisms and interventions for TB patients, but also their households, including food support, social protection and contact tracing. In deciding eligibility for grants, the situation of the household should be considered in addition to the individual patient."
https://openalex.org/W4224940990,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan, the state of emergency, as a public health measure to control the spread of COVID-19, and the Go To campaign, which included the Go To Travel and Go To Eat campaigns and was purposed to stimulate economic activities, were implemented. This study investigated the impact of these government policies on COVID-19 spread.This ecological study included all 47 prefectures in Japan as samples between February 3 and December 27, 2020. We used COVID-19 cases and mobility as variables. Additionally, places where social contacts could accrue, defined as restaurants, companies, transportation, and tourist spots; mean temperature and humidity; the number of inhabitants in their twenties to fifties; and the number of COVID-19 cases in the previous period, which were factors or covariates in the graphical modeling analysis, were divided into five periods according to the timing of the implementation of the state of emergency and Go To campaign.Graphical changes occurred throughout all five periods of COVID-19. During the state of emergency (period 2), a correlation between COVID-19 cases and those before the state of emergency (period 1) was observed, although this correlation was not significant in the period after the state of emergency was lifted (period 3). During the implementation of Go To Travel and the Go To Eat campaigns (period 5), the number of places where social contacts could accrue was correlated with COVID-19 cases, with complex associations and mobility.This study confirms that the state of emergency affected the control of COVID-19 spread and that the Go To campaign led to increased COVID-19 cases due to increased mobility by changing behavior in the social environment where social contacts potentially accrue."
https://openalex.org/W4225834395,"Background The Sysmex DI-60 digital morphology analyzer is a fully automated, cell-locating image analysis system. This study aimed to evaluate the analytical performance of DI-60. Methods A total of 822 peripheral blood smears were used. The diagnostic performance of DI-60 in terms of red blood cell (RBC) morphology characterization, white blood cell (WBC) differentials, and the total assay time including hands-on time was evaluated. Results In comparison with manual slide review, DI-60 demonstrated acceptable accuracy in recognizing polychromasia, target cells, and ovalocytes. However, for schistocytes, DI-60 demonstrated low specificity (10.4%) despite the high sensitivity (97.2%). In the precision analysis of RBC morphology characterization, borderline samples harboring specific RBCs showed inconsistencies in the positive results among 20 replicates. Particularly, 6 of 10 samples showed inconsistencies in the precision for schistocytes. For WBC differentials, the overall agreement between pre-classification results and user-verified results was 89.4%. Except for basophils, normal WBCs showed a good correlation between DI-60 (after user verification) and manual counts. The sensitivities in detecting immature granulocytes, blasts, atypical lymphocytes, and normoblasts were 85.9%, 92.0%, 37.5%, and 77.6%, respectively. Although the total assay time of DI-60 was longer than that of manual review, the hands-on time was considerably shorter with a difference of 144.1 s/slide for abnormal samples. Conclusion DI-60 demonstrated acceptable performance for normal samples. However, for abnormal WBC differentials and RBC morphology characterization, it should be utilized carefully. DI-60 may contribute to an improvement in laboratory efficiency with increased feasibility."
https://openalex.org/W4224440882,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world are facing one of the most severe health and economic crises of recent history and human society is called to figure out effective responses. However, as current measures have not produced valuable solutions, a multidisciplinary and open approach, enabling collaborations across private and public organizations, is crucial to unleash successful contributions against the disease. Indeed, the COVID-19 represents a Grand Challenge to which joint forces and extension of disciplinary boundaries have been recognized as main imperatives. As a consequence, Open Innovation represents a promising solution to provide a fast recovery. In this paper we present a practical application of this approach, showing how knowledge sharing constitutes one of the main drivers to tackle pressing social needs. To demonstrate this, we propose a case study regarding a data sharing initiative promoted by Facebook, the Data For Good program. We leverage a large-scale dataset provided by Facebook to the research community to offer a representation of the evolution of the Italian mobility during the lockdown. We show that this repository allows to capture different patterns of movements on the territory with increasing levels of detail. We integrate this information with Open Data provided by the Lombardy region to illustrate how data sharing can also provide insights for private businesses and local authorities. Finally, we show how to interpret Data For Good initiatives in light of the Open Innovation Framework and discuss the barriers to adoption faced by public administrations regarding these practices."
https://openalex.org/W4224996515,"Growing evidence demonstrates a strong correlation between obesity and an increased risk of breast cancer, although the mechanisms involved have not been completely elucidated. Some reports have described a crosstalk between adipocytes, cancer cells, and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, however, it is currently unknown whether obesity can promote tumor growth by inducing systemic alterations of the immune cell homeostasis in peripheral lymphoid organs and adipose tissue. Here, we used the E0771 breast cancer cell line in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity to analyze the immune subpopulations present in the tumors, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and spleen of lean and obese mice. Our results showed a significant reduction in the frequency of infiltrating CD8 + T cells and a decreased M1/M2 macrophage ratio, indicative of the compromised anti-tumoral immune response reported in obesity. Despite not finding differences in the percentage or numbers of intratumoral Tregs, phenotypic analysis showed that they were enriched in CD39 + , PD-1 + and CCR8 + cells, compared to the draining lymph nodes, confirming the highly immunosuppressive profile of infiltrating Tregs reported in established tumors. Analysis of peripheral T lymphocytes showed that tumor development in obese mice was associated to a significant increase in the percentage of peripheral Tregs, which supports the systemic immunosuppressive effect caused by the tumor. Interestingly, evaluation of immune subpopulations in the VAT showed that the characteristic increase in the M1/M2 macrophage ratio reported in obesity, was completely reversed in tumor-bearing mice, resembling the M2-polarized profile found in the microenvironment of the growing tumor. Importantly, VAT Tregs, which are commonly decreased in obese mice, were significantly increased in the presence of breast tumors and displayed significantly higher levels of Foxp3, indicating a regulatory feedback mechanism triggered by tumor growth. Altogether, our results identify a complex reciprocal relationship between adipocytes, immune cells, and the tumor, which may modulate the immune macroenvironment that promotes breast cancer development in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4224325556,"Replication timing regulatory factor 1 (RIF1) acts downstream of p53-binding protein 53BP1 to inhibit the resection of DNA broken ends, which plays critical roles in determining the DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice between nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination (HR). However, the mechanism by which this choice is made is not yet clear. In this study, we identified that histone chaperone protein ASF1 associates with RIF1 and regulates RIF1-dependent functions in the DNA damage response. Similar to loss of RIF1, we found that loss of ASF1 resulted in resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in BRCA1-deficient cells with restored HR and decreased telomere fusion in telomeric repeat-binding protein 2 (TRF2)-depleted cells. Moreover, we showed that these functions of ASF1 are dependent on its interaction with RIF1 but not on its histone chaperone activity. Thus, our study supports a new role for ASF1 in dictating double-strand break repair choice. Considering that the status of 53BP1-RIF1 axis is important in determining the outcome of PARP inhibitor-based therapy in BRCA1- or HR-deficient cancers, the identification of ASF1 function in this critical pathway uncovers an interesting connection between these S-phase events, which may reveal new strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4224980425,"A total of 296 strains of protease-producing bacteria were isolated and purified from medium-temperature Daqu produced by ZhangGong LaoJiu Wine Co. Ltd. After calculating the ratio of transparent ring diameter to colony diameter and measuring the protease activities, a strain of high-yield protease bacteria, called DW-7, was screened out with a protease activity of 99.54 U/mL. Through morphological observation, 16S rDNA sequence analysis, and physiological and biochemical tests, the isolated bacteria DW-7 was determined to be Bacillus velezensis. In addition, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), using PacBio and the Illumina platform, was performed. Gene annotation was then conducted using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Non-Redundant Protein Sequence Database (NR), and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. The results showed that the genome of DW-7 was 3,942,829 bp long with a GC content of 46.45%. A total of 3,662 protein-encoding genes were predicted, with a total length of 3,402,822 bp. Additionally, 2,283; 2,796; and 2,127 genes were annotated in the COG, KEGG, and GO databases, respectively. A total of 196 high-yield protease genes were mainly enriched in the metabolism of alanine, aspartic acid, glutamate, glycine, serine, and threonine, as well as ABC transporter and transporter pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4226217994,"Postpartum uterine infection in dairy cows is commonly caused by pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli). Progesterone elicits immunosuppressive function within bovine endometrium, and has been suggested to be related to postpartum uterine infection. Endometrial stroma is exposed to bacteria due to the disruption of epithelium during parturition, but the effect and mechanism of progesterone on innate immune response of stromal cells has not been reported. This study evaluated the impact of progesterone on inflammatory response of primary endometrial stromal cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed E. coli. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that progesterone repressed mRNA induction of IL1B, IL6, TNF, CXCL8, NOS2, and PTGS2 in stromal cells in response to lipopolysaccharide or E. coli challenge. Consistently, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining results showed that progesterone suppressed lipopolysaccharide- or E. coli-induced MAPK and NF-κB activations characterized with decreased phosphorylations of ERK1/2, JNK, P38, IκBα, and P65, and inhibition of P65 nuclear translocation. In unstimulated stromal cells, progesterone alone did not affect the mRNA transcription for IL6, TNF, CXCL8, NOS2, and PTGS2, and the signaling cascade of MAPK and NF-κB, but decreased IL1B mRNA expression. These results revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of progesterone in lipopolysaccharide- or E. coli-challenged endometrial stromal cells was probably mediated through MAPK and NF-κB pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4224944607,"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2 D3 ], the most active vitamin D (VD) metabolite, is a steroid hormone playing an important role in many physiological functions in addition to maintaining mineral homeostasis. In this study, we explored the mechanism that the VD regulated insulin pathway and glucose metabolism in zebrafish in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that 1,25(OH)2 D3 significantly enhances the expression of insulin receptor a (insra), insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs1) and glucose transporter 2 (glut2), and promotes glycolysis and glycogenesis, while suppressing gluconeogenesis in zebrafish liver cell line (ZFL) under the condition of high glucose (20 mM), instead of the normal glucose (10 mM). Moreover, consistent results were obtained from the zebrafish fed with VD3 -deficient diet, as well as the cyp2r1-/- zebrafish, in which endogenous VD metabolism is blocked. Furthermore, results from dual-luciferase reporting system exhibited that 1,25(OH)2 D3 directly activated the transcription of insra, rather than insrb in zebrafish by binding to vitamin D response element (VDRE) located at -181 to -167 bp in the promoter region of insra. Importantly, the 1,25(OH)2 D3 treatment significantly alleviated the symptoms of hyperglycemia in diabetic zebrafish. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that VD activates VDRE located in the promoter area of insra in zebrafish to promote insulin/insra signaling pathway, thereby contributing to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4225386880,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulates molecular and cellular entry from the cerebrovasculature into the surrounding brain parenchyma. Many diseases of the brain are associated with dysfunction of the BBB, where hypoxia is a common stressor. However, the contribution of hypoxia to BBB dysfunction is challenging to study due to the complexity of the brain microenvironment. In this study, we used a BBB model with brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes differentiated from iPSCs to investigate the effect of hypoxia on barrier function. We found that hypoxia-induced barrier dysfunction is dependent upon increased actomyosin contractility and is associated with increased fibronectin fibrillogenesis. We propose a role for actomyosin contractility in mediating hypoxia-induced barrier dysfunction through modulation of junctional claudin-5. Our findings suggest pericytes may protect brain microvascular endothelial cells from hypoxic stresses and that pericyte-derived factors could be candidates for treatment of pathological barrier-forming tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4226051125,"Surfactant protein C (SP-C) has several functions in pulmonary surfactant. These include the transfer of lipids between different membrane structures, a role in surfactant recycling and homeostasis, and involvement in modulation of the innate defense system. Despite these important functions, the structures of functional SP-C complexes have remained unclear. SP-C is known to exist as a primarily α-helical structure with an apparently unstructured N-terminal region, yet there is recent evidence that the functions of SP-C could be associated with the formation of SP-C dimers and higher oligomers. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations, two-dimensional umbrella sampling, and well-tempered metadynamics to study the details of SP-C dimerization. The results suggest that SP-C dimerizes in pulmonary surfactant membranes, forming dimers of different topologies. The simulations identified a dimerization motif region V21xxxVxxxGxxxM33 that is much larger than the putative A30xxxG34 motif that is commonly assumed to control the dimerization of some α-helical transmembrane domains. The results provide a stronger basis for elucidating how SP-C functions in concert with other surfactant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4226055950,"Antibiotics are used to treat serious illness, but may also be used extraneously or as a preventative measure in many farm animals. This usage increases the potential for unintentional exposure to a variety of organisms. When antibiotics enter aquatic environments, Daphnia magna are especially vulnerable as they filter-feed in freshwater environments. Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a commonly-used broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of mammalian diseases. In this study, the impact of OTC on D. magna mortality and gut biota were studied using both cultivation and sequencing-based approaches. Mortality rates were extremely low with the LD50 >2,000ppm. However, OTC impacted abundance and species diversity of intestinal microorganisms in the gut of the D. magna in abundance as well as species diversity. In control organisms, Pseudomonas putida and Aeromonas hydrophila were both present while only P. putida was found in OTC-exposed organisms. Disruption of the intestinal biota in D. magna could have implications on long-term survival, energy expenditure, and reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W4226113598,"Compartmental models are often used to understand and predict the progression of an infectious disease such as COVID-19. The most basic of these models consider the total population of a region to be closed. Many incorporate human mobility into their transmission dynamics, usually based on static and aggregated data. However, mobility can change dramatically during a global pandemic as seen with COVID-19, making static data unsuitable. Recently, large mobility datasets derived from mobile devices have been used, along with COVID-19 infections data, to better understand the relationship between mobility and COVID-19. However, studies to date have relied on data that represent only a fraction of their target populations, and the data from mobile devices have been used for measuring mobility within the study region, without considering changes to the population as people enter and leave the region. This work presents a unique case study in Andorra, with comprehensive datasets that include telecoms data covering 100% of mobile subscribers in the country, and results from a serology testing program that more than 90% of the population voluntarily participated in. We use the telecoms data to both measure mobility within the country and to provide a real-time census of people entering, leaving and remaining in the country. We develop multiple SEIR (compartmental) models parameterized on these metrics and show how dynamic population metrics can improve the models. We find that total daily trips did not have predictive value in the SEIR models while country entrances did. As a secondary contribution of this work, we show how Andorra's serology testing program was likely impacted by people leaving the country. Overall, this case study suggests how using mobile phone data to measure dynamic population changes could improve studies that rely on more commonly used mobility metrics and the overall understanding of a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4224312182,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cell populations and exhibit great potential in regenerative medicine and oncology. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are well known to regulate MSC biology through their chemotactic and mitogenic properties. However, their direct roles in the regulation of MSC lineage commitment are unclear. Here, we show that PDGF D promotes the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) into osteoblasts and inhibits hBMSC differentiation into adipocytes. We demonstrate that PDGF D-induced β-actin expression and polymerization are essential for mediating this differential regulation of osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis. Interestingly, we found that PDGF D induces massive upward molecular weight shifts of its cognate receptor, PDGF receptor beta (β-PDGFR) in hBMSCs, which was not observed in fibroblasts. Proteomic analysis indicated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECT, UBA, and WWE domain-containing protein 1 (HUWE1) associates with the PDGF D-activated β-PDGFR signaling complex in hBMSCs, resulting in β-PDGFR polyubiquitination. In contrast to the well-known role of ubiquitin in protein degradation, we provide evidence that HUWE1-mediated β-PDGFR polyubiquitination delays β-PDGFR internalization and degradation, thereby prolonging AKT signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that HUWE1-regulated β-PDGFR signaling is essential for osteoblastic differentiation of hBMSCs, while being dispensable for PDGF D-induced hBMSC migration and proliferation as well as PDGF D-mediated inhibition of hBMSC differentiation into adipocytes. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism by which PDGF D regulates the commitment of hBMSCs into the osteoblastic lineage."
https://openalex.org/W4224708308,"Celecoxib (CLB) is a highly hydrophobic selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor with high plasma protein binding and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. CLB is highly effective in the treatment of osteo and rheumatoid arthritis as first line therapy but produces severe gastro-intestinal toxicities and cardiovascular side effects. In this research, stealth liposomes of CLB were developed with the intention to reduce the side effects and increase the accumulation of drug in the sites of inflammation. Stealth liposomes were prepared by thin film hydration technique using distearoylphosphatidylcholine and PE-PEG 2000 with variable amounts of cholesterol and characterized. The effects of various lipids such as hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol content on % drug encapsulation was investigated. The optimized stealth liposomes were characterized by FT-IR and DSC for possible drug excipients interaction. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biodistribution studies were carried out for the stealth liposomes. The results revealed that the stealth liposomes reduced the inflammation to the larger magnitude and have also sustained the magnitude when compared to free drug along with maximum analgesic response. Higher elimination half-life, AUC, MRT and lowered clearance rate denotes the extended bioavailability of the drug in blood. Biodistribution studies revealed that stealth liposomes extend the circulation time of liposomes in blood by decreasing opsonisation and be less concentrated in kidney, thereby reducing the toxicities to RES and renal organs and facilitate the drug accumulation in the area of inflammation. Our results indicated that CLB, without the requirement of modifications to enhance solubilisation, can be encapsulated and released from liposomal formulations. This new-fangled drug delivery approach may be used to circumvent the low bioavailability and toxic side effects of oral CLB formulations."
https://openalex.org/W4224879015,"The incidence of anogenital warts (AGW) decreased after the introduction of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine in multiple jurisdictions. We studied how comparing AGW incidence rates with different outcomes affects the interpretation of the qHPV vaccination program. To do this, we replicated multiple study designs within a single jurisdiction (Manitoba).We measured the incidence rates of AGW, AGW-related prescriptions, chlamydia, and gonorrhea (the latter two as sham outcomes) between 2001 and 2017 using several clinical and administrative health databases from Manitoba. We then used incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to compare, for each outcome, the rate for the 1997-1998 birth cohort (the first cohorts eligible for the publicly funded qHPV vaccination program) and the older 1995-1996 birth cohort.AGW incidence in Manitoba dropped 72% (95% confidence interval 54-83%) among 16-18 year-old girls and 51% (14-72%) among boys after the introduction of the female-only qHPV vaccination program. Trends in AGW-related prescriptions were different from trends in AGW diagnoses as these prescriptions peaked shortly after the introduction of the publicly funded qHPV vaccine program. Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence rates also decreased 12% (5-18%) and 16% (-1-30%), respectively, for 16-18 year-old girls.The publicly funded school-based qHPV vaccine program reduced AGW incidence in Manitoba by three-quarters in young females.

https://openalex.org/W4224885800,"The usage of cladocerans as non-model organisms in ecotoxicological and risk assessment studies has intensified in recent years due to their ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems. The molecular assessment such as gene expression analysis has been introduced in ecotoxicological and risk assessment to link the expression of specific genes to a biological process in the cladocerans. The validity and accuracy of gene expression analysis depends on the quantity, quality and integrity of extracted ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the sample. However, the standard methods of RNA extraction from the cladocerans are still lacking. This study evaluates the extraction of RNA from tropical freshwater cladocerans Moina micrura using two methods: the phenol-chloroform extraction method (QIAzol) and a column-based kit (Qiagen Micro Kit). Glycogen was introduced in both approaches to enhance the recovery of extracted RNA and the extracted RNA was characterised using spectrophotometric analysis (NanoDrop), capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer). Then, the extracted RNA was analysed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to validate the RNA extraction method towards downstream gene expression analysis. The results indicate that the column-based kit is most suitable for the extraction of RNA from M. micrura, with the quantity (RNA concentration = 26.90 ± 6.89 ng/μl), quality (A260:230 = 1.95 ± 0.15, A280:230 = 1.85 ± 0.09) and integrity (RNA integrity number, RIN = 7.20 ± 0.16). The RT-PCR analysis shows that the method successfully amplified both alpha tubulin and actin gene at 33-35 cycles (i.e. Ct = 32.64 to 33.48). The results demonstrate that the addition of glycogen is only suitable for the phenol-chloroform extraction method. RNA extraction with high and comprehensive quality control assessment will increase the accuracy and reliability of downstream gene expression, thus providing more ecotoxicological data at the molecular biological level on other freshwater zooplankton species."
https://openalex.org/W4224995002,"Background Despite extensive research into acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults, research into the epidemiology, associated risk factors, treatment, and mortality of AKI in pediatric COVID-19 patients is understudied. Advancing understanding of this disease is crucial to further developing treatment and preventative care strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 2,546 COVID-19 pediatric patients (age ≤ 21 years) who were admitted the ICU in North America. Analysis of the Virtual Pediatric Systems (VPS) COVID-19 database was conducted between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Results Out of a total of 2,546 COVID positive pediatric patients, 10.8% (n = 274) were diagnosed with AKI. Significantly higher continuous and categorical outcomes in the AKI subset compared to the non-AKI cohort included: length of stay at the hospital (LOS) [9.04 (5.11–16.66) vs. 5.09 (2.58–9.94) days], Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) 2 probability of death [1.20 (0.86–3.83) vs. 0.96 (0.79–1.72)], PIM 3 probability of death [0.98 (0.72–2.93) vs. 0.78 (0.69–1.26)], mortality [crude OR (95% CI): 5.01 (2.89–8.70)], airway and respiratory support [1.63 (1.27–2.10)], cardio-respiratory support [3.57 (1.55–8.23)], kidney support [12.52 (5.30–29.58)], and vascular access [4.84 (3.70–6.32)]. Conclusions This is one of the first large scale studies to analyze AKI among pediatric COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU in North America. Although the course of the COVID-19 virus appears milder in the pediatric population, renal complications may result, increasing the risk of disease complication and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4225926528,"Low back pain (LBP) remains one of the most common and incapacitating health conditions worldwide. Clinical guidelines recommend exercise programs after the acute phase, but clinical effects are modest when assessed at a population level. Research needs to determine who is likely to benefit from specific exercise interventions, based on clinical presentation. This study aimed to derive clinical prediction rules (CPRs) for treatment success, using a lumbar stabilization exercise program (LSEP), at the end of treatment and at six-month follow-up. The eight-week LSEP, including clinical sessions and home exercises, was completed by 110 participants with non-acute LBP, with 100 retained at the six-month follow-up. Physical (lumbar segmental instability, motor control impairments, posture and range of motion, trunk muscle endurance and physical performance tests) and psychological (related to fear-avoidance and home-exercise adherence) measures were collected at a baseline clinical exam. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict clinical success, as defined by ≥50% decrease in the Oswestry Disability Index. CPRs were derived for success at program completion (T8) and six-month follow-up (T34), negotiating between predictive ability and clinical usability. The chosen CPRs contained four (T8) and three (T34) clinical tests, all theoretically related to spinal instability, making these CPRs specific to the treatment provided (LSEP). The chosen CPRs provided a positive likelihood ratio of 17.9 (T8) and 8.2 (T34), when two or more tests were positive. When applying these CPRs, the probability of treatment success rose from 49% to 96% at T8 and from 53% to 92% at T34. These results support the further development of these CPRs by proceeding to the validation stage."
https://openalex.org/W4226046707,"Choking can lead to mortality and residual impairments. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with choking among acute hospital patients and examine error-producing conditions to suggest choking-prevention policies. Among 36,364 cases reported by hospital staff at an acute university hospital from 2012 to 2018 were examined using a retrospective study, 35,440 were analysis as the number of cases analysed for the study. We used descriptive statistics to present patient characteristics and conducted univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with choking. Additionally, we conducted content analysis (root cause analysis) to examine error-producing conditions and prevention policies. Sixty-eight cases were related to choking injuries; of these, 43 patients (63.2%) were male, and 38 (55.9%) were aged 65 years and older. Choking cases had a high percent of adverse outcomes involving residual impairment or death (n = 23, 33.8%). Mental illness (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.14 [1.39-7.08]), and hospitalisation in the general wards (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.13 [1.70-5.76]) were associated with an increased probability of choking. Error production was caused by food (n = 25, 36.8%) and medical devices or supplies (n = 13, 19.1%). Almost all contributory factors were associated with inadequate checking (n = 66, 97.1%) and misperception of risk (n = 65, 95.6%). Choking poses a highly significant burden on patients, and hospital administrators should minimise the risk of choking to prevent related injuries. Hospital administrators should provide training and education to their staff and develop adequate protocols and procedures to prevent choking."
https://openalex.org/W4226059963,"Aims Women after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are a risk group for cardiometabolic diseases but are hard to reach by conventional lifestyle programs. Therefore, we tested whether a novel, smartphone-delivered intervention, TRIANGLE , is accepted by women after GDM and alters cardiometabolic risk behaviors and outcomes. TRIANGLE targets gradual habit change of mind and emotion, physical activity, nutrition, and sleep. Methods We conducted a 6-month multicenter, randomized-controlled trial of TRIANGLE versus standard care with 66 women 3–18 months after GDM in Germany. The primary outcome was the proportion of women achieving ≥3 out of 5 Diabetes Prevention Program goals, i.e. physical activity ≥150 min/week (moderate to high intensity), fiber intake ≥15 g/1,000 kcal, fat intake &lt;30% of total energy intake, saturated fat intake &lt;10% of total energy intake, and weight reduction ≥5% if BMI ≥23 kg/m 2 or weight maintenance if BMI &lt;23 kg/m 2 . Intervention participants also rated the TRIANGLE app in the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Results In the predefined, modified intention-to-treat analysis including 64 women, 6 out of 27 women in the intervention group [22%(10–40)] and 3 out of 27 women in the control group [11%(3–27)] reached the primary outcome (p = 0.47). In the predefined per-protocol intervention subgroup, the proportion was 4 out of 14 women [29%(11–55); p = 0.20 vs. control]. TRIANGLE app users were active on 42% of days and rated the app’s quality and perceived impact with 4.3±0.8 out of 5 uMARS points. Conclusions This first trial did not show the efficacy of the TRIANGLE intervention. However, the app was well accepted and considered helpful by most users. Therefore, this trial supports further development and testing of TRIANGLE and other app interventions for women after GDM. Additionally, it identifies necessary adaptations in trial design to better accommodate non-intensive lifestyle interventions for this target group.

https://openalex.org/W3198499755,"With the rapid proliferation of mobile telephony and the establishment of an IT-enabled payment and settlement system, Bangladesh nowadays is experiencing a remarkable growth in the usage of mobile financial services (MFS). As more and more people are opting to use this service, a huge number of mobile accounts are opened every day and a substantial amount of money is deposited, withdrawn and transferred frequently through the mobile network. This ever-increasing amount of mobile money flowing through the network may have a sizeable impact on the overall money supply of the country. Thus far, no systematic study has been conducted to quantify the impact of the mobile money on the conventional money supply of Bangladesh. In this study, we attempt to quantify the contribution of mobile money on the money supply which is an important quantity-based nominal anchor of monetary policy in Bangladesh. Apart from deriving algebraic relationships between money supply and e-money, here we have empirically shown that during the 03 years span of 2018-2021, MFS transactions account for nearly 10.88% and 11.29% of total narrow and broad money supply of Bangladesh as on January 2021. Besides, we also qualitatively discuss the impact of e-money on an important price-based nominal anchor of monetary policy in Bangladesh, i.e., interest rate. Based upon the above discussion, here we argue that MFS can act as an effective tool to slash interest rate by a reasonable proportion through adding significantly to the overall supply of money in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4224993418,"Motivation Selecting the most relevant genes for sample classification is a common process in gene expression studies. Moreover, determining the smallest set of relevant genes that can achieve the required classification performance is particularly important in diagnosing cancer and improving treatment. Results In this study, I propose a novel method to eliminate irrelevant and redundant genes, and thus determine the smallest set of relevant genes for breast cancer diagnosis. The method is based on random forest models, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and my developed Sort Difference Backward Elimination (SDBE) algorithm; hence, the method is named GSEA–SDBE. Using this method, genes are filtered according to their importance following random forest training and GSEA is used to select genes by core enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways that are strongly related to breast cancer. Subsequently, the SDBE algorithm is applied to eliminate redundant genes and identify the most relevant genes for breast cancer diagnosis. In the SDBE algorithm, the differences in the Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs) of performing random forest models are computed before and after the deletion of each gene to indicate the degree of redundancy of the corresponding deleted gene on the remaining genes during backward elimination. Next, the obtained MCC difference list is divided into two parts from a set position and each part is respectively sorted. By continuously iterating and changing the set position, the most relevant genes are stably assembled on the left side of the gene list, facilitating their identification, and the redundant genes are gathered on the right side of the gene list for easy elimination. A cross-comparison of the SDBE algorithm was performed by respectively computing differences between MCCs and ROC_AUC_score and then respectively using 10-fold classification models, e.g., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and extremely randomized trees (ExtraTrees). Finally, the classification performance of the proposed method was compared with that of three advanced algorithms for five cancer datasets. Results showed that analyzing MCC differences and using random forest models was the optimal solution for the SDBE algorithm. Accordingly, three consistently relevant genes (i.e., VEGFD , TSLP , and PKMYT1 ) were selected for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The performance metrics (MCC and ROC_AUC_score, respectively) of the random forest models based on 10-fold verification reached 95.28% and 98.75%. In addition, survival analysis showed that VEGFD and TSLP could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Moreover, the proposed method significantly outperformed the other methods tested as it allowed selecting a smaller number of genes while maintaining the required classification accuracy."

This paper estimates the policy effectiveness of environmental regulation based on the big data of Chinese government websites and combines the pig production data of various provinces in China from 2008 to 2018 to construct a mediating effect model, empirically analyzing the relationship between environmental regulations, herd structure, and pig production. Research shows: (1) Improving environmental regulations in the short term will increase the slaughter of pigs, but in the long run it will decrease first and then increase; (2) At this stage, environmental regulations can increase the slaughter of pigs by changing the herd structure; (3) Reasonable adjustment of the herd structure can effectively increase the slaughter of pigs; (4) The herd structure can be used as a supplementary monitoring indicator to stabilize the supply of pigs. Combine it with the change rate of sow stock to provide early warning of fluctuations in pig production, and the early warning herd structure values are 0.0980 and 0.1135. There are two key initiatives to achieve supply and price stability in the pig industry that taking into account environmental protection: first, an industrial regulation instrument based on the herd structure needs to be established; second, an early warning system for pig production fluctuations should be established with reference to the early warning system for pork price fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W4225338056,"The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score may be insufficient for accurate prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in Asians. This study was performed to investigate whether brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) has additional prognostic value to the risk score estimated by the ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations (PCEs).A total of 6,359 patients (3,534 men and 2,825 women) aged 40-79 years without documented cardiovascular disease who underwent baPWV measurement were retrospectively analyzed. Cardiovascular risk scores were calculated using the 2013 ACC/AHA PCEs. Cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and ischemic stroke, were assessed.During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years (interquartile range 1.7-6.1 years), cardiovascular events occurred in 129 patients (2.0%). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that baPWV was stronger in the detection of cardiovascular events than the 2013 ACC/AHA risk score (area under the curve: 0.70 versus 0.62, p<0.001). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, both baPWV and 2013 ACC/AHA risk score were independently associated with the occurrence of clinical events (p <0.001 for each). The baPWV had incremental prognostic value to the 2013 ACC/AHA risk score in predicting clinical events (global chi-square from 21.23 to 49.51, p<0.001).The baPWV appears to be a strong predictor of the risk of cardiovascular events in Koreans. Measuring baPWV in addition to the 2013 ACC/AHA risk score helps identify individuals at risk for MACE aged 40-79 years without previous cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4225966065,"The true belief (TB) control condition of the classical location-change task asks children to ascribe a veridical belief to an agent to predict her action (analog to the false belief (FB) condition to test Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities). Studies that administered TB tasks to a broad age range of children yielded surprising findings of a U-shaped performance curve in this seemingly trivial task. Children before age four perform competently in the TB condition. Children who begin to solve the FB condition at age four, however, fail the TB condition and only from around age 10, children succeed again. New evidence suggests that the decline in performance around age four reflects pragmatic confusions caused by the triviality of the task rather than real competence deficits in ToM. Based on these results, it can be hypothesized that the recovery of performance at the end of the U-shaped curve reflects underlying developments in children's growing pragmatic awareness. The aim of the current set of studies, therefore, was to test whether the developmental change at the end of the U-shaped performance curve can be explained by changes in children's pragmatic understanding and by more general underlying developmental changes in recursive ToM or recursive thinking in general. Results from Study 1 (N = 81, 6-10 years) suggest that children's recursive ToM, but not their advanced pragmatic understanding or general recursive thinking abilities predict their TB performance. However, this relationship could not be replicated in Study 2 (N = 87, 6-10 years) and Study 3 (N = 64, 6-10 years) in which neither recursive ToM nor advanced pragmatic understanding or recursive thinking explained children's performance in the TB task. The studies therefore remain inconclusive regarding explanations for the end of the U-shaped performance curve. Future research needs to investigate potential pragmatic and general cognitive foundations of this developmental change more thoroughly."
https://openalex.org/W3134329363,"This paper focuses on a class of reinforcement learning problems where significant events are rare and limited to a single positive reward per episode. A typical example is that of an agent who has to choose a partner to cooperate with, while a large number of partners are simply not interested in cooperating, regardless of what the agent has to offer. We address this problem in a continuous state and action space with two different kinds of search methods: a gradient policy search method and a direct policy search method using an evolution strategy. We show that when significant events are rare, gradient information is also scarce, making it difficult for policy gradient search methods to find an optimal policy, with or without a deep neural architecture. On the other hand, we show that direct policy search methods are invariant to the rarity of significant events, which is yet another confirmation of the unique role evolutionary algorithms has to play as a reinforcement learning method."
https://openalex.org/W4224316490,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a degenerative disease caused by a decrease in the mitochondrial protein frataxin (Fxn), which is involved in iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis. Diminutions in Fxn result in decreased ISC synthesis, increased mitochondrial iron accumulation, and impaired mitochondrial function. Here, we show that conditions that result in increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in yeast or mammalian cell culture give rise to increased turnover of Fxn but not of other ISC synthesis proteins. We demonstrate that the mitochondrial Lon protease is involved in Fxn degradation and that iron export through the mitochondrial metal transporter Mmt1 protects yeast Fxn from degradation. We also determined that when FRDA fibroblasts were grown in media containing elevated iron, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species increased and Fxn decreased compared to WT fibroblasts. Furthermore, we screened a library of FDA-approved compounds and identified 38 compounds that increased yeast Fxn levels, including the azole bifonazole, antiparasitic fipronil, antitumor compound dibenzoylmethane, antihypertensive 4-hydroxychalcone, and a nonspecific anion channel inhibitor 4,4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2-sulfonic acid. We show that top hits 4-hydroxychalcone and dibenzoylmethane increased mRNA levels of transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts, as well as downstream antioxidant targets thioredoxin, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase 2.

More recently, studies in yeast have shown that mutations in ERG29 lead to increased levels of 4′methyl sterol intermediates leading to an iron-dependent oxidation of mitochondrial Yfh1 (the yeast Fxn homolog) resulting in decreased Yfh1 levels, decreased ISC production, and impaired viability and cell growth (25Babcock M. de Silva D.

Here, we show that increased mitochondrial ROS resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial Yfh1 half-life due to degradation by the mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1. We also showed that increasing mitochondrial iron export through overexpression of the mitochondrial iron exporter MMT1 (29Li L. Bertram S. Kaplan J. Jia X. Ward D.M.

We confirmed that increased mitochondrial ROS gave rise to decreased mammalian Fxn while partner proteins Iscu and Nfs1 levels were unchanged in the H9C2 cardiomyocyte doxorubicin model. We demonstrated that FRDA patient fibroblasts were more susceptible to iron-dependent Fxn degradation and that inhibiting the Lon protease protected mammalian mitochondrial Fxn from ROS-induced degradation. We screened a library of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds for their ability to increase yeast Yfh1 levels when ERG29 expression was shut off and identified compounds that increased Yfh1 levels and cell growth. Compounds that showed the highest efficacy in yeast also showed increased mature mitochondrial Fxn levels in doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes and FRDA fibroblasts. Our data provide a possible explanation for the progression of disease in FRDA due to further loss of Fxn, and we identify compounds that may be efficacious in slowing the progression of FRDA. Previously, we reported that loss of Erg29, a protein involved in ergosterol synthesis in yeast, resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and decreases in the ISC synthesis protein Yfh1 (26Ward D.M. Chen O.S. Li L. Kaplan J. Bhuiyan S.A. Natarajan S.K. Bard M. Cox J.E. Altered sterol metabolism in budding yeast affects mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 10782-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We reported that the decrease in Yfh1 protein levels was not due to a change in YFH1 transcripts (26Ward D.M. Chen O.S. Li L. Kaplan J. Bhuiyan S.A. Natarajan S.K. Bard M. Cox J.E.

Chem. 2018; 293: 10782-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that the change in Yfh1 levels was due to posttranslational regulation. To determine if the half-life of mitochondrial Yfh1 was altered, we generated a Δerg29 yeast strain containing a plasmid with expression of ERG29 regulated by the GAL1 promoter. In the presence of galactose, cells express ERG29 (ON) and when grown in glucose as a carbon source, ERG29 is not expressed (OFF). The strain also contains the coding sequence of GFP cloned in frame into the carboxyl terminus of the endogenous locus of YFH1. We refer to this strain as ERG29 YFH1-GFP shut off cells. Yfh1-GFP was found to localize to the mitochondria as previously reported (Fig. S1) (25Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Regulation of mitochondrial iron accumulation by Yfh1p, a putative homolog of frataxin.Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). We grew these cells in galactose (ON) and then shifted them to glucose (OFF) in the presence of cycloheximide to block new translation. We observed a significant diminution in Yfh1-GFP levels in ERG29 OFF cells compared to ERG29 ON cells (Fig. 1A). Quantification of Western blots revealed that the half-life of Yfh1-GFP in ERG29 ON cells (5.10 h) was similar to that previously reported for Yfh1 (4.9 h) (31Christiano R. Nagaraj N. Frohlich F.

In ERG29 OFF cells, we observed a rapid decrease in the half-life of mitochondrial Yfh1-GFP (2.94 h), whereas the half-lives of Nfs1 and Isu1, other ISC synthesis proteins that act in the early ISC assembly complex (32Gerber J.

The amount of Nfs1 and Isu1 found complexed to Yfh1-GFP in control cells (ERG29 ON) was about 20 to 30%, with 70 to 80% unbound at any given time (Fig. 1C). As expected, the levels of unbound Nfs1 and Isu1 increased in the ERG29 shut off cells. The change in Yfh1 half-life was observed almost immediately after turn off of ERG29 expression, suggesting that there is either a signal or modification on Yfh1 that mediates increased turnover. The decreases in Yfh1 levels seen as early as 2 h after ERG29 shut off resulted in increased mitochondrial ROS as measured by the MitoSOX mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1D) and diminished ISC synthesis as measured by aconitase activity (Fig. 1E). This result suggests that the levels of Yfh1 can be “rate-limiting” for ISC synthesis. We also noted that control cells grown in galactose showed reduced aconitase activity suggesting that ISC synthesis may not meet the demands required by growth in galactose. Previous studies suggest that immature Fxn levels can be changed by inhibiting specific protease pathways in mammalian FRDA cells including the proteasome and autophagy pathways along with inhibiting the mitochondrial protease PITRM1 (34Benini M.

Quality control of mitochondria: Protection against neurodegeneration and ageing.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We focused on the Lon protease Pim1, a yeast mitochondrial protease known to mediate oxidized protein turnover (43Hamon M.P. Bulteau A.L. Friguet B. Mitochondrial proteases and protein quality control in ageing and longevity.Ageing Res. Rev. 2015; 23: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 44Bayot A. Gareil M. Rogowska-Wrzesinska A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 11445-11457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine if Pim1 is responsible for increased Yfh1 turnover in ERG29 OFF cells, we generated strains expressing YFH1-GFP with a deletion of PIM1 in WT and Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 cells. Loss of Pim1 resulted in a slight increase in Yfh1-GFP half-life in WT mitochondria, although not to significance (Fig. 2A), whereas, deletion of PIM1 in Δerg29pGAL1ERG29 shut off cells resulted in a dramatic increase in the half-life of mitochondrial localized Yfh1-GFP with minimal Yfh1-GFP degradation observed when ERG29 was shut off (Fig. 2B). In addition, overexpression of the mitochondrial iron exporter Mmt1 protected Yfh1 from Pim1-mediated degradation in ERG29 OFF conditions (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that mitochondrial iron accumulation and increased mitochondrial oxidant-mediated targeting of Yfh1 are responsible for increased Yfh1 degradation through Pim1. Previous studies have shown doxorubicin treatment of cardiomyocytes results in increased mitochondrial ROS, decreased Fxn levels, and decreased mitochondrial function (23Mouli S. Nanayakkara G.

The cardioprotective mechanism of phenylaminoethyl selenides (PAESe) against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity involves frataxin.Front. Pharmacol. 2020; 11: 574656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Fxn protects against oxidant-mediated cell death. We examined if other ISC synthesis proteins were affected by doxorubicin exposure. When the rat cardiomyocyte cell line H9C2 was treated with doxorubicin, there was a marked decrease in Fxn levels, whereas, levels of the ISC scaffolding protein Iscu increased and Nfs1 levels were unaltered (Fig. 3, A and B). (Quantification of Western blots was done on mature Fxn). This suggests that the increased mitochondrial ROS in doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes specifically affect Fxn levels, similar to what we observed in our yeast ERG29 shut off model (Figs. 1 and 2). It is important to note that decreases in Fxn levels below 50% have been shown to result in mitochondrial iron accumulation in yeast cells and in mammalian models of ISC defects (25Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J.

Genet. 2001; 27: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that increasing iron levels in the mitochondrial of FRDA patients would further reduce mitochondrial Fxn levels. To our knowledge, the levels of mitochondrial Fxn over time of concurrent mitochondrial iron accumulation in patients have not been evaluated. To test this hypothesis, we grew WT and FRDA fibroblasts in 20 μM Fe-nitrotriacetic acid (FeNTA) and measured Fxn levels and mitochondrial ROS. Fxn levels were increased in WT cells grown in the presence of FeNTA (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, Fxn levels were significantly reduced in FRDA cells under these same conditions. Both WT and FRDA showed increased levels of ferritin, indicating that both WT and FRDA cells were iron loaded. To determine if the changes in Fxn levels were due to changes in transcripts, we quantified FXN mRNA levels using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We observed a small but significant increased FXN transcripts in FeNTA grown FRDA cells (Fig. 3E). These results show that the decrease in Fxn protein in FeNTA-exposed FRDA cells was not due to a decrease in FXN transcripts. The increase in cellular iron levels slightly increased mitochondrial ROS in WT cells and dramatically increased mitochondrial ROS in FRDA cells (Fig. 3, F and G). Our yeast studies showed that when mitochondrial ROS were increased due to iron accumulation, yeast Fxn (Yfh1) was degraded by the Lon protease Pim1 (Fig. 2), which is known to target oxidized proteins (49Ngo J.K. Pomatto L.C. Davies K.J. Upregulation of the mitochondrial Lon Protease allows adaptation to acute oxidative stress but dysregulation is associated with chronic stress, disease, and aging.Redox Biol. 2013; 1: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine if mammalian Fxn is a target of the Lon1 protease, we utilized a Lon1 protease inhibitor 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid methyl ester (CDDO)–Me to prevent degradation of oxidized mitochondrial proteins (50Gibellini L.

We confirmed that the CDDO-Me acted as a Lon inhibitor as the levels of a known Lon target, aconitase 2 (51Bota D.A. Davies K.J.

Van Remmen H. Davies K.J. Modulation of Lon protease activity and aconitase turnover during aging and oxidative stress.FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), were increased when FRDA cells were treated with CDDO-Me (Fig. S3). When FRDA cells grown in FeNTA were treated with CDDO-me, we observed a significant increase in Fxn levels (Fig. 3H). These results support a role for the Lon protease in mitochondrial iron/oxidant-mediated decreased Fxn levels similar to that observed in yeast (Fig. 2) and for other yeast ISC proteins (53Ciesielski S.J. Schilke B. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Protection of scaffold protein Isu from degradation by the Lon protease Pim1 as a component of Fe-S cluster biogenesis regulation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2016; 27: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As expected, the levels of Fxn did not approach that of WT fibroblasts as the genetic mutation harbored in FRDA patient cells already shows a >50% decrease in Fxn due to reduced FXN mRNA levels. Fxn levels did return to pre iron exposure levels. We noted that extended incubations (>24 h) with 1 μM CDDO-Me were toxic to cells (data not shown) not allowing for extended time course evaluations of Fxn turnover. Current therapies for FRDA have shown modest effects in vivo and there is a great need for better therapies for this lethal disorder. Studies have suggested that iron chelation, antioxidants, or increased autophagy may improve mitochondrial function in either the absence of Yfh1 (54Bulteau A.L. Planamente S. Jornea L. Dur A.

Methods The 2nd and 3rd MCP joints were scanned at a voxel size of 60.7 μm using second-generation HR-pQCT. Bone erosions on MCP joints were identified using a semi-automated algorithm we developed, and each erosion parameter was measured. Measurement reproducibility was evaluated in 19 healthy subjects using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and root mean square percent coefficient of variance (RMS%CV). Finally, longitudinal changes in bone erosions over a period of 12 months were assessed in 26 patients with RA based on the calculated least significant change (LSC). Results Reproducibilities for measurement parameters regarding bone erosions with our algorithm were good (all ICCs ≥ 0.98; all RMS%CVs &lt; 5%). No erosion parameters showed significant changes after 12 months of treatment in terms of median values in all erosions, while both progression and repair of erosions were observed individually (e.g., erosion volume: progression, 26% (+0.62 mm 3 ); repair, 34% (-0.85 mm 3 ); no change, 40%). Conclusions The measurement algorithm developed for bone erosions at MCP joints showed good reproducibility. Both progression and repair of bone erosions were observed in patients with RA even after 12 months of appropriate treatment. Our algorithm may be useful to investigate the etiology of RA and assess drug efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4224462495,"The intensification of agriculture leads to increased pesticide use and significant transformation from small fields towards large-scale monocultures. This may significantly affect populations of non-target arthropods (NTA). We aimed to assess whether the multigenerational exposure to plant protection products has resulted in the evolution of resistance to insecticides in the ground beetle Poecilus cupreus originating from different agricultural landscapes. Two contrasting landscapes were selected for the study, one dominated by small and another by large fields. Within each landscape the beetles were collected at nine sites representing range of canola coverage and a variety of habitat types. Part of the collected beetles, after acclimation to laboratory conditions, were tested for sensitivity to Proteus 110 OD-the most commonly used insecticide in the studied landscapes. The rest were bred in the laboratory for two consecutive generations, and part of the beetles from each generation were also tested for sensitivity to selected insecticide. We showed that the beetles inhabiting areas with medium and large share of canola located in the landscape dominated by large fields were less sensitive to the studied insecticide. The persistence of reduced sensitivity to Proteus 110 OD for two consecutive generations indicates that either the beetles have developed resistance to the insecticide or the chronic exposure to pesticides has led to the selection of more resistant individuals naturally present in the studied populations. No increased resistance was found in the beetles from more heterogeneous landscape dominated by small fields, in which spatio-temporal diversity of crops and abundance of small, linear off-crop landscape elements may provide shelter that allows NTAs to survive without developing any, presumably costly, resistance mechanisms."

This study was carried out to investigate the diversity and population structure of 34 P . vulgaris landrace accessions collected from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&amp;K) regions of Pakistan. The samples were analyzed both morphologically and using genetic variation identified through RNA sequencing. Our results indicated that most genetic variation occurs among local accessions, with little genetic variation occurring between geographical regions. In addition, the accessions fell into two major genetic groups. Morphological analysis revealed that these two genetic groups differ in a number of quantitative traits, including seed length, seed width, and seed weight. One accession, DUD-11, appears to be a mixture of the two major groups genetically as well as morphologically. Among the other accessions, DUD-8, RWK-2, and NGD-1 depicted particularly high seed weight along with higher seed length, seed width, and seed yield per plant. We suggest focusing on these accessions in future breeding programs. More generally, our results provide baseline data that will be useful for crop improvement and effective cultivation practices in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4224979812,"Most previous research place great importance on the influence of family and maternal background on child and adolescents' mental health. However, age of onset studies indicates that the majority of the mental health disease prevalence occurs during the youth years. This study investigates the relationship of family and maternal background, as well as individual circumstance on youth mental health status.Data from 975 participants and 4632 observations of aged cohort 15 to 19 years in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) longitudinal study were followed for 10 years (2007-2017). Multilevel logistic regression models were used to analyse the impact of youth circumstances on mental health status.The findings suggests that not all dimensions of family and maternal background (especially maternal education) have impacts on youth mental health. We found low household income (AOR: 1.572, 95% CI: 1.017-2.43) and adverse living arrangement (AOR: 1.586, 95% CI: 1.097-2.294) significantly increases mental disorder odds whereas maternal education or occupation fixed effects were not significant. Individual level circumstances have much stronger impact on youth mental health. We found financial shock (AOR: 1.412, 95% CI: 1.277-1.561), life event shock (AOR: 1.157, 95% CI: 1.01-1.326), long term health conditions (AOR: 2.855, 95% CI: 2.042-3.99), smoking (AOR: 1.676, 95% CI: 1.162-2.416), drinking (AOR: 1.649, 95% CI: 1.286-2.114) and being female (AOR: 2.021, 95% CI: 1.431-2.851) have significant deteriorating effects on youth mental health.Our finding is in contrast to the majority of studies in the literature which give a preeminent role to maternal characteristics in child and youth mental health status. Mental health interventions should consider heterogeneity of adverse youth circumstances and health-related behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W4224987341,"Advance care planning (ACP) can improve outcomes for persons living with dementia (PLwD). Clinicians see the lack of acceptability of these conversations as a barrier to ACP in individuals with mild dementia. COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the need for ACP discussions in older adults, particularly for those living with dementia. In light of the pandemic, much of the healthcare is provided virtually, but little evidence exists on how to best implement ACP virtually. We designed Voice Your Values (VYV), a tailored ACP intervention for persons living with mild dementia and their trusted individuals such as friends or family. Purpose Determine the acceptability of the VYV intervention, in terms of its content and the potential utility of videoconferencing to deliver it. Methods For this pilot study, we recruited 21 dyads of older adults with mild dementia and their trusted individuals from five geriatric clinics in Ontario, Canada. The tailored VYV intervention was delivered to dyads over two sessions over videoconferencing. Acceptability was assessed using scores on a modified Treatment Evaluation Inventory. The interventionist diary and Researcher Virtual Experience Questionnaire were used to examine facilitators and barriers, whereas Participant Virtual Experience Questionnaire was used to understand their experience. Qualitative data was analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results 100% of the participants rated VYV as acceptable. Participants and researcher rated video and sound quality highly. PLwD who lived with their trusted individuals were more likely to find the intervention acceptable (t = 3.559, p = 0.001, β = 0.323). Five interrelated themes were established that describe the acceptability of the virtually delivered VYV intervention. All PLwD were able to articulate their values and wishes related to being in a terminal and vegetative states and had them documented. Conclusion The virtual VYV intervention was an acceptable approach to ACP in older adults with mild dementia and their trusted individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4224990556,"USP2 contributes to the quality control of multiple oncogenic proteins including cyclin D1, Mdm2, Aurora-A, etc., and it is a potential target for anti-cancer drug development. However, currently only a few inhibitors with moderate inhibition activities against USP2 have been discovered. USP2-targeted active compounds with either new scaffolds or enhanced activities are in need. Here in this study, Ub-AMC hydrolysis assay-based screening against ~4000 commercially available drugs and drug candidates was performed to identify USP2-targeted inhibitors. COH29, which was originally developed as an anti-cancer agent by blocking the function of human ribonucleotide reductase (RNR, IC50 = 16 µM), was found to exhibit an inhibition activity against USP2 with the IC50 value at 2.02 ± 0.16 µM. The following conducted biophysical and biochemical experiments demonstrated that COH29 could specifically interact with USP2 and inhibit its enzymatic activity in a noncompetitive inhibition mode (Ki = 1.73 ± 0.14 µM). Since COH29 shows similar inhibitory potencies against RNR (RRM2) and USP2, USP2 inhibition-dependent cellular consequences of COH29 are expected. The results of cellular assays confirmed that the application of COH29 could downregulate the level of cyclin D1 by enhancing its degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and the modulation effect of COH29 on cyclin D1 is independent of RRM2. Since cyclin D1 acts as an oncogenic driver in human cancer, our findings suggest that USP2 might be a promising therapeutic target for cyclin D1-addicted cancers, and COH29 could serve as a starting compound for high selectivity inhibitor development against USP2."

A sample of initial consultation notes (ICN) of oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients were identified through a purposeful sampling method and added to the study until saturation was achieved.

From the 34 ICN included in our analysis, five main categories were identified: appraisal interval, help-seeking interval, diagnosis interval, pre-treatment interval, and other contributing factors such as health-related behaviours, system delay, and tumor characteristics. These factors negatively contributed to early detection of oral and oropharyngeal cancers and affect treatment wait time with patients, providers, and the healthcare system. Patient's lack of awareness, provider's oversight and prolonged access to care were the main reasons of delay in cancer diagnosis and management in our study. A sustainable plan for public awareness interventions and implementation of a solid curriculum for medical and dental students is needed to enhance their related knowledge, competence in clinical judgement, and treatment managements."
https://openalex.org/W4225808301,"The Tahiti petrel (Pseudobulweria rostrata) is a rare and declining seabird whose breeding biology and nest-site selection are poorly known. Nest-site selection is critical to seabird population fitness, and understanding the factors driving it is essential for designing effective conservation measures. Here, we measured several variables (topographical, physical and environmental) to characterize Tahiti petrel nesting habitats and burrows (i.e., width, height, depth and type: rocky cavity, dug into the soil or under a root) on Nemou Island in New Caledonia. The data were clustered using the HCPC (Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Component) method to identify principal habitat groups. This method was combined with logistic regressions to examine the influence of the variables on nest-site selection and breeding success. Our results showed that nest-site selection is linked to habitat groups (a combination of substrate and vegetation data), slope, orientation and soil depth, while breeding success is only influenced by nest characteristics (i.e., burrow type and width). Tahiti petrels prefer to nest on steep slopes in mature forests with rocky substrate and deep soil. Burrows were scatterred in small sub-colonies or isolated pairs, suggesting that nest-site selection depends on habitat quality rather than conspecific density. The study also revealed that breeding success is lower in rocky cavities and increases in burrows with wide entrances. Our nest-site selection survey is the first for the genus Pseudobulweria, and provides critical information for designing effective conservation programs in New Caledonia and the Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W4225816914,"Oral mucositis (OM) is a common side effect in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy; however, no salivary mediator is known to be associated with OM. We aimed to determine candidate salivary inflammatory mediators potentially associated with OM in patients with cancer. To this end, we compared the relationships between OM grade, oral mucosal dryness, and inflammatory mediators (Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), prostaglandin E2, and vascular endothelial growth factor) in patients with cancer and in healthy volunteers (HV). We collected saliva samples from 18 patients with cancer according to the following schedule: 1) within 14 days of treatment initiation, 2) within 3 days of OM occurrence, 3) when OM was improved or got worsened, and 4) within 7 days after chemotherapy completion. The oral care support team determined the OM grade at each sample collection point based on CTCAE version 5.0. Salivary inflammatory mediator concentrations were detected using cytometric bead array or enzyme-linked immunoassay. We compared oral mucosal dryness in pre- and post-index patients with cancer to that in HV (n = 33) using an oral moisture-checking device. Fourteen of eighteen patients experienced OM (four, grade 3 OM; four, grade 2 OM; six, grade 1 OM). IL-6, IL-10, and TNF salivary concentrations were significantly increased in the post-index group compared to those in the pre-index group (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0364, and p = 0.0160, respectively). Additionally, salivary IL-6, IL-10, and TNF levels were significantly higher in the post-index group than in the HV group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively). Significant positive correlations were observed between OM grade and salivary IL-6, IL-10, and TNF levels (p = 0.0004, r = 0.4939; p = 0.0171, r = 0.3394; and p = 0007, r = 0.4662, respectively). Oral mucosal dryness was significantly higher in the HV than in the pre- and post-index groups (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that salivary IL-6, IL-10, and TNF levels may be used as biomarkers for OM occurrence and grade in patients with cancer. Furthermore, monitoring oral mucosal dryness and managing oral hygiene before cancer treatment is essential."
https://openalex.org/W4226077401,"We investigated mediolateral dynamic stability at first foot off and first initial contact during gait initiation according to whether the paretic or non-paretic leg was used as the leading limb. Thirty-eight individuals with stroke initiated gait with the paretic and non-paretic legs as the leading limb, and their movements were measured using a 3D motion analysis system. Margin of stability (i.e., the length between the extrapolated center of mass and lateral border of the stance foot) was used as an index of dynamic stability, with a large value indicating dynamic stability in the lateral direction. However, an excessively large margin of stability value (i.e., when the extrapolated center of mass is outside the medial border of the stance foot) indicates dynamic instability in the medial direction. Differences in the margin of stability between tasks were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The minimum margin of stability was observed just before first foot off. When the non-paretic leg was used as the leading limb, the margin of stability tended to be excessively large at first foot off compared with when the paretic leg was used (p < 0.001). In other words, the extrapolated center of mass was outside the medial border of the paretic stance foot. In conclusion, lateral stability was achieved when using the non-paretic leading limb because the extrapolated center of mass was located outside the medial border of the stance foot. However, medial dynamic stability was lower for the non-paretic leading limb compared with the paretic leading limb."
https://openalex.org/W4226150555,"While fertility rates have decreased during the second half of the 20th century in Japan, little is known regarding trends in the number of children that men and women have across birth cohorts and whether these differ by education and income.We used data from four rounds of the National Fertility Survey (1992, 2005, 2010 and 2015) and included men and women aged 40-49 years (16728 men and 17628 women). By 5-year birth cohorts, we assessed the distribution of number of children (0, 1, 2 and 3 or more) and total fertility (the mean number of children) at completed fertility (age 45-49 or 40-44 years depending on birth cohort). We assessed trends in these fertility outcomes in men and women separately, and by education (no university education; university education) for men and women and by reported annual income (0 to <3 000 000 JPY; 3 000 000 to <6 000 000 JPY; ≥6 000 000 JPY) for men.When comparing those born in 1943-1948 with those born in 1971-1975, the proportion with no children had increased from 14.3 to 39.9% for men and from 11.6 to 27.6% for women. This increase coincided with a decrease in the proportions of individuals with 2 or more children. Total fertility had decreased from 1.92 to 1.17 among men and from 1.96 to 1.42 among women. For men, those with a university degree were more likely to have children than those without a university degree in all birth cohorts except 1943-1947. Men with higher income were more likely to have children across birth cohorts. While the proportion who had children had decreased in all income groups, the decrease was steeper among those in the lowest income group. Among women born 1956-1970, those with a university degree were less likely to have children than those without a university degree; this difference was no longer seen among those born 1971-1975. For both men and women, trends in having children and total fertility across birth cohorts did not differ by educational status.The decline in the total fertility rate in Japan can be attributed to both an increasing proportion of the population who have no children and a lower number of children among those who have children. Men with lower education and income were less likely to have children and the disparity in the number of children that men have by income had increased in more recent birth cohorts. Among women, higher education was associated with lower fertility, although this pattern was no longer observed among those born in 1971-1975."
https://openalex.org/W4224884197,"Livestock herding dogs contribute greatly to the rural economy of Australia. However, their selection currently lacks a cohesive or methodical approach. For example, there is no accessible tool for assessing Australian livestock herding dogs' suitability for work. The purpose of the current study was to devise a herding dog assessment form, the Herding Dog Assessment Form-Personality (HDAF-P), to facilitate collection of data on relevant behavioural phenotypes of large numbers of working Kelpies and to apply the HDAF-P to identify personality traits needed for herding dog performance. The focus was on creating a succinct form that was salient and accessible to livestock herding dog owners. Wherever practical, terms and methods from published personality questionnaires were integrated. Seventeen terms were included as behavioural descriptors in the HDAF-P which was then used by 95 owners to assess a sample of 228 of their working Kelpies. Owners were also asked to rate the overall ability of their dog(s). Of these dogs, 210 (all twelve months or older) were fully described and their data were used in the analysis. Thus, the study was designed to reveal which personality traits are most critical to the overall ability of the herding dogs and to undertake an exploratory analysis of the patterns of dog behaviour revealed by the HDAF-P in non-juvenile dogs. The traits that showed the strongest correlations (using Kendall's Tau correlation analysis) with overall ability were initiative (T = 0.41, p < 0.001), persistence (T = 0.36, p < 0.001), intelligence (T = 0.32, p < 0.001), confidence (T = 0.36, p < 0.001) and nervousness (T = -0.30, p < 0.001). An exploratory principal component analysis of trait scores revealed that 64.5% of the variance could be explained by four components that share several similarities with those reported by previous dog personality studies. These findings confirm that the HDAF-P has potential for the practical assessment of livestock herding dog personality and can elucidate traits that should be considered for prioritisation in training and breeding to optimise herding dog ability."

https://openalex.org/W4225258848,"Hyperemesis gravidarum is severe nausea and excessive vomiting, starting between 4 and 6 gestational weeks, peak at between 8 and 12 weeks and usually improve and subside by 20 weeks of pregnancy. Identifying the determinants of hyperemesis gravidarum has a particular importance for early detection and intervention to reduce the health, psychosocial and economic impact. In Ethiopia there is low information on determinants of hyperemesis gravidarum.Institution based unmatched case-control study design was conducted from April 12- June 12, 2021. A structured face-to-face interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist for document review were used to collect the data from 360 study participants (120 cases and 240 controls). The data were collected by KoBocollect 1.3, and then exported to statistical package for social science version 25 for further analysis. Both bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were done to identify the determinants and a p-value < 0.05 with a 95% confidence level was used to declare statistical significance.Being an urban dweller (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.01, 4.34), having polygamous husband (AOR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.27, 6.68), having history asthma/ other respiratory tract infections (AOR = 3.56, 95% CI: 1.43, 8.82), saturated fat intake (AOR = 4.06 95% CI: 1.98, 8.3), no intake of ginger (AOR = 3.04 95% CI: 1.14, 8.09), and inadequate intake of vitamin B rich foods (2.2, 95% CI: 1.14-4.2) were the determinants of hyperemesis gravidarum.This study revealed that, urban residence, having polygamous husband, history of asthma/other respiratory tract infections, intake of saturated fat, no intake of ginger, inadequate intake of vitamin B reach foods were found to be independent determinants of hyperemesis gravidarum. It is better if healthcare providers and government authorities exert continual effort to give health education and counselling service concerning to dietary practice and asthma attacks. It is advisable if pregnant women adhere to healthy diets and limit intake of saturated fats and also husband and nearby relatives give care and support for pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W4226137540,"Background A high false-negative rate has been reported for the diagnosis of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) using plain radiography. We investigated whether deep learning (DL) can improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists for cervical OPLL using plain radiographs. Materials and methods The training set consisted of 915 radiographs from 207 patients diagnosed with OPLL. For the test set, we used 200 lateral cervical radiographs from 100 patients with cervical OPLL and 100 patients without OPLL. An observer performance study was conducted over two reading sessions. In the first session, we compared the diagnostic performance of the DL-model and the six observers. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) at the vertebra and patient level. The sensitivity and specificity of the DL model and average observers were calculated in per-patient analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the morphologic classification of OPLL. In the second session, observers evaluated the radiographs by referring to the results of the DL-model. Results In the vertebra-level analysis, the DL-model showed an AUC of 0.854, which was higher than the average AUC of observers (0.826), but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.292). In the patient-level analysis, the performance of the DL-model had an AUC of 0.851, and the average AUC of observers was 0.841 ( p = 0.739). The patient-level sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 69% in the DL model, and 83% and 68% for the average observers, respectively. Both the DL-model and observers showed decreases in overall performance in the segmental and circumscribed types. With knowledge of the results of the DL-model, the average AUC of observers increased to 0.893 ( p = 0.001) at the vertebra level and 0.911 ( p &lt; 0.001) at the patient level. In the subgroup analysis, the improvement was largest in segmental-type (AUC difference 0.087; p = 0.002). Conclusions The DL-based OPLL detection model can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists on cervical radiographs."
https://openalex.org/W4226165843,"Only a small proportion of COVID-19 patients in Canada have been recruited into clinical research studies. One reason is that few community intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada participate in research. The objective of this study was to examine the motivating factors, barriers and facilitators to research participation amongst Canadian community ICU stakeholders. A cross-sectional online survey was distributed between May and November 2020. The survey focused on 6 domains: participant demographics, ICU characteristics, ICU research infrastructure, motivating factors, perceived barriers, and perceived facilitators. Responses were received from 73 community ICU stakeholders, representing 18 ICUs. 7/18 ICUs had a clinical research program. Participants rated their interest in pandemic research at a mean of 5.2 (Standard Deviation [SD] = 1.9) on a 7-point Likert scale from 'not interested' to 'very interested'. The strongest motivating factor for research participation was the belief that research improves clinical care and outcomes. The most significant facilitators of research involvement were the availability of an experienced research coordinator and dedicated external funding to cover start-up costs, while the most significant barriers to research involvement were a lack of start-up funding for a research coordinator and a lack of ICU research experience. Canadian Community ICU stakeholders are interested in participating in pandemic research but lack basic infrastructure, research personnel, research experience and start-up funding. Evolution of a research support model at community hospitals, where most patients receive acute care, may increase research participation and improve the generalizability of funded research in Canada."
