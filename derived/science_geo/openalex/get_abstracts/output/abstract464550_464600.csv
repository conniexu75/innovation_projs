We included articles published in 2005 or later reporting for the prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus clinical isolates. Thirty-two studies were included. In Tunisia, the prevalence of MRSA increased from 16% to 41% between 2002–2007, while in Libya it was 31% in 2007. In South Africa, the prevalence decreased from 36% in 2006 to 24% during 2007–2011. In Botswana, the prevalence varied from 23–44% between 2000–2007. In Algeria and Egypt, the prevalence was 45% and 52% between 2003–2005, respectively. In Nigeria, the prevalence was greater in the northern than the southern part. In Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast, the prevalence was 55% and 39%, respectively. The prevalence of MRSA was lower than 50% in most of the African countries, although it appears to have risen since 2000 in many African countries, except for South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2020686570,"WRINKLED1 (AtWRI1) is a key transcription factor in the regulation of plant oil synthesis in seed and non-seed tissues. The structural features of WRI1 important for its function are not well understood. Comparison of WRI1 orthologs across many diverse plant species revealed a conserved 9 bp exon encoding the amino acids “VYL”. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids within the ‘VYL’ exon of AtWRI1 failed to restore the full oil content of wri1-1 seeds, providing direct evidence for an essential role of this small exon in AtWRI1 function. Arabidopsis WRI1 is predicted to have three alternative splice forms. To understand expression of these splice forms we performed RNASeq of Arabidopsis developing seeds and queried other EST and RNASeq databases from several tissues and plant species. In all cases, only one splice form was detected and VYL was observed in transcripts of all WRI1 orthologs investigated. We also characterized a phylogenetically distant WRI1 ortholog (EgWRI1) as an example of a non-seed isoform that is highly expressed in the mesocarp tissue of oil palm. The C-terminal region of EgWRI1 is over 90 amino acids shorter than AtWRI1 and has surprisingly low sequence conservation. Nevertheless, the EgWRI1 protein can restore multiple phenotypes of the Arabidopsis wri1-1 loss-of-function mutant, including reduced seed oil, the “wrinkled” seed coat, reduced seed germination, and impaired seedling establishment. Taken together, this study provides an example of combining phylogenetic analysis with mutagenesis, deep-sequencing technology and computational analysis to examine key elements of the structure and function of the WRI1 plant transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1980407081,"The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a macromolecular machine that mediates bacteria-host or bacteria-bacteria interactions. The T6SS core apparatus assembles from 13 proteins that form two sub-assemblies: a phage-like complex and a trans-envelope complex. The Hcp, VgrG, TssE, and TssB/C subunits are structurally and functionally related to components of the tail of contractile bacteriophages. This phage-like structure is thought to be anchored to the membrane by a trans-envelope complex composed of the TssJ, TssL, and TssM proteins. However, how the two sub-complexes are connected remains unknown. Here we identify TssK, a protein that establishes contacts with the two T6SS sub-complexes through direct interactions with TssL, Hcp, and TssC. TssK is a cytoplasmic protein assembling trimers that display a three-armed shape, as revealed by TEM and SAXS analyses. Fluorescence microscopy experiments further demonstrate the requirement of TssK for sheath assembly. Our results suggest a central role for TssK by linking both complexes during T6SS assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2085450186,"Hsp70 proteins constitute an evolutionarily conserved protein family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones involved in a wide range of biological processes. Mammalian Hsp70 proteins are subject to various post-translational modifications, including methylation, but for most of these, a functional role has not been attributed. In this study, we identified the methyltransferase METTL21A as the enzyme responsible for trimethylation of a conserved lysine residue found in several human Hsp70 (HSPA) proteins. This enzyme, denoted by us as HSPA lysine (K) methyltransferase (HSPA-KMT), was found to catalyze trimethylation of various Hsp70 family members both in vitro and in vivo, and the reaction was stimulated by ATP. Furthermore, we show that HSPA-KMT exclusively methylates 70-kDa proteins in mammalian protein extracts, demonstrating that it is a highly specific enzyme. Finally, we show that trimethylation of HSPA8 (Hsc70) has functional consequences, as it alters the affinity of the chaperone for both the monomeric and fibrillar forms of the Parkinson disease-associated protein α-synuclein.Background: The function of many proteins is regulated through post-translational methylation.Results: METTL21A was identified as a human protein methyltransferase targeting Hsp70 proteins, thereby altering their ability to interact with client proteins.Conclusion: METTL21A is a specific methyltransferase modulating the function of Hsp70 proteins.Significance: The activity of a human protein-modifying enzyme is unraveled, and the modification is demonstrated to have functional consequences.

Conclusion: METTL21A is a specific methyltransferase modulating the function of Hsp70 proteins. Significance: The activity of a human protein-modifying enzyme is unraveled, and the modification is demonstrated to have functional consequences. Many cellular proteins are post-translationally methylated. These modifications are introduced by protein methyltransferases (MTases), 3The abbreviations used are: MTasemethyltransferase7BSseven-beta strandSAMS-adenosylmethionineVCPvalosin-containing proteinNBDnucleotide-binding domainα-Synα-synucleinCBPcalmodulin-binding peptideSBPstreptavidin-binding peptideTAPtandem affinity purificationBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. usually on amine groups on the side chains of lysine and arginine residues (1.Clarke S.G. Protein methylation at the surface and buried deep: thinking outside the histone box.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The functional role of protein methylation has been most thoroughly studied in the case of histones, where methylation is described as a key element in the “histone code,” which is a strong determinant of chromatin state and gene transcription status (2.Greer E.L. Shi Y. Histone methylation: a dynamic mark in health, disease and inheritance.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). Lysine can accept up to three methyl groups, and many of the so-called “readers” of the histone code represent protein domains that specifically interact with a lysine of a certain methylation state, leading to the recruitment of transcriptional modulators and/or chromatin-modifying enzymes (3.Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. The key to development: interpreting the histone code?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 4.Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J.

Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). In addition to the frequent lysine methylations on histone proteins, many non-histone proteins are also subject to such methylation (1.Clarke S.G. Protein methylation at the surface and buried deep: thinking outside the histone box.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). methyltransferase seven-beta strand S-adenosylmethionine valosin-containing protein nucleotide-binding domain α-synuclein calmodulin-binding peptide streptavidin-binding peptide tandem affinity purification 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Besides methylating proteins, MTases are responsible for methylation of a wide variety of cellular macromolecules and metabolites (5.Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: a chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 6.Bestor T.H. The DNA methyltransferases of mammals.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis has predicted that MTases constitute ∼1% of all human protein-coding genes, and most of the >200 corresponding enzymes remain uncharacterized (7.Petrossian T.C. Clarke S.G. Uncovering the human methyltransferasome.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (10.1074/mcp.M110.000976)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MTases are subdivided into five different classes based on their three-dimensional structure. Of these, the “seven-beta strand” (7BS) MTases are the most abundant, comprising 126 enzymes in humans (7.Petrossian T.C. Clarke S.G. Uncovering the human methyltransferasome.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (10.1074/mcp.M110.000976)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The 7BS-MTases adopt a characteristic Rossmann fold-like twisted β-sheet and contain conserved sequence motifs involved in the binding of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), facilitating their identification by sequence homology searches (8.Katz J.E. Dlakić M. Clarke S. Automated identification of putative methyltransferases from genomic open reading frames.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 525-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The second largest class of MTases is constituted by the SET domain proteins, which are lysine-specific protein MTases responsible for methylations on the histone tails, as well as several methylations on non-histone substrates (9.Del Rizzo P.A. Trievel R.C. Substrate and product specificities of SET domain methyltransferases.Epigenetics. 2011; 6: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, some 7BS-MTases are also lysine-specific, and so far, three such human enzymes have been characterized. These are the histone-specific MTase DOT1L, which methylates Lys-79 in the globular part of histone H3; CaM-KMT, which trimethylates Lys-115 in calmodulin; and VCP-KMT, which trimethylates Lys-315 in the molecular chaperone valosin-containing protein (VCP) (see below) (10.Feng Q. Wang H. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Struhl K. Zhang Y. Methylation of H3-lysine 79 is mediated by a new family of HMTases without a SET domain.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1052-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 11.Magnani R. Dirk L.M. Trievel R.C. Houtz R.L. Calmodulin methyltransferase is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that trimethylates Lys-115 in calmodulin.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12.Kernstock S. Davydova E. Jakobsson M. Moen A. Pettersen S. Mælandsmo G.M. Egge-Jacobsen W. Falnes P.Ø. Lysine methylation of VCP by a member of a novel human protein methyltransferase family.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hsp70 (heat shock protein of ∼70 kDa) proteins represent ATP-dependent molecular chaperones present in all three domains of life and constitute one of the most evolutionarily conserved protein families (13.Hageman J. van Waarde M.A. Zylicz A. Walerych D. Kampinga H.H. The diverse members of the mammalian HSP70 machine show distinct chaperone-like activities.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Humans have 13 genes encoding Hsp70s (HSPA proteins), and whereas some of these proteins are induced by heat shock and other types of stress, others are constitutively expressed (14.Kampinga H.H. Hageman J. Vos M.J. Kubota H. Tanguay R.M. Bruford E.A. Cheetham M.E. Chen B. Hightower L.E. Guidelines for the nomenclature of the human heat shock proteins.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Although Hsp70s have been extensively studied, several remain largely uncharacterized. Some human Hsp70s are associated with specific subcellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum resident HSPA5 (BiP/Grp78), mitochondrial HSPA9 (mortalin), cytosolic constitutively expressed HSPA8 (Hsc70), and cytosolic/nuclear classical stress-inducible HSPA1 (Hsp70). Other members are testis-specific HSPA2 and cytosolic HSPA6, which has been reported to chaperone p53 (13.Hageman J. van Waarde M.A. Zylicz A. Walerych D. Kampinga H.H. The diverse members of the mammalian HSP70 machine show distinct chaperone-like activities.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hsp70s share a domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), followed by a substrate-binding domain, which can be further subdivided into a peptide-binding domain, which binds stretches of hydrophobic residues, and a C-terminal “lid” domain, which can fold back onto the peptide-binding domain and lock client proteins to Hsp70 (15.Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). This process, and thus the affinity for unfolded substrates and the binding/release cycles of the chaperone, is allosterically regulated by ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the NBD, which in turn is stimulated by co-chaperones from the Hsp40/DNAJ family and by nucleotide exchange factors. Together, these proteins are often referred to as the “Hsp70 chaperone machinery” (16.Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). In a recent study (12.Kernstock S. Davydova E. Jakobsson M. Moen A. Pettersen S. Mælandsmo G.M. Egge-Jacobsen W. Falnes P.Ø. Lysine methylation of VCP by a member of a novel human protein methyltransferase family.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we reported that the previously uncharacterized human putative MTase METTL21D was responsible for trimethylating Lys-315 in the abundant and essential molecular chaperone VCP, and we denoted this enzyme VCP-KMT. Moreover, our results indicated that VCP-KMT and its close relatives METLL21A, METTL21B, and METTL21C, together with calmodulin (CaM-KMT) and five uncharacterized MTases, constitute a family of human protein MTases (12.Kernstock S. Davydova E. Jakobsson M. Moen A. Pettersen S. Mælandsmo G.M. Egge-Jacobsen W. Falnes P.Ø. Lysine methylation of VCP by a member of a novel human protein methyltransferase family.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the function of METTL21A and show by a combination of enzymatic and cellular studies that it catalyzes the trimethylation of a conserved Lys residue found in the lid domain of several human Hsp70s. Moreover, we show that trimethylation of HSPA8 modulates its chaperone activity, manifested as a reduced ability to sequester the Parkinson disease-associated protein α-synuclein (α-Syn) in a soluble state and to bind to preformed α-Syn fibrils. NCBI BLAST was used for identification of proteins homologous to human Hsp70s and METTL21A (17.McGinnis S. Madden T.L. BLAST: at the core of a powerful and diverse set of sequence analysis tools.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W20-W25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Multiple protein sequence alignments were performed using the Muscle algorithm embedded in Jalview v2.8 (18.Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J. Jalview Version 2–a multiple sequence alignment editor and analysis workbench.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5690) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of proteins was predicted from the primary sequence using the PSIPRED algorithm (19.McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. The PSIPRED protein structure prediction server.Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). All plasmids used in this study and the detailed cloning strategy used to generate them are listed in supplemental Table S1. Briefly, ORFs were amplified with Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) using primers that generated PCR products with restriction sites flanking the ORF. The PCR product was then digested with the indicated restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) and cloned into pNTAPa (Agilent Technologies), pGEX-6P (GE Healthcare), or pET28a (Novagen). To generate the pcDNA5/FRT/TO-METL21A-CBP-SBP construct, METTL21A was first cloned into pNTAPa and then subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) using ApaI and NotI. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. A cell line for inducible overexpression of calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP)- and streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP)-tagged METTL21A was generated using the Flp-InTM T-RExTM HEK-293 system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Flp-In T-REx HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO-METTL21A-CBP-SBP and pOG44 (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen). Successful incorporation of the METTL21A construct was selected for with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Cells were thereafter maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with tetracycline-reduced 10% (v/v) FBS (AH diagnostics), l-glutamine (Lonza), 5 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). Tandem affinity purification (TAP) was performed using the InterPlay mammalian TAP system (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a few exceptions. Briefly, the Flp-In T-REx HEK-293 METTL21A-CBP-SBP cell line was expanded onto 20 T175 flasks. Overexpression of the bait was induced in 10 flasks with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich D9891) for 24 h, whereas the remaining flasks were untreated to serve as a negative control. As our prior experience indicated that S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine may stabilize 7BS-MTase·substrate complexes, all buffers were supplemented with 100 μm S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, and 1 mm PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to promote protein stability throughout the purification. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× NuPAGE gel loading buffer (Invitrogen) and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. pET28a- and pGEX-6P-derived plasmids harboring recombinant His6- and GST-tagged proteins, respectively, were transfected into the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL expression strain (Agilent). Cells were cultured with appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C and shaking at 250 rpm until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5. The temperature was then reduced to 18 °C, and the expression of His6- or GST-tagged proteins was induced by 100 or 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, respectively, and allowed to proceed for 16 h. Cells were thereafter harvested by centrifugation. For purification of His6-tagged proteins, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 30 mm imidazole, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 units/ml Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich)). Imidazole was omitted for GST-tagged constructs. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and recombinant proteins were allowed to bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (His6-tagged proteins; Qiagen) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GST-tagged proteins; GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 16 h. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity resins were extensively washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (w/v) glycerol), whereas nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resins were washed with wash buffer supplemented with 30 mm imidazole. Recombinant proteins were eluted in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl) supplemented with either 300 mm imidazole (His6-tagged proteins) or 15 mm reduced glutathione (GST-tagged proteins). Eluates were then buffer-exchanged to storage buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 6.8), and 1 mm DTT) by sequential concentration and dilution using Vivaspin 20 ultrafiltration columns with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 or 50 kDa (Sartorius AG). Proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C, and concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For tag removal, GST-fused HSPA proteins were incubated with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 16 h to allow proteolytic cleavage. Free GST, GST-fused HSPA proteins, and protease were removed with glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions, and untagged HSPA proteins were buffer-exchanged to storage buffer as described above. Methyltransferase reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes for 1 h at 37 °C in methyltransferase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 13 μm [3H]SAM (2 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 4 μm substrate, and 2 μm METTL21A) unless stated otherwise. For mass spectrometric analysis, radiolabeled SAM was replaced with 1.2 mm nonradioactive SAM (New England Biolabs). Reactions were stopped by precipitating proteins with TCA for liquid scintillation counting of radioactivity or by denaturation in NuPAGE sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis (followed by MS or fluorographic analysis). For fluorography, reactions were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using the XCell SureLockTM system (Invitrogen). Membranes were then stained with Ponceau S, treated with the scintillation enhancer EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to Carestream Kodak BioMax MS film (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24–72 h at −80 °C. For liquid scintillation counting, proteins were precipitated in 10% (w/v) TCA at 4 °C for 1 h. Acid-insoluble material was retained on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C) by vacuum filtration. Filters were washed with 10% (w/v) TCA and EtOH and placed in scintillation fluid (Ultima GoldTM XR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. LC-MS/MS of proteolytic peptides was performed using a Hypercarb 5-μm particle size column (G&T Septech AS) for sample concentration and a C18 column (GlycproSIL C18–80Å, Glycpromass) for analytical separation of peptides. Samples were washed with a mobile phase (0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 2.5% (v/v) acetonitrile) and eluted with a binary gradient of increasing acetonitrile up to 60% (v/v). The LC setup was coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) via nanoelectrospray. In-gel proteolytic digestion was performed with Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) or trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Peptide samples were analyzed with a collision-induced dissociation fragmentation method, acquiring one Orbitrap survey scan in the mass range of m/z 200–2000, followed by MS/MS of the most intense ions in the Orbitrap. Mass spectrometric data were analyzed with searches using Proteome Discoverer SEQUESTTM (Thermo Scientific) against in-house maintained databases of either HSPA proteins or the human proteome. The mass tolerances for fragment ions and parent ions were set to 0.5 Da and 10 ppm, respectively. Methionine oxidation and lysine mono-, di-, and trimethylation and acetylation were selected as variable modifications. MS/MS spectra of relevant peptides were manually extracted using Qual Browser (v2.0.7). Chromatograms representing various methylation states of peptides were generated by gating for m/z ratios corresponding to un-, mono-, di-, and trimethylated species of the predominant charge state using the BOXCAR algorithm and a sensitivity of 10 ppm in Qual Browser (v2.0.7). To achieve comparable chromatograms, the y axis was normalized with respect to signal intensity for the different methylation states. Relative quantification of peptides was performed by integrating area under curves using Qual Browser (v2.0.7). The following primary antibodies were used (dilution in Western blotting is indicated): anti-HSPA1 (Abcam ab79852; 1:10,000), anti-HSPA8 (Abcam EP1531Y/ab51052; 1:1000), anti-GAPDH (Ambion AM4300; 1:4000), and anti-CBP (Millipore 07-482; 1:4000). For detection of HSPA1-K561me3 (HSPA1(me3)), a custom antibody was used at a dilution of 1:10,000 in Western blots. The antibody was obtained by affinity purification of serum from rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide (acetyl-CDEGLKGK(me3)ISEA-amide; New England Peptide). Transfer of samples to PVDF membrane was performed as described above. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 and incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were thereafter incubated with SuperSignal West Dura (Thermo Scientific), and chemiluminescence signals were detected with a Image Station 4000R Pro system (Kodak). For knockdown assays, Flp-In T-REx HEK-293 cells were transfected with either a pool of siRNAs versus the METTL21A transcript (Sigma-Aldrich SASI_Hs01_00047371, SASI_Hs01_00047373, and SASI_Hs01_00047374) or a scrambled sequence as a negative control (Sigma-Aldrich SIC001), or RNA was omitted. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was used as the transfection agent according to the manufacturer's instructions, and knockdown was assayed by Western blotting and MS after 72 h. Reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes in a 96-well format in assay buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) supplemented with HSPA1 (1 μm), HSPA8 (1 μm), DNAJB1 (1 μm), HSPA-KMT (0.5 μm), SAM (1 mm), and ATP (100 μm) as indicated. After incubation of the plate for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidity chamber, 100 μl of BIOMOL Green reagent (Enzo Life Sciences) was added. After additional incubation of the plate at room temperature for 30 min, the absorbance at 620 nm was measured. The concentration of liberated free phosphate was determined from a standard curve. Recombinant α-Syn was purified as described previously (20.Ghee M. Melki R. Michot N. Mallet J. PA700, the regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome, interferes with α-synuclein assembly.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The α-Syn concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 5960 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Pure α-Syn (0.5 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm KCl was passed through sterile 0.22-μm filters and stored at −80 °C. Assembly of α-Syn fibrils was performed as described previously (21.Pemberton S. Madiona K. Pieri L. Kabani M. Bousset L. Melki R. Hsc70 protein interaction with soluble and fibrillar α-synuclein.J.

Briefly, soluble α-Syn was incubated with continuous shaking in an Eppendorf Thermomixer set at 600 rotations/min at 37 °C. At regular time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn, and the assembly process was monitored using thioflavin T binding by averaging the emission signal at 480 nm for an excitation wavelength of 440 nm over 30 s using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The morphology and structure of α-Syn assemblies were assessed using a Jeol 1400 transmission electron microscope following adsorption of the samples onto carbon-coated 200-mesh grids and negative staining with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The images were recorded with a Gatan ORIUS CCD camera. Human METTL21A belongs, together with METTL21B, METTL21C, and VCP-KMT (METTL21D), to a subgroup of four closely related enzymes within MTase family 16 (pfam PF10294) (12.Kernstock S. Davydova E.

To identify putative METTL21A orthologs in other organisms, BLAST searches were performed to identify proteins with substantial sequence similarity to METTL21A (expect value < 10−15). Next, these candidate proteins were used as queries in reciprocal BLAST searches versus human sequences, and those that yielded METTL21A, rather than its paralogs, as the best human hit were categorized as putative orthologs. According to this analysis, METTL21A orthologs are found in a wide range of eukaryotes, including all vertebrates and several invertebrates, but appear to be absent in bacteria (Table 1). However, METTL21A shows a rather scattered distribution among eukaryotes; for example, METTL21A orthologs are absent in the common model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe but are present in other members of the respective organism groups, i.e. plants, nematodes, and fungi (Table 1).TABLE 1Presence of METTL21A-like sequences in various organismsClosest METTL21A homologReciprocal BLAST versus human (expect value)OrganismExpect valueAccession no.METTL21A (NP_660323.3)METTL21B (NP_056248.2)METTL21C (NP_001010977.1)METTL21D (NP_078834.2)VertebratesH. sapiens (human)NP_660323.31E-161aBoldface indicates best human hit in a reciprocal search.1E-486E-235E-28Mus musculus (mouse)3E-133NP_080240.15E-1453E-472E-243E-25D. rerio (zebrafish)1E-80NP_001013584.12E-924E-495E-263E-24Gallus gallus (chicken)2E-94XP_421949.13E-1064E-432E-285E-26InsectsAcyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphid)bBest hit within a group (insect, nematode, etc.).5E-20XP_001945214.15E-225E-254E-152E-38Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)4E-07NP_573368.29E-95E-110.000020.024NematodesA. suum (pig roundworm)bBest hit within a group (insect, nematode, etc.).5E-31ADY46645.15E-331E-223E-111E-10C. elegans6E-10NP_001122759.17E-129E-217E-135E-29PlantsZ. mays (maize)bBest hit within a group (insect, nematode, etc.).1E-25NP_001142219.12E-272E-203E-189E-25A. thaliana (thale cress)1E-21AAU94386.12E-232E-243E-184E-24FungiSerpula lacrymans (dry rot fungus)bBest hit within a group (insect, nematode, etc.).7E-29EGO015761E-303E-182E-144E-28S. cerevisiae (budding yeast)1E-17NP_014374.11E-195E-132E-112E-16S. pombe (fission yeast)9E-11NP_593178.12E-126E-114E-81E-14OtherscBest hits among invertebrates.Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster)7E-69EKC35706.19E-713E-444E-224E-24N. vectensis (starlet sea anemone)7E-64XP_001623378.18E-662E-341E-224E-30Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin)4E-51XP_781765.34E-587E-311E-221E-17a Boldface indicates best human hit in a reciprocal search.b Best hit within a group (insect, nematode, etc.).c Best hits among invertebrates.

https://openalex.org/W1992390501,"Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic malignancy worldwide; yet the tumor microenvironment, especially the fibroblast cells surrounding the cancer cells, is poorly understood. We established four primary cultures of fibroblasts from human endometrial cancer tissues (cancer-associated fibroblasts, CAFs) using antibody-conjugated magnetic bead isolation. These relatively homogenous fibroblast cultures expressed fibroblast markers (CD90, vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin) and hormonal (estrogen and progesterone) receptors. Conditioned media collected from CAFs induced a dose-dependent proliferation of both primary cultures and cell lines of endometrial cancer in vitro (175%) when compared to non-treated cells, in contrast to those from normal endometrial fibroblast cell line (51%) (P<0.0001). These effects were not observed in fibroblast culture derived from benign endometrial hyperplasia tissues, indicating the specificity of CAFs in affecting endometrial cancer cell proliferation. To determine the mechanism underlying the differential fibroblast effects, we compared the activation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways in endometrial cancer cells following treatment with normal fibroblasts- and CAFs-conditioned media. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of both phosphorylated forms of Akt and Erk were significantly down-regulated in normal fibroblasts-treated cells, but were up-regulated/maintained in CAFs-treated cells. Treatment with specific inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 reversed the CAFs-mediated cell proliferation (P<0.0001), suggesting for a role of these pathways in modulating endometrial cancer cell proliferation. Rapamycin, which targets a downstream molecule in PI3K pathway (mTOR), also suppressed CAFs-induced cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Cytokine profiling analysis revealed that CAFs secrete higher levels of macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, RANTES and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than normal fibroblasts. Our data suggests that in contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs may exhibit a pro-tumorigenic effect in the progression of endometrial cancer, and PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk signaling may represent critical regulators in how endometrial cancer cells respond to their microenvironment."

Investigation of both individual and environmental risk factors may assist in developing suicide prevention policies for prisoners and other high-risk populations. We conducted a matched case-control interview study with 60 male prisoners who had made near-lethal suicide attempts in prison (cases) and 60 male prisoners who had not (controls). We compared levels of depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, impulsivity, aggression, hostility, childhood abuse, life events (including events occurring in prison), social support, and social networks in univariate and multivariate models. A range of psychosocial factors was associated with near-lethal self-harm in prisoners. Compared with controls, cases reported higher levels of depression, hopelessness, impulsivity, and aggression, and lower levels of self-esteem and social support (all p values <0.001). Adverse life events and criminal history factors were also associated with near-lethal self-harm, especially having a prior prison spell and having been bullied in prison, both of which remained significant in multivariate analyses. The findings support a model of suicidal behaviour in prisoners that incorporates imported vulnerability factors, clinical factors, and prison experiences, and underscores their interaction. Strategies to reduce self-harm and suicide in prisoners should include attention to such factors."
https://openalex.org/W2005711459,"Permeable vesicles containing the proto-ring anchoring ZipA protein shrink when FtsZ, the main cell division protein, polymerizes in the presence of GTP. Shrinkage, resembling the constriction of the cytoplasmic membrane, occurs at ZipA densities higher than those found in the cell and is modulated by the dynamics of the FtsZ polymer. In vivo, an excess of ZipA generates multilayered membrane inclusions within the cytoplasm and causes the loss of the membrane function as a permeability barrier. Overproduction of ZipA at levels that block septation is accompanied by the displacement of FtsZ and two additional division proteins, FtsA and FtsN, from potential septation sites to clusters that colocalize with ZipA near the membrane. The results show that elementary constriction events mediated by defined elements involved in cell division can be evidenced both in bacteria and in vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2039892653,"Despite a wealth of EEG epilepsy data that accumulated for over half a century, our ability to understand brain dynamics associated with epilepsy remains limited. Using EEG data from 15 controls and 9 left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) patients, in this study we characterize how the dynamics of the healthy brain differ from the “dynamically balanced” state of the brain of epilepsy patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs in the context of resting state. We show that such differences can be observed in band power, synchronization and network measures, as well as deviations from the small world network (SWN) architecture of the healthy brain. The θ (4–7 Hz) and high α (10–13 Hz) bands showed the biggest deviations from healthy controls across various measures. In particular, patients demonstrated significantly higher power and synchronization than controls in the θ band, but lower synchronization and power in the high α band. Furthermore, differences between controls and patients in graph theory metrics revealed deviations from a SWN architecture. In the θ band epilepsy patients showed deviations toward an orderly network, while in the high α band they deviated toward a random network. These findings show that, despite the focal nature of LTLE, the epileptic brain differs in its global network characteristics from the healthy brain. To our knowledge, this is the only study to encompass power, connectivity and graph theory metrics to investigate the reorganization of resting state functional networks in LTLE patients."

We tested whether measures derived from a single body-fixed sensor worn during traditional Timed Up and Go (TUG) testing could identify subclinical gait impairments in community dwelling older adults without mobility disability.We used data from 432 older adults without dementia (mean age 83.30 ± 7.04 yrs, 76.62% female) participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. The traditional TUG was conducted while subjects wore a body-fixed sensor. We derived measures of overall TUG performance and different subtasks including transitions (sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit), walking, and turning. Multivariate analysis was used to compare persons with and without mobility disability and to compare individuals with and without Instrumental Activities of Daily Living disability (IADL-disability), all of whom did not have mobility disability.As expected, individuals with mobility disability performed worse on all TUG subtasks (p<0.03), compared to those who had no mobility disability. Individuals without mobility disability but with IADL disability had difficulties with turns, had lower yaw amplitude (p<0.004) during turns, were slower (p<0.001), and had less consistent gait (p<0.02).A single body-worn sensor can be employed in the community-setting to complement conventional gait testing. It provides a wide range of quantitative gait measures that appear to help to identify subclinical gait impairments in older adults."

Based on sequence homology PfEMP-1 variants have been grouped into three major groups A-C, the highly conserved VAR2CSA variants, and semi-conserved types defined by tandem runs of specific domains (""domain cassettes"" (DC)). The PfEMP-1 type expressed determines the adherence phenotype, and is associated with clinical outcome of infection.Parasite isolates from Beninese children or women presenting with, respectively, CM or PAM were collected along with samples from patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM). We assessed the transcript level of var genes by RT-qPCR and the expression of PfEMP-1 proteins by LC-MS/MS.Var genes encoding DC8 and Group A PfEMP-1 were transcribed more often and at higher levels in cerebral malaria vs. uncomplicated malaria patients. LC-MS/MS identified peptides from group A, DC8 PfEMP-1 more frequently in cerebral malaria than in uncomplicated malaria and pregnancy-associated malaria samples.This is the first study to show association between PfEMP-1 subtype and disease outcome by direct analysis of parasites proteome. The results corroborate that group A and specifically the PfEMP-1 types DC8 are universally associated with cerebral malaria.

Although almost all citrus plants are susceptible to HLB, reports have shown reduced susceptibility to Las infection in lemon (Citrus limon) plants. The aim of this study is to identify intra-species specific molecular mechanisms associated with Las-induced responses in lemon plants. To achieve this, comparative 2-DE and mass spectrometry, in addition to Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICPS) analyses, were applied to investigate differences in protein accumulation and the concentrations of cationic elements in leaves of healthy and Las-infected lemon plants. Results showed a differential accumulation of 27 proteins, including an increase in accumulation of starch synthase but decrease in the production of photosynthesis-related proteins in Las-infected lemon plants compared to healthy plants. Furthermore, there was a 6% increase (P > 0.05) in K concentration in leaves of lemon plants upon Las infection, which support results from previous studies and might represent a common response pattern of citrus plants to Las infection. Interestingly, contrary to reports from prior studies, this study showed a general reduction in the production of defense-related pathogen-response proteins but a 128% increase in Zn concentration in lemon plants in response to Las infection. Taken together, this study sheds light on general and intra-species specific responses associated with the response of citrus plants to Las."
https://openalex.org/W2081158187,"MicroRNA-224 (miR-224) is frequently over-expressed in liver and colorectal cancers. We and others have previously described the role of miR-224 over-expression in cell proliferation in vitro but we have yet to identify the relevant miR-224 direct target. In this study, we further demonstrated that miR-224 up-regulation promotes cell proliferation using both in vitro assays and in vivo tumor growth models. We systematically screened for high confidence miR-224 targets by overlapping in silico predicted targets from multiple algorithms and significantly down-regulated genes in miR-224-expressing cells from whole genome expression microarrays. A total of 72 high confidence miR-224 targets were identified and found to be enriched in various cancer-related processes. SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) is experimentally validated as the direct cellular target through which miR-224 promotes cell proliferation. The clinical relevance of our experimental observations was supported by a statistically significant inverse correlation between miR-224 and SMAD4 transcript expression in tumor versus paired adjacent non-tumorous tissues from HCC patients (p<0.001, r= -0.45, R(2) =0.122). Furthermore, miR-224 up-regulation and SMAD4 down-regulation is significantly associated with poorer patient survival (p<0.05). In summary, miR-224/SMAD4 pathway is a clinically relevant pathway to provide new insights in understanding HCC. (191 words)."

Here we present the crystal structure of a glycoside hydrolase family 50 exo-β-agarase, Aga50D, from the marine microbe Saccharophagus degradans. This enzyme catalyzes a critical step in the metabolism of agarose by S. degradans through cleaving agarose oligomers into neoagarobiose products that can be further processed into monomers.

https://openalex.org/W2069537206,"Inorganic arsenic is a worldwide metalloid pollutant in environment. Although extensive studies on arsenic-induced toxicity have been conducted using in vivo and in vitro models, the exact molecular mechanism of arsenate toxicity remains elusive. Here, the RNA-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) sequencing technology was used to analyse hepatic response to arsenic exposure at the transcriptome level. Based on more than 12 million SAGE tags mapped to zebrafish genes, 1,444 differentially expressed genes (750 up-regulated and 694 down-regulated) were identified from a relatively abundant transcripts (>10 TPM [transcripts per million]) based on minimal two-fold change. By gene ontology analyses, these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in several major biological processes including oxidation reduction, translation, iron ion transport, cell redox, homeostasis, etc. Accordingly, the main pathways disturbed include metabolic pathways, proteasome, oxidative phosphorylation, cancer, etc. Ingenity Pathway Analysis further revealed a network with four important upstream factors or hub genes, including Jun, Kras, APoE and Nr2f2. The network indicated apparent molecular events involved in oxidative stress, carcinogenesis, and metabolism. In order to identify potential biomarker genes for arsenic exposure, 27 out of 29 up-regulated transcripts were validated by RT-qPCR analysis in pooled RNA samples. Among these, 14 transcripts were further confirmed for up-regulation by a lower dosage of arsenic in majority of individual zebrafish. Finally, at least four of these genes, frh3 (ferrintin H3), mgst1 (microsomal glutathione S-transferase-like), cmbl (carboxymethylenebutenolidase homolog) and slc40a1 (solute carrier family 40 [iron-regulated transporter], member 1) could be confirmed in individual medaka fish similarly treated by arsenic; thus, these four genes might be robust arsenic biomarkers across species. Thus, our work represents the first comprehensive investigation of molecular mechanism of asenic toxicity and genome-wide search for potential biomarkers for arsenic exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2001545141,"Birth weight and prematurity are important obstetric outcomes linked to lifelong health. We studied a large birth cohort to look for evidence of epigenetic involvement in birth outcomes.We investigated the association between birth weight, length, placental weight and duration of gestation and four candidate variants in 1,236 mothers and 1,073 newborns; DNMT1 (rs2162560), DNMT3A (rs734693), DNMT3B (rs2424913) and DNMT3L (rs7354779). We measured methylation of LINE1 and the imprinted genes, PEG3, SNRPN, and IGF2, in cord blood.The minor DNMT3L allele in the baby was associated with higher birth weight (+54 95% CI 10,99 g; p = 0.016), birth length (+0.23 95% CI 0.04,0.42 cm; p = 0.017), placental weight, (+18 95% CI 3,33 g; p = 0.017), and reduced risk of being in the lowest birth weight decile (p = 0.018) or requiring neonatal care (p = 0.039). The DNMT3B minor allele in the mother was associated with an increased risk of prematurity (p = 0.001). Placental size was related to PEG3 (p<0.001) and IGF2 (p<0.001) methylation. Birth weight was related to LINE1 and IGF2 methylation but only at p = 0.052. The risk of requiring neonatal treatment was related to LINE1 (p = 0.010) and SNRPN (p = 0.001) methylation. PEG3 methylation was influenced by baby DNMT3A genotype (p = 0.012) and LINE1 by baby 3B genotype (p = 0.044). Maternal DNMT3L genotype was related to IGF2 methylation in the cord blood but this effect was only seen in carriers of the minor frequency allele (p = 0.050).The results here suggest that epigenetic processes are linked birth outcome and health in early life. Our emerging understanding of the role of epigenetics in health and biological function across the lifecourse suggests that these early epigenetic events could have longer term implications."
https://openalex.org/W1991812174,"Aggregation is a defensive strategy employed by many prey species in response to predatory threat. Our group has characterized defensive aggregation (huddling) in Rattus norvegicus in response to a ball of cat fur. In this situation some rats huddle less, and approach the threatening cue more than others (active vs. passive responders). The present study explored whether active responding is a stable phenotype associated with behaviors outside direct predatory encounters. The neural substrates of active and passive responding under predatory threat were explored using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Finally, we examined whether the presence of conspecifics during predatory threat biases behavior towards active responding. Active and passive responding styles were found to be stable in individual rats across consecutive group exposures to cat fur, and were predicted by anxiety-like behavior in an open-field emergence test. Active responders displayed less conditioned fear in an environment associated with predatory threat, and had higher post-exposure intake of a weak sucrose solution (a test of ""anhedonia""). Active responding was associated with: greater cat fur-induced activation of the accessory olfactory bulb, reflecting greater olfactory stimulation in rats actively approaching the fur; lowered activation of somatosensory cortex, reflecting reduced huddling with conspecifics; and reduced activation in the lateral septum. Social exposure to cat fur promoted active responding relative to individual exposure, and lowered c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey, medial caudate putamen and lateral habenula. We conclude that individual differences in anti-predator behavior appear stable traits with active responders having a more resilient phenotype. Social exposure to predatory threat has an acute buffering effect, subtly changing the neural and behavioral response towards threat and encouraging active responding. An association between active responding and lower c-Fos expression in the lateral septum is consistent with previous studies that highlight this region as an important neurobiological substrate of defensive aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2012755125,"Nasal potential difference (NPD) is used as a biomarker of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. We evaluated methods to detect changes in chloride and sodium transport by NPD based on a secondary analysis of a Phase II CFTR-modulator study. Thirty-nine subjects with CF who also had the G551D-CFTR mutation were randomized to receive ivacaftor (Kalydeco™; also known as VX-770) in four doses or placebo twice daily for at least 14 days. All data were analyzed by a single investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. We compared three analysis methods to determine the best approach to quantify changes in chloride and sodium transport: (1) the average of both nostrils; (2) the most-polarized nostril at each visit; and (3) the most-polarized nostril at screening carried forward. Parameters of ion transport included the PD change with zero chloride plus isoproterenol (CFTR activity), the basal PD, Ringer's PD, and change in PD with amiloride (measurements of ENaC activity), and the delta NPD (measuring CFTR and ENaC activity). The average and most-polarized nostril at each visit were most sensitive to changes in chloride and sodium transport, whereas the most-polarized nostril at screening carried forward was less discriminatory. Based on our findings, NPD studies should assess both nostrils rather than a single nostril. We also found that changes in CFTR activity were more readily detected than changes in ENaC activity, and that rigorous standardization was associated with relatively good within-subject reproducibility in placebo-treated subjects (±2.8 mV). Therefore, we have confirmed an assay of reasonable reproducibility for detecting chloride-transport improvements in response to CFTR modulation."

In this study, we systematically identified endogenous miRNA target genes by using AGO2 immunoprecipitation (AGO2-IP) and microarray analyses in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, representing luminal and basal-like breast cancer, respectively. The expression levels of ∼70% of the AGO2-IP mRNAs were increased by DROSHA or DICER1 knockdown. In addition, integrated analysis of miRNA expression profiles, mRNA-AGO2 interaction, and the 3'-UTR of mRNAs revealed that >60% of the AGO2-IP mRNAs were putative targets of the 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs. Together, these results suggested that the majority of the AGO2-associated mRNAs were bona fide miRNA targets. Functional enrichment analysis uncovered that the AGO2-IP mRNAs were involved in regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion/migration/invasion, stress responses (e.g. DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress and hypoxia), and cell-cell communication (e.g. Notch and Ephrin signaling pathways). A role of miRNAs in regulating cell migration/invasion and stress response was further defined by examining the impact of DROSHA knockdown on cell behaviors. We demonstrated that DROSHA knockdown enhanced cell migration and invasion, whereas it sensitized cells to cell death induced by suspension culture, glucose depletion, and unfolding protein stress. Data from an orthotopic xenograft model showed that DROSHA knockdown resulted in reduced growth of primary tumors but enhanced lung metastasis. Taken together, these results suggest that miRNAs collectively function to promote survival of tumor cells under stress but suppress cell migration/invasion in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2146663091,"RNA interference (RNAi) has significant therapeutic promise for the genetic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Targeted vectors are able to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) into HCC cells with high transfection efficiency and stability. The tripeptide arginine glycine aspartic acid (RGD)-modified non-viral vector, polyethylene glycol-grafted polyethylenimine functionalized with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (RGD-PEG-g-PEI-SPION), was constructed as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible nanocarrier for the delivery of Survivin siRNA targeting the human HCC cell line Bel-7402. The biophysical characterization of the RGD-PEG-g-PEI-SPION was performed. The RGD-modified complexes exhibited a higher transfection efficiency in transferring Survivin siRNA into Bel-7402 cells compared with a non-targeted delivery system, which resulted in more significant gene suppression at both the Survivin mRNA and protein expression levels. Then, the level of caspase-3 activation was significantly elevated, and a remarkable level of tumor cell apoptosis was induced. As a result, the tumor growth in the nude mice Bel-7402 hepatoma model was significantly inhibited. The targeting ability of the RGD-PEG-g-PEI-SPION was successfully imaged by MRI scans performed in vitro and in vivo. Our results strongly indicated that the RGD-PEG-g-PEI-SPION can potentially be used as a targeted non-viral vector for altering gene expression in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and for detecting the tumor in vivo as an effective MRI probe."

Haematological indices were measured using an AC.Tron Coulter Counter. Quantification of inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and adhesion molecules was performed by ELISA. Measurement of whole blood viscosity was done using a Wells Brookfield cone-plate viscometer. Quantification of microvascular tissue oxygenation was done by Visible Lightguide spectrophotometry.TNF-α and whole blood viscosity at 46 sec(-1) and 230 sec(-1) (1.75, 2.02 vs. 0.83, 1.26, p<0.05) were significantly greater in sickle cell disease subjects than in controls. There were no differences in plasma concentration of sICAM-1, IL-1β and IL-10 between SCD subjects and controls. IL-1β (median, IQR: 0.96, 1.7 vs. 0, 0.87; p<0.01) and sICAM-1 (226.5, 156.48 vs. 107.63, 121.5, p<0.005) were significantly greater in SSu group compared with SSn. However there were no differences in TNF-α (2, 3.98 vs. 0, 2.66) and IL-10 (13.34, 5.95 vs. 11.92, 2.99) concentrations between SSu and SSn. WBV in the SSu group at 46 sec(-1) and at 230 Sec 1 were 1.9 (95%CI; 1.2, 3.1) and 2.3 (1.2, 4.4) times greater than in the SSn group. There were no differences in the degree of tissue hypoxia as determined by lightguide spectrophotometry.Inflammatory, adhesion markers and WBV may be associated with leg ulceration in sickle cell disease by way of inflammation-mediated vasoocclusion/vasoconstriction. Impaired skin oxygenation does not appear to be associated with chronic ulcers in these subjects with sickle cell disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020307436,"Schizophrenia patients demonstrate perceptual deficits consistent with broad dysfunction in visual context processing. These include poor integration of segments forming visual contours, and reduced visual contrast effects (e.g. weaker orientation-dependent surround suppression, ODSS). Background image context can influence contour perception, as stimuli near the contour affect detection accuracy. Because of ODSS, this contextual modulation depends on the relative orientation between the contour and flanking elements, with parallel flankers impairing contour perception. However in schizophrenia, the impact of abnormal ODSS during contour perception is not clear. It is also unknown whether deficient contour perception marks genetic liability for schizophrenia, or is strictly associated with clinical expression of this disorder. We examined contour detection in 25 adults with schizophrenia, 13 unaffected first-degree biological relatives of schizophrenia patients, and 28 healthy controls. Subjects performed a psychophysics experiment designed to quantify the effect of flanker orientation during contour detection. Overall, patients with schizophrenia showed poorer contour detection performance than relatives or controls. Parallel flankers suppressed and orthogonal flankers enhanced contour detection performance for all groups, but parallel suppression was relatively weaker for schizophrenia patients than healthy controls. Relatives of patients showed equivalent performance with controls. Computational modeling suggested that abnormal contextual modulation in schizophrenia may be explained by suppression that is more broadly tuned for orientation. Abnormal flanker suppression in schizophrenia is consistent with weaker ODSS and/or broader orientation tuning. This work provides the first evidence that such perceptual abnormalities may not be associated with a genetic liability for schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2128904073,"The highly sulfated polysaccharides heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) play key roles in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Despite its importance, no molecular structures of free HS have been reported up to now. By combining analytical ultracentrifugation, small angle x-ray scattering, and constrained scattering modeling recently used for heparin, we have analyzed the solution structures for eight purified HS fragments dp6-dp24 corresponding to the predominantly unsulfated GlcA-GlcNAc domains of heparan sulfate. Unlike heparin, the sedimentation coefficient s20,w of HS dp6-dp24 showed a small rotor speed dependence, where similar s20,w values of 0.82-1.26 S (absorbance optics) and 1.05-1.34 S (interference optics) were determined. The corresponding x-ray scattering measurements of HS dp6-dp24 gave radii of gyration RG values from 1.03 to 2.82 nm, cross-sectional radii of gyration RXS values from 0.31 to 0.65 nm, and maximum lengths L from 3.0 to 10.0 nm. These data showed that HS has a longer and more bent structure than heparin. Constrained scattering modeling starting from 5,000 to 12,000 conformationally randomized HS structures gave best fit dp6-dp24 molecular structures that were longer and more bent than their equivalents in heparin. Alternative fits were obtained for HS dp18 and dp24, indicating their higher bending and flexibility. We conclude that HS displays bent conformations that are significantly distinct from that for heparin. The difference is attributed to the different predominant monosaccharide sequence and reduced sulfation of HS, indicating that HS may interact differently with proteins compared with heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1977860912,"In recent years, numerous environmental psychology studies have demonstrated that contact with nature as opposed to urban settings can improve an individual’s mood, can lead to increased levels of vitality, and can offer an opportunity to recover from stress. According to Attention Restoration Theory (ART) the restorative potential of natural environments is situated in the fact that nature can replenish depleted attentional resources. This replenishment takes place, in part, because nature is deemed to be a source of fascination, with fascination being described as having an “attentional”, an “affective” and an “effort” dimension. However, the claim that fascination with nature involves these three dimensions is to a large extent based on intuition or derived from introspection-based measurement methods, such as self-reports. In three studies, we aimed to more objectively assess whether these three dimensions indeed applied to experiences related to natural environments, before any (attentional) depletion has taken place. The instruments that were used were: (a) the affect misattribution procedure (Study 1), (b) the dot probe paradigm (Study 2) and (c) a cognitively effortful task (Study 3). These instrument were respectively aimed at verifying the affective, attentional and effort dimension of fascination. Overall, the results provide objective evidence for the claims made within the ART framework, that natural as opposed to urban settings are affectively positive (cfr., affective dimension) and that people have an attentional bias to natural (rather than urban) environments (cfr., attentional dimension). The results regarding the effort dimension are less straightforward, and suggest that this dimension only becomes important in sufficiently difficult cognitive tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2079957040,"Background and Objectives The cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is a highly conserved exotoxin that are produced by a number of Gram negative bacteria, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and affects mammalian cells by inhibiting cell division and causing apoptosis. A complete cdt-operon is present in the majority of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but the proportion of isolates that lack cdt-encoding genes (A, B and C) varies according to the population studied. The objectives of this study were to examine serotype, Cdt-genotype, and Cdt-activity in isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans collected from an adolescent West African population and to examine the association between the carrier status of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the progression of attachment loss (AL). Materials and Methods A total of 249 A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates from 200 Ghanaian adolescents were examined for serotype and cdt-genotype by PCR. The activity of the Cdt-toxin was examined by DNA-staining of exposed cultured cells and documented with flow cytometry. The periodontal status of the participants was examined at baseline and at a two-year follow-up. Results Presence of all three cdt-encoding genes was detected in 79% of the examined A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates. All these isolates showed a substantial Cdt-activity. The two different cdt-genotypes (with and without presence of all three cdt-encoding genes) showed a serotype-dependent distribution pattern. Presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with progression of AL (OR = 5.126; 95% CI = [2.994–8.779], p<0.001). Conclusion A. actinomycetemcomitans isolated from the Ghanaian adolescents showed a distribution of serotype and cdt-genotype in line with results based on other previously studied populations. Presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with disease progression, in particular the b serotype, whereas the association with disease progression was not particularly related to cdt-genotype, and Cdt-activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007546289,"The ability to initiate and sustain trust is critical to health and well-being. Willingness to trust is in part determined by the reputation of the putative trustee, gained via direct interactions or indirectly through word of mouth. Few studies have examined how the reputation of others is instantiated in the brain during trust decisions. Here we use an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) design to examine what neural signals correspond to experimentally manipulated reputations acquired in direct interactions during trust decisions. We hypothesized that the caudate (dorsal striatum) and putamen (ventral striatum) and amygdala would signal differential reputations during decision-making. Twenty-nine healthy adults underwent fMRI scanning while completing an iterated Trust Game as trusters with three fictive trustee partners who had different tendencies to reciprocate (i.e., likelihood of rewarding the truster), which were learned over multiple exchanges with real-time feedback. We show that the caudate (both left and right) signals reputation during trust decisions, such that caudate is more active to partners with two types of ""bad"" reputations, either indifferent partners (who reciprocate 50% of the time) or unfair partners (who reciprocate 25% of the time), than to those with ""good"" reputations (who reciprocate 75% of the time). Further, individual differences in caudate activity related to biases in trusting behavior in the most uncertain situation, i.e. when facing an indifferent partner. We also report on other areas that were activated by reputation at p < 0.05 whole brain corrected. Our findings suggest that the caudate is involved in signaling and integrating reputations gained through experience into trust decisions, demonstrating a neural basis for this key social process."

However, how eIF3a participates in translational regulation and in formation of the eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex remain to be solved. In this study, we used the tandem affinity purification approach in combination with tandem MS/MS and identified the spectrin domain of eIF3a as the docking site for the formation of eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex.

Translational control is an important regulatory mechanism of gene expression, which mainly occurs at the translational initiation step that involves more than 10 initiation factor complexes in eukaryotes (1.Pestova T.V.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2007: 87-128Google Scholar). Among these eIFs, eIF3 is the largest and most complex one consisting of 13 putative subunits named eIF3a to eIF3m (2.Dong Z. Zhang J.T. Initiation factor eIF3 and regulation of mRNA translation, cell growth, and cancer.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2006; 59: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Many eIF3 subunits have been implicated to play important roles in regulating protein synthesis and in tumorigenesis (3.Yin J.Y. Dong Z. Liu Z.Q. Zhang J.T. Translational control gone awry: a new mechanism of tumorigenesis and novel targets of cancer treatments.Biosci. Rep. 2011; 31: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although some eIF3 subunits may serve as putative tumor suppressors, others may function as proto-oncogenes (2.Dong Z. Zhang J.T.

Previously, a functional mammalian eIF3 core complex consisting of six subunits (eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3h) have been identified using reconstitution of purified proteins (4.Masutani M.

Using similar reconstitution of recombinant proteins, it was found that the core complex consists of eight subunits ( eIF3a*, 3c*, 3e, 3f, 3h, 3k, 3l, and 3m) with eIF3a-eIF3c dimer as a centerpiece of the octamer (5.Sun C.

In another study of the eIF3 using dissociation and mass spectrometry analysis, it was found that the eIF3 full complex may consist of three stable subcomplexes: eIF3(a:b:i:g), eIF3(c:d:e:l:k), and eIF3(f:h:m) (6.Zhou M.

Furthermore, although the interaction between each subunit in the reconstituted core complexes was thought to be via their PCI (proteasome, COP9, and initiation factor) or MPN (Mpr1-Pad1 N-terminal) signature domain, there are no studies discussing whether this is true and how the subunits interact with each other in the eIF3 core or subcomplexes. Of the 13 putative eIF3 subunits, eIF3a is the largest one with a molecular mass of 170 kDa and is one of the subunits in the hexamer or octamer core complex and in one of the stable subcomplexes as discussed above. Study of eIF3a has been particularly difficult due to its large size, flexibility, expression and purification of full-length recombinant protein, and difficulty in mass assignment (5.Sun C.

We found that the SPT domain and not the PCI or RP domain is the docking site for binding of other eIF3 subunits to form the eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex. eIF3b and eIF3i concurrently bind to the SPT domain of eIF3a. We also showed that Phe760 and amino acid residues 765–775 in the SPT domain are important for eIF3a interaction with eIF3b and eIF3i, respectively. Participation of eIF3g in the eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex is via its interaction with the c-terminal domain of eIF3b, whereas the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of eIF3b is responsible for eIF3b binding to the SPT domain of eIF3a. Binding of eIF3j to eIF3b is also at the RRM of eIF3b but mutually exclusive for eIF3a binding to the same site. spectrin repeat RNA recognition motif tandem affinity purification.

Briefly, DNA templates were linearized with suitable restriction enzymes, and the transcripts with 5′-cap were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mm m7GpppG, purified using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, and used to program cell-free translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine.

Briefly, protein bands of interest were excised from silver-stained gels, minced, and digested with 20 μg/ml trypsin (in 36 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 8% acetonitrile) at 37 °C for 18 h. The nano-LC separations were performed using a CapLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) or an LC Packings system (Dionex, Sunnydale, CA). Separation was accomplished using a 15-min gradient from 0 to 35% solvent B at a 250 nl/min flow rate. Solvent B consisted of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, whereas solvent A consisted of 3% acetonitrile and 97% water with 0.1% formic acid. At the end of the column, ions were electrosprayed directly into either a ThermoFinnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer or a Micromass QTOF Global mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.), which recorded mass spectra and data-dependent tandem mass spectra of the separated peptide ions. The acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against human protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot database using Mascot (version 1.9) (15.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar) for peptide scoring and consequently protein identification. MS/MS spectra were extracted as Mascot Generic Format files using the TurboRaw2mgf converter written in-house (version 1.0.9) and requiring minimum spectral intensity of 1 × 106 and a minimum of 15 ions in the spectrum. Database searches of the spectra as double- or triple-charged precursors were restricted to trypsin specificity, allowing for one missed cleavage per peptide. Monoisotopic precursor mass tolerance was set to ±2.0 Da, whereas monoisotopic fragment ion tolerance was ± 0.8 Da. Variable modifications of carbamidomethylation or propionamidination of cysteine and oxidation of methionine, histidine, or tryptophan were included in the search. Spectral matches with scores equal to or greater than 39, the score threshold determined by Mascot to represent p < 0.05, was reported as identified peptides. These peptide scores were then summed for each assigned protein and reported in Table 2 along with the sequence coverage for each protein in replicate experiments.TABLE 2Peptides of proteins co-purified with SPT domain of eIF3a as identified using LC-MS/MSProteinsIdentificationSequence of peptides from LC-MS/MSZ score110 kDaeIF3b217ITNDFYPEEDGKTK23030231GYIFLEYASPAHAVDAVK24843493VTLM*QLPTR50143536GTQGVVTNFEIFR5485943 kDaeIF3g242VTNLSEDTR2514436 kDaeIF3i1M*KPILLQGHER1132177SGEVLVNVK18558199DM*TM*FVTASK20831299SYSSGGEDGYVR31064 Open table in a new tab eIF3a has three putative domains, PCI, SPT, and RP, which are potentially involved in protein-protein interactions (7.Pincheira R. Chen Q. Zhang J.T. Identification of a 170-kDa protein over-expressed in lung cancers.Br J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1520-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To identify potential binding partners of these eIF3a domains, we used the TAP technology by engineering these domains individually into the TAP vector (Fig. 1A). HeLa cells were then transiently transfected with these constructs and subjected to TAP purification. The purified proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were revealed by silver staining. As shown in Fig. 1B, three specific proteins of 110, 43, and 36 kDa were found in the TAP-SPT-purified but not in the TAP vector control-purified fractions. Interestingly, no proteins were found with either the TAP-PCI or the TAP-RP-purified fractions. The three proteins co-purified with the SPT domain were then excised from the silver-stained gel and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. Table 2 shows that the 110-, 43-, and 36-kDa proteins are identified as eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i, respectively, based on peptide sequences from tandem mass spectra and their molecular masses. This observation is consistent with the previous finding of the stable eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex (6.Zhou M. Sandercock A.M. Fraser C.S. Ridlova G. Stephens E. Schenauer M.R. Yokoi-Fong T. Barsky D. Leary J.A. Hershey J.W. Doudna J.A. Robinson C.V. Mass spectrometry reveals modularity and a complete subunit interaction map of the eukaryotic translation factor eIF3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18139-18144Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and suggests that the SPT domain of eIF3a is likely involved in formation of the eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex. To validate the above findings, the purified TAP-SPT complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and followed by Western blot analysis probed with specific antibodies against eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i as well as other eIF3 subunits eIF3c, eIF3d, and eIF3j as controls. As shown in Fig. 1C, eIF3b, eIF3g and eIF3i were all detected in the TAP-SPT-purified fraction but not in the TAP vector control fraction. The other eIF3 subunits, eIF3c, eIF3d, and eIF3j, were not found in the TAP-SPT-purified fraction, suggesting that the SPT domain of eIF3a likely does not interact with eIF3c, eIF3d, and eIF3j directly or indirectly. Next, we performed a pulldown assay to confirm the binding of the SPT domain of eIF3a to eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i newly synthesized in cell-free expression system using purified GST-SPT fusion protein as bait. As shown in Fig. 2, GST-SPT successfully pulled down 35S-labeled eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i. The control irrelevant luciferase protein was not pulled down. The GST alone control bait also did not pull down any of these protein targets. Furthermore, GST-PCI and GST-RP fusion protein bait did not pull down any of the three newly synthesized eIF3 subunits (Fig. 2B), confirming our observation that these two domains of eIF3a did not interact with eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i as shown in Fig. 1. To further investigate the protein-binding function of the SPT domain of eIF3a, we engineered a FLAG-tagged eIF3a with deletion of the SPT domain (ΔSPT) for expression in mammalian cells (Fig. 3A). Another construct with deletion of the 10-amino acid repeat domain (ΔRP) was also engineered as a control. These constructs along with the WT control were transiently transfected into HeLa cells for expression and co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous eIF3 proteins. Fig. 3B shows that all of the FLAG-tagged wild type and deletion mutant eIF3a molecules are equally expressed, along with endogenous eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i. Fig. 3C shows that only the FLAG-tagged wild type and the ΔRP deletion mutant eIF3a can co-immunoprecipitate eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i. The ΔSPT deletion mutant, however, cannot co-immunoprecipitate these endogenous eIF3 subunits. Taken together with the above findings, we conclude that the SPT domain of eIF3a has protein-binding activities and is likely responsible for eIF3a interaction with eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i to form the eIF3(a:b:i:g) subcomplex. In the above TAP purification, pulldown, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, the systems contained many other proteins. Thus, it is not clear whether the binding of the SPT domain of eIF3a to eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i is direct or indirect via other unknown proteins present in the systems. To address this issue, His-tagged recombinant eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. These purified proteins were then subjected to pulldown assay using purified GST or GST-SPT fusion proteins as bait. As shown in Fig. 4A, purified eIF3b and eIF3i were successfully pulled down by GST-SPT but not by GST control bait. Pulldown of eIF3g by GST-SPT, however, was not successful. Interestingly, eIF3g was pulled down by GST-SPT in the presence of eIF3b (Fig. 4B). Thus, it is likely that the binding of the SPT domain of eIF3a to eIF3b and eIF3i is a direct interaction, whereas the binding eIF3a to eIF3g is indirect and possibly mediated by eIF3b. To verify that eIF3b directly interacts with eIF3g, we generated GST-eIF3b fusion protein and used it as bait for pulldown assay of purified recombinant eIF3g. As shown in Fig. 4C, eIF3g but not eIF3i was successfully pulled down by GST-eIF3b, demonstrating that eIF3b likely can bind directly to eIF3g and that eIF3b does not interact with eIF3i. This observation confirms that eIF3b likely mediates the interaction between eIF3a and eIF3g. We also tested whether eIF3i possibly interacts with eIF3g using GST-eIF3i as bait and purified His-eIF3g as a target. As shown in Fig. 4D, no His-eIF3g was pulled down by GST-eIF3i, similar as the negative control GST bait, whereas GST-eIF3b bait successfully pulled down His-eIF3g. Thus, eIF3i likely does not interact directly with eIF3g and does not mediate eIF3g binding to eIF3a. To determine the binding sites of eIF3b and eIF3i in the SPT domain of eIF3a in more detail, we created a series of deletion mutants of the SPT domain (Fig. 5A) and purified GST fusion proteins of these deletion mutants (Fig. 5B). These purified GST fusion proteins were then used as bait for pulldown assay of eIF3b and eIF3i synthesized and 35S-labeled in the cell-free system. As shown in Fig. 5C, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 6 amino acids (ΔC6) did not reduce the binding activity of the SPT domain to either eIF3b or eIF3i. However, further deletion of 10 amino acids (ΔC16) drastically reduced its binding activity to eIF3i but not to eIF3b. The binding activity of the SPT domain of eIF3a to eIF3b diminished after deletion of additional 10 amino acids (ΔC26). These findings suggest that the binding sites of eIF3b and eIF3i in the SPT domain are adjacent to each other (amino acid residues 756–765 for eIF3b and 766–775 for eIF3i). To further detail the binding site of eIF3b in the SPT domain of eIF3a, we performed alanine-scanning (As) mutagenesis of the region consisting of amino acid residues 756 to 765 in the SPT domain of eIF3a by mutating four residues to alanine in each mutant (Fig. 6A). The As mutant SPT domains were then expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins for use as bait for pulldown assay of in vitro-translated eIF3b (Fig. 6B). The wild type GST-SPT and the ΔC26 mutant (Fig. 5) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. It appears that AsM2 and AsM3 mutants lost their binding activities to eIF3b (Fig. 6B). These observations suggest that the amino acid residues 760–761 (Phe760-Val761) (Fig. 6A) in the SPT domain are most likely responsible for eIF3b binding. We next dissected the two residues Phe760-Val761 of the SPT domain of eIF3a in eIF3b binding by mutating them together or individually (AsM5-AsM7, Fig. 6A) followed by pulldown assay of in vitro-translated eIF3b. As shown in Fig. 6C, the AsM5 mutant with a double mutation and the AsM6 mutant with a single Phe760 mutation both lost their activity in binding eIF3b. However, the AsM7 mutant with single Val761 mutation could efficiently bind to eIF3b equally well as the wild type GST-SPT bait. To confirm this finding, we performed a pulldown assay of purified recombinant His-tagged eIF3b using these mutant baits. Fig. 6D shows that again only the AsM7 mutant (Val761) has activities in binding to purified eIF3b similar as the wild type GST-SPT bait. Thus, we conclude that the single amino acid residue Phe760 in the SPT domain of eIF3a is essential for the interaction between eIF3a and eIF3b. The fact that the binding sites for eIF3b and eIF3i in the SPT domain of eIF3a are very close"

The factors that influence the level of activation, however, are not fully defined. Since endogenous glucocorticoids are important in regulating inflammation, we sought to determine whether less optimal diurnal cortisol patterns are associated with greater T cell activation. Methods We studied 128 HIV-infected adults who were not on treatment and had a CD4+ T cell count above 250 cells/µl. We assessed T cell activation by CD38 expression using flow cytometry, and diurnal cortisol was assessed with salivary measurements. Results Lower waking cortisol levels correlated with greater T cell immune activation, measured by CD38 mean fluorescent intensity, on CD4+ T cells (r = −0.26, p = 0.006). Participants with lower waking cortisol also showed a trend toward greater activation on CD8+ T cells (r = −0.17, p = 0.08). A greater diurnal decline in cortisol, usually considered a healthy pattern, correlated with less CD4+ (r = 0.24, p = 0.018) and CD8+ (r = 0.24, p = 0.017) activation. Conclusions These data suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis contributes to the regulation of T cell activation in HIV. This may represent an important pathway through which psychological states and the HPA axis influence progression of HIV."

We assessed the programme's effectiveness to guide policy on HBV prevention.We analysed reports of acute HBV infection in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2010 requesting serum from patients for HBV-genome S- and C-region sequencing. We used coalescence analyses to assess genetic diversity of nonimported genotype-A cases over time.1687 patients with acute HBV infection were reported between 2004 and 2010. The incidence of reported acute HBV infection decreased from 1.8 to 1.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, mostly due to a reduction in the number of cases in men who have sex with men. Men were overrepresented among cases with an unknown route of transmission, especially among genotype A2 cases mainly associated with transmission through male homosexual contact. The genetic diversity of nonimported genotype-A strains obtained from men who have sex with men decreased from 2006 onwards, suggesting HBV incidence in this group decreased.The selective HBV-vaccination programme for behavioural high-risk groups very likely reduced the incidence of HBV infection in the Netherlands mainly by preventing HBV infections in men who have sex with men. A considerable proportion of cases in men who did not report risk behaviour was probably acquired through homosexual contact. Our findings support continuation of the programme, and adopting similar approaches in other countries where HBV transmission is focused in high-risk adults."
https://openalex.org/W2070006896,"Coordinated assembly and disassembly of actin into filaments and higher order structures such as stress fibers and lamellipodia are fundamental for cell migration and adhesion. However, the precise spatiotemporal regulation of F-actin structures is not completely understood. SWAP-70, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-interacting, F-actin-binding protein, participates in actin rearrangements through yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that SWAP-70 is an F-actin-bundling protein that oligomerizes through a Gln/Glu-rich stretch within a coiled-coil region. SWAP-70 bundles filaments in parallel and anti-parallel fashion through its C-terminal F-actin binding domain and delays dilution-induced F-actin depolymerization. We further demonstrate that SWAP-70 co-localizes and directly interacts with cofilin, an F-actin severing and depolymerization factor, and contributes to the regulation of cofilin activity in vivo. In line with these activities, upon stem cell factor stimulation, murine bone marrow-derived mast cells lacking SWAP-70 display aberrant regulation of F-actin and actin free barbed ends dynamics. Moreover, proper stem cell factor-dependent cofilin activation via dephosphorylation and subcellular redistribution into a detergent-resistant cytoskeletal compartment also require SWAP-70. Together, these findings reveal an important role of SWAP-70 in the dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of F-actin networks."

https://openalex.org/W2106746502,"Obesity is a primary risk factor for multiple metabolic disorders. Many drugs for the treatment of obesity, which mainly act through CNS as appetite suppressants, have failed during development or been removed from the market due to unacceptable adverse effects. Thus, there are very few efficacious drugs available and remains a great unmet medical need for anti-obesity drugs that increase energy expenditure by acting on peripheral tissues without severe side effects. Here, we report a novel approach involving antisense inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) in peripheral tissues. Treatment of diet-induce obese (DIO) mice with FGFR4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) specifically reduced liver FGFR4 expression that not only resulted in decrease in body weight (BW) and adiposity in free-feeding conditions, but also lowered BW and adiposity under caloric restriction. In addition, combination treatment with FGFR4 ASO and rimonabant showed additive reduction in BW and adiposity. FGFR4 ASO treatment increased basal metabolic rate during free-feeding conditions and, more importantly, prevented adaptive decreases of metabolic rate induced by caloric restriction. The treatment increased fatty acid oxidation while decreased lipogenesis in both liver and fat. Mechanistic studies indicated that anti-obesity effect of FGFR4 ASO was mediated at least in part through an induction of plasma FGF15 level resulted from reduction of hepatic FGFR4 expression. The anti-obesity effect was accompanied by improvement in plasma glycemia, whole body insulin sensitivity, plasma lipid levels and liver steatosis. Therefore, FGFR4 could be a potential novel target and antisense reduction of hepatic FGFR4 expression could be an efficacious therapy as an adjunct to diet restriction or to an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2048629945,"Understanding the ecological processes that generate complex community structures may provide insight into the establishment and maintenance of a normal microbial community in the human gastrointestinal tract, yet very little is known about how biotic interactions influence community dynamics in this system. Here, we use natural strains of Escherichia coli and a simplified model microbiota to demonstrate that the colonization process on the strain level can be context dependent, in the sense that the outcome of intra-specific competition may be determined by the composition of the background community. These results are consistent with previous models for competition between organisms where one competitor has adapted to low resource environments whereas the other is optimized for rapid reproduction when resources are abundant. The genomic profiles of E. coli strains representing these differing ecological strategies provide clues for deciphering the genetic underpinnings of niche adaptation within a single species. Our findings extend the role of ecological theory in understanding microbial systems and the conceptual toolbox for describing microbial community dynamics. There are few, if any, concrete examples of context-dependent competition on a single trophic level. However, this phenomenon can have potentially dramatic effects on which bacteria will successfully establish and persist in the gastrointestinal system, and the principle should be equally applicable to other microbial ecosystems."

Gene-by-diet interactions are difficult to study in humans because the human diet is hard to control. Here, we used mice to study dietary obesity genes, by four methods. First, we bred 213 F2 mice from strains that are susceptible [C57BL/6ByJ (B6)] or resistant [129P3/J (129)] to dietary obesity. Percent body fat was assessed after mice ate low-energy diet and again after the same mice ate high-energy diet for 8 weeks. Linkage analyses identified QTLs associated with dietary obesity. Three methods were used to filter candidate genes within the QTL regions: (a) association mapping was conducted using >40 strains; (b) differential gene expression and (c) comparison of genomic DNA sequence, using two strains closely related to the progenitor strains from Experiment 1. The QTL effects depended on whether the mice were male or female or which diet they were recently fed. After feeding a low-energy diet, percent body fat was linked to chr 7 (LOD = 3.42). After feeding a high-energy diet, percent body fat was linked to chr 9 (Obq5; LOD = 3.88), chr 12 (Obq34; LOD = 3.88), and chr 17 (LOD = 4.56). The Chr 7 and 12 QTLs were sex dependent and all QTL were diet-dependent. The combination of filtering methods highlighted seven candidate genes within the QTL locus boundaries: Crx, Dmpk, Ahr, Mrpl28, Glo1, Tubb5, and Mut. However, these filtering methods have limitations so gene identification will require alternative strategies, such as the construction of congenics with very small donor regions."
https://openalex.org/W1968382121,"β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) regulated many key physiological processes by activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (Gs protein). This process could be modulated by different types of ligands. But the details about this modulation process were still not depicted. Here, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the structures of β2AR-Gs protein in complex with different types of ligands. The simulation results demonstrated that the agonist BI-167107 could form hydrogen bonds with Ser2035.42, Ser2075.46 and Asn2936.55 more than the inverse agonist ICI 118,551. The different binding modes of ligands further affected the conformation of β2AR. The energy landscape profiled the energy contour map of the stable and dissociated conformation of Gαs and Gβγ when different types of ligands bound to β2AR. It also showed the minimum energy pathway about the conformational change of Gαs and Gβγ along the reaction coordinates. By using interactive essential dynamics analysis, we found that Gαs and Gβγ domain of Gs protein had the tendency to separate when the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 bound to β2AR. The α5-helix had a relatively quick movement with respect to transmembrane segments of β2AR when the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 bound to β2AR. Besides, the analysis of the centroid distance of Gαs and Gβγ showed that the Gαs was separated from Gβγ during the MD simulations. Our results not only could provide details about the different types of ligands that induced conformational change of β2AR and Gs protein, but also supplied more information for different efficacies of drug design of β2AR."
https://openalex.org/W2041543200,"Rifaximin is a semi-synthetic rifamycin derivative that is used to treat different conditions including bacterial diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin is of particular interest because it is poorly adsorbed in the intestines and has minimal effect on colonic microflora. We previously demonstrated that rifaximin affected epithelial cell physiology by altering infectivity by enteric pathogens and baseline inflammation suggesting that rifaximin conferred cytoprotection against colonization and infection. Effects of rifaximin on epithelial cells were further examined by comparing the protein expression profile of cells pretreated with rifaximin, rifampin (control antibiotic), or media (untreated). Two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis identified 36 protein spots that were up- or down-regulated by over 1.7-fold in rifaximin treated cells compared to controls. 15 of these spots were down-regulated, including annexin A5, intestinal-type alkaline phosphatase, histone H4, and histone-binding protein RbbP4. 21 spots were up-regulated, including heat shock protein (HSP) 90α and fascin. Many of the identified proteins are associated with cell structure and cytoskeleton, transcription and translation, and cellular metabolism. These data suggested that in addition to its antimicrobial properties, rifaximin may alter host cell physiology that provides cytoprotective effects against bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2167820974,"Integrating evidence from multiple domains is useful in prioritizing disease candidate genes for subsequent testing. We ranked all known human genes (n=3819) under linkage peaks in the Irish Study of High-Density Schizophrenia Families using three different evidence domains: 1) a meta-analysis of microarray gene expression results using the Stanley Brain collection, 2) a schizophrenia protein-protein interaction network, and 3) a systematic literature search. Each gene was assigned a domain-specific p-value and ranked after evaluating the evidence within each domain. For comparison to this ranking process, a large-scale candidate gene hypothesis was also tested by including genes with Gene Ontology terms related to neurodevelopment. Subsequently, genotypes of 3725 SNPs in 167 genes from a custom Illumina iSelect array were used to evaluate the top ranked vs. hypothesis selected genes. Seventy-three genes were both highly ranked and involved in neurodevelopment (category 1) while 42 and 52 genes were exclusive to neurodevelopment (category 2) or highly ranked (category 3), respectively. The most significant associations were observed in genes PRKG1, PRKCE, and CNTN4 but no individual SNPs were significant after correction for multiple testing. Comparison of the approaches showed an excess of significant tests using the hypothesis-driven neurodevelopment category. Random selection of similar sized genes from two independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia showed the excess was unlikely by chance. In a further meta-analysis of three GWAS datasets, four candidate SNPs reached nominal significance. Although gene ranking using integrated sources of prior information did not enrich for significant results in the current experiment, gene selection using an a priori hypothesis (neurodevelopment) was superior to random selection. As such, further development of gene ranking strategies using more carefully selected sources of information is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1992887555,"Proteins of the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily are essential in controlling the shape and dynamics of intracellular membranes. Here, we present evidence for the unconventional function of a member of the endophilin family of BAR and Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, namely endophilin B2, in the perinuclear organization of intermediate filaments. Using mass spectrometry analysis based on capturing endophilin B2 partners in in situ pre-established complexes in cells, we unravel the interaction of endophilin B2 with plectin 1, a variant of the cytoskeleton linker protein plectin as well as with vimentin. Endophilin B2 directly binds the N-terminal region of plectin 1 via Src homology 3-mediated interaction and vimentin indirectly via plectin-mediated interaction. The relevance of these interactions is strengthened by the selective and drastic reorganization of vimentin around nuclei upon overexpression of endophilin B2 and by the extensive colocalization of both proteins in a meshwork of perinuclear filamentous structures.

Significance: Our data unravel a novel activity of a BAR protein that does not involve membrane deforming activity supporting membrane trafficking. Cell motility and exchange of materials between intracellular compartments in eukaryotes involve dynamic remodeling of membrane curvature. Scaffolding, a process reversibly involving peripheral membrane proteins at the membrane-cytosol interface, can impose and/or stabilize curvature and is accomplished by several classes of proteins (1McMahon H.T.

Members of the N-BAR family, such as amphiphysins, endophilins, and nadrins, possess an N-terminal sequence folded into an amphipathic α-helix in the membrane environment.

BAR domain proteins participate in several cellular functions as most of them possess binding modules, such as the phosphoinositide binding pleckstrin and phox homology domains, or the protein recognition SH3 domain.

However, the contribution of endoB1 in Bax-mediated permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, depending on Bax conformational changes, is not fully understood. Whether and how these events rely on self-assembly and membrane deforming activities of the BAR domain remain open questions. Consistently with its ability to reshape membranes (41Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. Generation of high curvature membranes mediated by direct endophilin bilayer interactions.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), endoB1 was shown to control the morphology of the mitochondrial network and to participate in mitochondrial division (37Karbowski M. Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Endophilin B1 is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In agreement with its presence on Golgi membranes, endoB1 has also been involved in COPI-vesicle formation (41Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. Generation of high curvature membranes mediated by direct endophilin bilayer interactions.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 42Yang J.S. Zhang L. Lee S.Y. Gad H. Luini A. Hsu V.W. Key components of the fission machinery are interchangeable.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly with the role of endophilins A in regulated endocytosis, endoB1 has been specifically implicated in the regulation of nerve growth factor/TrkA trafficking (43Wan J. Cheung A.Y. Fu W.Y. Wu C. Zhang M. Mobley W.C. Cheung Z.H. Ip N.Y. Endophilin B1 as a novel regulator of nerve growth factor/TrkA trafficking and neurite outgrowth.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9002-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a last process involving endoB1 because, in starved cells, it is translocated to early stage autophagosomes and recruits the ultraviolet irradiation resistant-associated gene (UVRAG), via its SH3 domain (44Takahashi Y. Coppola D. Matsushita N. Cualing H.D. Sun M. Sato Y. Liang C. Jung J.U. Cheng J.Q. Mulé J.J. Pledger W.J. Wang H.G. Bif-1 interacts with Beclin 1 through UVRAG and regulates autophagy and tumorigenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Although the contribution of its membrane deforming activity, if any, needs to be determined, endoB1 could thus be part of a complex driving membrane biogenesis for the formation of autophagosomes. Relevant to this function, a key role of endoB1 in the fission of Golgi tubules during nutrient starvation was reported (44Takahashi Y. Coppola D. Matsushita N. Cualing H.D. Sun M. Sato Y. Liang C. Jung J.U. Cheng J.Q. Mulé J.J. Pledger W.J. Wang H.G. Bif-1 interacts with Beclin 1 through UVRAG and regulates autophagy and tumorigenesis.Nat.

Bif-1 regulates Atg9 trafficking by mediating the fission of Golgi membranes during autophagy.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). EndoB1 is increasingly involved in tumor suppression (with autophagy and apoptosis being negative regulators of tumorigenesis (46Kang R. Zeh H.J. Lotze M.T. Tang D. The Beclin 1 network regulates autophagy and apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar)); strikingly, its close relative endoB2 has not been assigned any function. As lower organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila have only one gene encoding for endophilin B, endoB1 and -B2 could exert redundant functions in mammals. However, because both can assemble as heterodimers, more subtle functions might exist in higher organisms, and at least some of the endoB1 described functions that might require endoB2 via heterodimerization. In this study, we present evidence for a specific function of endoB2 in mammalian cells that has never been described before and that involves interaction with plectin 1 (plec1), a plakin superfamily member controlling cytoskeleton architecture (47Sonnenberg A. Liem R.K. Plakins in development and disease.Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 2189-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For mammalian expression, the cDNA encoding for human endoB2 (short isoform or isoform1, Swiss-Prot accession Q9NR46-1) was cloned into pCDNA3.1/myc-His using BamHI/EcoRI, and the one encoding for N-BAR/endoB2 (encompassing amino-acids 1–280) was cloned into pEXPR-IBA3 using XbaI/BamHI. The plasmid encoding for vim-GFP was a kind gift from S. Etienne-Manneville (Institut Pasteur, France). For bacterial expression, the cDNA encoding for endoB2 was cloned into pAsk-IBA3 using SacII/BamHI. Part of the cDNA sequence encoding for the N-terminal region of human plectin 1 (plectin isoform 1, Swiss-Prot accession Q15149-1), starting from glycine 121 and ending at threonine 174, was reconstituted by fill-in and PCR amplification using six overlapping sense and antisense primers with 5-′ and 3-′ primers containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The 3-′ primer also contained a stop codon. The resulting cDNA was subsequently cloned into pGEX-6P-1. For the mutant cDNA in which proline 153 was mutagenized into alanine, the same strategy as for the wild type sequence was used except that the relevant primer contained an alternative codon encoding for alanine. Recombinant proteins were designed by fusing to GST either a fragment of the wild type N-terminal sequence (residues 121–174) or a mutated form with the 150PETA153 sequence, giving rise to GST-plec1PETP and GST-plec1PETA, respectively (Fig. 3). The sequence KARLKK (residues 173–178) in endoB2 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II system, Stratagene, Agilent Technologies) into two distinct sequences as follows: AAALAA, using the primers 5′-GGATGCCTGCGCAGCGGCGCTGGCGGCGGCCAAGGCTGCAGAAGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTTCTGCAGCCTTGGCCGCCGCCAGCGCCGCTGCGCAGGCATCC-3′ (reverse); and KARLAA, using the primers 5′-GGATGCCTGCAAAGCGAGGCTGGCGGCGGCCAAGGCTGCAGAAGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTTCTGCAGCCTTGGCCGCCGCCAGCCTCGCTTTGCAGGCATCC-3′ (reverse), respectively. Both mutations were generated in parallel in the bacterial and mammalian recombinant expression vectors pASK3-endoB2-St and pcDNA3-endoB2-myc described earlier, respectively. For protein purification, all proteins were expressed in transformed Escherichia coli BL21pLys (Novagen). Synthesis of endoB2-St, endoB1-St, their BAR-truncated species, and mutagenized forms (pASK-IBA3C vector) or GST, GST-plec1PETP, or GST-plec1PETA (pGEX-6P vector) was induced with 0.2 μg/ml anhydrotetracycline or 1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside, respectively, for 3 h at 37 °C. Purification under native conditions at 4 °C was performed from cleared lysates by affinity chromatography on StrepTactin-Sepharose or glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA, GmbH, Germany and Amersham Biosciences, respectively), yielding >95% pure proteins at 0.75–1.2 mg/ml. Unless freshly prepared material was required, proteins could be stored at −80 °C without loss in solubility or membrane binding ability. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (PAA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (PAA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

https://openalex.org/W2128365072,"Flavonoids are secondary metabolites present in all terrestrial plants. The flavonoid pathway has been extensively studied, and many of the involved genes and metabolites have been described in the literature. Despite this extensive knowledge, the functioning of the pathway in vivo is still poorly understood. Here, we study the flavonoid pathway using both experiments and mathematical models. We measured flavonoid metabolite dynamics in two tissues, hypocotyls and cotyledons, during tomato seedling development. Interestingly, the same backbone of interactions leads to very different accumulation patterns in the different tissues. Initially, we developed a mathematical model with constant enzyme concentrations that described the metabolic networks separately in both tissues. This model was unable to fit the measured flavonoid dynamics in the hypocotyls, even if we allowed unrealistic parameter values. This suggested us to investigate the effect of transcript abundance on flavonoid accumulation. We found that the expression of candidate flavonoid genes varies considerably with time. Variation in transcript abundance results in enzymatic variation, which could have a large effect on metabolite accumulation. Candidate transcript abundance was included in the mathematical model as representative for enzyme concentration. We fitted the resulting model to the flavonoid dynamics in the cotyledons, and tested it by applying it to the data from hypocotyls. When transcript abundance is included, we are indeed able to explain flavonoid dynamics in both tissues. Importantly, this is possible under the biologically relevant restriction that the enzymatic properties estimated by the model are conserved between the tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1995342727,"Peptidomimetics effective in modulating protein-protein interactions and resistant to proteolysis have potential in therapeutic applications. An appealing yet underperforming peptidomimetic strategy is to employ D-amino acids and reversed sequences to mimic a lead peptide conformation, either separately or as the combined retro-inverso peptide. In this work, we examine the conformations of inverse, reverse and retro-inverso peptides of p53(15-29) using implicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation and circular dichroism spectroscopy. In order to obtain converged ensembles for the peptides, we find enhanced sampling is required via the replica exchange molecular dynamics method. From these replica exchange simulations, the D-peptide analogues of p53(15-29) result in a predominantly left-handed helical conformation. When the parent sequence is reversed sequence as either the L-peptide and D-peptide, these peptides display a greater helical propensity, feature reflected by NMR and CD studies in TFE/water solvent. The simulations also indicate that, while approximately similar orientations of the side-chains are possible by the peptide analogues, their ability to mimic the parent peptide is severely compromised by backbone orientation (for D-amino acids) and side-chain orientation (for reversed sequences). A retro-inverso peptide is disadvantaged as a mimic in both aspects, and further chemical modification is required to enable this concept to be used fruitfully in peptidomimetic design. The replica exchange molecular simulation approach adopted here, with its ability to provide detailed conformational insights into modified peptides, has potential as a tool to guide structure-based design of new improved peptidomimetics."

ATPases hydrolyze ATP to adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (ATP + H2O → ADP + Pi), whereas adenylate kinases catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP onto the α-phosphate of adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) (ATP + AMP ⇆ 2 ADP).

Ap5A contains two adenosine groups connected by five phosphate groups, allowing it to bind simultaneously to the ATP- and the AMP-binding site (28Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I.

The SMC-NBD structure showed the two adenosine moieties of Ap5A attached to two binding sites separated by ∼15 Å. A Mg2+ ion, one adenosine, plus α-, β-, and γ-phosphates of Ap5A bound the canonical Mg2+-ATP-binding site on lobe I of the NBD. The other adenosine stacked onto the side chain of a conserved glutamine of the Q-loop at the interface of lobe I and lobe II. The authors also examined nucleotide-induced conformational changes. ATP did not alter the NBD structure. In contrast, binding of Ap5A rotated the two lobes of the NBD by ∼15°. These results suggest that adenylate kinase activity induces distinct conformational changes in SMC. Although ATP and AMP bind separate sites, binding of one nucleotide influences the interaction with the other in non-ABC adenylate kinases. A number of different experimental approaches showed that ATP greatly increased binding of AMP to the AMP-binding site (30Tomasselli A.G. Noda L.H. Mitochondrial GTP-AMP phosphotransferase. 2.

Based on data from non-ABC adenylate kinases, we hypothesized that ATP and AMP mutually influence their interaction with CFTR at separate binding sites (Fig. 1). Based on the data from CFTR, we further hypothesized that only one of the two ATP-binding sites of CFTR is involved in adenylate kinase activity. To test these hypotheses, we employed the patch clamp technique with excised membrane patches containing CFTR and also photolabeling of CFTR using radioactive nucleotides with a photoactivatable azido (N3)-group attached to the adenine ring. The N3-group absorbs UV light, resulting in photolysis and formation of a reactive intermediate, which reacts covalently with nearby amino acid residues (38Potter R.L. Haley B.E.

An advantage of these approaches is that they allow the interactions of nucleotides with CFTR to be studied while CFTR is embedded in the membrane. The radioactive, photoactivatable azido-nucleotides, dissolved as triethylammonium salt in absolute methanol, were from Affinity Photoprobes, LLC (Lexington, KY). Immediately before use, the methanol was evaporated under a stream of argon, and the azido-nucleotide was dissolved in a buffer of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2.

The high speed membrane pellet (70,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C) was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 7 μg/ml E-64. Membranes (containing 25–35 μg of protein to detect photolabeling of full-length CFTR or 150–270 μg of protein to detect labeling of proteolytic CFTR fragments) were incubated on ice in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2 with the radioactive azido-nucleotide and non-radioactive nucleotides as described in the figure legends in a total volume of 30 μl. Individual reactions were then irradiated with UV light (302 nm, 8-watt lamp) at a distance of 5 cm unless otherwise indicated. The duration of UV irradiation varied between the different azido-nucleotides and is indicated in the figure legends. After exposure to UV light, 20 μl of stop buffer (25 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 125 μg/ml benzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, 7 μg/ml E-64) followed by 875 μl of solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 125 μg/ml benzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, 7 μg/ml E-64) were added.

Immunocomplexed CFTR (from 150–270 μg of membrane protein) was bound to Dynabeads® Protein A (0.75 mg/sample) (Invitrogen). Beads were washed with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl and 1 ml of 0.05% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl.

The proteolysis reactions were stopped by adding dithiothreitol (end concentration 50 mm) and an equal volume of 2× Novex® Tricine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitated full-length CFTR was fractionated on 6 or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteolytic digestion products of CFTR were fractionated on Novex® 16% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) (44Schägger H. von Jagow G.

After electrophoresis, gels were either dried and then subjected to digital autoradiography using a FLA-7000 imaging system (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon®-FL transfer membrane, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) for Western blotting. For quantitative image analysis, Multi Gauge analysis software (version 3.0; Fuji Photo Film) was used. Region intensities corresponding to protein or peptide bands were quantified in linear arbitrary units. Background intensities were subtracted. PVDF membranes blocked in 0.01% casein were incubated for 2 h with monoclonal anti-human CFTR antibodies as indicated for each experiment in the figures, diluted 1:1,000 in TTBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.05% Tween 20).

The bath (intracellular) solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CsEGTA, and 10 mm Tricine, pH 7.3, with HCl. Following patch excision, CFTR channels were activated with 25 nm protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA) and ATP. PKA was present in all cytosolic solutions that contained ATP. Experiments were performed at room temperature (23–26 °C). Macropatch recordings were low pass-filtered at 100 Hz for analysis using an 8-pole Bessel filter (model 900, Frequency Devices, Inc.

https://openalex.org/W2094391135,"Background HLA directed antibodies play an important role in acute and chronic allograft rejection. During viral infection of a patient with HLA antibodies, the HLA antibody levels may rise even though there is no new immunization with antigen. However it is not known whether the converse occurs, and whether changes on non-donor specific antibodies are associated with any outcomes following HLA antibody incompatible renal transplantation. Methods 55 patients, 31 women and 24 men, who underwent HLAi renal transplant in our center from September 2005 to September 2010 were included in the studies. We analysed the data using two different approaches, based on; i) DSA levels and ii) rejection episode post transplant. HLA antibody levels were measured during the early post transplant period and corresponding CMV, VZV and Anti-HBs IgG antibody levels and blood group IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies were quantified. Results Despite a significant DSA antibody rise no significant non-donor specific HLA antibody, viral or blood group antibody rise was found. In rejection episode analyses, multiple logistic regression modelling showed that change in the DSA was significantly associated with rejection (p = 0.002), even when adjusted for other antibody levels. No other antibody levels were predictive of rejection. Increase in DSA from pre treatment to a post transplant peak of 1000 was equivalent to an increased chance of rejection with an odds ratio of 1.47 (1.08, 2.00). Conclusion In spite of increases or decreases in the DSA levels, there were no changes in the viral or the blood group antibodies in these patients. Thus the DSA rise is specific in contrast to the viral, blood group or third party antibodies post transplantation. Increases in the DSA post transplant in comparison to pre-treatment are strongly associated with occurrence of rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2108256664,"The secretion of angiogenic factors by vascular endothelial cells is one of the key mechanisms of angiogenesis. Here we report on the isolation of a new potent angiogenic factor, diuridine tetraphosphate (Up4U) from the secretome of human endothelial cells. The angiogenic effect of the endothelial secretome was partially reduced after incubation with alkaline phosphatase and abolished in the presence of suramin. In one fraction, purified to homogeneity by reversed phase and affinity chromatography, Up4U was identified by MALDI-LIFT-fragment-mass-spectrometry, enzymatic cleavage analysis and retention-time comparison. Beside a strong angiogenic effect on the yolk sac membrane and the developing rat embryo itself, Up4U increased the proliferation rate of endothelial cells and, in the presence of PDGF, of vascular smooth muscle cells. Up4U stimulated the migration rate of endothelial cells via P2Y2-receptors, increased the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like tubes and acts as a potent inducer of sprouting angiogenesis originating from gel-embedded EC spheroids. Endothelial cells released Up4U after stimulation with shear stress. Mean total plasma Up4U concentrations of healthy subjects (N = 6) were sufficient to induce angiogenic and proliferative effects (1.34±0.26 nmol L-1). In conclusion, Up4U is a novel strong human endothelium-derived angiogenic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1982292770,"Silkworm posterior silkgland is a model for studying intracellular trafficking. Here, using this model, we identify several potential cargo proteins of BmKinesin-1 and focus on one candidate, BmCREC. BmCREC (also known as Bombyx mori DNA supercoiling factor, BmSCF) was previously proposed to supercoil DNA in the nucleus. However, we show here that BmCREC is localized in the ER lumen. Its C-terminal tetrapeptide HDEF is recognized by the KDEL receptor, and subsequently it is retrogradely transported by coat protein I (COPI) vesicles to the ER. Lacking the HDEF tetrapeptide of BmCREC or knocking down COPI subunits results in decreased ER retention and simultaneously increased secretion of BmCREC. Furthermore, we find that BmCREC knockdown markedly disrupts the morphology of the ER and Golgi apparatus and leads to a defect of posterior silkgland tube expansion. Together, our results clarify the ER retention mechanism of BmCREC and reveal that BmCREC is indispensable for maintaining ER/Golgi morphology."
