This report concerns the relative stabilities of these proteins and their metal complexes to enzyme action and to thermal denaturation."

Williams, St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School, London. oAminobenzoyl and p-aminobenzoyl glucosiduronic acids were prepared enzymatically with UDP-glucuronic acid’ and aglycone (5). Phenolphthalein glucosiduronic acid and bacterial P-glucuronidase were obtained from the Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri. UDP-glucuronic acid was prepared enzymatically from UDPG, with UDPG dehydrogenase and DPN (4). An aniline-glucuronic acid complex was generously supplied by Dr. R. T. Williams (6). This compound contained 2 moles of aniline per mole of glucuronic acid. 1 mole of aniline could be removed by washing a solution of the compound at pH 8.0 with ether. The resulting aniline-glucuronic acid compound did not reduce triphenyltetrazolium in 0.5 N NaOH, but, following acidification with 0.1 N HCl, both the reducing group of glucuronic acid and the amino group of aniline were liberated. These observations indicated that the compound was N-phenylglucuronosylamine, in which the amino group was linked to carbon 1 of glucuronic acid. Methods--Aniline and p-toluidine were extracted at pH 7.0 or above into 5 volumes of ethylene dichloride containing 1.5 per cent isoamyl alcohol. The compounds were returned to 1 ml. of 0.1 N HCl and determined in 0.5 ml. of the acid extract by diazotization and by coupling"

https://openalex.org/W127596188,"A study of the urinary excretion of digitoxin in man was first attempted by Friedman and coworkers (1) by the use of the embryonic duck heart method of biological assay. These workers estimated that the amount of cardioactive substances (calculated as digitoxin) excreted in the urine of young adults over a period of 12 to 24 days after an oral dose was equivalent to approximately 40 per cent of the dose. However, no differentiation between digitoxin and possible cardioactive metabolites was attempted in this work. By using biosynthetically labeled C14-digitoxin, Okita et al. (2) found that 60 to 80 per cent of an intravenous dose was eliminated through the kidneys of humans over a long period, and that only 6 to 10 per cent of this appeared to be unchanged glycoside. The nature of the metabolites of the glycoside present in the urine was not investigated. Some qualitative information has been obtained about the metabolic products of cardiac glycosides excreted in rat urine (3, 4). Digoxin and lanatoside C were both excreted in this animal, principally as the unchanged glycoside, but both were also converted to a metabolic product which has been designated Metabolite B. Investigation into the chemical nature of this substance (5) indicated that it was probably a conjugate of the aglycone digoxigenin. Digitoxin was excreted in only small amounts as the unchanged glycoside in this animal (4); the principal urinary product was a substance, Metabolite C, which was thought to be a conjugate of a derivative of digitoxigenin. With higher doses of digitoxin, other metabolites appeared in the urine, one of which was named Metabolite G. We have now been able to make a qualitative study of the cardioactive substances present in human urine after oral administration of digoxin, digitoxin, and lanatoside C and have compared the metabolites present with those found in rat urine. A preliminary communication (6) outlined evidence which indicated that hydroxylation occurred at C-12 in the digitoxin molecule in humans and in rats, thereby producing a urinary metabolite which could not be separated from the glycoside digoxin. This evidence was based on experiments in which paper chromatography and C14-digitoxin were used, and the details of this work are also presented in this paper."

https://openalex.org/W2104405100,"(Received for publication, December 20, 1957) Incorporation of Cl4 into L-ascorbic acid’ in detached ripening straw- berries to which specifically labeled sugars have been administered has demonstrated a close relationship between ascorbic acid and glucose metabolism at the hexose level (1). Corresponding observations have been made on the conversion of glucose to ascorbic acid in green gram seeds (2, 3) and in cress seedlings (4). Ascorbic acid isolated from strawberries fed glucose-l-84 was found to contain 65 to 70 per cent of its total activity in carbon 1. This observation, together with other related data, was interpreted as evidence that glucose or a closely related intermediate was the ultimate precursor of ascorbic acid in plants; that the conversion of glucose to ascorbic acid occurred in such a way that the carbon chain was preserved intact, and that carbon 1 of glucose became carbon 1 of ascorbic acid. The last observation mentioned was in contrast to the pathway of ascorbic acid formation in both the cress seedling and the rat, as proposed by Isherwood, Chen, and Mapson (5), and in the rat as proved by King and coworkers (6-9). In an effort to learn whether results obtained with the strawberry represented a unique or possibly an alternative pathway, or whether the observation was representative of the normal path of ascorbic acid formation in plants, the glucose-l-Cl4 experiment was repeated with cress seedlings (4). Again, about 70 per cent of the total activity of the ascorbic acid appeared in carbon 1 after administration of glucose-l-04. To provide further information on the origin and nature of ascorbic acid labeling patterns obtained from strawberries administered various specifically labeled sugars, we have now investigated labeling patterns of"

https://openalex.org/W1252774,"In earlier studies from this laboratory (l-3), it was demonstrated that on parenteral administration certain steroids, particularly those closely related to testosterone, possessed the ability to enhance the kidney /3-glucuronidase activity of various strains of mice. Fishman, Artenstein, and Green (3) established experimental conditions which made it possible to obtain uniform and reproducible figures for mouse kidney &glucuronidase activity in the Ajax strain of mice. A large number of steroids were screened. Androgens as a group were found to increase renal p-glucuronidase, seven out of forty-nine pregnane and corticoid derivatives showed weak activity, and estrogens and progesterone were without effect. With use of testosterone as the reference steroid (which gave a 3-fold response), they found that the following changes in the molecule enhanced the potency: (1) esterification of the 17p-OH, (2) introduction of a 17~CHo group, (3) reduction of the A4 double bond, and (4) elimination of the 19-CH3 group. The following alterations reduced potency: replacement of the 17@OH (1) by a 17~0H, (2) by a 17-ketone, and (3) by introduction of an lla-, 14cr-, or 6/3-OH group. In the AK-androstenediol series, enhancement of activity was seen in the 17a-CH3 compound, the potency of which was reduced by blocking the 17P-OH group or by oxidizing it to a 17-keto group. In the present report, conditions are described which make the assay more reliable and significant for steroids highly potent with regard to the renal &glucuronidase response. By this means, it was discovered that esters of testosterone had a much higher order of activity than that shown by unesterified testosterone. Moreover, the study of newer compounds by the “screening” method has yielded findings which bear on the relationship between structure and activity of some protein-anabolic steroids."
