We developed an imaging-based nanophotonic method for detecting mid-infrared molecular fingerprints and implemented it for the chemical identification and compositional analysis of surface-bound analytes. Our technique features a two-dimensional pixelated dielectric metasurface with a range of ultrasharp resonances, each tuned to a discrete frequency; this enables molecular absorption signatures to be read out at multiple spectral points, and the resulting information is then translated into a barcode-like spatial absorption map for imaging. The signatures of biological, polymer, and pesticide molecules can be detected with high sensitivity, covering applications such as biosensing and environmental monitoring. Our chemically specific technique can resolve absorption fingerprints without the need for spectrometry, frequency scanning, or moving mechanical parts, thereby paving the way toward sensitive and versatile miniaturized mid-infrared spectroscopy devices."

In a dynamical system whose state is determined by interactions among neurons, computations can be rapidly reconfigured by controlling the system’s inputs and initial conditions. To investigate whether the brain employs such control mechanisms, we recorded from the dorsomedial frontal cortex of monkeys trained to measure and produce time intervals in two sensorimotor contexts. The geometry of neural trajectories during the production epoch was consistent with a mechanism wherein the measured interval and sensorimotor context exerted control over cortical dynamics by adjusting the system’s initial condition and input, respectively. These adjustments, in turn, set the speed at which activity evolved in the production epoch, allowing the animal to flexibly produce different time intervals. These results provide evidence that the language of dynamical systems can be used to parsimoniously link brain activity to sensorimotor computations.

Humans and nonhuman primates are capable of generating a vast array of behaviors, a feat dependent on the brain’s ability to produce a vast repertoire of neural activity patterns. However, identifying the mechanisms by which the brain flexibly selects neural activity patterns across a multitude of contexts remains a fundamental and outstanding problem in systems neuroscience. Here, we aimed to answer this question using a dynamical systems approach. Work in multiple modalities has provided support for a hypothesis that neural activity can be understood at the level of neural populations and viewed as neural trajectories of a dynamical system (Fetz, 1992Fetz E.E.

This line of investigation has been complemented by efforts in developing, training, and analyzing recurrent neural network models that can emulate a range of motor and cognitive behaviors, leading to novel insights into the underlying latent dynamics (Rigotti et al., 2010Rigotti M.

These early successes hold promise for the development of a more ambitious “computation-through-dynamics” that provides a general framework for understanding how activity patterns in the brain support flexible behaviorally relevant computations. The behavior of a dynamical system can be described in terms of three factors: (1) the interaction between state variables, (2) the system’s initial state, and (3) the external inputs to the system. Accordingly, the hope for using the mathematics of dynamical systems to understand flexible generation of neural activity patterns and behavior depends on our ability to understand the co-evolution of behavioral and neural states in terms of these three components. Assuming that synaptic couplings between neurons and other biophysical properties are approximately constant on short timescales (i.e., trial to trial), we asked whether behavioral flexibility can be understood in terms of adjustments to initial states and low-dimensional external inputs with minimal dynamics. There is evidence that certain aspects of behavioral flexibility can be understood in terms of these factors. For example, it has been proposed that preparatory activity prior to movement initializes the system such that ensuing movement-related activity follows the appropriate trajectory (Churchland et al., 2010Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P. Kaufman M.T. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Cortical preparatory activity: representation of movement or first cog in a dynamical machine?.Neuron. 2010; 68: 387-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Similarly, the presence of a static context input can enable a recurrent neural network to perform flexible rule- (Mante et al., 2013Mante V. Sussillo D. Shenoy K.V. Newsome W.T. Context-dependent computation by recurrent dynamics in prefrontal cortex.Nature. 2013; 503: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, Song et al., 2016Song H.F. Yang G.R. Wang X.-J.

However, whether these initial insights would apply more broadly when both inputs and initial conditions change is an important outstanding question. For many behaviors, distinguishing the effects of synaptic coupling, inputs, and initial conditions in neural activity patterns is challenging. For example, neural activity during a reaching movement is likely governed by both local recurrent interactions and distal inputs from time-varying and condition-dependent reafferent signals (Todorov and Jordan, 2002Todorov E. Jordan M.I. Optimal feedback control as a theory of motor coordination.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1226-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, Scott, 2004Scott S.H.

Primary motor cortex underlies multi-joint integration for fast feedback control.Nature. 2011; 478: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Similarly, in many perceptual decision making tasks, it is not straightforward to disambiguate the sensory drive from recurrent activity representing the formation of a decision and the subsequent motor plan (Mante et al., 2013Mante V.

Deliberation and commitment in the premotor and primary motor cortex during dynamic decision making.Neuron. 2014; 81: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This makes it difficult to tease apart the contribution of recurrent dynamics governed by initial conditions from the contribution of dynamic inputs (Sussillo et al., 2016Sussillo, D., Jozefowicz, R., Abbott, L.F., and Pandarinath, C. (2016). LFADS - Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. arXiv, arXiv:1608.06315, https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06315.Google Scholar). To address this challenge, we designed a sensorimotor task for nonhuman primates in which animals had to measure and produce time intervals using internally generated patterns of neural activity in the absence of potentially confounding time-varying sensory and reafferent inputs. Using a novel analysis of the geometry and dynamics of in vivo activity in the dorsal medial frontal cortex (DMFC) and in silico activity in recurrent neural network (RNN) models trained to perform the same task, we found evidence that behavioral flexibility is mediated by the complementary action of inputs and initial conditions controlling the structural organization of neural trajectories. Our aim was to ask whether flexible control of internally generated dynamics could be understood in terms of systematic adjustments made to initial conditions and external inputs of a dynamical system. We designed a “Ready, Set, Go” (RSG) timing task to directly investigate the role of these two factors. The basic sensory and motor events in the task were as follows: after fixating a central spot, monkeys viewed two peripheral visual flashes (“Ready” followed by “Set”) separated by a sample interval, ts, and produced an interval, tp, after Set by making a saccade to a visual target that was presented throughout the trial. In order to obtain juice reward, animals had to generate tp as close as possible to a target interval, tt (Figure 1B), which was equal to ts times a “gain factor,” g (tt=gts). The demand for flexibility was imposed in two ways (Figure 1C). First, ts varied between 0.5 and 1 s on a trial-by-trial basis (drawn from a discrete uniform “prior” distribution). Second, g switched between 1 (g=1 context) and 1.5 (g=1.5 context) across blocks of trials (Figure 1D, mean block length = 101, SD = 49 trials). To verify that animals learned the task (Figures 1E and S1), we used regression analyses to assess the dependence of tp on ts and g. First, we verified that animals learned to measure ts by analyzing the relationship between ts and tp within each context (tp=βo+β1ts). Results indicated that tp increased monotonically with ts (β1 > 0, p ≪ 0.001 for all sessions). Next, we verified that animals learned the gain by comparing regression slopes relating tp to ts across the two contexts. The slopes (β1) were significantly higher in the g=1.5 context compared to g=1 context (mean β1 = 1.2 versus 0.84; signed-rank test p = 0.002, n = 10 sessions; Figure 1E, inset). As a complementary analysis to show that animals displayed sensitivity to gain in individual sessions, we fit a regression model to behavior across both contexts that included additional regressors for gain and its interaction with ts (tp=β0+β1ts+β2g+β3gts). Results indicated a significant positive interaction between ts and g (mean β3 = 0.73; β3 > 0, p < 0.0001 in each session). Finally, we asked whether animals switched between contexts rapidly by fitting a regression model relating tp Z scored for each ts (zp), to the number of trials n following a context switch (zp=β0+β1n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 25 trials after switches). There was no evidence that zp changed as a function of number of trials after switch (one-tailed test for β1, p > 0.25), suggesting that the switching was rapid. Together, these results confirmed that animals used an estimate of ts to compute tp and were able to flexibly and rapidly adjust their responses according to the gain information. For both gains, responses were variable, and average responses exhibited a regression to the mean (mean β1 < 1, p = 0.005 for g=1, and mean β1 < 1.5, p = 0.0001 for g=1.5, one-sided signed-rank test). As with previous work (Miyazaki et al., 2005Miyazaki M. Nozaki D. Nakajima Y. Testing Bayesian models of human coincidence timing.J.

To assess the neural computations in RSG, we focused on the dorsal region of the medial frontal cortex (DMFC) comprising supplementary eye field, dorsal supplementary motor area (i.e., excluding the medial bank), and presupplementary motor area. DMFC is a natural candidate for our task because it plays a crucial role in timing as shown by numerous studies in humans (Halsband et al., 1993Halsband U. Ito N. Tanji J. Freund H.J.

We recorded from 324 units (129 from monkey C and 195 from monkey J) in DMFC (Figures S2 and S11). Between 11 and 82 units were recorded simultaneously in a given session; however, in this study, we combined data across all units irrespective of whether they were recorded simultaneously. Firing patterns were heterogeneous and varied across units, task epochs, and experimental contexts. In the Ready-Set epoch, responses were modulated by both gain and elapsed time (e.g., units #1, 3, and 5, Figure 2A). For many units, firing rate modulations underwent a salient change at the earliest expected time of Set (0.5 s). For example, responses of some units increased monotonically in the first 0.5 s but decreased afterward (Figure 2A, units #1 and 3). Following Set, firing rates were characterized by a mixture of (1) transient changes after Set (units #1 and 3), (2) sustained modulations during the Set-Go epoch (units #1 and 5), and (3) monotonic changes in anticipation of the saccade (units #1, 2 and 4). These characteristics were not purely sensory or motor and varied systematically with ts and gain. For example, the amplitude of the early transient response (unit #1) depended on both ts and gain, indicating that it was not a visually triggered response to Set. The same was true for the sustained modulations after Set and activity modulations prior to saccade initiation. We also examined the representation of ts and gain across the population by projecting the data on dimensions along which activity was strongly modulated by context and interval in state-space (i.e., the space spanned by the firing rates of all 324 units; see STAR Methods). Similar to individual units, population activity was modulated by both elapsed time and gain during both the Ready-Set (Figure 2B) and Set-Go (Figure 2C) epochs. We used this rich dataset to investigate whether the flexible adjustment of intrinsic dynamics across the population with respect to ts and gain could be understood using the language of dynamical systems. We pursued the idea that neural computations responsible for flexible control of saccade initiation time can be understood in terms of the behavior of a dynamical system established by interactions among neurons. To formulate a rigorous hypothesis for how a dynamical system could confer such flexibility, we considered the goal of the task and worked backward logically. The goal of the animal was to flexibly control the saccade initiation time to a fixed target. Previous motor timing studies proposed that saccade initiation is triggered when the activity of a subpopulation of neurons with monotonically increasing firing rates (i.e., “ramping”) reaches a threshold (Romo and Schultz, 1987Romo R.

Methods A cross-sectional survey comprised of questions from the nationally-representative 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was administered to 591 MTurk workers and 393 masters in 2016. Health status (asthma, depression, BMI, and general health), health behaviors (influenza vaccination, health insurance, smoking, and physical activity), and demographic characteristics of the two MTurk populations (workers and masters) were compared to each other and, using Poisson regression, to a nationally-representative BRFSS and NHANES samples. Results Workers and master demographics were similar. MTurk users were more likely to be aged under 50 years compared to the national sample (86% vs. 55%) and more likely to complete a college degree than the national sample (50% vs. 26%). Adjusting for covariates, MTurk users were less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, to smoke, to have asthma, to self-report being in excellent or very good health, to exercise, and have health insurance but over twice as likely to screen positive for depression relative to a national sample. Results were fairly consistent among different age groups. Conclusions MTurk workers are not a generalizable population with regards to health status and behaviors; deviations did not follow a trend. Appropriate health-related uses for MTurk and ways to improve upon the generalizability of MTurk health studies are proposed."

Although LDL-C levels vary among humans and are heritable, the genetic factors affecting LDL-C are not fully characterized. We identified a rare frameshift variant in the LIMA1 (also known as EPLIN or SREBP3) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol absorption. In a mouse model, LIMA1 was mainly expressed in the small intestine and localized on the brush border membrane. LIMA1 bridged NPC1L1, an essential protein for cholesterol absorption, to a transportation complex containing myosin Vb and facilitated cholesterol uptake. Similar to the human phenotype, Lima1-deficient mice displayed reduced cholesterol absorption and were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Through our study of both mice and humans, we identify LIMA1 as a key protein regulating intestinal cholesterol absorption."

Macrophages represent a diverse and plastic subset of phagocytic innate immune cells that are critically important for immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis. In vivo, macrophage phenotypes are almost exclusively driven by external stimuli that dictate the activation of necessary cellular programs (1.Kawasaki T. Kawai T.

In the context of infection or pro-inflammatory stimuli, macrophages evoke a wave of cellular responses, including the production and secretion of cytokines as well as membrane biogenesis and phagocytosis. These processes are intricately linked to phospholipid homeostasis; however, there are few papers linking phospholipid metabolism and macrophage biology. Choline is a quaternary amine and essential nutrient that participates in acetylcholine synthesis (cholinergic neurons) and one-carbon metabolism (primarily thought to be in the liver and kidney). However, in eukaryotic nonneuronal cells, choline is predominantly used for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), 5The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineCTL1choline transporter-like protein 1CTL1-AbCTL1-specific primary antibodyDAGdiacylglycerolPKCprotein kinase CCCTphosphocholine cytidylyltransferaseCHT1high-affinity choline transporterOCTorganic ion transporterLPSlipopolysaccharideM[0]basal macrophageM[LPS]LPS-stimulated macrophageAAarachidonic acidSMsphingomyelinESIelectrospray ionizationTGtriglycerideBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophage(s)Pcyt1gene encoding phosphocholine cytidylyltransferasePcyt2gene encoding phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferaseHC3hemicholinium-3TNFtumor necrosis factorILinterleukinBIMbisindolylmaleimide ISRMselected reaction monitoringIDAinformation-dependent acquisitionEPIenhanced product ionERendoplasmic reticulumAAarachidonic acidDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleRTroom temperatureANOVAanalysis of variance. the major outer-leaflet phospholipid.

Moreover, PC can also be degraded by numerous phospholipases to yield lipid intermediates that can then be recycled or further processed.

Although few studies have investigated choline metabolism in immune cells, early experiments revealed that macrophage stimulation with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acutely increased PC synthesis (17.Chu A.J. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulates phospholipid synthesis and phosphatidylcholine breakdown in cultured human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells.Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24 (1733798): 317-32310.1016/0020-711X(92)90264-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18.Grove R.I. Allegretto N.J. Kiener P.A. Warr G.A.

Biol. 1990; 48 (2358751): 38-4210.1002/jlb.48.1.38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When PC synthesis was compromised by myeloid-specific deletion of CCTα (the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis), cells had a reduced capacity to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS (19.Tian Y. Pate C. Andreolotti A. Wang L. Tuomanen E. Boyd K. Claro E. Jackowski S. Cytokine secretion requires phosphatidylcholine synthesis.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181 (18559668): 945-95710.1083/jcb.200706152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data suggest that in response to an inflammatory insult, choline availability and PC synthesis may be important. In the present study, we sought to investigate how macrophage LPS polarization affects choline uptake and subsequent metabolism. We observed an increase in PC synthesis in response to LPS due to an up-regulation in the transcription of the CTL1 gene (Slc44a1), which facilitates an increased rate of uptake and synthesis of PC. Conversely, we also sought to ask the reciprocal question of how limiting the availability of choline might affect acute response to LPS stimulation. Pharmacological and antibody-mediated inhibition of CTL1 limited choline uptake and diminished PC content, which altered cytokine secretion. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of PC synthesis resulted in an increase in DAG accumulation and subsequent protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Restoring PC levels and inhibiting PKC activity were important for regulating the pro-inflammatory responses, linking macrophage phospholipid metabolism and inflammation. LPS is known to increase choline incorporation into PC (17.Chu A.J. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulates phospholipid synthesis and phosphatidylcholine breakdown in cultured human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells.Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24 (1733798): 317-32310.1016/0020-711X(92)90264-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18.Grove R.I. Allegretto N.J. Kiener P.A. Warr G.A.

Biol. 1990; 48 (2358751): 38-4210.1002/jlb.48.1.38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, the effect of long-term exposure to LPS on choline uptake and metabolism remains unclear. Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM) were treated for 48 h with LPS, and the transcript expression of pro-inflammatory (Tnfa, Il1b, Il6, and the ratio of iNos/Arg1) or anti-inflammatory (Tgfb1 and Mrc1) markers was measured to confirm polarization (Fig. S1). The rate of choline uptake was markedly increased in M[LPS] compared with control M[0] (Fig. 1A). Moreover, LPS-polarization increased the maximal transport of choline from 418 ± 49 to 821 ± 62 pmol/mg/min, where the apparent affinity remained unchanged (68.62 ± 20.07 to 72.66 ± 13.42 μm) (Fig. 1B). Following uptake in nonhepatic or renal tissue, choline is rapidly phosphorylated and shuttled along the CDP-choline pathway to produce PC. In keeping with an increased rate of uptake, the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC was higher in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 1C). It has been shown previously that arachidonic acid (AA) liberated from PC via the actions of phospholipase A2 can have subsequent roles in inflammatory signaling via conversion to prostaglandin and lipid mediators following LPS stimulation (17.Chu A.J. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulates phospholipid synthesis and phosphatidylcholine breakdown in cultured human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells.Int. J.

We reasoned that perhaps LPS stimulation of PC synthesis might be accompanied by a coordinated increase in overall PC turnover to facilitate AA metabolism. However, pulse-chase experiments revealed no difference in the rate of PC degradation between M[LPS] and M[0] cells (Fig. S2A). There was also no difference in the sensitivity to the choline uptake inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC3) between naive and LPS-treated cells (Fig. S2B). These data indicate that when chronically polarized with LPS, choline transport and subsequent incorporation into PC are up-regulated. To validate these findings and address directly whether the levels of PC and/or the downstream lipid sphingomyelin (SM) were increased following LPS stimulation, we used a targeted lipidomic approach to profile and quantify total content and lipid species at the molecular level. A total of 35 PC and 27 SM species were detected by HPLC electrospray ionization tandem MS (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Corroborating recent work in murine immortalized macrophages (22.Zhang C. Wang Y. Wang F. Wang Z. Lu Y. Xu Y. Wang K. Shen H. Yang P. Li S. Qin X. Yu H. Quantitative profiling of glycerophospholipids during mouse and human macrophage differentiation using targeted mass spectrometry.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28341849): 41210.1038/s41598-017-00341-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we found that in LPS-treated macrophages, total PC content was increased ∼50% (Fig. 2A) (p = 0.0817, using a small sample size of n = 3). There was a trend consistent with higher levels of SM in LPS-treated cells, although side-chain composition was only different between treatments in SM(d18:1/16:0) (Fig. S3, A and B). However, there was a significant increase in the most abundant PC molecular species, including PC(16:0/16:1), PC(16:0/18:1), PC(16:1/18:1), and PC(18:0/18:2) (Fig. 2B), which represent potentially newly synthesized, desaturated, and elongated fatty acids. The transcript expression of Elovl6 and Scd1, which encode for the elongase and desaturase activity, respectively, were up-regulated by 48-h LPS treatment (Fig. S3C). To further investigate this phenomenon, we measured LPS-stimulated de novo fatty acid synthesis by assessing the incorporation of [3H]acetate into all lipids, which was increased overall (Fig. 2C) and confirms previously published work (23.Im S.S. Yousef L. Blaschitz C. Liu J.Z. Edwards R.A. Young S.G. Raffatellu M. Osborne T.F. Linking lipid metabolism to the innate immune response in macrophages through sterol regulatory element binding protein-1a.Cell Metab. 2011; 13 (21531336): 540-54910.1016/j.cmet.2011.04.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the dramatic increase in [3H]acetate-derived fatty acids and an absolute increase in PC, the relative proportion of de novo fatty acids incorporated into the total phospholipid pool diminishes with LPS treatment compared with control (51.73% versus 36.55%; p < 0.01). As reported previously (24.Huang Y.L. Morales-Rosado J. Ray J. Myers T.G. Kho T. Lu M. Munford R.S. Toll-like receptor agonists promote prolonged triglyceride storage in macrophages.J. Biol.

Biol. 2012; 92 (22753953): 829-83910.1189/jlb.1111537Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), LPS triggered an increased fatty acid incorporation into triglyceride (TG) (29.89% versus 45.09%; p < 0.0001), where fatty acid esterification onto DAG or cholesteryl esters remained consistent between naive and LPS-treated macrophages (Fig. 2C). Together, these results demonstrate that chronic LPS polarization stimulates an increase in total PC and a remodeling of fatty acid side chains, potentially in keeping with augmented lipogenesis observed with 48-h LPS-polarized cells. We hypothesized that the protein expression of choline transporters was increased in LPS-stimulated cells, which would explain the observed increase in the maximal rate of choline transport. We first assessed the transcript levels of the potential choline transport proteins (choline transporter-like proteins Slc44a1–5, organic cation transporters Slc22a1–3, and the high-affinity choline transporter Slc5a7) and show that only Slc44a1/CTL1 and Slc44a2/CTL2 were expressed in BMDM (Fig. 3) (data not shown). In response to chronic LPS stimulation, the transcript expression of Slc44a1 and Slc44a2 was significantly increased compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3A). There were no differences in transcript expression of the first two enzymes in the CDP-choline pathway, Chka or Pcyt1, or the rate-limiting enzyme of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, Pcyt2 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, although there was a corresponding up-regulation of the CTL1 protein with LPS stimulation, CTL2 protein expression was unchanged (Fig. 3B). This was counter to the increased Slc44a2 transcript expression and suggests that CTL1 is the main choline transporter in BMDM. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in response to chronic stimulation with LPS, the transcript and protein expression of CTL1 is correspondingly higher and may facilitate the increase in choline metabolism fueled by inflammatory stimulation.Figure 4Chronic pharmacological or CTL1-specific antibody inhibition lowers choline uptake and PC levels. BMDM were incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of the choline uptake inhibitor HC3 (250 μm), where DMSO was used as a vehicle control or with a primary CTL1 antibody, where an isotype control IgG antibody was used (both at 1:250 dilution). A, acute [3H]choline uptake was assessed over 10 min (n = 4 separate isolations, each performed in triplicate).

Choline, an essential nutrient for humans.FASEB J. 1991; 5 (2010061): 2093-209810.1096/fasebj.5.7.2010061Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); however, the effects of choline depletion on macrophages are not known. To address this question, we used a pharmacological and antibody occlusion approach to chronically inhibit general and CTL1-specific choline uptake. Following a chronic (48-h) incubation with either the choline uptake inhibitor HC3 or a CTL1-specific primary antibody (CTL1-Ab), choline uptake was significantly reduced (Fig. 4A). Next, we treated macrophages with either HC3 or the CTL1-Ab in the presence of [3H]choline for 48 h to assess the endogenous pool of PC after the duration of choline uptake inhibition. In keeping with the choline uptake measurements, the amount of PC was significantly reduced in both HC3 and CTL1-Ab–treated cells (Fig. 4B). HC3-mediated choline uptake inhibition was equal to that of the CTL1-specific antibody, suggesting that CTL1 is the primary transporter of choline in these cells. Chronic treatment at the indicated concentrations of HC3 had no affect on cell size and slightly but significantly decreased cell viability (Fig. S4). These effects were not observed using the CTL1-Ab (data not shown). Previous work has shown that CCTα-deficient macrophages, which lack the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway and have reduced PC content, secrete less TNFα and IL-6 in response to LPS. This is due to secretory defects at the level of the ER and Golgi. In our BMDM model of choline uptake inhibition, we used a cytokine array panel and determined that chronic HC3 treatment altered 6-h LPS-stimulated secretion of various cytokines and chemokines, including TNFα and IL-10 (Fig. S5). Contrary to the findings in CCTα-deficient cells, when we assessed LPS-stimulated primary macrophages that had experienced chronic choline uptake inhibition (6-h LPS), we observed a significant increase in the secretion of both TNFα and IL-6, along with significant reductions in IL-10 secretion (Fig. 5, A–C), whereas no differences in IL-1β were seen (data not shown). The affect of choline uptake inhibition was only noted in the presence of LPS (Fig. 5, A–C). The final step in the biosynthesis of PC involves the combination of CDP-choline and DAG at the ER. We next tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of choline uptake subsequently altered the levels or metabolism of DAG. We incubated BMDM with either HC3 or the CTL1-Ab in the presence of [3H]glycerol for 48 h and demonstrated that in response to both forms of inhibition, there was a marked increase in the amount of DAG (Fig. 6A). In addition, there was a significant increase in TG levels (Fig. 6B) and, as expected, a significant reduction in [3H]glycerol incorporation into PC (Fig. 6C). In keeping with altered DAG metabolism, HC3 treatment resulted in an increase in the transcript expression of the final step of TG synthesis, Dgat2, but not Dgat1 (Fig. 6D). This was associated with more defined lipid droplets in HC3-treated cells (Fig. 6E). Increased cellular DAG is known to activate conventional and novel isoforms of PKC, which in turn has been linked to macrophage inflammation (27.Zhou X. Yang W. Li J.

HC3-mediated chronic choline inhibition was associated with an overall increase in macrophage PKC activity as assessed using a substrate motif antibody (Fig. 7), where in cells treated with the choline uptake inhibitor, an increased abundance of phosphorylated PKC substrates was observed.Figure 7Inhibiting choline uptake is associated with higher PKC activity. Choline uptake was inhibited in BMDM for 48 h using HC3 (250 μm). Cell lysate was collected and immunoblotted using a PKC substrate motif antibody.

Blots are representative images of the biological replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibiting choline uptake directly skewed the macrophage inflammatory profile. As a final interrogation, we aimed to rescue the aberrant cytokine secretion via two independent approaches. We first supplemented macrophages with excess choline in the media (500 μm) in the presence of both HC3 and the CTL1-Ab. We hypothesized that excess choline would compete with the inhibitor and potentially restore choline uptake and metabolism. Interestingly, choline treatment rescued the levels of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 that were altered by HC3 (Fig. 8, A–C); however, in the presence of the CTL1-Ab, excess choline treatment was completely ineffective (Fig. 8, D–F). As a secondary approach, cells were treated with the conventional/novel PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) (30.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. The bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C.J. Biol.

Independent of pharmacological or antibody-mediated choline inhibition, BIM treatment was partially able to correct the secreted levels of LPS-stimulated TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 (Fig. 8, A–F). Finally, we confirmed that the supplementation of excess choline was able to dilute the effect of HC3-mediated inhibition on choline uptake and increased PC levels (Fig. 9A) but had no effect in cells treated with the CTL1-Ab. As expected, BIM treatment had no effect on PC levels (Fig. 9B).Figure 9PC levels in the presence of choline or PKC inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2806749833,"Retrogradely transported neurotropic viruses enable genetic access to neurons based on their long-range projections and have become indispensable tools for linking neural connectivity with function. A major limitation of viral techniques is that they rely on cell-type-specific molecules for uptake and transport. Consequently, viruses fail to infect variable subsets of neurons depending on the complement of surface receptors expressed (viral tropism). We report a receptor complementation strategy to overcome this by potentiating neurons for the infection of the virus of interest-in this case, canine adenovirus type-2 (CAV-2). We designed AAV vectors for expressing the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) throughout candidate projection neurons. CAR expression greatly increased retrograde-labeling rates, which we demonstrate for several long-range projections, including some resistant to other retrograde-labeling techniques. Our results demonstrate a receptor complementation strategy to abrogate endogenous viral tropism and thereby facilitate efficient retrograde targeting for functional analysis of neural circuits."

The personal and economic costs of work impairment in these disorders are immense. Symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety are potentially remediable forms of distress that may contribute to work impairment in chronic health conditions such as IMID. The present study evaluated the association between pain [Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale], fatigue [Daily Fatigue Impact Scale], depression and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] and work impairment [Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale] in four patient populations: multiple sclerosis (n = 255), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 248, rheumatoid arthritis (n = 154) and a depression and anxiety group (n = 307), using quantile regression, controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors, physical disability, and cognitive deficits. Each of pain, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue individually showed significant associations with work absenteeism, presenteeism, and general activity impairment (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.3 to 1.0). When the distress variables were entered concurrently into the regression models, fatigue was a significant predictor of work and activity impairment in all models (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). These findings have important clinical implications for understanding the determinants of work impairment and for improving work-related outcomes in chronic disease."

This study examined the association between women’s attitudes towards wife-beating and their utilization of reproductive healthcare services. Method Two waves of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data were analyzed using multivariate regression. Outcome variables were a set of reproductive healthcare services, namely contraception use, modern contraception use, antenatal visit by skilled health professionals (SHP), delivery in healthcare facilities, delivery by SHP and postnatal check up by SHP. Attitudes towards abuse were assessed by a set of five questions that asked the situation under which ‘hitting or beating’ one’s wife is justifiable. Results Around 32% of the participants reported that hitting or beating wife by husband was justified in certain situations. There is a gradient in the relationship between number of healthcare services accessed and number of situations justified for beating wife. Women who strongly reject the justification of wife beating were more likely than those who reject that weakly to report contraception use, antenatal care by SHP, delivery in healthcare facilities, delivery care by SHP, and postnatal care by SHP. Conclusions Women’s attitudes towards ‘wife beating’ have a significant association with reproductive healthcare seeking behavior. The impact of this malpractice on women’s health and consequences thereafter need to be brought in the forefront of public health campaign."

All patients provided detailed clinical histories and underwent urodynamic studies. Cystoscopic bladder biopsies were obtained and processed for transmission EM (TEM) and scanning EM (SEM). The severity of the urothelium findings was graded on a 4-point scale (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate, and 3: severe). The EM findings between IC/BPS and control patients were compared; the results were analyzed using the chi-square test.Compared with the urothelium of control patients, the urothelium of IC/BPS patients had more severe defects of the urothelial cell layers and integrity of umbrella cells in TEM (p = 0.045 and 0.01, respectively). In SEM, umbrella cell pleomorphism increased and microplicae of the cell membrane decreased in the IC/BPS group, and both were more severe than in the control group (p = 0.022 and 0.007, respectively). The patients with moderate to severe defects of umbrella cell integrity had more severe bladder pain and smaller maximal bladder capacity (MBC) (both p = 0.010). Patients with moderate to severe defects in microplicae of the cell membrane had smaller cystometric bladder capacity and MBC (p = 0.037 and 0.047, respectively).The results revealed significant urothelium defects in IC/BPS, especially in the umbrella cells.

https://openalex.org/W2805997767,"Spermatogenesis is a highly complex developmental process that occurs primarily in seminiferous tubules of the testes and requires additional maturation steps in the epididymis and beyond. Mutations in many different genes can lead to defective spermatozoa and hence to male infertility. Some of these genes encode for ion channels and transporters that play roles in various processes such as cellular ion homeostasis, signal transduction, sperm motility, and the acrosome reaction. Here we show that germ cell–specific, but not Sertoli cell–specific, disruption of Lrrc8a leads to abnormal sperm and male infertility in mice. LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) is the only obligatory subunit of heteromeric volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Its ablation severely compromises cell volume regulation by completely abolishing the transport of anions and osmolytes through VRACs. Consistent with impaired volume regulation, the cytoplasm of late spermatids appeared swollen. These cells failed to properly reduce their cytoplasm during further development into spermatozoa and later displayed severely disorganized mitochondrial sheaths in the midpiece region, as well as angulated or coiled flagella. These changes, which progressed in severity on the way to the epididymis, resulted in dramatically reduced sperm motility. Our work shows that VRAC, probably through its role in cell volume regulation, is required in a cell-autonomous manner for proper sperm development and explains the male infertility of Lrrc8a−/− mice and the spontaneous mouse mutant ébouriffé.

Spermatogenesis, the production of male gametes, takes place in seminiferous tubules that harbor Sertoli cells and germ cells at various developmental stages. Sertoli cells envelop and provide a specialized environment for the developing spermatozoa. Following cycles of mitosis and meiosis, spherical, haploid spermatids transform into elongated and polarized spermatozoa (1Cooke H.J. Saunders P.T. Mouse models of male infertility.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3 (12360237): 790-80110.1038/nrg911Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This transformation, known as spermiogenesis, includes formation of the acrosome, chromatin condensation, and reshaping of the nucleus that results in the typical sperm head shape and the assembly of a mitochondrial sheath around the axoneme of the flagellum. It culminates in spermiation, in which residual cytoplasm of the elongated spermatids is shed off and spermatozoa are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule (2O'Donnell L. Nicholls P.K. O'Bryan M.K. McLachlan R.I. Stanton P.G. Spermiation: the process of sperm release.Spermatogenesis. 2011; 1 (21866274): 14-3510.4161/spmg.1.1.14525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3O'Donnell L.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2010: 553-597Google Scholar), which guide spermatozoa to the epididymis.

The general importance of LRRC8 channels became evident from the severe phenotypes of Lrrc8a−/− mice, which were reported shortly after the identification of LRRC8A as an obligatory VRAC constituent (28Kumar L.

It was only recently discovered that the spontaneous mouse mutant ébouriffé (29Lalouette A. Lablack A. Guenet J.L. Montagutelli X. Segretain D.

This mouse mutant shares several pathological features (29Lalouette A. Lablack A. Guenet J.L. Montagutelli X. Segretain D.

The more benign phenotype of ébouriffé mice may be explained by the observation that their VRAC currents are strongly reduced but not abolished (30Platt C.D. Chou J. Houlihan P. Badran Y.R. Kumar L.

The first characterization of ébouriffé mice focused on their male sterility, which was attributed to structural defects of sperm cells (29Lalouette A. Lablack A. Guenet J.L. Montagutelli X. Segretain D. Male sterility caused by sperm cell-specific structural abnormalities in ebouriffé, a new mutation of the house mouse.Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55 (8828840): 355-36310.1095/biolreprod55.2.355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It remains, however, unclear whether a complete loss of LRRC8A would have similar consequences and whether these pathologies are cell-autonomous outcomes of a reduction of VRAC currents in germ cells or in Sertoli cells. In this study, we investigated the role of LRRC8A in spermatogenesis using several mouse models. Whereas mice lacking LRRC8A specifically in Sertoli cells were completely fertile, LRRC8A was indispensable in germ cells for the normal development of mature spermatozoa and for male fertility. In the absence of LRRC8A, late spermatids displayed severe disorganization of the mitochondrial sheath in the midpiece region and a drastically swollen cytosolic compartment. Spermatozoa showed flagellar coiling or angulation, features that were previously described with abnormal cell swelling upon RVD failure (7Yeung C.H. Barfield J.P. Cooper T.G. Physiological volume regulation by spermatozoa.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 250 (16446027): 98-10510.1016/j.mce.2005.12.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As the basis for exploring the role of VRAC in male fertility, we first determined the expression of all LRRC8 subunits in testis and epididymis. It is generally believed that VRAC is ubiquitously expressed in all vertebrate tissues and cells (11Jentsch T.J. VRACs and other ion channels and transporters in the regulation of cell volume and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Indeed, Western blotting analysis identified the obligatory VRAC subunit LRRC8A in testis and epididymis and in all other tissues examined (Fig. 1A). With the exception of LRRC8E, the other LRRC8 isoforms were also significantly expressed in those tissues (Fig. 1A). The glutamate transport-enhancing subunit LRRC8E (26Lutter D. Ullrich F. Lueck J.C. Kempa S. Jentsch T.J. Selective transport of neurotransmitters and modulators by distinct volume-regulated LRRC8 anion channels.J.

The testicular expression pattern of Lrrc8a was investigated using knock-in (KI) mice expressing β-gal under the control of the endogenous Lrrc8a promoter (32Stuhlmann T. Planells-Cases R. Jentsch T.J. LRRC8/VRAC anion channels enhance β-cell glucose sensing and insulin secretion.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (29773801): 197410.1038/s41467-018-04353-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Blue LacZ staining was scattered over the whole width of seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Lrrc8a is expressed in Sertoli cells and in germ cells of all developmental stages.

These tags were inserted by CRISPR-Cas9–mediated recombination in fertilized mouse oocytes obtained from crosses of WT and Lrrc8alox/lox (32Stuhlmann T. Planells-Cases R. Jentsch T.J. LRRC8/VRAC anion channels enhance β-cell glucose sensing and insulin secretion.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (29773801): 197410.1038/s41467-018-04353-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) mice. The resulting Lrrc8aHA/HA and Lrrc8alox-HA/lox-HA mice allowed the detection of LRRC8A by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry using commercial antibodies against the HA tag, with WT mice serving as negative controls. Lrrc8alox-HA/lox-HA mice additionally permit to ascertain Cre-mediated, cell type–specific disruption of Lrrc8a. Consistent with the lacZ staining (Fig. 1B), immunofluorescent labeling of testis sections of Lrrc8aHA/HA mice revealed broad expression of LRRC8A all over the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1C). We observed a remarkably strong radial staining that extended from the outer circumference to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, a pattern that is suggestive of Sertoli cells. It is possible that the remaining scattered and weaker labeling represents germ cells, but the low signal intensity precluded a definite conclusion. Considering the complexity of spermatogenesis, including the important interplay of germ cells with Sertoli cells, the male infertility of Lrrc8a−/− mice (28Kumar L. Chou J. Yee C.S. Borzutzky A.

Med. 2014; 211 (24752297): 929-94210.1084/jem.20131379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) might be due to primary defects in different testicular cell types. For instance, the male infertility of mice lacking the ClC-2 Cl− channel has been tentatively attributed to a defect in Sertoli rather than germ cells (33Bösl M.R. Stein V. Hübner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J.

To identify the cell type in which absence of LRRC8A causes male infertility, we generated different conditional LRRC8A knock-out (KO) mouse models. We first crossed Lrrc8alox/lox (32Stuhlmann T. Planells-Cases R. Jentsch T.J. LRRC8/VRAC anion channels enhance β-cell glucose sensing and insulin secretion.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (29773801): 197410.1038/s41467-018-04353-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or Lrrc8alox-HA/lox-HA mice with AMH-Cre mice (34Lécureuil C. Fontaine I. Crepieux P. Guillou F.

In the following, we refer to the resulting Sertoli cell-specific LRRC8A KO as SC-Δ8A and SC-Δ8A-HA, respectively. Immunofluorescent analysis of testes from SC-Δ8A-HA mice (Fig. 2A) showed that LRRC8A could no longer be detected in seminiferous tubules. However, Western blotting analysis showed only a moderate reduction of LRRC8A protein levels in testes compared with Lrrc8alox/lox controls (Fig. 2B), suggesting that LRRC8A is also expressed in testicular cell types other than Sertoli cells. Despite the prominent expression of LRRC8A in Sertoli cells, we failed to detect any morphological changes of SC-Δ8A testes compared with Lrrc8alox/lox con"

A comprehensive and systematic metabolic characterization of the Botryococcus braunii race A strain CCAP 807/2 was conducted within the present study, including the detailed analysis of growth-associated and physiological parameters. In addition, the intracellular metabolome was profiled for the first time and showed growth- and product-specific fluctuations in response to the different availability of medium resources during the cultivation course. Among the identified metabolites, a constant expression of raffinose was observed for the first time under standard conditions, which has until now only been described for higher plants. Overall, the multilayered analysis during the cultivation of strain CCAP 807/2 allowed the differentiation of four distinct physiological growth phases and revealed differences in the production profiles and content of liquid hydrocarbons and carbohydrates with up to 84% of organic dry weight (oDW). In the process, an enhanced production of carbohydrates with up to 63% of oDW (1.36±0.03 g L-1) could be observed during the late linear growth phase, whereas the highest accumulation of extracellular hydrocarbons with up to 24% of oDW (0.66±0.12 g L-1) occurred mainly during the stationary growth phase. Altogether, the knowledge obtained is potentially useful for the general understanding of the overall physiology of Botryococcus braunii and provide important insights into the growth behavior and product formation of this microalga, and is thus relevant for large scale biofuel production and industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2805812684,"Personality traits are related to many aspects of one's life, including risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio). To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles: bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior) following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.5% (v/v%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0% alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish. However, 0.5% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal, while both 0.1% and 0.5% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens."

The role of ALIAmides in the control of inflammatory processes has recently gained much attention and prompted the use of these molecules or their analogs, and the pharmacologic manipulation of their endogenous levels, as plausible therapeutic strategies in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory conditions. Since chronic inflammation is mainly driven by cells of adaptive immunity, particularly T lymphocytes, we aimed at investigating whether suchbioactive lipids could directly modulate T-cell responses. We found that OEA, PEA, and eicosatrienoyl ethanolamide (ETEA) could directly inhibit both T-cell responses by reducing their production of TNF-α and IFN-γ from CD8 T cells and TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17 from CD4 T cells. Furthermore, neither SEA nor docosatrienoyl ethanolamide (DTEA) could affect cytokine production from both T cell subsets. Interestingly, unlike OEA and ETEA, PEA was also able to enhance de novo generation of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)-expressing regulatory T cells from CD4-naive T cells. Our findings show for the first time that specific ALIAmides can directly affect different T-cell subsets, and provide proof of their anti-inflammatory role in chronic inflammation, ultimately suggesting that these bioactive lipids could offer novel tools for the management of T- cell dependent chronic inflammatory diseases.—Chiurchiù, V., Leuti, A., Smoum, R., Mechoulam, R., Maccarrone, M.

https://openalex.org/W2805261575,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH1)-1 is mutated in various types of human cancer, and the presence of this mutation is associated with improved responses to irradiation and chemotherapy in solid tumor cells. Mutated IDH1 (IDH1MUT) enzymes consume NADPH to produce d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG) resulting in the decreased reducing power needed for detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), for example. The objective of the current study was to investigate the mechanism behind the chemosensitivity of the widely used anticancer agent cisplatin in IDH1MUT cancer cells. Oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by cisplatin treatment were monitored in IDH1MUT HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and U251 glioma cells. We found that exposure to cisplatin induced higher levels of ROS, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and cell death in IDH1MUT cancer cells, as compared with IDH1 wild-type ( IDH1WT) cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that cisplatin treatment dose dependently reduced oxidative respiration in IDH1MUT cells, which was accompanied by disturbed mitochondrial proteostasis, indicative of impaired mitochondrial activity. These effects were abolished by the IDH1MUT inhibitor AGI-5198 and were restored by treatment with d-2HG. Thus, our study shows that altered oxidative stress responses and a vulnerable oxidative metabolism underlie the sensitivity of IDH1MUT cancer cells to cisplatin.-Khurshed, M., Aarnoudse, N., Hulsbos, R., Hira, V.

In particular, dis organized spindle/chromosomes and the loss of the cortical actin cap are readily observed in SIRT7-depleted oocytes, generating aneuploid eggs. Furthermore, we found that SIRT7 depletion markedly elevated reactive ox ygen species levels in oocytes, thereby compromising the developmental competence of early embryos. Of note, SIRT7 protein level is significantly decreased in oocytes from obese mice, and the forced expression of exogenous SIRT7 ameliorates maternal obesity-associated meiotic defects and oxidative stress in oocytes.

In the present study, we found that CPI-613, which targets tumorous mitochondrial energy metabolism, induced autophagosome formation followed by lysosome fusion in HS-MM CCS cells in vitro. Interestingly, CPI-613 along with chloroquine, which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, significantly induced necrosis of HS-MM CCS cell growth in vitro. Subsequently, we established a murine orthotropic metastatic model of CCS and evaluated the putative suppressive effect of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on CCS progression. Injection of HS-MM into the aponeuroses of the thigh, the most frequently affected site in CCS, resulted in massive metastasis in SCID-beige mice. By contrast, intraperitoneal administration of CPI-613 (25 mg/kg) and chloroquine (50 mg/kg), two days a week for two weeks, significantly decreased tumor growth at the injection site and abolished metastasis. The present results imply the inhibitory effects of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on the progression of CCS."

https://openalex.org/W2805798992,"Spatial capture-recapture modelling (SCR) is a powerful analytical tool to estimate density and derive information on space use and behaviour of elusive animals. Yet, SCR has been seldom applied to the study of ecologically keystone small mammals. Here we highlight its potential and requirements with a case study on common voles (Microtus arvalis). First, we address mortality associated with live-trapping, which can be high in small mammals, and must be kept minimal. We designed and tested a nest box coupled with a classic Sherman trap and show that it allows a 5-fold reduction of mortality in traps. Second, we address the need to adjust the trapping grid to the individual home range to maximize spatial recaptures. In May-June 2016, we captured and tagged with transponders 227 voles in a 1.2-ha area during two monthly sessions. Using a Bayesian SCR with a multinomial approach, we estimated: (1) the baseline detection rate and investigated variation according to sex, time or behaviour (aversion/attraction after a previous capture); (2) the parameter sigma that describes how detection probability declines as a function of the distance to an individual´s activity centre, and investigated variation according to sex; and (3) density and population sex-ratio. We show that reducing the maximum distance between traps from 12 to 9.6m doubled spatial recaptures and improved model predictions. Baseline detection rate increased over time (after overcoming a likely aversion to entering new odourless traps) and was greater for females than males in June. The sigma parameter of males was twice that of females, indicating larger home ranges. Density estimates were of 142.92±38.50 and 168.25±15.79 voles/ha in May and June, respectively, with 2–3 times more females than males. We highlight the potential and broad applicability that SCR offers and provide specific recommendations for using it to study small mammals like voles."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of human MSCs on inflammatory arthritis and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Mice with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) received two intraperitoneal injections of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. The clinical and histological features of injected CAIA were then compared with those of non-injected mice. The effect of MSCs on induction of regulatory T cells was examined both in vitro and in vivo. We also examined multiple cytokines secreted by peritoneal mononuclear cells, along with migration of MSCs in the presence of stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) and/or regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Sections of CAIA mouse joints and spleen were stained for human anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) to confirm migration of injected human MSCs. The results showed that MSCs alleviated the clinical and histological signs of synovitis in CAIA mice. Peritoneal lavage cells from mice treated with MSCs expressed higher levels of SDF-1α and RANTES than those from mice not treated with MSCs. MSC migration was more prevalent in the presence of SDF-1α and/or RANTES. MSCs induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells in vitro, and expression of FOXP3 mRNA was upregulated in the forepaws of MSC-treated CAIA mice. Synovial and splenic tissues from CAIA mice receiving human MSCs were positive for human ANA, suggesting recruitment of MSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that MSCs migrate into inflamed tissues and directly induce the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells, which then suppress inflammation. Thus, systemic administration of MSCs may be a therapeutic option for rheumatoid arthritis."

To better understand the cold response of cultivated and wild rice, cold-sensitive cultivar 93-11 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Indica) and cold-resistant hybrid wild rice DC907 with a 93-11 genetic background were used for a quantitative proteomic analysis with tandem mass tags (TMT) in parallel. Rice seedlings grown for four weeks at a normal temperature (25°C) were treated at 8-10°C for 24, 72 and 120 h. The number of differentially expressed proteins increased gradually over time in the cold-exposed rice in comparison with the untreated rice. A total of 366 unique proteins involved in ATP synthesis, photosystem, reactive oxygen species, stress response, cell growth and integrity were identified as responding to cold stress in DC907. While both DC907 and 93-11 underwent similar alterations in proteomic profiles in response to cold stress, DC907 responded in a prompter manner in terms of expressing cold-responding proteins, maintained a higher level of photosynthesis to power the cells, and possessed a stable and higher level of DIR proteins to prevent the plant from obtaining irreversible cell structure damage. The observations made in this study may lay a new foundation for further investigation of cold sensitivity or tolerance mechanisms in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2806302860,"Melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) is a single transmembrane domain accessory protein and a critical component of the hypothamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. MRAP is highly expressed in the adrenal gland and is essential for adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) receptor expression and function. Human loss-of-function mutations in MRAP cause familial glucocorticoid (GC) deficiency (FGD) type 2 (FGD2), whereby the adrenal gland fails to respond to ACTH and to produce cortisol. In this study, we generated Mrnp-null mice to study the function of MRAP in vivo. We found that the vast majority of Mrap−/− mice died at birth but could be rescued by administration of corticosterone to pregnant dams. Surviving Mrap−/− mice developed isolated GC deficiency with normal min- eralocorticoid and catecholamine production, recapitulating FGD2. The adrenal glands of adult Mrap−/− mice were small, with grossly impaired adrenal capsular morphology and cortex zonation. Progenitor cell differentiation was significantly impaired, with dysregulation of WNT4/β-catenin and sonic hedgehog pathways. These data dem onstrate the roles of MRAP in both steroidogenesis and the regulation of adrenal cortex zonation. This is the first mouse model of isolated GC deficiency and reveals the role of MRAP in adrenal progenitor cell regulation and cortex zonation.—Novoselova, T. V., Hussain, M., King, P.

https://openalex.org/W2807591256,"The evolution of cell-adhesion mechanisms in animals facilitated the assembly of organized multicellular tissues. Studies in traditional animal models have revealed two predominant adhesion structures, the adherens junction (AJ) and focal adhesions (FAs), which are involved in the attachment of neighboring cells to each other and to the secreted extracellular matrix (ECM), respectively. The AJ (containing cadherins and catenins) and FAs (comprising integrins, talin, and paxillin) differ in protein composition, but both junctions contain the actin-binding protein vinculin. The near ubiquity of these structures in animals suggests that AJ and FAs evolved early, possibly coincident with multicellularity. However, a challenge to this perspective is that previous studies of sponges-a divergent animal lineage-indicate that their tissues are organized primarily by an alternative, sponge-specific cell-adhesion mechanism called ""aggregation factor."" In this study, we examined the structure, biochemical properties, and tissue localization of a vinculin ortholog in the sponge Oscarella pearsei (Op). Our results indicate that Op vinculin localizes to both cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts and has biochemical and structural properties similar to those of vertebrate vinculin. We propose that Op vinculin played a role in cell adhesion and tissue organization in the last common ancestor of sponges and other animals. These findings provide compelling evidence that sponge tissues are indeed organized like epithelia in other animals and support the notion that AJ- and FA-like structures extend to the earliest periods of animal evolution."

This new strain overproduces all twelve following proteins: HoxEFUYH (hydrogen production), HoxW (maturation of the HoxH subunit of hydrogenase) and HypABCDEF (assembly of the [NiFe] redox center of HoxHY hydrogenase). This strain when grown in the presence of a suitable quantities of nickel and iron used here exhibits a strong (25-fold) increase in hydrogenase activity, as compared to the WT strain growing in the standard medium. Hence, this strain can be very useful for future analyses of the cyanobacterial [NiFe] hydrogenase to determine its structure and, in turn, improve its tolerance to oxygen with the future goal of increasing hydrogen production. We also report the counterintuitive notion that lowering the activity of the Synechocystis urease can increase the photoproduction of biomass from urea-polluted waters, without decreasing hydrogenase activity. Such cyanobacterial factories with high hydrogenase activity and a healthy growth on urea constitute an important step towards the future development of an economical industrial processes coupling H2 production from solar energy and CO2, with wastewater treatment (urea depollution)."
https://openalex.org/W2805255143,"Key contributions to protein structure and stability are provided by weakly polar interactions, which arise from asymmetric electronic distributions within amino acids and peptide bonds. Of particular interest are aromatic side chains whose directional π-systems commonly stabilize protein interiors and interfaces. Here, we consider aromatic-aromatic interactions within a model protein assembly: the dimer interface of insulin. Semi-classical simulations of aromatic-aromatic interactions at this interface suggested that substitution of residue TyrB26 by Trp would preserve native structure while enhancing dimerization (and hence hexamer stability). The crystal structure of a [TrpB26]insulin analog (determined as a T3Rf3 zinc hexamer at a resolution of 2.25 Å) was observed to be essentially identical to that of WT insulin. Remarkably and yet in general accordance with theoretical expectations, spectroscopic studies demonstrated a 150-fold increase in the in vitro lifetime of the variant hexamer, a critical pharmacokinetic parameter influencing design of long-acting formulations. Functional studies in diabetic rats indeed revealed prolonged action following subcutaneous injection. The potency of the TrpB26-modified analog was equal to or greater than an unmodified control. Thus, exploiting a general quantum-chemical feature of protein structure and stability, our results exemplify a mechanism-based approach to the optimization of a therapeutic protein assembly."

The composition of pacemaker channel complexes in different tissues is poorly understood, and the presence of additional HCN modulating subunits was speculated. Here we show that vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB), previously associated with a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 8, is an essential HCN1 and HCN2 modulator. VAPB significantly increases HCN2 currents and surface expression and has a maj or influence on the dendritic neuronal distribution of HCN2. Severe cardiac bradycardias in VAPB-deficient zebrafish and VAPB−/− mice highlight that VAPB physiologically serves to increase cardiac pacemaker currents. An altered T-wave morphology observed in the ECGs of VAPB−/− mice supports the recently proposed role of HCN channels for ventricular repolarization. The critical function of VAPB in native pacemaker channel complexes will be relevant for our understanding of cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsies, and provides an unexpected link between these diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.—Silbernagel, N., Walecki, M., Schäfer, M.-K.

To test compatibility of protein force fields (FFs) with TIP4P/Ice water, CHARMM, AMBER, and OPLS FFs were applied. CHARMM and AMBER FFs predict more β-sheet structure and lower diffusivity of TmAFP at the ice-water interface than does OPLS FF, indicating that β-sheet structure is important for the TmAFP-interface binding and antifreeze activity. In particular, CHARMM FF more clearly distinguishes the strengths of hydrogen bonds in the ice-binding and non-ice-binding sites of TmAFP than do other FFs, in agreement with experiments, implying that CHARMM FF can be a reasonable choice to simulate proteins with TIP4P/Ice water. Simulations of mutated TmAFPs show that for the same density of Thr residues, continuous arrangement of Thr with the distance of 0.4~0.6 nm induces the higher extent of antifreeze activity than does intermittent arrangement of Thr with larger distances. These findings suggest the choice of CHARMM FF for AFP-TIP4P/Ice simulations and help explain the relationship between Thr-residue arrangement and antifreeze activity."
https://openalex.org/W2807664708,"Poverty affects many people, but the ramifications and impacts affect all aspects of society. Information about the incidence of poverty is therefore an important parameter of the population for policy analysis and decision making. In order to provide specific, targeted solutions when addressing poverty disadvantage small area statistics are needed. Surveys are typically designed and planned to produce reliable estimates of population characteristics of interest mainly at higher geographic area such as national and state level. Sample sizes are usually not large enough to provide reliable estimates for disaggregated analysis. In many instances estimates are required for areas of the population for which the survey providing the data was unplanned. Then, for areas with small sample sizes, direct survey estimation of population characteristics based only on the data available from the particular area tends to be unreliable. This paper describes an application of small area estimation (SAE) approach to improve the precision of estimates of poverty incidence at district level in the State of Bihar in India by linking data from the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey 2011–12 of NSSO and the Population Census 2011. The results show that the district level estimates generated by SAE method are more precise and representative. In contrast, the direct survey estimates based on survey data alone are less stable."
https://openalex.org/W2805368592,"Cyanide is a potent toxic agent, and the few available antidotes are not amenable to rapid deployment in mass exposures. As a result, there are ongoing efforts to exploit different animal models to identify novel countermeasures. We have created a pipeline that combines high-throughput screening in zebrafish with subsequent validation in two mammalian small animal models as well as a porcine large animal model. We found that zebrafish embryos in the first 3 days post fertilization (dpf) are highly resistant to cyanide, becoming progressively more sensitive thereafter. Unbiased analysis of gene expression in response to several hours of ultimately lethal doses of cyanide in both 1 and 7 dpf zebrafish revealed modest changes in iron-related proteins associated with the age-dependent cyanide resistance. Metabolomics measurements demonstrated significant age-dependent differences in energy metabolism during cyanide exposure which prompted us to test modulators of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and related metabolic processes as potential antidotes. In cyanide-sensitive 7 dpf larvae, we identified several such compounds that offer significant protection against cyanide toxicity. Modulators of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as well as the small molecule sodium glyoxylate, consistently protected against cyanide toxicity in 7 dpf zebrafish larvae. Together, our results indicate that the resistance of zebrafish embryos to cyanide toxicity during early development is related to an altered regulation of cellular metabolism, which we propose may be exploited as a potential target for the development of novel antidotes against cyanide poisoning."

The animals were collected between 1995 and 2015 and represented 75 marsh deer (MD) and 136 brown brocket deer (BBD). Summarized, pneumonia was diagnosed microscopically in 48 MD and 52 BBD; 76 deer suffered trauma, involving dog attack (14 BBD) and vehicle-collision (14 BBD). Pulmonary edema (50 MD; 55 BBD) and congestion (57 MD; 78 BBD) were the most common findings for both species. Additionally, we diagnosed ruminal and myocardial mycosis in MD and BBD, respectively; ovarian dysgerminoma and pancreatic trematodiasis in BBD; and lesions suggestive of malignant catarrhal fever and orbiviral hemorrhagic disease in both species. The main CD in MD was: respiratory (41/75), alimentary, nutritional, trauma and euthanasia (3/75 each). Correspondingly, in BBD were: trauma (34/131), respiratory (30/131) and euthanasia (9/131). Respiratory disease was often defined by pulmonary edema and pneumonia. We provide evidence that respiratory disease, mainly pneumonia, is a critical pathological process in these Neotropical deer species. Although no etiological agents were identified, there is evidence of bacterial and viral involvement. Our results show trauma, mainly anthropogenic, as a common ailment in BBD. We propose to prioritize respiratory disease in future research focused on South American deer health aspects. We believe anthropogenic trauma may be a primary threat for populations of BBD."

Enhanced actomyosin assembly contributes to endothelial cell contact dysfunction. However, the roles and mechanisms of actomyosin assembly in ALI are not totally clear. We investigated the dynamic alterations and roles of actomyosin in ALI in vivo and in vitro models induced by LPS. Pulmonary levels of E-cadherin, vascular endothelial-cadherin, occludin, myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, and thymosin β4 were decreased, and the number and activity of neutrophils and the levels of actomyosin, p-ρ-associated protein kinase, p-myosin light-chain kinase, and profilin1 were increased within 3 d after LPS administration, and then, those alterations were recovered within the next 4 d, which was consistent with the alterations of lung histology, vascular permeability, edema, and serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α. Direct or indirect inhibition of increased F-actin or myosin assembly ameliorated the reduction of intercellular junction molecules, the activation and migration of neutrophils, and the degree of lung injury. Moreover, neutrophil activation further promoted actomyosin assembly and aggravated lung injury. Conclusively, the enhancement of self-organized actomyosin contributes to alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and neutrophil recruitment in inflammatory response, which is a potential therapeutic target for ALI.-Chen, B., Yang, Z., Yang, C., Qin, W., Gu, J., Hu, C., Chen, A., Ning, J., Yi, B., Lu, K.

Genetic selection on this gene within appropriate breeding programs may contribute to the control of the disease. The present study characterized the genetic profile of codons 146, 211 and 222 in three dairy goat breeds in Greece. A total of 766 dairy goats from seven farms were used. Animals belonged to two indigenous Greek, Eghoria (n = 264) and Skopelos (n = 287) and a foreign breed, Damascus (n = 215). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples from individual animals. Polymorphisms were detected in these codons using Real-Time PCR analysis and four different Custom TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays. Genotypic, allelic and haplotypic frequencies were calculated based on individual animal genotypes. Chi-square tests were used to examine Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium state and compare genotypic distribution across breeds. Genetic distances among the three breeds, and between these and 30 breeds reared in other countries were estimated based on haplotypic frequencies using fixation index FST with Arlequin v3.1 software; a Neighbor-Joining tree was created using PHYLIP package v3.695. Level of statistical significance was set at P = 0.01. All scrapie resistance-associated alleles (146S, 146D, 211Q and 222K) were detected in the studied population. Significant frequency differences were observed between the indigenous Greek and Damascus breeds. Alleles 222K and 146S had the highest frequency in the two indigenous and the Damascus breed, respectively (ca. 6.0%). The studied breeds shared similar haplotypic frequencies with most South Italian and Turkish breeds but differed significantly from North-Western European, Far East and some USA goat breeds. Results suggest there is adequate variation in the PRNP gene locus to support breeding programs for enhanced scrapie resistance in goats reared in Greece. Genetic comparisons among goat breeds indicate that separate breeding programs should apply to the two indigenous and the imported Damascus breeds."

Adult female schistosomes produce numerous eggs that are responsible for the pathogenesis and transmission of the disease, and the maturation of female gonads depends on the permanent pairing of females and males. Signaling protein kinases have been proven to control female gonad differentiation after pairing; however, little is known about the roles of protein phosphatases in the developmental and reproductive biology of schistosomes. Here we explored 3 genes encoding catalytic subunits of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) that were structurally and evolutionarily conserved in Schistosoma japonicum. In situ hybridization showed transcripts of 3 Sj-pp1c genes mainly localized in the reproductive organs and tissues. Triple knockdown of Sj-pp1c genes by RNA interference caused stunted growth and decreased pairing stability of worm pairs, as well as a remarkable reduction in cell proliferation activity and defects in reproductive maturation and fecundity. Transcriptomic analysis post–RNA interference suggested that Sj-pp1c genes are involved in controlling worm development and maturation mainly by regulating cell proliferation, eggshell synthesis, nutritional metabolism, cytoskeleton organization, and neural process.

However, limited information is available about the development of pneumonitis associated with this treatment in clinical practice. This study aimed to characterize this form of pneumonitis and identify the risk factors for its onset. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 44 patients with gastric cancer who received combination treatment with ramucirumab and paclitaxel from 2016 to 2017. Then, the clinicopathological characteristics of patients who developed treatment-related pneumonitis were evaluated and further compared with those of patients who did not. Results Six patients (13.6%) developed pneumonitis within five treatment cycles, and in five cases, remission was observed after cessation of combination treatment alone. The onset of pneumonitis was independently associated with pre-existing interstitial lung disease (ILD) (p = 0.025; odds ratio = 206.4). Patients with pneumonitis showed reduced time to treatment failure (median 56 vs. 138 days; p = 0.008), as compared with those without pneumonitis. Most patients with pre-existing ILD with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern developed pneumonitis. Conclusions In clinical practice, pneumonitis associated with the combination treatment of ramucirumab and paclitaxel was generally mild, but common. Patients with gastric cancer with pre-existing ILD, particularly those presenting with a UIP pattern, undergoing this combination treatment, should be carefully monitored for the development of treatment-related pneumonitis."

In this study, we performed systematic liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolic profiling coupled with antioxidant assays for indigenous plant family extracts. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of LC-MS datasets for the extracts of 34 plant species belonging to the families Aceraceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae showed that these species were clustered according to their respective phylogenies. In particular, seven Aceraceae species were clearly demarcated with higher average antioxidant activities, rationalizing their application for bioconversion studies. On the basis of further evaluation of the interspecies variability of metabolic profiles and antioxidant activities among Aceraceae family plants, we found that Acer tataricum (TA) extracts were clearly distinguished from those of other species, with a higher relative abundance of tannin derivatives. Further, we detected a strong positive correlation between most tannin derivatives and the observed higher antioxidant activities. Following Aspergillus oryzae-mediated fermentative bioconversion of Acer plant extracts, we observed a time-correlated (0-8 days) linear increase in antioxidant phenotypes for all species, with TA having the highest activity. Temporal analysis of the MS data revealed tannin bioconversion mechanisms with a relatively higher abundance of gallic acid (m/z 169) accumulated at the end of 8 days, particularly in TA. Similarly, quercetin precursor (glycoside) metabolites were also transformed to quercetin aglycones (m/z 301) in most Acer plant extracts. The present study underscores the efficacy of fermentative bioconversion strategies aimed at enhancing the quality and availability of bioactive metabolites from plant extracts."

Now, with a 20-point lead in the polls, she seems set to become mayor of this city of nearly 9 million people in elections on 1 July. Her work on energy science and engineering—with a focus on vehicle emissions and climate change mitigation—is respected both in Mexico and abroad, and she9s a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and a former member of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Many say she9s uniquely positioned to understand and tackle the myriad problems that afflict the 20 million people in the city9s metropolitan area, especially its stuffed-to-the-gills public transportation, epic traffic snarls, and worsening water crisis. Meanwhile, critics worry about Sheinbaum Pardo9s close ties with Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist populist and the leading candidate in Mexico9s presidential election."

War with Spain prevented speedy resupply of the colony—the first English settlement in the New World, backed by Elizabethan courtier Sir Walter Raleigh. When a search-and-rescue mission arrived 3 years later, the town was abandoned and the colonists had vanished. Despite more than a century of intensive digging, no trace has been found of the colonists9 town—only the remains of a small workshop and an earthen fort that, according to a study to be published later this year, may have been built after what is commonly called the Lost Colony. Now, after a long hiatus, archaeologists plan to resume digging this fall, hoping to find the colonists9 abandoned town and learn more about early English ventures into the New World."

Astronomers have long had evidence of baby black holes with masses of no more than tens of suns, and of million- or billion-solar-mass behemoths lurking at the centers of galaxies. But middle-size ones, weighing thousands or tens of thousands of suns, seemed to be missing. Their absence forced theorists to propose that supermassive black holes didn9t grow gradually by slowly consuming matter, but somehow emerged as ready-made giants. Now, astronomers appear to have located some missing middleweights. An international team has scoured an archive of galaxy spectra and found more than 300 small galaxies that have the signature of intermediate mass black holes in their cores, opening new questions for theorists."
