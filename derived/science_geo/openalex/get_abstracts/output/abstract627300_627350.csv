https://openalex.org/W2912696928,"A better understanding of the features that define the interaction between cancer cells and immune cells is important for the development of new cancer therapies1. However, focus is often given to interactions that occur within the primary tumour and its microenvironment, whereas the role of immune cells during cancer dissemination in patients remains largely uncharacterized2,3. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are precursors of metastasis in several types of cancer4–6, and are occasionally found within the bloodstream in association with non-malignant cells such as white blood cells (WBCs)7,8. The identity and function of these CTC-associated WBCs, as well as the molecular features that define the interaction between WBCs and CTCs, are unknown. Here we isolate and characterize individual CTC-associated WBCs, as well as corresponding cancer cells within each CTC–WBC cluster, from patients with breast cancer and from mouse models. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to show that in the majority of these cases, CTCs were associated with neutrophils. When comparing the transcriptome profiles of CTCs associated with neutrophils against those of CTCs alone, we detect a number of differentially expressed genes that outline cell cycle progression, leading to more efficient metastasis formation. Further, we identify cell–cell junction and cytokine–receptor pairs that define CTC–neutrophil clusters, representing key vulnerabilities of the metastatic process. Thus, the association between neutrophils and CTCs drives cell cycle progression within the bloodstream and expands the metastatic potential of CTCs, providing a rationale for targeting this interaction in treatment of breast cancer. The authors show that circulating tumour cells can be found in association with neutrophils, an interaction which supports their proliferation and their ability to seed metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2911349862,"There is growing evidence that tumour neoantigens have important roles in generating spontaneous antitumour immune responses and predicting clinical responses to immunotherapies1,2. Despite the presence of numerous neoantigens in patients, complete tumour elimination is rare, owing to failures in mounting a sufficient and lasting antitumour immune response3,4. Here we show that durable neoantigen-specific immunity is regulated by mRNA N6-methyadenosine (m6A) methylation through the m6A-binding protein YTHDF15. In contrast to wild-type mice, Ythdf1-deficient mice show an elevated antigen-specific CD8+ T cell antitumour response. Loss of YTHDF1 in classical dendritic cells enhanced the cross-presentation of tumour antigens and the cross-priming of CD8+ T cells in vivo. Mechanistically, transcripts encoding lysosomal proteases are marked by m6A and recognized by YTHDF1. Binding of YTHDF1 to these transcripts increases the translation of lysosomal cathepsins in dendritic cells, and inhibition of cathepsins markedly enhances cross-presentation of wild-type dendritic cells. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 checkpoint blockade is enhanced in Ythdf1-/- mice, implicating YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target in anticancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2911642321,"Retrotransposable elements are deleterious at many levels, and the failure of host surveillance systems for these elements can thus have negative consequences. However, the contribution of retrotransposon activity to ageing and age-associated diseases is not known. Here we show that during cellular senescence, L1 (also known as LINE-1) retrotransposable elements become transcriptionally derepressed and activate a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response. The IFN-I response is a phenotype of late senescence and contributes to the maintenance of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The IFN-I response is triggered by cytoplasmic L1 cDNA, and is antagonized by inhibitors of the L1 reverse transcriptase. Treatment of aged mice with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine downregulated IFN-I activation and age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) in several tissues. We propose that the activation of retrotransposons is an important component of sterile inflammation that is a hallmark of ageing, and that L1 reverse transcriptase is a relevant target for the treatment of age-associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2912171584,"Despite intense interest in expanding chemical space, libraries containing hundreds-of-millions to billions of diverse molecules have remained inaccessible. Here we investigate structure-based docking of 170 million make-on-demand compounds from 130 well-characterized reactions. The resulting library is diverse, representing over 10.7 million scaffolds that are otherwise unavailable. For each compound in the library, docking against AmpC β-lactamase (AmpC) and the D4 dopamine receptor were simulated. From the top-ranking molecules, 44 and 549 compounds were synthesized and tested for interactions with AmpC and the D4 dopamine receptor, respectively. We found a phenolate inhibitor of AmpC, which revealed a group of inhibitors without known precedent. This molecule was optimized to 77 nM, which places it among the most potent non-covalent AmpC inhibitors known. Crystal structures of this and other AmpC inhibitors confirmed the docking predictions. Against the D4 dopamine receptor, hit rates fell almost monotonically with docking score, and a hit-rate versus score curve predicted that the library contained 453,000 ligands for the D4 dopamine receptor. Of 81 new chemotypes discovered, 30 showed submicromolar activity, including a 180-pM subtype-selective agonist of the D4 dopamine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2913095286,"Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid metabolism1,2 that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty acid metabolism and, in particular, fatty acid desaturation3. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty acid metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty acid desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty acid sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty acid desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty acid desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2914023611,"Government policies currently commit us to surface warming of three to four degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which will lead to enhanced ice-sheet melt. Ice-sheet discharge was not explicitly included in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, so effects on climate from this melt are not currently captured in the simulations most commonly used to inform governmental policy. Here we show, using simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets constrained by satellite-based measurements of recent changes in ice mass, that increasing meltwater from Greenland will lead to substantial slowing of the Atlantic overturning circulation, and that meltwater from Antarctica will trap warm water below the sea surface, creating a positive feedback that increases Antarctic ice loss. In our simulations, future ice-sheet melt enhances global temperature variability and contributes up to 25 centimetres to sea level by 2100. However, uncertainties in the way in which future changes in ice dynamics are modelled remain, underlining the need for continued observations and comprehensive multi-model assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2884325170,"Superconducting circuits are a competitive platform for quantum computation because they offer controllability, long coherence times and strong interactions-properties that are essential for the study of quantum materials comprising microwave photons. However, intrinsic photon losses in these circuits hinder the realization of quantum many-body phases. Here we use superconducting circuits to explore strongly correlated quantum matter by building a Bose-Hubbard lattice for photons in the strongly interacting regime. We develop a versatile method for dissipative preparation of incompressible many-body phases through reservoir engineering and apply it to our system to stabilize a Mott insulator of photons against losses. Site- and time-resolved readout of the lattice allows us to investigate the microscopic details of the thermalization process through the dynamics of defect propagation and removal in the Mott phase. Our experiments demonstrate the power of superconducting circuits for studying strongly correlated matter in both coherent and engineered dissipative settings. In conjunction with recently demonstrated superconducting microwave Chern insulators, we expect that our approach will enable the exploration of topologically ordered phases of matter."

https://openalex.org/W2911750130,"Predictions for sea-level rise this century due to melt from Antarctica range from zero to more than one metre. The highest predictions are driven by the controversial marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) hypothesis, which assumes that coastal ice cliffs can rapidly collapse after ice shelves disintegrate, as a result of surface and sub-shelf melting caused by global warming. But MICI has not been observed in the modern era and it remains unclear whether it is required to reproduce sea-level variations in the geological past. Here we quantify ice-sheet modelling uncertainties for the original MICI study and show that the probability distributions are skewed towards lower values (under very high greenhouse gas concentrations, the most likely value is 45 centimetres). However, MICI is not required to reproduce sea-level changes due to Antarctic ice loss in the mid-Pliocene epoch, the last interglacial period or 1992–2017; without it we find that the projections agree with previous studies (all 95th percentiles are less than 43 centimetres). We conclude that previous interpretations of these MICI projections over-estimate sea-level rise this century; because the MICI hypothesis is not well constrained, confidence in projections with MICI would require a greater range of observationally constrained models of ice-shelf vulnerability and ice-cliff collapse. By better quantifying uncertainties for marine ice-cliff instability, future Antarctic ice loss is predicted to be much lower than previously estimated."

https://openalex.org/W2914051310,"Cytosolic DNA triggers innate immune responses through the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and production of the cyclic dinucleotide second messenger 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)1-4. 2',3'-cGAMP is a potent inducer of immune signalling; however, no intracellular nucleases are known to cleave 2',3'-cGAMP and prevent the activation of the receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING)5-7. Here we develop a biochemical screen to analyse 24 mammalian viruses, and identify poxvirus immune nucleases (poxins) as a family of 2',3'-cGAMP-degrading enzymes. Poxins cleave 2',3'-cGAMP to restrict STING-dependent signalling and deletion of the poxin gene (B2R) attenuates vaccinia virus replication in vivo. Crystal structures of vaccinia virus poxin in pre- and post-reactive states define the mechanism of selective 2',3'-cGAMP degradation through metal-independent cleavage of the 3'-5' bond, converting 2',3'-cGAMP into linear Gp[2'-5']Ap[3']. Poxins are conserved in mammalian poxviruses. In addition, we identify functional poxin homologues in the genomes of moths and butterflies and the baculoviruses that infect these insects. Baculovirus and insect host poxin homologues retain selective 2',3'-cGAMP degradation activity, suggesting an ancient role for poxins in cGAS-STING regulation. Our results define poxins as a family of 2',3'-cGAMP-specific nucleases and demonstrate a mechanism for how viruses evade innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2912191120,"Small molecules containing the N-nitroso group, such as the bacterial natural product streptozotocin, are prominent carcinogens1,2 and important cancer chemotherapeutics3,4. Despite the considerable importance of this functional group to human health, enzymes dedicated to the assembly of the N-nitroso unit have not been identified. Here we show that SznF, a metalloenzyme from the biosynthesis of streptozotocin, catalyses an oxidative rearrangement of the guanidine group of Nω-methyl-L-arginine to generate an N-nitrosourea product. Structural characterization and mutagenesis of SznF reveal two separate active sites that promote distinct steps in this transformation using different iron-containing metallocofactors. This biosynthetic reaction, which has little precedent in enzymology or organic synthesis, expands the catalytic capabilities of non-haem-iron-dependent enzymes to include N-N bond formation. We find that biosynthetic gene clusters that encode SznF homologues are widely distributed among bacteria-including environmental organisms, plant symbionts and human pathogens-which suggests an unexpectedly diverse and uncharacterized microbial reservoir of bioactive N-nitroso metabolites."

https://openalex.org/W2912027453,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a fibrotic stroma with a poor lymphocyte infiltrate, in part driven by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs, which express fibroblast activation protein (FAP), contribute to immune escape via exclusion of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells from cancer cells, upregulation of immune checkpoint ligand expression, immunosuppressive cytokine production, and polarization of tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells. FAP is a post-proline peptidase selectively expressed during tissue remodeling and repair, such as with wound healing, and in the tumor microenvironment by cancer-associated fibroblasts. We targeted FAP function using a novel small molecule inhibitor, UAMC-1110, and mice with germline knockout of FAP and concomitant knock-in of E. coli beta-galactosidase. We depleted CAFs by adoptive transfer of anti-βgal T cells into the FAP knockout animals. Established syngeneic pancreatic tumors in immune competent mice were targeted with these 3 strategies, followed by focal radiotherapy to the tumor. FAP loss was associated with improved antigen-specific tumor T cell infiltrate and enhanced collagen deposition. However, FAP targeting alone or with tumor-directed radiation did not improve survival even when combined with anti-PD1 therapy. Targeting of CAFs alone or in combination with radiation did not improve survival. We conclude that targeting FAP and CAFs in combination with radiation is capable of enhancing anti-tumor T cell infiltrate and function, but does not result in sufficient tumor clearance to extend survival."
https://openalex.org/W2913590313,"The ability of cytoskeletal motors to move unidirectionally along filamentous tracks is central to their role in cargo transport, motility and cell division. Kinesin and myosin motor families have a subclass that moves towards the opposite end of the microtubule or actin filament with respect to the rest of the motor family1,2, whereas all dynein motors that have been studied so far exclusively move towards the minus end of the microtubule3. Guided by cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we sought to understand the mechanism that underpins the directionality of dynein by engineering a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dynein that is directed towards the plus end of the microtubule. Here, using single-molecule assays, we show that elongation or shortening of the coiled-coil stalk that connects the motor to the microtubule controls the helical directionality of dynein around microtubules. By changing the length and angle of the stalk, we successfully reversed the motility towards the plus end of the microtubule. These modifications act by altering the direction in which the dynein linker swings relative to the microtubule, rather than by reversing the asymmetric unbinding of the motor from the microtubule. Because the length and angle of the dynein stalk are fully conserved among species, our findings provide an explanation for why all dyneins move towards the minus end of the microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W2912805361,"Stress can impair cognitive performance, as commonly observed in cognitive performance anxiety (CPA; e.g., test anxiety). Cognitive theories indicate that stress impairs performance by increasing attention to negative thoughts, a phenomenon also known as threat-interference. These theories are mainly supported by findings related to self-report measures of threat-interference or trait anxiety. Our main aim was to test, for the first time in a single study, the hypotheses that acute CPA-related stress negatively affects both working memory (WM) performance and objectively assessed threat-interference during performance. In addition, we aimed to assess the validity of a new stress-induction procedure that was developed to induce acute CPA. Eighty-six females were randomly assigned to a CPA-related stress group (n = 45) or a control group. WM performance and threat-interference were assessed with an n-back task (2-back and 3-back memory loads), using CPA-related words as distracters. The stress group showed higher state anxiety and slower WM performance. Both effects were moderated by trait CPA: the effects were stronger for individuals with higher trait CPA. Finally, trait CPA moderated the effect of stress on threat-interference during higher cognitive load: individuals with higher trait CPA in the stress group showed higher threat-interference. We conclude that acute CPA increases threat-interference and impairs WM performance, especially in vulnerable individuals. The role of threat-interference, cognitive load, and trait anxiety should be taken into account in future research. Finally, our method (combining our stressor and modified n-back task) is effective for studying stress-cognition interactions in CPA."
https://openalex.org/W2912950195,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme that generates the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). We generated mice with global inducible post-natal inactivation or adipose-specific loss of the Enpp2 gene encoding ATX. The animals are phenotypically unremarkable and exhibit differences in adipocyte size and adipose tissue expression of inflammatory genes after high fat feeding without gross differences in fat distribution or body mass. Surprisingly, both models of Enpp2- deficiency exhibited marked protection from high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. This phenotype was not associated with differences in dietary fat absorption but may be accounted for by differences in hepatic expression of genes involved in de novo synthesis of triglycerides. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ATX might be protective against hepatic steatosis."

There are limited studies about maternal satisfaction with labor and delivery care services in Ethiopia and particularly in the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to better understand client satisfaction on existing labor and delivery care service and associated factors among mothers who gave birth in the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital, Ethiopia.This institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Referral Hospital. 593 mothers who gave birth between July and September 2016 were enrolled. Study participants were selected by systematic random sampling. A standardized, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive and summary statistics were performed. A linear regression model was fitted and variables having a P value of ≤0.05 in the multivariable model were considered statistically significant.Overall, 31.3% of mothers were satisfied by the existing labor and delivery care. Living in rural areas (-2.9%; 95% CI: -5.75,-0.12) and the presence of a co-morbidity (-3.2%; 95%CI:-5.70, -0.72) were the factor which have a negative influence on maternal satisfaction. On the other hand, travel time to reach to the hospital (hours) (0.79%; 95% CI: 0.07, 1.52), birth by episiotomy or assisted vaginal delivery (6.3%; 95%CI: 1.56, 11.04), and receiving cost-free maternal health services (6.66%; 95%CI: 3.31, 10.01) were the factors that had positive influence.The level of satisfaction of laboring mothers with the labor and delivery care services was poor. Rural residency and chronic medical co-morbidity were negatively associated with level of satisfaction while travel time, mode of delivery, and payment free delivery service had a statistically significant positive influence on satisfaction."

https://openalex.org/W2912806377,"Cotton is a commercial and economically important crop that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue worldwide. However, cotton yield is affected by a sap-sucking insect Bemisia tabaci (whitefly), and whitefly-borne cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD). The causative agent of devastating CLCuD is led by the viruses belonging to the genus Begomovirus (family Geminiviridae), collectively called cotton leaf curl viruses. Unfortunately, the extensively cultivated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) species are highly susceptible and vulnerable to CLCuD. Yet, the concomitant influence of whitefly and CLCuD on the susceptible G. hirsutum transcriptome has not been interpreted. In the present study we have employed an RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptomics approach to explore the differential gene expression in susceptible G. hirsutum variety upon infection with viruliferous whiteflies. Comparative RNA-Seq of control and CLCuD infected plants was done using Illumina HiSeq 2500. This study yielded 468 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among them, we identified 220 up and 248 downregulated DEGs involved in disease responses and pathogen defense. We selected ten genes for downstream RT-qPCR analyses on two cultivars, Karishma and MNH 786 that are susceptible to CLCuD. We observed a similar expression pattern of these genes in both susceptible cultivars that was also consistent with our transcriptome data further implying a wider application of our global transcription study on host susceptibility to CLCuD. We next performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis that revealed six modules. This analysis also identified highly co-expressed genes as well as 55 hub genes that co-express with ≥ 50 genes. Intriguingly, most of these hub genes are shown to be downregulated and enriched in cellular processes. Under-expression of such highly co-expressed genes suggests their roles in favoring the virus and enhancing plant susceptibility to CLCuD. We also discuss the potential mechanisms governing the establishment of disease susceptibility. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive differential gene expression analysis of G. hirsutum under whitefly-mediated CLCuD infection. This vital study will advance the understanding of simultaneous effect of whitefly and virus on their host and aid in identifying important G. hirsutum genes which intricate in its susceptibility to CLCuD."

To investigate free GPIs in cultured cell lines and mouse tissues, here we used the T5-4E10 mAb (T5 mAb), which recognizes unlinked GPIs having an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) side chain linked to the first mannose at the nonreducing terminus. We detected free GPIs bearing the GalNAc side chain on the surface of Neuro2a and CHO, but not of HEK293, K562, and C2C12 cells. Furthermore, free GPIs were present in mouse pons, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, testis, epididymis, and kidney. Using a panel of Chinese hamster ovary cells defective in both GPI-transamidase and GPI remodeling pathway, we demonstrate that free GPIs follow the same structural remodeling pathway during passage from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane as do protein-linked GPI. Specifically, free GPIs underwent post-GPI attachment to protein 1 (PGAP1)-mediated inositol deacylation, PGAP5-mediated removal of the ethanolamine phosphate from the second mannose, and PGAP3- and PGAP2-mediated fatty acid remodeling. Moreover, T5 mAb recognized free GPIs even if the inositol-linked acyl chain or ethanolamine-phosphate side chain linked to the second mannose is not removed.

https://openalex.org/W2914063806,"There has been increasing attention to understanding how laypeople explain disagreements among scientists. In this article, we evaluate the factorial validity and scale/item functioning of a Science Dispute Reasons scale (Study 1) and test specific hypotheses about demographic, individual difference, and topic-related variables that may explain why some reasons are perceived to be more likely than others (Study 2). The final scale included 17 items grouped into three reason factors (Process/Competence, Interests/Values, and Complexity/Uncertainty), which is largely consistent with previous research. We find a mixed pattern of global and specific impacts on reason likelihood ratings from a range of variables including political ideology and conspiracist ideation (primary mediated through perceived credibility of science), science knowledge, and topic-related variables such as knowledge of and care about the dispute in question. Overall, science dispute reasons appear to be more strongly driven by attitudes and worldviews as opposed to objective knowledge and skills.

https://openalex.org/W2913023906,"Repair of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a complex and emergent cardiovascular surgery that is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality. Each cannulation strategy has different benefits and drawbacks during cardiopulmonary bypass. Using a retrospective study design, we aimed to clarify the safety and efficacy of right axillary artery cannulation in combination with femoral artery cannulation compared to single arterial cannulation for ATAAD repair.From January 2007 to July 2017, 476 adult patients underwent ATAAD repair at a single institution. Patients were classified into groups according to their cannulation strategy: the double arterial cannulation (DAC) group (n = 377; 79.2%) or single arterial cannulation (SAC) group (n = 99; 20.8%). Preoperative demographics, surgical information, and postoperative recovery were compared between both groups. Survival and freedom from reoperation rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method.Demographics, comorbidities, and surgical procedures were generally homogenous between the two groups, except for sex, age, and rate of extensive aortic repair. Patients who underwent DAC had lower in-hospital mortality (13.5% vs. 25.3%; P = 0.005) and lower incidence of malperfusion-related complications (18.8% vs. 30.3%; P = 0.011) than those who underwent SAC. During multivariate analysis, SAC was identified as an in-hospital mortality predictor (odds ratio, 2.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-5.17; P = 0.001), as were preoperative ventilator support, intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation installation, and postoperative malperfusion-related complications. Three-year cumulative survival and freedom from reoperation rates were 74.8% and 85.3% for the DAC group and 62.6% and 81.1% for the SAC group, respectively (P = 0.010 and 0.430, respectively).With acceptable short- and mid-term outcomes, DAC is effective and safe for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass during ATAAD repair."
https://openalex.org/W2913679781,"Symmetry and topology play key roles in the identification of phases of matter and their properties. Both concepts are central to understanding quantum Hall ferromagnets (QHFMs), two-dimensional electronic phases with spontaneously broken spin or pseudospin symmetry whose wavefunctions also have topological properties. Domain walls between distinct broken symmetry QHFM phases are predicted to host gapless one-dimensional (1D) modes that emerge due to a topological change of the underlying electronic wavefunctions at such interfaces. Although a variety of QHFMs have been identified in different materials, probing interacting electronic modes at these domain walls has not yet been accomplished. Here we use a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to directly visualize the spontaneous formation of boundary modes, within a sign-changing topological gap, at domain walls between different valley-polarized quantum Hall phases on the surface of bismuth. By changing the valley occupation and the corresponding number of modes at the domain wall, we can realize different regimes where the valley-polarized channels are either metallic or develop a spectroscopic gap. This behavior is a consequence of Coulomb interactions constrained by the symmetry-breaking valley flavor, which determines whether electrons in the topological modes can backscatter, making these channels a unique class of interacting Luttinger liquids."

We investigated behavioral changes of predators and prey fish in sub-tropical “live-bottom” (sandstone) reefs at Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS), located 20 nautical miles off the coast of Georgia, USA, using fisheries acoustic methods in association with visual census and direct observation using SCUBA. Changes in co-location and habitat preferences of predators and prey over time throughout the diel cycle were investigated using species distribution models (MAXENT) based on habitat predictors and by means of spatial statistics. The results indicate that predator and prey distribution patterns changed considerably throughout the day. Prey and predator species exhibited complex spatial dynamics and behavior over diel periods, with prey modifying patterns of habitat use and spatial distribution, likely as a response of their interactions with predators. Crepuscular periods were confirmed to be the most active phases in terms of predator-prey interactions and consequently the most variable. The combination of tools and approaches used in this study provided valuable sources of information that support the inferences of predation risk-driven habitat selection of prey in this sub-tropical reef system."
https://openalex.org/W2950176030,"Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is a globally distributed pathogen that has been associated with pneumonia in both domestic and wild Caprinae. It is closely related to M. hyopneumoniae, a respiratory pathogen of swine that is associated with decreased growth rates of pigs as well as clinical respiratory disease. In order to assess the effects of M. ovipneumoniae on lamb performance, we generated a cohort of lambs free of M. ovipneumoniae by segregation of test negative ewes after lambing, then compared the growth and carcass quality traits of M. ovipneumoniae-free and -colonized lambs from weaning to harvest. Some signs of respiratory disease were observed during the feeding trial in both lamb groups, but the M. ovipneumoniae-exposed group included more affected lambs and higher average disease scores. At harvest, lungs of lambs in both groups showed few grossly visible lesions, although the M. ovipneumoniae-exposed group did exhibit increased microscopic lung lesions (P<0.05). In addition, M. ovipneumoniae exposed lambs produced lower average daily gains (P<0.05), and lower yield grade carcasses (P<0.05) compared to those of non-exposed lambs. The results demonstrated the feasibility of test and segregation for elimination of M. ovipneumoniae from groups of sheep and suggested that this pathogen may impair lamb growth and productivity even in the absence of overt respiratory disease."

COI1 and 13 subtypes of JAZ are encoded in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and 1 can induce PPI between COI1 and most JAZ subtypes to cause various physiological responses. However, the detailed physiological functions of these JAZ subtypes remain unclear, mainly due to the complexity of the JA-mediated signaling cascade, the genetic redundancy of JAZ genes, and signaling cross-talk with other phytohormones (8Chini A. Gimenez-Ibanez S. Goossens A. Solano R. Redundancy and specificity in jasmonate signalling.Curr. Opin.

In addition, functional compensation by other JAZ subtype in jaz knockout mutants cause difficulties in the functional analysis of each JAZ subtype (9Campos M.L. Yoshida Y.

The balance between redundant and specific mechanisms of JA signaling likely contributes to fine-tuning of the numerous JA-regulated responses and plant adaptation to the environment. Accordingly, practical chemical tools for the study of JA-mediated signaling cascades such as JAZ subtype–selective ligands are needed (13Takaoka Y. Iwahashi M. Chini A. Saito H. Ishimaru Y.

To discover such ligands, reliable and high-throughput in vitro assay systems of the ligands for all combinations of COI1–JAZ co-receptors must be prepared. One conventional method is the yeast two-hybrid system. Although capable of screening ligands against most combinations of COI1–JAZ co-receptors, false positives and negatives could also be found, in part due to the use of live yeast cells, the performance of which is affected by factors unrelated to binding affinity such as cell-penetration efficiency of the ligands and cell growth inhibition. In vitro or semi-in vivo pulldown assays can also be used for direct analyses for PPI between phytohormone co-receptors, although they are qualitative in nature and of low-throughput performance. Herein, we disclose a fluorescence anisotropy (FA)-based in vitro binding assay system for the ligands of COI1–JAZ co-receptors. FA has been widely used for the quantitative and high-throughput screening (HTS) of PPI inducers or inhibitors (14Milroy L.G. Grossmann T.N. Hennig S. Brunsveld L. Ottmann C.

Cancer. 2014; 14 (24622521): 248-26210.1038/nrc3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and by applying it to the assay system for COI1–JAZ co-receptors, quantitative analyses of the affinity values of endogenous JA derivatives covering almost all the combinations of COI1–JAZ co-receptors were achieved for the first time. Moreover, this system has a sufficiently good signal-to-noise ratio and is capable of mix-and-read assay, and thus is amenable to a plate reader-based assay of COI1-JAZ co-receptor agonists and antagonists. Short (27-amino-acid) peptide fragments composed of Jas motifs of a JAZ protein were previously found to be sufficient for co-receptor formation, and so we designed a fluorophore-conjugated JAZ peptide for PPI detection of COI1–JAZ co-receptors according to the previously reported crystal structure of COI1–1–JAZ1 complex (7Sheard L.B. Tan X. Mao H. Withers J. Ben-Nissan G. Hinds T.R. Kobayashi Y. Hsu F.F. Sharon M. Browse J. He S.Y. Rizo J. Howe G.A. Zheng N. Jasmonate perception by inositol-phosphate-potentiated COI1-JAZ co-receptor.Nature. 2010; 468 (20927106): 400-40510.1038/nature09430Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The conjugated peptide was composed of 27 amino acids (∼3,500 Da; Fig. S1), and Oregon Green (OG) was attached to the additional Cys on the N terminus of the Jas motif (OG-Cys-JAZ) (13Takaoka Y. Iwahashi M. Chini A. Saito H. Ishimaru Y. Egoshi S. Kato N. Tanaka M. Bashir K. Seki M. Solano R. Ueda M. A rationally designed JAZ subtype-selective agonist of jasmonate perception.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (30194307)365410.1038/s41467-018-06135-yCrossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a binding domain of JAZ proteins with COI1. The molecular masses of these conjugated peptides were significantly smaller than those of PPI complexes (Fig. 1b; ∼100 kDa), and thus a dramatic increase in FA can be expected upon formation of the COI1–ligand–JAZ peptide ternary complex (Fig. 1, b and c). Initially, in a proof-of-principle, positive control experiment, we observed the FA (r value) change of OG-Cys-JAZ1 and COI1-GST upon addition of coronatine (COR; 2), a functional mimic of JA-Ile and strong binder of COI1–JAZ co-receptor (16Ichihara A. Shiraishi K. Sato H. Sakamura S. Nishiyama K. Sakai R. Furusaki A. Matsumoto T. The structure of coronatine.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 636-63710.1021/ja00444a067Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1d, the r value was relatively low (∼0.092) when OG-Cys-JAZ1 and COI1-GST were dissolved but increased by 1.9-fold upon the addition of 2. In contrast, little or no anisotropy change was observed upon addition of ent2 as the negative control. Therefore, OG-Cys-JAZ1 can monitor the formation of COI1–2–JAZ ternary complex. We next sought to enhance the sensitivity of this assay system by examination of the structures of fluorescently labeled JAZ peptides, specifically (i) the position of the fluorophore (N or C terminus of the peptide), (ii) the linker structures between fluorophores and peptides, and (iii) the structures of the fluorophores (Figs. 2a and S2). In the case of JAZ1-Cys-OG, in which OG was introduced at the C terminus through Cys (Fig. 2b), almost no anisotropy change was observed upon addition of 2 (Fig. S3a), although 2 caused PPI between co-receptors, similar to the case of OG-Cys-JAZ1 (Fig. S3b), indicating that the fluorophore should be conjugated to the N-terminal position of the JAZ peptide. Next, we examined the effect of linker structure/length between OG and each N terminus of JAZ1 (OG-EG4, EG2-JAZ1, and OG-JAZ1) (Fig. 2b). It was found that the ratio of anisotropy change (r/r0 − 1) depended upon the linker length (without linker (OG-JAZ1; 1.8) > EG2 (1.0) > EG4 (0.7); Fig. 2c and S3, c and d) despite the fact that all peptides induced PPI with GST-COI1 (Fig. S3b). In particular, r values of the peptides having various linkers were similar (0.071–0.092), whereas those of the peptides in the presence of 2 and GST-COI1 decreased in proportion to the length of the linkers (OG-JAZ1 (0.22) > EG2 (0.16) > EG4 (0.12); Fig. 2c and S3, c and d). The difference in molecular weights of these peptides is insignificant compared with those of corresponding ternary complexes, and thus the differences in the r values of these peptides should be derived from the microenvironmental mobility of the fluorophore in the corresponding ternary complexes. We also designed two peptides bearing fluorescein (Fl) and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) instead of the original OG (Fl-JAZ1 and TMR-JAZ1; Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2d, the r values of all these peptides bearing GST-COI1 increased upon addition of 2 in a dose-dependent manner, and the ratios of anisotropy changes (r/r0 − 1) in Fl-JAZ1 and OG-JAZ1 were higher than that in TMR-JAZ1. The Fl-JAZ1 with GST-COI1 also showed no change in r values upon addition of ent2 as the negative control, and thus Fl-JAZ1 as well as original OG-N-Cys-JAZ1 specifically detected the agonist-induced PPI between COI1 and JAZ1. Overall, we found that Fl-JAZ1 as well as the original OG-N-Cys-JAZ1 worked well as novel FA-based sensors for COI1–JAZ co-receptor formation. In the following experiments, we used Fl-JAZ1 as it is less expensive to acquire. We next applied the FA-based sensing system to the quantitative analyses of the binding affinities of various natural jasmonate derivatives bearing COI1–JAZ co-receptors. From the saturation binding curve, the apparent Kd value of 2 with Fl-JAZ1 and GST-COI1 was calculated to be 5.0 nm (Fig. 3a). A sample of synthetic JA-Ile (3) containing (+)-7-iso-JA-l-Ile (1) and (−)-JA-l-Ilepure diastereomeric isomers in a 95:5 ratio (Fig. 3b) and purified bioactive stereoisomer (+)-7-iso-JA-l-Ile (1) also increased the r value in a dose-dependent manner. The Kd value of 1 was 29 nm, which is significantly lower than that of the mixture, 3 ((−)-JA-l-Ile; 824 nm), and these results are consistent with the previous report (4Fonseca S. Chini A. Hamberg M. Adie B. Porzel A. Kramell R. Miersch O. Wasternack C. Solano R. (+)-7-iso-Jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine is the endogenous bioactive jasmonate.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5 (19349968): 344-35010.1038/nchembio.161Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In contrast, little or no change was observed upon addition of either jasmonic acid (4) or 12-hydroxy-JA-l-Ile (5) (Figs. 3b and S5), which is consistent with previous reports, although the Kd values of 2 and 3 are almost a single order of magnitude lower than the reported values (48 nm for 2 and 18 μm for 3). Thirteen JAZ gene subtypes are coded in Arabidopsis; the Jas motifs of JAZ5 and -6 are identical, and JAZ7, -8, and -13 are expected to have no or weak affinity with COI1 because they lack a binding sequence (8Chini A. Gimenez-Ibanez S. Goossens A. Solano R. Redundancy and specificity in jasmonate signalling.Curr. Opin.

Thus, we prepared nine short peptides corresponding to the remaining subtypes (Fl-JAZs; Fig. S4) with Fl-JAZ13 as a negative control. Next, we applied this sensing system to evaluate the binding affinities of 2, 1, 3, 4, and 5 for all combinations of COI1 and 10 JAZ subtypes. As shown in Fig. 3c and with the except of Fl-JAZ13, 2 induced an increase in FA in the presence of GST-COI1 and the corresponding Fl-JAZ. The affinity values of 2 are summarized in Table 1 (see also Fig. S5), and those corresponding to JAZ1, -3, -6, and -10 are consistent with previous reports (7Sheard L.B. Tan X. Mao H. Withers J.

Although no affinity values of 2 have been reported for JAZ2, -4, -9, -11, and -12 with COI1, pulldown experiments demonstrated that 2 indeed caused PPI for these COI1–JAZ combinations, similar to the case of JAZ1 (Fig. S6). In the cases of 1, 3, and 5, the anisotropy was also increased in most combinations of COI1–JAZ co-receptors except for JAZ13. In contrast, little change was observed for 4 against all co-receptors (Table 1 and Fig. S5). Affinity values for 1, 3, 4, and 5 with any COI1–JAZ co-receptors were previously unreported, and so our results are the first quantitative analyses of the affinity of endogenous JA derivatives with most combinations of COI1–JAZ co-receptors. Interestingly, the measured affinity values for 1, 2, and 5 against each JAZ subtype were found to be weakly correlated (Fig. S7; correlation factor is 0.55 for 2 and 1, 0.72 for 2 and 5, and 0.72 for 1 and 5), indicating that the JAZ-subtype selectivity of these jasmonates is similar but not identical to each other.Table 1The Kd values of JA derivatives for all COI1–JAZ co-receptorsCOR (2)(+)-7-Iso-JA-l-Ile (1)(−)-JA-l-Ile (3)JA (4)12-OH-JA-l-Ile (5)ObtainedLiteraturenmnmnmnmJAZ1548aThe values have been previously reported (7, 17, 18).29824NDbND, the value could not be determined due to the low signal change.6,461JAZ21—cAlthough no value has been reported in the literature, COR-induced PPI was confirmed by another method.7759ND4,824JAZ3720aThe values have been previously reported (7, 17, 18).11681ND3,337JAZ46—cAlthough no value has been reported in the literature, COR-induced PPI was confirmed by another method.251,724ND9,234JAZ5/61668aThe values have been previously reported (7, 17, 18).341,660ND24,054JAZ90.5—cAlthough no value has been reported in the literature, COR-induced PPI was confirmed by another method.10608ND1,187JAZ1067aThe values have been previously reported (7, 17, 18).71,471ND3,635JAZ114—cAlthough no value has been reported in the literature, COR-induced PPI was confirmed by another method.13616ND8,886JAZ124—cAlthough no value has been reported in the literature, COR-induced PPI was confirmed by another method.8768ND2,821JAZ13ND—dPPI induction has not been reported.NDNDNDNDa The values have been previously reported (7Sheard L.B.

Therefore, our FA-based binding assay system is amenable to the plate reader-based HTS of COI1–JAZ co-receptor agonists. Our FA-based binding assay systems can also evaluate antagonists for COI1–JAZ by monitoring the disassembly of the ternary complex. Previously developed a rationally designed antagonist, coronatine O-methyloxime (COR-MO; 6; Fig. 4a), of COI1–JAZ co-receptor based on a crystallographic structure of the ternary complex (20Delete in proof.Google Scholar), and thus a proof-of-principle experiment could be carried out using COR-MO as a positive control. Initially, the COI1–(+)-7-iso-JA-l-Ile (1)–Fl-JAZ1 ternary complex was prepared in a similar manner to that described above (Fig. 4b). The r value of this ternary complex was found to decrease upon addition of 6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4b), indicating that 6 disrupted the formation of the COI1–1–Fl-JAZ1 ternary complex and released the small peptide Fl-JAZ1 into solution. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6 was 1.92 μm, which was consistent with the literature value (IC50) of 0.43–1.53 μm. An inhibitory effect of 6 on COI1–1–Fl-JAZ1 was further confirmed by our HTS system with plate reader equipment (Fig. 4c). These results clearly exemplify the utility of our HTS system for the screening of the COI1–JAZ antagonists. Coronatine (2) has been considered as a structural and biological mimic of JA-Ile (1), but several researchers have claimed it to have a broader range of functions that includes rapid chlorosis and plant defense responses in both COI1–JAZ-dependent and -independent manners (21Uppalapati S.R.

Our quantitative analyses of 2 and bioactive hormone (+)-7-iso-JA-l-Ile (1) for the co-receptors suggested that their JAZ-subtype selectivities were obviously different; that is, affinity values of 1 and 2 for each JAZ subtype were weakly correlated (Fig. S7; the correlation factor is 0.55), providing a possible explanation for the differences in bioactivities of 1 and 2, at least in vitro. Although several synthetic jasmonates derivatives have been developed, their structure–activity relationship profiles have been mainly collected from whole-plant bioassays (24Jimenez-Aleman G.H. Machado R.A.R. Baldwin I.T. Boland W. JA-Ile-macrolactones uncouple growth and defense in wild tobacco.Org. Biomol.

In contrast, our binding assay system for the quantitative assessment of ligand-subtype selectivity will provide new insights into not only the mode of action of these derivatives but also the biological role of each JAZ subtype. Other phytohormones such as auxin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid also act as PPI inducers for the corresponding co-receptors, of which there are various subtypes with high genetic redundancy (25Santner A.

One advantage of the FA-based assay is that it is “mix-and-read”: all the components of the assay can be mixed prior to compound administration and read out directly, allowing for the rapid HTS assay of various ligands simultaneously. Also, fluorescent probes are used in rather low concentrations (50–100 nm in this case, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio or ligand affinity), and its miniaturization into sample uncoated microplates, which saves biological materials (proteins or peptides) and compounds by simple reduction of the assay volume, is relatively straightforward and results in costs per well that are lower than for SPR or other biomolecule immobilization–based PPI detection methods (AlphaScreen or biolayer interferometry).

This is a slow process that begins in kindergarten: at this age, writing is very similar to drawing (i.e. scribbles); from there, it takes several years before children are able to write competently. Many studies support the idea that motor training plays a crucial role to increase mental representations of the letters, but relatively little is known about the specific relation between handwriting skills and teaching practices. This study investigated the efficacy of cursive writing teaching. The sample comprised 141 students attending eight classes of the first grade of primary school, all with typical development, not exhibiting any cognitive or sensory disabilities, nor displaying motor disorders that could significantly hinder the execution of the writing task. We tested whether the development of academic writing skills could be effectively supported by training strategies focusing on cursive writing. All rules and characteristics of the letters were explained by demonstrating the correct writing movements, based on the idea that movement learning becomes more valuable when children begin to connect the letters in order to write individual words. Growth models on pre-, post- and follow-up measures showed that performance on prerequisites and writing and reading skills were better overall among the children in the intervention group as compared to control group."

Although skipping breakfast is associated with depressive symptoms in adolescents, the effects of dietary patterns on their depressive symptoms remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether dietary patterns are associated with depressive symptoms among junior and senior high school students in Japan. A total of 441 junior high school students and 417 senior high school students participated in this study. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was used to measure the participants’ depressive symptoms. We surveyed the participants’ breakfast consumption pattern, as well as their general dietary patterns (meat, fish, green and yellow vegetables, milk and dairy products, and fruits), using a self-report questionnaire. The results indicated that the senior high school students had a significantly higher CES-D score than the junior high school students. We found negative and significant partial correlations between regular consumption of breakfast and depressive symptoms, and between regular consumption of green and yellow vegetables and depressive symptoms in both junior and senior high school students, after controlling for age, sex, and sleep duration. Furthermore, a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that adolescents who consumed green and yellow vegetables every day (one or more times per day) had significantly lower depressive symptoms than those from the “Never/1–2 times a week” group. The findings of this study reveal that the regular consumption of green and yellow vegetables is associated with lower depressive symptoms in adolescents, that is, the consumption of green and yellow vegetables may be vital in the context of adolescents’ mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2911409140,"Liver regeneration depends on sequential activation of pathways and cells involving the remaining organ in recovery of mass. Proliferation of parenchyma is dependent on angiogenesis. Understanding liver regeneration-associated neovascularization may be useful for development of clinical interventions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote tumor angiogenesis and play a role in developmental processes that necessitate rapid vascularization. We therefore hypothesized that the MDSCs could play a role in liver regeneration. Following partial hepatectomy, MDSCs were enriched within regenerating livers, and their depletion led to increased liver injury and postoperative mortality, reduced liver weights, decreased hepatic vascularization, reduced hepatocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, and aberrant liver function. Gene expression profiling of regenerating liver-derived MDSCs demonstrated a large-scale transcriptional response involving key pathways related to angiogenesis. Functionally, enhanced reactive oxygen species production and angiogenic capacities of regenerating liver-derived MDSCs were confirmed. A comparative analysis revealed that the transcriptional response of MDSCs during liver regeneration resembled that of peripheral blood MDSCs during progression of abdominal tumors, suggesting a common MDSC gene expression profile promoting angiogenesis. In summary, our study shows that MDSCs contribute to early stages of liver regeneration possibly by exerting proangiogenic functions using a unique transcriptional program.-Nachmany, I., Bogoch, Y., Sivan, A., Amar, O., Bondar, E., Zohar, N., Yakubovsky, O., Fainaru, O., Klausner, J.

However, IVIM imaging at low b-values is a persistent problem. This paper aims to investigate in a systematic and detailed manner how the number of low b-values influences the estimation of IVIM parameters. To this end, diffusion-weighted (DW) data with different low b-values were simulated to get insight into the distributions of subsequent IVIM parameters. Then, in vivo DW data with different numbers of low b-values and different number of excitations (NEX) were acquired. Finally, least-squares (LSQ) and Bayesian shrinkage prior (BSP) fitting methods were implemented to estimate IVIM parameters. The influence of the number of low b-values on IVIM parameters was analyzed in terms of relative error (RE) and structural similarity (SSIM). The results showed that the influence of the number of low b-values on IVIM parameters is variable. LSQ is more dependent on the number of low b-values than BSP, but the latter is more sensitive to noise."

Ideally, such research should be conducted on human subjects. However, due to ethical considerations, animals such as rodents and monkeys are used as alternatives. Among these alternative models, non-human primates are preferred because of their similarities with humans. The small South American common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) may offer several advantages over other non-human primates in terms of its smaller size, shorter life-span, and dental anatomy identical to humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the viability of using the marmoset as a human oral disease model. We collected saliva samples from eight marmosets and eight human subjects. Prokaryotic DNA was extracted from the saliva samples, and 16S bacterial rRNA gene sequencing was performed on each of the samples. Our results indicated that the types of oral microbiomes detected among human and marmoset samples were nearly indistinguishable. In contrast, the oral microbiomes of our human and marmoset subjects were distinctly different from those reported for rats and dogs, which are currently popular research animals. The oral microbiomes of marmosets showed greater diversity than those of humans. However, the oral microbiota of marmosets exhibited less variation than those of humans, which may be attributed to the fact that the marmoset subjects were kept in a controlled environment with identical lifestyles. The characteristics of its oral microbiota, combined with other technical advantages, suggest that the marmoset may provide the best animal model thus far for the study of oral health. This study characterized the oral microbes of the marmoset, thereby providing information to support future application of the marmoset as a model for age-related oral disease."

The present study attempts to understand the adaptive reproduction of this crab living in an extreme environment by examining its spatial and temporal distribution and isotopic signatures. The seasonal variation of the female-male ratio suggests that ovigerous females may migrate from beneath the vent orifice to the vent-periphery region to release their larvae to avoid the larvae contacting high toxic plumes, and then returns to the vent orifice habitat. We used variation of the isotopic crab signatures as indicators for this unique female migration. Our results showed that this vent crab evolved an adaptive modulation of reproductive behavior to successfully survive and propagate in an oceanic shallow hydrothermal vent field."

River-resident larval sea lamprey metamorphose into juveniles and migrate from their larval stream habitats in fall through spring, but diel timing of this migratory behavior is not well understood. Diel activity was determined for newly metamorphosed sea lamprey using day/night net sampling and passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry in two natural streams and PIT telemetry in an artificial stream. Downstream migration was primarily nocturnal in all studies. All but one of 372 sea lamprey were captured during night sampling in the day/night net collections and all detections (N = 56) for the in-stream PIT telemetry occurred within a few hours after sunset. Most (81% of 48) tagged lamprey moved downstream during the first night following release and moved at speeds consistent with observed water velocities. During long-term observation of behavior in the artificial stream most sea lamprey movement occurred during the night with limited occurrence of movement during daylight hours. Understanding seasonal and diel timing of downstream migration behavior may allow more effective management of sea lamprey for both conservation and control."

In Bacillus subtilis uracil can be removed from DNA by the uracil DNA-glycosylase through the base excision repair pathway. Genetic evidence suggests that B. subtilis YwqL, a homolog of Endonuclease-V (EndoV), acts on a wider spectrum of deaminated bases but the factors that complete this pathway have remained elusive. Here, we report that a purified His6-YwqL (hereafter BsEndoV) protein had in vitro endonuclease activity against double-stranded DNAs containing a single uracil (U), hypoxanthine (Hx), xanthine (X) or an AP site. Interestingly, while BsEndoV catalyzed a single strand break at the second phosphodiester bond towards the 3'-end of the U and AP lesions, there was an additional cleavage of the phosphodiester bond preceding the Hx and X lesions. Remarkably, the repair event initiated by BsEndoV on Hx and X, was completed by a recombinant B. subtilis His6-DNA polymerase A (BsPolA), but not on BsEndoV-processed U and AP lesions. For the latter lesions a second excision event performed by a recombinant B. subtilis His6-ExoA (BsExoA) was necessary before completion of their repair by BsPolA. These results suggest the existence of a novel alternative excision repair pathway in B. subtilis that counteracts the genotoxic effects of base deamination. The presence of this novel pathway in vivo in B. subtilis was also supported by analysis of effects of single or multiple deletions of exoA, endoV and polA on spontaneous mutations in growing cells, and the sensitivity of growing wild-type and mutant cells to a DNA deaminating agent."

The burden of common genetic variants was measured as aggregated genetic risk scores (GRS) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered in genome-wide association studies.Self-reported familial CAD (prevalent in 41% of the sample) was associated with -3.2 years (95% confidence interval -4.5, -2.2, p<0.0001) earlier need of revascularization in sex-adjusted models. Patients with and without familial CAD had similar mean values of CAD-GRS (unweighted scores 68.4 vs. 68.0, p = 0.10, weighted scores 67.7 vs. 67.5, p = 0.49) and LDL-C-GRS (unweighted scores 58.5 vs. 58.3, p = 0.34, weighted scores 63.3 vs. 61.1, p = 0.41). The correlation between the CAD-GRS and LDL-C-GRS was low (r = 0.14, p<0.001). In multivariable adjusted regression models, each 1 standard deviation higher values of LDL-C-GRS and CAD-GRS were associated with -0.70 years (95% confidence interval -1.25, -0.14, p = 0.014) and -0.51 years (-1.07, 0.04, p = 0.07) earlier need for revascularization, respectively.Young individuals presenting with CAD requiring surgical interventions had a higher genetic burden of SNPs relating to LDL-C and CAD (although the latter was statistically non-significant), compared with older individuals. However, the absolute difference was modest, suggesting that genetic screening can currently not be used as an effective prediction tool of when in life a person will develop CAD. Whether undiscovered genetic variants can still explain a ""missing heritability"" in early-onset CAD warrants more research."

The primary outcome, undiagnosed diabetes, was based on an oral glucose tolerance test. Model updating techniques and prediction models were identified via recent systematic reviews. Model performance was assessed using the C-statistic and expected/observed (E/O) events rates ratio.Intercept adjustment and logistic calibration improved calibration across all five models (Cambridge, Kuwaiti, Omani, Rotterdam and Simplified Finnish diabetes risk models). This was improved further by model revision, where likelihood ratio tests showed that the effect of body mass index, waist circumference and family history of diabetes required additional adjustment (Omani, Rotterdam and Finnish models). However, discrimination was poor following internal validation of these models. Re-estimation of the regression coefficients did not increase performance, while the addition of new variables resulted in the highest discriminatory and calibration performance combination for the models it was undertaken in.While the discriminatory performance of the original existent models during external validation were higher, calibration was poor. The highest performing models, based on discrimination and calibration, were the Omani diabetes model following model revision, and the Cambridge diabetes risk model following the addition of waist circumference as a predictor. However, while more extensive methods incorporating development population information were superior over simpler methods, the increase in model performance was not great enough for recommendation."
https://openalex.org/W2914202007,"Background Despite the importance of platelet transfusions in treatment of hematologic cancer patients, the optimal platelet count threshold for prophylactic transfusion is unknown in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We followed patients admitted to the Uganda Cancer Institute with a hematological malignancy in 3 sequential 4-month time-periods using incrementally lower thresholds for prophylactic platelet transfusion: platelet counts ≤ 30 x 109/L in period 1, ≤ 20 x 109/L in period 2, and ≤ 10 x 109/L in period 3. Clinically significant bleeding was defined as WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to compare the frequency of clinically significant bleeding and platelet transfusions by study period, adjusting for age, sex, cancer type, chemotherapy, baseline platelet count, and baseline hemoglobin. Results Overall, 188 patients were enrolled. The median age was 22 years (range 1–80). Platelet transfusions were given to 42% of patients in period 1, 55% in period 2, and 45% in period 3. These transfusions occurred on 8% of days in period 1, 12% in period 2, and 8% in period 3. In adjusted models, period 3 had significantly fewer transfusions than period 1 (RR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.9; p = 0.01) and period 2 (RR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.4–0.7; p<0.001). Eighteen patients (30%) had clinically significant bleeding on at least one day in period 1, 23 (30%) in period 2, and 15 (23%) in period 3. Clinically significant bleeding occurred on 8% of patient-days in period 1, 9% in period 2, and 5% in period 3 (adjusted p = 0.41). Thirteen (21%) patients died in period 1, 15 (22%) in period 2, and 11 (19%) in period 3 (adjusted p = 0.96). Conclusion Lowering the threshold for platelet transfusion led to fewer transfusions and did not change the incidence of clinically significant bleeding or mortality, suggesting that a threshold of 10 x 109/L platelets, used in resource-rich countries, may be implemented as a safe level for transfusions in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2950558766,"Visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), an event-related signature of automatic detection of events violating sequential regularities is traditionally investigated at the onset of frequent (standard) and rare (deviant) events. In a previous study we obtained vMMN to vanishing parts of continuously presented objects (diamonds with diagonals), and we concluded that the offset-related vMMN is a model of sensitivity to irregular partial occlusion of objects. In the present study we replicated the previous results, but in order to test the object-related interpretation we applied a new condition with a set of separate visual stimuli: a texture of bars with two orientations. In the texture condition (offset of bars with irregular vs. regular orientation) we obtained vMMN, showing that the continuous presence of objects is unnecessary for offset-related vMMN. However, unlike in the object-related condition, reappearance of the previously vanishing lines also elicited vMMN. In principle reappearance of the stimuli is an event with probability 1.0, and according to our results, the object condition reappearance was an expected event. However, the offset and onset of texture elements seems to be treated separately by the system underlying vMMN. As an advantage of the present method, the whole stimulus set during the inter-stimulus interval saturates the visual structures sensitive to stimulus input. Accordingly, the offset-related vMMN is less sensitive to low-level adaptation that differs between the deviant and standard stimuli."

Materials and methods Records of 46 consecutive patients (25 men, 21 women, mean age 55±14 y) who underwent CDT for submassive PE between September 2009 and February 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Mean t-PA rate was 0.7±0.3 mg/h. PAP was measured at baseline and daily until CDT termination. Mixed-effects regression modeling was performed of repeated PAP measures in individual patients. Bleeding events were classified by Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) and t-PA dose at onset. Results Mean t-PA dose was 43.0±30.0 mg over 61.9± 28.8 h. Mean systolic PAP decreased from 51.7±15.5 mmHg at baseline to 35.6±12.7 mmHg at CDT termination (p<0.001). Mixed-effects regression revealed a linear decrease in systolic PAP over time (β = -0.37 (SE = 0.05), p<0.001) with reduction in mean systolic PAP to 44.8±1.9 mmHg at 12 mg t-PA/20 h, 39.5±2.0 mmHg at 24 mg t-PA/40 h, and 34.9±2.1 mmHg at 36 mg/60 h. No severe, one moderate, and 8 mild bleeding events occurred; bleeding onset was more frequent at ≤24 mg t-PA (p <0.001). One patient expired from cardiopulmonary arrest after 16 h of CDT (15.4 mg t-PA); no additional intra-procedural fatalities occurred. Conclusion Increased total t-PA dose and CDT duration were associated with greater PAP reduction without increased bleeding events."
