https://openalex.org/W2033678540,"In newborn mice subcutaneous injectionis of monosodium glutamate induced acute neuronal necrosis in several regions of developing brain including the hypothanamus. As adults, treated animals showed stunted skeletal development, marked obesity, and female sterility. Pathological changes were also found in several organs associated with endocrine function. Studies of food consumption failed to demonstrate hyperphagia to explain the obesity. It is postulated that the aduls syndrome represents a multifacted nueroendocrine disturbance arising from the disruption of developing nueral centers concered in the mediation of endocrine function."

https://openalex.org/W2023859887,"The shapes of red blood cells in capillary blood vessels are reinterpreted from observations of human red cells. The parachute or umbrella shape often observed is not an axisymmetric shape as formerly assumed, but is the basic biconcave disk shape of the red cell with the upstream end flattened by the pressure gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2043238839,"The isolated eye of the sea hare Aplysia califomica shows a circadian rhythm of optic nerve impulses when kept in total darkness. Peak activity on the first day of isolation occurs during the projected "" dawn"" of the light-dark cycle to which the whole animal had previously been entrained. Eyes from animals previously exposed to constant light show a free-running rhythm. This simple photoreceptor provides a quantized output with an ideal control (the other eye) for studies on rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W1996436167,"Amino acid sequences of encephalitogenic proteins from bovine cord and rabbit brain are reported. The bovine protein contains 45 residues. The rabbit protein is identical except for two isopolar substitutions, a dipeptide and amino acid deletion. Analysis of this protein and a 140-residue myelin basic protein indicates that the smaller protein is a portion of the larger encephalitogen. The larger myelin protein contains at least two encephalitogenic sites."

https://openalex.org/W2055995025,"Reduced population densities lead to increased rates of fissioning in planarians whereas higher population densities suppress fissioning. This effect is not primarily due to mucus deposition or substances secreted into the water. Experiments are presented which show a system of population feedback control. In the presence of other planarians, the brain exerts an influence (probably neurohormonal) to suppress fissioning. This influence becomes attenuated with axial distance from the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1990365877,"The failure to find positive contrast effects in the runway may be attributed to a ceiling effect that can be overcome with the use of delay of reward. Rats were trained one trial a day in a runway with small, medium, or large reward. When a shift to large reward was combined with delay of reward, shift groups slowed down less than controls."

https://openalex.org/W2005403871,"From a review of the records of schizophrenic women whose psychotic symptoms were associated with pregnancy, it was found that those who had developed a psychosis within 1 month of conception delivered only live female infants. A predominance of males was born to 13 women who became psychotic during the first month after delivery. These observations are interpreted as consistent with a theory that schizophrenia is associated with plasma factors which interact with the fetus and provide the basis for a higher fetal mortality."

https://openalex.org/W2022490130,"Plasma natriuretic activity was evoked in cows and dogs by infusion of saline with or without dextran. Deproteinized samples were fractionated on both Sephadex and Bio-Gel columns; the activity was separated, the approximate molecular weight being in the region of 1000. Incubation with chymotrypsin destroyed the activity, suggesting that it might be a polypeptide. A similar activity in blood resulted from intracarotid injection of either oxytocin or either of two synthetic analogs. Possibly the latter are saluretic by virtue of a releasing action on some intracranial structure for another natriuretic peptide."

https://openalex.org/W2080970381,"High doses (5 x 10-(6) gram) of LSD-25 given to Swiss-Webster females on gestation days 6, 7, 8, or 9 caused a high incidence of anterior subcapsular lens abnormalities. Accompanying this, the lens epithelium was often hyperplastic, and the lens bow was widened posteriorly in a fashion similar to cataracts induced by x-radiation. Confirmation of this effect of LSD-25 was obtained by a (duplicate) experiment 1 year after the observations reported."
https://openalex.org/W2039755383,"Deoxyribonucleic acid methylase activity has been detected in a preparation of disrupted nuclei prepared from pea seedlings. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine acted as a donor of methyl groups, and the product of the reaction was identified as 5-methylcytosine. The reaction had a sharp temperature optimum at about 30 degrees C and was unusual in that the DNA methylase was able to methylate DNA in the crude extract."

https://openalex.org/W2089040479,"RETINAE were removed from dark adapted ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei; Pacific dogfish, Squalus suckleyi; and big skate, Raja binoculata, obtained by bottom trawling near Friday Harbor, Washington. Retinal extracts were prepared by a standard procedure and analysed with a Cary 14 spectrophotometer by the method of partial bleaching1. The bleachings were with λ640 nm, λ610 nm and dim white light for six ratfish extracts; and λ660 nm, λ640 nm and λ610 nm for three dogfish and two skate extracts. For each extract of a species, a plot of the three difference spectra, expressed as δDmax=100 per cent, resulted in three congruent curves indicating the presence of a single visual pigment. In all extracts, the λmax of the product of bleaching was 367 nm (indicative of retinene1 oxime), so the visual pigment of each species is based on retinene1. The λmax of the visual pigment of each species was estimated from a nomogram2 and a chart3 for determining the λmax of visual pigments based on retinene1. The visual pigment of the ratfish has λmax = 484.0 nm; that of the dogfish has λmax = 497.5 nm; and that of the skate has λmax= 497.0 nm."

https://openalex.org/W2013884129,"The usage of the word interaction by physiologists has led to a consensus that gibberellin and abscisin interact in affecting plant responses. However, no such consensus is admissible if one uses the statisticians' definition which is more physiologically sound than that used by physiologists."
