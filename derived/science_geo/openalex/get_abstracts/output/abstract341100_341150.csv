https://openalex.org/W2038777424,"This article is a review of research on how much the life chances of children are affected by the socioeconomic and racial mix of their schools and neighborhoods. The social mix of a high school has little effect on students' chances of attending college or on white students' academic achievement. Evidence about the effect of the socioeconomic mix of schools or neighborhoods on achievement of elementary school students, on graduation rates of high school students, on teenage crime, and on early labor market experience is weak. Growing up in poor neighborhoods seems to increase black teenage pregnancy rates."
https://openalex.org/W2087754320,"A peptide that strongly stimulates the secretion of juvenile hormone from corpora allata in vitro (allatotropin) has been purified from extracts of heads of pharate adult Manduca sexta. The primary structure of this 13-residue peptide has been determined: H-Gly-Phe-Lys-Asn-Val-Glu-Met-Met-Thr-Ala-Arg-Gly-Phe-NH2. This neurohormone has no sequence similarity with any known neuropeptide from other organisms. Synthetic allatotropin, as well as truncation fragments, including one with the five amino terminal residues deleted, showed in vitro activity indistinguishable from that of native allatotropin."

https://openalex.org/W2078669054,"In north-central Oregon a large area of near-zero near-surface conductive heat flow occurs in young volcanic rocks of the Cascade Range. Recent advective heat flux measurements and a heat-budget analysis suggest that ground-water circulation sweeps sufficient heat out of areas where rocks younger than 6 Ma (million years ago) are exposed to account for the anomalously high advective and conductive heat discharge measured in older rocks at lower elevations. Earlier workers have proposed that an extensive midcrustal magmatic heat source is responsible for this anomalously high heat flow. Instead, high heat flow in the older rocks may be a relatively shallow phenomenon caused by regional ground-water flow. Any deeper anomaly may be relatively narrow, spatially variable, and essentially confined to the Quaternary (less than 2 Ma) arc. Magmatic intrusion at a rate of 9 to 33 cubic kilometers per kilometer of arc length per million years can account for the total heat flow anomaly. Deep drilling in the areas of high heat flow in the older rocks could indicate which model is more appropriate for the near-surface heat flow data."
