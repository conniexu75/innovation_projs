https://openalex.org/W1663816085,"NASA has developed an extensive program of international cooperation, which opens the entire range of its space activities to foreign participation and benefit. The program has involved developing as well as advanced countries in activities that are fruitful scientifically, technically, economically, and (it may be hoped) politically. ""Gaps"" or limitations in the program are found in the areas of manned space flight and large booster development and in cooperation with the Soviet Union. In the first case, the low level of European budgeting is the prime explanation, perhaps reflecting Europe's late start in the space business and an early underestimate of its values and possibilities. In the second case, the explanation seems to rest with Soviet political views rather than with technical problems or any lack of interest by the United States. Openhanded efforts are currently under way to raise the level of foreign participation in the space programs of the next decade, but it is too early to estimate their chances of major success. Public commentary could undoubtedly assist these efforts more effectively if it were directed more clearly to the actual sources of restriction on foreign participation. Despite the restricting factors abroad, however, there is every reason to persevere with existing and improved programs for international cooperation."

If taken as an upper limit on inverse Compton x-rays generated by scattering interactions between relativistic electrons and cosmological background photons, the observation implies an upper limit of close to 3 degrees K for the background radiation temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2032616197,"Variations of the Globorotalia menardii complex in cores from the Indian Ocean can be interpreted as indicating climatic changes that are opposite to trends exhibited by the total planktonic fauna. The questionable value of correlations between different water masses based on a single species can be shown by Neogloboquadrina dutertrei subcretacea in cores obtained off the coast of California and Baja California. This information, in addition to previous correlations between Quaternary cores of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, indicates that the Pleistocene history of the two oceans was parallel."

https://openalex.org/W1990052339,"This paper provides an overview of territorial patterns of COVID-19 deaths in four European countries severely affected by the pandemic, Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The analysis focuses on cumulated COVID-19 mortality at the sub-regional level, following the territorial subdivision of countries adopted by the European Union. The paper builds upon a dataset with highly granular information on COVID-19 deaths assembled from various sources. The analysis shows remarkable differences in territorial patterns of COVID-19 mortality, both within and across the four countries reviewed. Results somewhat differ depending on the aspect considered (concentration of deaths or mortality rates) but, in general, Italy, France and Spain display significant territorial disparities, with selected sub-regions being disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Instead, the picture is more uniform in the UK, with comparatively lower differences across the various sub-regions. These findings suggest that analyses of COVID-19 mortality at the national level (and, sometimes, even at the regional level) may conceal major differences and therefore be of limited use, both analytically and from an operational viewpoint."
