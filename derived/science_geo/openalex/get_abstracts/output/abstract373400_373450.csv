https://openalex.org/W1979751563,"Exosome biogenesis is poorly understood. The small GTPases Rab27a and Rab27b and their effectors, Slp4 and Slac2b, control exosome secretion at different steps by regulating the peripheral localization, retention and docking of exosomal precursors, the multivesicular endosomes. Exosomes are secreted membrane vesicles that share structural and biochemical characteristics with intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). Exosomes could be involved in intercellular communication and in the pathogenesis of infectious and degenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms of exosome biogenesis and secretion are, however, poorly understood. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified five Rab GTPases that promote exosome secretion in HeLa cells. Among these, Rab27a and Rab27b were found to function in MVE docking at the plasma membrane. The size of MVEs was strongly increased by Rab27a silencing, whereas MVEs were redistributed towards the perinuclear region upon Rab27b silencing. Thus, the two Rab27 isoforms have different roles in the exosomal pathway. In addition, silencing two known Rab27 effectors, Slp4 (also known as SYTL4, synaptotagmin-like 4) and Slac2b (also known as EXPH5, exophilin 5), inhibited exosome secretion and phenocopied silencing of Rab27a and Rab27b, respectively. Our results therefore strengthen the link between MVEs and exosomes, and introduce ways of manipulating exosome secretion in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2054259512,"The normal microflora of the skin includes staphylococcal species that will induce inflammation when present below the dermis but are tolerated on the epidermal surface without initiating inflammation. Here we reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which a product of staphylococci inhibits skin inflammation. This inhibition is mediated by staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and acts selectively on keratinocytes triggered through Toll-like receptor 3(TLR3). We show that TLR3 activation is required for normal inflammation after injury and that keratinocytes require TLR3 to respond to RNA from damaged cells with the release of inflammatory cytokines. Staphylococcal LTA inhibits both inflammatory cytokine release from keratinocytes and inflammation triggered by injury through a TLR2-dependent mechanism. To our knowledge, these findings show for the first time that the skin epithelium requires TLR3 for normal inflammation after wounding and that the microflora can modulate specific cutaneous inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2075690247,"Obesity is a highly heritable and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Here we investigated the contribution of copy number variation to obesity in 300 Caucasian patients with severe early-onset obesity, 143 of whom also had developmental delay. Large (>500 kilobases), rare (<1%) deletions were significantly enriched in patients compared to 7,366 controls (P < 0.001). We identified several rare copy number variants that were recurrent in patients but absent or at much lower prevalence in controls. We identified five patients with overlapping deletions on chromosome 16p11.2 that were found in 2 out of 7,366 controls (P < 5 x 10(-5)). In three patients the deletion co-segregated with severe obesity. Two patients harboured a larger de novo 16p11.2 deletion, extending through a 593-kilobase region previously associated with autism and mental retardation; both of these patients had mild developmental delay in addition to severe obesity. In an independent sample of 1,062 patients with severe obesity alone, the smaller 16p11.2 deletion was found in an additional two patients. All 16p11.2 deletions encompass several genes but include SH2B1, which is known to be involved in leptin and insulin signalling. Deletion carriers exhibited hyperphagia and severe insulin resistance disproportionate for the degree of obesity. We show that copy number variation contributes significantly to the genetic architecture of human obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2005894707,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as an important new class of cellular regulators that control various cellular processes and are implicated in human diseases, including cancer. Here, we show that loss of let-7 function enhances lung tumor formation in vivo, strongly supporting the hypothesis that let-7 is a tumor suppressor. Moreover, we report that exogenous delivery of let-7 to established tumors in mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) significantly reduces the tumor burden. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of let-7 in NSCLC and point to miRNA replacement therapy as a promising approach in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2007106585,"Macrophages show endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress when exposed to lipotoxic signals associated with atherosclerosis, although the pathophysiological importance and the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unknown. Here we show that mitigation of ER stress with a chemical chaperone results in marked protection against lipotoxic death in macrophages and prevents macrophage fatty acid-binding protein-4 (aP2) expression. Using genetic and chemical models, we show that aP2 is the predominant regulator of lipid-induced macrophage ER stress. The absence of lipid chaperones incites an increase in the production of phospholipids rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and bioactive lipids that render macrophages resistant to lipid-induced ER stress. Furthermore, the impact of aP2 on macrophage lipid metabolism and the ER stress response is mediated by upregulation of key lipogenic enzymes by the liver X receptor. Our results demonstrate the central role for lipid chaperones in regulating ER homeostasis in macrophages in atherosclerosis and show that ER responses can be modified, genetically or chemically, to protect the organism against the deleterious effects of hyperlipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W1996957734,"Contrary to the widely held view that impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission underlies epileptic activity, extrasynaptic GABA-dependent thalamocortical inhibition caused by reduced GABA uptake is reported to be increased in diverse models of absence seizures. The cellular mechanisms underlying typical absence seizures, which characterize various idiopathic generalized epilepsies, are not fully understood, but impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition remains an attractive hypothesis. In contrast, we show here that extrasynaptic GABAA receptor–dependent 'tonic' inhibition is increased in thalamocortical neurons from diverse genetic and pharmacological models of absence seizures. Increased tonic inhibition is due to compromised GABA uptake by the GABA transporter GAT-1 in the genetic models tested, and GAT-1 is crucial in governing seizure genesis. Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are a requirement for seizures in two of the best characterized models of absence epilepsy, and the selective activation of thalamic extrasynaptic GABAA receptors is sufficient to elicit both electrographic and behavioral correlates of seizures in normal rats. These results identify an apparently common cellular pathology in typical absence seizures that may have epileptogenic importance and highlight potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of absence epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2019828567,"The identification of the genes associated with chromosomal translocation breakpoints has fundamentally changed understanding of the molecular basis of hematological malignancies. By contrast, the study of chromosomal deletions has been hampered by the large number of genes deleted and the complexity of their analysis. We report the generation of a mouse model for human 5q- syndrome using large-scale chromosomal engineering. Haploinsufficiency of the Cd74-Nid67 interval (containing Rps14, encoding the ribosomal protein S14) caused macrocytic anemia, prominent erythroid dysplasia and monolobulated megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. These effects were associated with defective bone marrow progenitor development, the appearance of bone marrow cells expressing high amounts of the tumor suppressor p53 and increased bone marrow cell apoptosis. Notably, intercrossing with p53-deficient mice completely rescued the progenitor cell defect, restoring common myeloid progenitor and megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor, granulocyte-monocyte progenitor and hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow populations. This mouse model suggests that a p53-dependent mechanism underlies the pathophysiology of the 5q- syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2011102093,"An unresolved question in neuroscience relates to the extent to which corticothalamocortical circuits emanating from layer 5B are involved in information transfer through the cortical hierarchy. Using a new form of optical imaging in a brain slice preparation, we found that the corticothalamocortical pathway drove robust activity in higher-order somatosensory cortex. When the direct corticocortical pathway was interrupted, secondary somatosensory cortex showed robust activity in response to stimulation of the barrel field in primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF), which was eliminated after subsequently cutting the somatosensory thalamus, suggesting a highly efficacious corticothalamocortical circuit. Furthermore, after chemically inhibiting the thalamus, activation in secondary somatosensory cortex was eliminated, with a subsequent return after washout. Finally, stimulation of layer 5B in S1BF, and not layer 6, drove corticothalamocortical activation. These findings suggest that the corticothalamocortical circuit is a physiologically viable candidate for information transfer to higher-order cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2034264501,"Chris Wallace and colleagues report the identification of a new locus on chromosome 14q32.3 that alters susceptibility to type 1 diabetes with a parent-of-origin effect. The region contains imprinted genes including DLK1 and MEG3. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies to map common disease susceptibility loci have been hugely successful, with over 300 reproducibly associated loci reported to date1. However, these studies have not yet provided convincing evidence for any susceptibility locus subject to parent-of-origin effects. Using imputation to extend existing GWA datasets2,3,4, we have obtained robust evidence at rs941576 for paternally inherited risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D; ratio of allelic effects for paternal versus maternal transmissions = 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71–0.79). This marker is in the imprinted region of chromosome 14q32.2, which contains the functional candidate gene DLK1. Our meta-analysis also provided support at genome-wide significance for a T1D locus at chromosome 19p13.2. The highest association was at marker rs2304256 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86; 95%CI = 0.82–0.90) in the TYK2 gene, which has previously been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus5 and multiple sclerosis6."
https://openalex.org/W1980403687,"Pheromones controlling aggression have been identified in insects and in mice, but the nature of the neuronal circuits involved remains unclear. Liming Wang and David Anderson show that the volatile pheromone cVA (cis-vaccenyl acetate) produced by the male fruitfly promotes male-to-male aggression by activating olfactory sensory neurons expressing a cVA receptor protein, Or67d. This neuronal circuit may regulate male population density on a food resource through cVA-promoted aggression and consequent male fly dispersal, which in turn lowers cVA levels, thereby reducing aggression. This work in the classic genetic model Drosophila — using machine vision technology described in a recent Nature feature ( page 562 in the 3 December issue ) and shown in movie form at go.nature.com/o8sRLs — opens the study of aggressive behaviour to detailed genetic manipulation and investigation. Although aggression is known to be regulated by pheromones in many animal species, in no system have the pheromones, their receptors and corresponding sensory neurons been identified. Here, 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a volatile pheromone produced by male fruitflies, is shown to promote male-to-male aggression through the activation of olfactory sensory neurons expressing the receptor Or67d. Aggression is regulated by pheromones in many animal species1,2,3. However, in no system have aggression pheromones, their cognate receptors and corresponding sensory neurons been identified. Here we show that 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a male-specific volatile pheromone, robustly promotes male–male aggression in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. The aggression-promoting effect of synthetic cVA requires olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the receptor Or67d4,5,6, as well as the receptor itself. Activation of Or67d-expressing OSNs, either by genetic manipulation of their excitability or by exposure to male pheromones in the absence of other classes of OSNs, is sufficient to promote aggression. High densities of male flies can promote aggression by the release of volatile cVA. In turn, cVA-promoted aggression can promote male fly dispersal from a food resource, in a manner dependent on Or67d-expressing OSNs. These data indicate that cVA may mediate negative-feedback control of male population density, through its effect on aggression. Identification of a pheromone–OSN pair controlling aggression in a genetic organism opens the way to unravelling the neurobiology of this evolutionarily conserved behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2125639616,"The trafficking defect associated with the cystic fibrosis disease-linked allele of the CFTR chloride channel is alleviated by inhibitors of histone deacetylases, suggesting that altering the transcription of genes associated with protein misfolding can ameliorate disease. Chemical modulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity by HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) is an increasingly important approach for modifying the etiology of human disease. Loss-of-function diseases arise as a consequence of protein misfolding and degradation, which lead to system failures. The ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in the absence of the cell surface chloride channel and a loss of airway hydration, leading to the premature lung failure and reduced lifespan responsible for cystic fibrosis. We now show that the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) restores surface channel activity in human primary airway epithelia to levels that are 28% of those of wild-type CFTR. Biological silencing of all known class I and II HDACs reveals that HDAC7 plays a central role in restoration of ΔF508 function. We suggest that the tunable capacity of HDACs can be manipulated by chemical biology to counter the onset of cystic fibrosis and other human misfolding disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2029092025,"Partitioning tissues into compartments that do not intermix is essential for the correct morphogenesis of animal embryos and organs. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain compartmental cell sorting, mainly differential adhesion, but also regulation of the cytoskeleton or of cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that keep cells apart at boundaries remain unclear. Here we demonstrate, in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos, that actomyosin-based barriers stop cells from invading neighbouring compartments. Our analysis shows that cells can transiently invade neighbouring compartments, especially when they divide, but are then pushed back into their compartment of origin. Actomyosin cytoskeletal components are enriched at compartmental boundaries, forming cable-like structures when the epidermis is mitotically active. When MyoII (non-muscle myosin II) function is inhibited, including locally at the cable by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI), in live embryos, dividing cells are no longer pushed back, leading to compartmental cell mixing. We propose that local regulation of actomyosin contractibility, rather than differential adhesion, is the primary mechanism sorting cells at compartmental boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2026784295,"Coordinated spiking activity in neuronal ensembles, in local networks and across multiple cortical areas, is thought to provide the neural basis for cognition and adaptive behavior. Examining such collective dynamics at the level of single neuron spikes has remained, however, a considerable challenge. We found that the spiking history of small and randomly sampled ensembles (approximately 20-200 neurons) could predict subsequent single neuron spiking with substantial accuracy in the sensorimotor cortex of humans and nonhuman behaving primates. Furthermore, spiking was better predicted by the ensemble's history than by the ensemble's instantaneous state (Ising models), emphasizing the role of temporal dynamics leading to spiking. Notably, spiking could be predicted not only by local ensemble spiking histories, but also by spiking histories in different cortical areas. These strong collective dynamics may provide a basis for understanding cognition and adaptive behavior at the level of coordinated spiking in cortical networks."
https://openalex.org/W2011370595,"Mouse mutants for Sec24b, a component of COPII-coated ER-to-Golgi vesicles, have defects in convergent extension, neural tube closure and other phenotypes related to planar cell polarity (PCP). The PCP component Vangl2 is sorted by Sec24b, and Vangl2 mutants defective in convergent extension do not exit the ER. Craniorachischisis is a rare but severe birth defect that results in a completely open neural tube. Mouse mutants in planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling components have deficits in the morphological movements of convergent extension that result in craniorachischisis. Using a forward genetic screen in mice, we identified Sec24b, a cargo-sorting member of the core complex of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport vesicle COPII, as critical for neural tube closure. Sec24bY613 mutant mice exhibit craniorachischisis, deficiencies in convergent extension and other PCP-related phenotypes. Vangl2, a key component of the PCP-signalling pathway critical for convergent extension, is selectively sorted into COPII vesicles by Sec24b. Moreover, Sec24bY613 genetically interacts with a loss-of-function Vangl2 allele (Vangl2LP), causing a marked increase in the prevalence of spina bifida. Interestingly, the Vangl2 looptail point mutants Vangl2D255E and Vangl2S464N, known to cause defects in convergent extension, fail to sort into COPII vesicles and are trapped in the ER. Thus, during COPII vesicle formation, Sec24b shows cargo specificity for a core PCP component, Vangl2, of which proper ER-to-Golgi transport is essential for the establishment of PCP, convergent extension and closure of the neural tube."

Viral infections triggered a series of signaling events that lead to induction of type I interferons (IFNs). Type I IFNs then activate the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways, leading to transcriptional induction of a wide range of downstream antiviral genes and subsequent innate antiviral response (1Durbin J.E. Fernandez-Sesma A. Lee C.K. Rao T.D. Frey A.B. Moran T.M. Vukmanovic S. García-Sastre A. Levy D.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4220-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 2Honda K. Takaoka A.

Transcriptional induction of type I IFN genes requires the coordinate activation of multiple transcription factors and their cooperative assembly into transcriptional enhancer complexes in vivo. For example, the IFNB1 gene promoter contains conserved enhancer elements recognized by NF-κB (κB site) and phosphorylated IRF3 (ISRE site, also known as PRDIII or IRF-E). It has been shown that transcriptional activation of the IFNB1 gene requires coordinate and cooperative assembly of an enhanceosome that contains all of these transcription factors (2Honda K.

The innate immune system has developed at least two types of pathogen recognition receptors for the recognition of viral RNAs (7Bowie A.G. Unterholzner L. Nat. Rev.

Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar). The second one involves the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptor family members RIG-I, MDA5, and Lgp2. Both RIG-I and MDA5 contain two CARD modules at their N terminus and a DexD/H-box RNA helicase domain at their C terminus (9Andrejeva J. Childs K.S. Young D.F. Carlos T.S. Stock N. Goodbourn S.

The essential roles of VISA in antiviral innate immune response were demonstrated by the observations that VISA-deficient mice failed to mount a proper IFN response to viral infections (14Sun Q.

Various studies have demonstrated that VISA plays a central role in assembling a complex that activates distinct signaling pathways leading to NF-κB and IRF3 activation, respectively. VISA is associated with TRAF6 through its TRAF interaction motifs. It has been shown that TRAF6 is required for activation of IKK and subsequent NF-κB (17Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J.

Accumulating evidence has revealed critical roles of post-translational modification, particularly ubiquitination and deubiquitination, in RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling. It has been shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 catalyzes Lys63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, and this ubiquitination is essential for the interaction of RIG-I with VISA as well as for its ability to signal (22Gack M.U.

The Riplet/REUL E3 ubiquitin ligase also targets RIG-I for ubiquitination, which positively regulates RIG-I-mediated signaling (23Gao D. Yang Y.K. Wang R.P. Zhou X. Diao F.C. Li M.D. Zhai Z.H. Jiang Z.F. Chen D.Y. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5760Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, an OTU (ovarian tumor domain) containing deubiquitinating enzyme, CYLD, dissociates Lys63-linked ubiquitin moieties from RIG-I, and therefore negatively regulates RIG-I-mediated signaling (25Friedman C.S.

The ubiquitination/deubiquitination systems also target other components in the virus-triggered pathways. For example, MITA and IRF3 are ubiquitinated by RNF5 and RBCK1, respectively, and subsequently degraded by proteasome-dependent processes (27Zhang M. Tian Y. Wang R.P. Gao D. Zhang Y. Diao F.C.

In this report, we found that two OTUB (Otubain) deubiquitinating enzyme family members, OTUB1 and OTUB2, deubiquitinate TRAF3 and TRAF6, leading to the inhibition of virus-induced IFN-β expression and cellular antiviral responses. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms on regulation of TRAF3 and TRAF6 mediated signaling by deubiquitination.

Mammalian expression plasmids for hemagglutinin- or FLAG-tagged OTUB1 and OTUB2 were constructed by standard molecular biology techniques. The expression clones on GFC transfection arrays were obtained from Origene. The clones were transfected together with the IFN-β luciferase reporter into 293 cells. Sixteen h after transfection, cells were infected with SeV or left uninfected for 8 h. The clones that inhibited SeV-triggered activation of the IFN-β promoter were isolated and validated by repeating the reporter assays. 293 cells were seeded on 24-well dishes and transfected the following day by standard calcium phosphate precipitation. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.05 μg of pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase) reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using a dual-specific luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized based on Renilla luciferase activities. All reporter assays were repeated for at least three times. Total RNA was isolated from 293 cells using TRIzol reagent (Tianwei, China) and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR analysis to measure expression of IFNB1, RANTES, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Gene-specific primer sequences were as follows: IFNB1, 5′-CAGCAATTTTCAGTGTCAGCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-TCATCCTGTCCTTGAGGCAGTAT-3′; RANTES, 5′- ATGAAGGTCTCCGCGGCACGCCT-3′ and 5′-CTAGCTCATCTCCAAAGAGTTG-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5/-AAAATCAAGTGGGGCGATGCT-3′ and 5′-GGGCAGAGATGATGACCCTTT-3′. For transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (∼1 × 106) were transfected for 24 h. The transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, 0.4 ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated antibody or control IgG and 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were analyzed by standard immunoblot procedures. For endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (5 × 107) were infected with SeV for the indicated times or left uninfected. The coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments were performed as described above. 293 cells grown in media containing 1% fetal bovine serum were incubated with VSV at a multiplicity of infection 0.1 for 1 h before replacement with the complete media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four h later, the supernatant was harvested and diluted to infect confluent BHK21 cells cultured on 24-well dishes. One hour postinfection, cell culture medium was removed, and 2% methylcellulose was overlaid. On day 3 postinfection, overlay was removed and cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and stained with 1% crystal violet in 70% methanol for 15 min. Plaques were counted, averaged, and multiplied by the dilution factor to determine viral titer as log10 (plaque-forming unit/ml). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequences were cloned into the pSuper.Retro RNAi plasmid (Oligoengine, Inc.). The target sequences (5′ to 3′) used in this study are as follows: OTUB1-1: GCAAGTTCTTCGAGCACTT; OTUB1-2: TGGATGACAGCAAGGAGTT; OTUB2-1: CCGTTTACCTGCTCTATAA; OTUB2-2: CTTCTGCACTCACGAAGTA; and DUBA-1: CTGGGCCTGCCATCATTCA; DUBA-2: CGGAATATCCACTATAATT. The cell fractionation experiments were performed as described previously (36Zhong B. Yang Y. Li S. Wang Y.Y. Li Y. Diao F. Lei C. He X. Zhang L. Tien P. Shu H.B. Immunity. 2008; 29: 538-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). In brief, 293 cells (6 × 107) infected with SeV or left uninfected for various time points were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by douncing 40 times in 5 ml homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min to precipitate mitochondria. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min to generate cytosol. The mitochondria fraction was lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) for 20 min followed by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting analysis. Virus-triggered IFN induction is delicately regulated to avoid excessive immune response. Because ubiquitination of several key components of the virus-triggered IFN pathways is important for their activation, we reasoned that these components are also regulated by certain deubiquitinating enzymes. To identify such enzymes, we screened a protease cDNA array containing 352 clones for proteases that inhibit SeV-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter in reporter assays. These experiments identified OTUB1 as an inhibitor of SeV-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1A). OTUB1 is a member of the OTU domain-containing Otubain family of cysteine proteases (33Balakirev M.Y. Tcherniuk S.O. Jaquinod M. Chroboczek J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The OTU domain confers the deubiquitinase activity of this family. During the course of this work, it was reported that the Otubain family member DUBA/OTUD5 deubiquitinates TRAF3 and negatively regulates TLR3- and RIG-I/MDA5-mediated IFN induction (34Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R. Quan C. O'Rourke K.M. Eby M. Pietras E. Cheng G. Bazan J.F. Zhang Z. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was reported that two Otubain family members, OTUB2 and OTUD5/DUBA, are among 283 genes identified in a RNA interference screen for human genes associated with West Nile virus infection (35Krishnan M.N. Ng A. Sukumaran B. Gilfoy F.D. Uchil P.D. Sultana H. Brass A.L. Adametz R. Tsui M. Qian F. Montgomery R.R. Lev S. Mason P.W. Koski R.A. Elledge S.J. Xavier R.J. Agaisse H. Fikrig E. Nature. 2008; 455: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We reasoned that these proteins could act to inhibit virus-triggered IFN induction and cellular antiviral response and therefore were required for efficient West Nile virus infection. In reporter assays, OTUB2, like OTUB1 and DUBA, inhibited SeV-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). OTUB1 and OTUB2 could also inhibit expression of endogenous IFNB1 and RANTES genes, and their effects were accumulative in these experiments (Fig. 1B&C), suggesting OTUB1 and OTUB2 have redundant functions in inhibiting virus-triggered signaling. Consistently, OTUB1 and OTUB2 also inhibited SeV-triggered ISRE and NF-κB activation (Fig. 1, D and E), as well as cytoplasmic poly(I·C)- and B-DNA-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1F). The effects of OTUB1 and OTUB2 on virus-induced IFN signaling are not cell type-specific because OTUB1 and OTUB2 also inhibited SeV-induced IFN-β promoter in A549 cells (Fig. 1G). TRIF is an essential adapter for TLR3- and TLR4-mediated induction of type I IFNs. In reporter assays, OTUB1 and OTUB2 also inhibited TRIF-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 1H). In similar experiments, OTUB1 and OTUB2 did not inhibit IFN-γ-induced activation of the IRF1 promoter (Fig. 1I). These results suggest that OTUB1 and OTUB2 specifically inhibit virus- and TLR3/4-triggered signaling. To determine the roles of endogenous OTUB1 and OTUB2, we investigated the effects of knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 on virus-triggered IFN signaling. Reporter assays indicated that knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 potentiated SeV-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 2, A and B). In these experiments, knockdown of DUBA had a weaker potentiation effect than knockdown of OTUB1 or OTUB2 (Fig. 2B). Knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 also potentiated SeV-induced expression of endogenous IFNB1 and RANTES genes (Fig. 2, C and D). (The OTUB1-1 OTUB1-RNAi and OTUB2-1 OTUB2-RNAi plasmids were used for all the following experiments.) Consistently, knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 also potentiated SeV-triggered ISRE and NF-κB activation (Fig. 2, E and F).Similar results were obtained in A549 cells (Fig. 2G). Knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 also potentiated TRIF-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results suggest that OTUB1 and OTUB2 are two negative regulators of viruses, as well as TLR3/4-triggered signaling pathways. Because OTUB1 and OTUB2 negatively regulate virus-triggered IFN signaling, we further confirmed their roles in cellular antiviral response. We determined the effects of knockdown of these proteins on viral replication. In plaque assays, knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 inhibited VSV replication and enhanced the inhibitory effect triggered by cytoplasmic poly(I·C) (Fig. 3). These results suggest OTUB1 and OTUB2 negatively regulate cellular antiviral response. Various components are involved in virus-induced signaling. To determine at which levels that OTUB1 and OTUB2 regulate virus-induced signaling, we performed reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, OTUB1 and OTUB2 inhibited RIG-I-N, MDA5- and VISA-mediated but not TBK1- and IRF3-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter, suggesting that OTUB1 and OTUB2 target a step downstream of VISA but upstream of TBK1. Because TRAF3 and TRAF6 functions downstream of VISA in virus-triggered IFN-β induction, we hypothesized that TRAF3 and TRAF6 are the targets of OTUB1 and OTUB2. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that OTUB1 and OTUB2 interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Fig. 4B). In the same experiments, OTUB1 also interacted with VISA but not RIG-I (Fig. 4B). Moreover, endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that OTUB1 and OTUB2 are both recruited to the VISA-associated complex after SeV infection, though the dynamics was different among the proteins (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that components of the VISA-associated complex are potential targets of OTUB1 and OTUB2. Because OTUB1 and OTUB2 are deubiqutinating enzymes, we determined whether OTUB1 and OTUB2 could remove ubiquitin moieties from components of the VISA-associated complex. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of OTUB1 and OTUB2 caused deubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6, but not RIG-I or VISA. The combination of OTUB1 and OTUB2 further enhanced the deubiquitination effects (Fig. 5A). Conversely, knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 potentiated SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that OTUB1 and OTUB2 specifically deubiquitinate TRAF3 and TRAF6 after viral infection. Virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs is crucial for the early innate antiviral response as well as late stage adaptive immunity. This process is delicately regulated in a spatio-temporal manner by various molecules and distinct mechanisms. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination have emerged as critical post-translational regulatory mechanisms for activation or attenuation of the virus-triggered IFN response pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for the members of the TRAF protein family in the virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs. However, how TRAFs are regulated in virus-triggered IFN induction pathways is not understood. In this report, we demonstrated that TRAF3 and TRAF6 were negatively regulated through deubiquitination by OTUB1 and OTUB2 in the virus-triggered IFN induction pathways. Because several components of the virus-triggered IFN induction pathways are ubiquitinated and their ubiquitinations are essential for their abilities to signal, we attempted to identify deubiquitination enzymes that negatively regulate the pathways. These efforts led to the identification of OTUB1 and OTUB2, two members of the Otubain deubiquitinating enzyme family. We found that overexpression of either OTUB1 or OTUB2 inhibited SeV-triggered activation of ISRE and NF-κB as well as the IFN-β promoter. Moreover, knockdown of either OTUB1 or OTUB2 potentiated SeV-triggered activation of ISRE and NF-κB as well as the IFN-β promoter. Previously, it has been demonstrated that DUBA/OTUD5, also a member of the Otubain family, deubiquitinates TRAF3 and negatively regulates TLR3- and RIG-I/MDA5-mediated IFN induction (34Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Chan S. Chaudhari R. Quan C. O'Rourke K.M. Eby M. Pietras E. Cheng G. Bazan J.F. Zhang Z. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In our experiments, knockdown of DUBA had a relative minor potentiation effect on virus-triggered signaling in comparison to either OTUB1 or OTUB2. These studies suggest that OTUB1, OTUB2, and DUBA have redundant roles in inhibition of virus-triggered signaling. In the course of this work, one study reported that two Otubain family members, OTUB2 and OTUD5/DUBA, were among 283 genes identified in a RNA interference screen for human genes associated with the West Nile virus infection (35Krishnan M.N. Ng A. Sukumaran B. Gilfoy F.D. Uchil P.D. Sultana H. Brass A.L. Adametz R. Tsui M. Qian F. Montgomery R.R. Lev S. Mason P.W. Koski R.A. Elledge S.J. Xavier R.J. Agaisse H. Fikrig E. Nature. 2008; 455: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In light of this observation and our studies, we propose that OTUB1, OTUB2, and DUBA promote viral infection by inhibiting virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral response. Several observations suggest that OTUB1 and OTUB2 mediate the inhibition of the virus-triggered signaling through deubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. Firstly, OTUB1 and OTUB2 inhibited upstream RIG-I-, MDA5-, and VISA-mediated but not downstream TBK1-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter. Second, OTUB1 and OTUB2 were recruited to the VISA complex after viral infection. Third, overexpression of OTUB1 and OTUB2 abolished ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 but not that of upstream component RIG-I and VISA, whereas knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 increased SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. These results suggest that OTUB1 and OTUB2 function to deubiquitinate TRAF3 and TRAF6, two E3 ubiquitin ligases required for virus-triggered IRF3 and NF-κB activation pathways, respectively. Regulation of the virus-triggered IFN pathways and OTUB1 and OTUB2 are further supported by their abilities to regulate viral replication. In plaque assays, knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 had opposite effects. In conclusion, our findings revealed the regulatory mechanism of TRAF3 and TRAF6 in virus-triggered IFN induction pathways and further underscored the importance of ubiquitination and deubiquitination in precise control of cellular antiviral response.

We report that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors selectively kill diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) that depend on the BCL-6 transcriptional repressor. We found that endogenous Hsp90 interacts with BCL-6 in DLBCL cells and can stabilize BCL-6 mRNA and protein. Hsp90 formed a complex with BCL-6 at its target promoters, and Hsp90 inhibitors derepressed BCL-6 target genes. A stable mutant of BCL-6 rescued DLBCL cells from Hsp90 inhibitor–induced apoptosis. BCL-6 and Hsp90 were almost invariantly coexpressed in the nuclei of primary DLBCL cells, suggesting that their interaction is relevant in this disease. We examined the pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy of PU-H71, a recently developed purine-derived Hsp90 inhibitor. PU-H71 preferentially accumulated in lymphomas compared to normal tissues and selectively suppressed BCL-6–dependent DLBCLs in vivo, inducing reactivation of key BCL-6 target genes and apoptosis. PU-H71 also induced cell death in primary human DLBCL specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2153129295,"Recording from single neurons in awake macaque monkeys, the authors find that neurons of the frontal pole cortex encode decisions at the time of feedback, but do not carry signals typically seen in other prefrontal areas, such as information about sensory cues, strategies, working memory, future goals or movement plans. The frontal pole cortex (FPC) expanded markedly during human evolution, but its function remains uncertain in both monkeys and humans. Accordingly, we examined single-cell activity in this area. On every trial, monkeys decided between two response targets on the basis of a 'stay' or 'shift' cue. Feedback followed at a fixed delay. FPC cells did not encode the monkeys' decisions when they were made, but did so later on, as feedback approached. This finding indicates that the FPC is involved in monitoring or evaluating decisions. Using a control task and delayed feedback, we found that decision coding lasted until feedback only when the monkeys combined working memory with sensory cues to 'self-generate' decisions, as opposed to when they simply followed trial-by-trial instructions. A role in monitoring or evaluating self-generated decisions could account for FPC's expansion during human evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2015751862,"Greg Gibson and colleagues report an analysis of gene expression variation in relation to environmental geography and ethnicity in blood leukocyte samples from individuals in rural and urban southern Morocco. The study determined the contributions of geography and ethnicity to associations between genotypes and transcript abundance. Studies of the genetics of gene expression can identify expression SNPs (eSNPs) that explain variation in transcript abundance. Here we address the robustness of eSNP associations to environmental geography and population structure in a comparison of 194 Arab and Amazigh individuals from a city and two villages in southern Morocco. Gene expression differed between pairs of locations for up to a third of all transcripts, with notable enrichment of transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Robust associations were observed in the leukocyte samples: cis eSNPs (P < 10−08) were identified for 346 genes, and trans eSNPs (P < 10−11) for 10 genes. All of these associations were consistent both across the three sample locations and after controlling for ancestry and relatedness. No evidence of large-effect trans-acting mediators of the pervasive environmental influence was found; instead, genetic and environmental factors acted in a largely additive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2051431548,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1beta) is a transcription factor required for the expression of several renal cystic genes and whose prenatal deletion leads to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We show here that inactivation of Hnf1b from postnatal day 10 onward does not elicit cystic dilations in tubules after their proliferative morphogenetic elongation is over. Cystogenic resistance is intrinsically linked to the quiescent state of cells. In fact, when Hnf1b deficient quiescent cells are forced to proliferate by an ischemia-reperfusion injury, they give rise to cysts, owing to loss of oriented cell division. Remarkably, in quiescent cells, the transcription of crucial cystogenic target genes is maintained even in the absence of HNF-1beta. However, their expression is lost as soon as cells proliferate and the chromatin of target genes acquires heterochromatin marks. These results unveil a previously undescribed aspect of gene regulation. It is well established that transcription is shut off during the mitotic condensation of chromatin. We propose that transcription factors such as HNF-1beta might be involved in reprogramming gene expression after transcriptional silencing is induced by mitotic chromatin condensation. Notably, HNF-1beta remains associated with the mitotically condensed chromosomal barrels. This association suggests that HNF-1beta is a bookmarking factor that is necessary for reopening the chromatin of target genes after mitotic silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2069473378,"This study uses a new method of profiling cell type–specific gene expression to identify genes expressed in fruitfly clock neurons. Such profiling yields two novel circadian genes, in separate sets of clock neurons and with differing circadian functions. Behavioral circadian rhythms are controlled by a neuronal circuit consisting of diverse neuronal subgroups. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of neuronal subgroups within the Drosophila circadian circuit, we used cell-type specific gene-expression profiling and identified a large number of genes specifically expressed in all clock neurons or in two important subgroups. Moreover, we identified and characterized two circadian genes, which are expressed specifically in subsets of clock cells and affect different aspects of rhythms. The transcription factor Fer2 is expressed in ventral lateral neurons; it is required for the specification of lateral neurons and therefore their ability to drive locomotor rhythms. The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the vertebrate circadian gene nocturnin is expressed in a subset of dorsal neurons and mediates the circadian light response. The approach should also enable the molecular dissection of many different Drosophila neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1971392223,"Most cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis for generation of their energy supply. This specificity could be used to preferentially kill these cells. In this study, we identified the signaling pathway initiated by glycolysis inhibition that results in sensitization to death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis. We showed, in several human cancer cell lines (such as Jurkat, HeLa, U937), that glucose removal or the use of nonmetabolizable form of glucose (2-deoxyglucose) dramatically enhances apoptosis induced by Fas or by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. This sensitization is controlled through the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is the central energy-sensing system of the cell. We established the fact that AMPK is activated upon glycolysis block resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease, but no other Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic members. Interestingly, we determined that, upon glycolysis inhibition, the AMPK–mTOR pathway controlled Mcl-1 levels neither through transcriptional nor through posttranslational mechanism but rather by controlling its translation. Therefore, our results show a novel mechanism for the sensitization to DR-induced apoptosis linking glucose metabolism to Mcl-1 downexpression. In addition, this study provides a rationale for the combined use of DR ligands with AMPK activators or mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2088861488,"The appropriate response of human keratinocytes to ultraviolet-B (UVB) is dependent on the activation status of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor. Keratinocytes grown in conditions in which the IGF-1 receptor is inactive inappropriately replicate in the presence of UVB-induced DNA damage. In human skin, epidermal keratinocytes do not express IGF-1, and hence the IGF-1 receptor on keratinocytes is activated by IGF-1 secreted from dermal fibroblasts. We now show that the IGF-1 produced by human fibroblasts is essential for the appropriate UVB response of keratinocytes. Furthermore, the expression of IGF-1 is silenced in senescent fibroblasts in vitro. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunohistochemisty, we can show that IGF-1 expression is also silenced in geriatric dermis in vivo. The diminished IGF-1 expression in geriatric skin correlates with an inappropriate UVB response in geriatric volunteers. Finally, the appropriate UVB response is restored in geriatric skin in vivo through pretreatment with exogenous IGF-1. These studies provide further evidence for a role of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in suppressing UVB-induced carcinogenesis, suggest that fibroblasts have a critical role in maintaining appropriate activation of the keratinocyte IGF-1R, and imply that reduced expression of IGF-1 in geriatric skin could be an important component in the development of aging-related non-melanoma skin cancer."

We recently showed a critical role of the BH3-only protein p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) in acute radiation-induced GI damage and GI syndrome in mice. Growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been shown to protect against radiation-induced intestinal injury, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. We report here the suppression of PUMA through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/p53 axis in the intestinal stem cells as a novel molecular mechanism of growth factor-mediated intestinal radioprotection. IGF-1 or bFGF impaired radiation-induced apoptosis and the expression of PUMA and p53 in the crypt cells and intestinal stem cells. Using colonic epithelial cells that undergo PUMA-dependent and radiation-induced apoptosis, we found that a PI3K inhibitor, dominant-negative PI3K or Mdm2 antagonist restored the induction of PUMA, p53 and apoptosis in the presence of growth factors. In contrast, overexpression of AKT suppressed the induction of PUMA and p53 by radiation. Furthermore, inhibiting PI3K or activating p53 abrogated growth factor-mediated suppression of apoptosis and PUMA expression in the intestinal crypts and stem cells after radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2033496263,"Heterozygosity of the retinoblastoma gene Rb1 elicits tumorigenesis in susceptible tissues following spontaneous loss of the remaining functional allele. Inactivation of previously studied retinoblastoma protein (pRb) targets partially inhibited tumorigenesis in Rb1(+/-) mice. Here we report that inactivation of pRb target Skp2 (refs. 7,8) completely prevents spontaneous tumorigenesis in Rb1(+/-) mice. Targeted Rb1 deletion in melanotrophs ablates the entire pituitary intermediate lobe when Skp2 is inactivated. Skp2 inactivation does not inhibit aberrant proliferation of Rb1-deleted melanotrophs but induces their apoptotic death. Eliminating p27 phosphorylation on T187 in p27T187A knock-in mice reproduces the effects of Skp2 knockout, identifying p27 ubiquitination by SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase as the underlying mechanism for Skp2's essential tumorigenic role in this setting. RB1-deficient human retinoblastoma cells also undergo apoptosis after Skp2 knockdown; and ectopic expression of p27, especially the p27T187A mutant, induces apoptosis. These results reveal that Skp2 becomes an essential survival gene when susceptible cells incur Rb1 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2084118031,"There are two major molecular pathways to sporadic colorectal cancer, the chromosomal instability (CIN) and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) pathways. This study recruited 166 patients undergoing colonoscopy. Biopsy samples were collected from the cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. DNA methylation was quantified at ‘type A’ (ESR1, GATA5, HIC1, HPP1, SFRP1) and ‘type C’ markers (MGMT, MLH1, CDKN2A, MINT2, MINT31, IGF2, CACNA1G, NEUROG1, SOCS1, RUNX3), and LINE-1. ‘Type A’ genes are frequently methylated in normal and neoplastic tissues, proportional to tissue age. ‘Type C’ methylation is more specific for neoplasia. The last five ‘type C’ markers comprise a CIMP panel. The mean ‘type A’ and CIMP-panel methylation Z-scores were calculated. In all, 88 patients had adenomatous lesions, 32 had proximal serrated polyps (PSPs) and 50 were normal. Most ‘type A’ genes showed direct correlations between methylation and age (ESR1, ρ=0.66, P<0.0001), with higher methylation distally (ESR1, P<0.0001). On multivariate analysis, ‘type A’ methylation was inversely associated with colorectal adenomas (odds ratio=0.23, P<0.001), the precursor to CIN cancers. CIMP-panel methylation was significantly associated with advanced PSPs (odds ratio=5.1, P=0.009), the precursor to CIMP cancers. DNA methylation in normal mucosa varied with age and region and was associated with pathway-specific pathology. In the future, the colorectal field could yield important information and potentially inform clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2149175115,"The output of a neural circuit results from an interaction between the intrinsic properties of neurons in the circuit and the features of the synaptic connections between them. The plasticity of intrinsic properties has been primarily attributed to modification of ion channel function and/or number. We have found a mechanism for intrinsic plasticity in rhythmically active Drosophila neurons that was not based on changes in ion conductance. Larval motor neurons had a long-lasting, sodium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following bursts of action potentials that was mediated by the electrogenic activity of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. This AHP persisted for multiple seconds following volleys of action potentials and was able to function as a pattern-insensitive integrator of spike number that was independent of external calcium. This current also interacted with endogenous Shal K(+) conductances to modulate spike timing for multiple seconds following rhythmic activity, providing a cellular memory of network activity on a behaviorally relevant timescale."

https://openalex.org/W1990435106,"A growing body of evidence indicates that interactions between neoplastic cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial in promoting tumor cell invasion and progression. Macrophages have an ambiguous role in these processes as this M1 phenotype correlates with tumoricidal capacity, whereas TAMs of M2 phenotype exert tumor-promoting effects. In this study, we provide evidence that interactions between mouse breast tumor cells and TAMs remodel the TME, leading to the upregulation of Fra-1, a member of the FOS family of transcription factor. In turn, this proto-oncogene initiates activation of the IL-6/JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway. This creates a malignant switch in breast tumor cells, leading to increased release of proangiogenic factors MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta from tumor cells and intensified invasion and progression of breast cancer. Proof of the concept for the crucial role played by transcription factor Fra-1 in regulating these processes was established by specific knockdown of Fra-1 with small interfering RNA, which resulted in a marked suppression of tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis in a mouse breast cancer model. Such a strategy could eventually lead to future efficacious treatments of metastatic breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2080605787,"DNA amplifications, leading to the overexpression of oncogenes, are a cardinal feature of lung cancer and directly contribute to its pathogenesis. To uncover such novel alterations, we performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization survey of 128 non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines and tumors. Prominent among our findings, we identified recurrent high-level amplification at cytoband 22q11.21 in 3% of lung cancer specimens, with another 11% of specimens exhibiting low-level gain spanning that locus. The 22q11.21 amplicon core contained eight named genes, only four of which were overexpressed (by transcript profiling) when amplified. Among these, CRKL encodes an adapter protein functioning in signal transduction, best known as a substrate of the BCR-ABL kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of CRKL in lung cancer cell lines with (but not without) amplification led to significantly decreased cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, cell survival, and cell motility and invasion. In addition, overexpression of CRKL in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells led to enhanced growth factor-independent cell growth. Our findings indicate that amplification and resultant overexpression of CRKL contribute to diverse oncogenic phenotypes in lung cancer, with implications for targeted therapy, and highlight a role of adapter proteins as primary genetic drivers of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007318006,"Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) are a subclass of cysteine proteases that catalyze the removal of ubiquitin (either monomeric or chains) from substrates, thus counteracting the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although the importance of USPs in a multitude of processes, from hereditary cancer to neurodegeneration, is well established, our knowledge on their mode of regulation, substrate specificity and biological function is quite limited. In this study we identify USP47 as a novel interactor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (SCF(beta-Trcp)). We found that both beta-Trcp1 and beta-Trcp2 bind specifically to USP47, and point mutations in the beta-Trcp WD-repeat region completely abolished USP47 binding, indicating an E3-substrate-type interaction. However, unlike canonical beta-Trcp substrates, USP47 protein levels were neither affected by silencing of beta-Trcp nor modulated in a variety of processes, such as cell-cycle progression, DNA damage checkpoint responses or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway activation. Notably, genetic or siRNA-mediated depletion of USP47 induced accumulation of Cdc25A, decreased cell survival and augmented the cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs. In conclusion, we showed that USP47, a novel beta-Trcp interactor, regulates cell growth and survival, potentially providing a novel target for anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2149527725,"Viral infections and abnormal host response are thought to cause epithelial injury in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To understand IPF pathogenesis, we have used overexpression cell models and expression microarrays to discover genes networked with ELMO domain containing 2 (ELMOD2) gene genetically implicated in IPF. The identified pathways were confirmed in vitro, and ELMOD2 protein expression was characterized in tissue samples. Here 303 genes were significantly altered after ELMOD2 transfection of human alveolar epithelial A549 cell line. The enriched pathways were interferon induction, viral response, antigen processing and presentation, and I-/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. ELMOD2 showed immunoreactivity in macrophages and type II alveolar epithelial cells in normal human lung. In A549 cells, forced expression of ELMOD2 increased type I and type III interferon mRNA expression, and ELMOD2-specific siRNA molecules inhibited expression of these antiviral cytokines in response to Toll-like receptor three (TLR3) activation. In human macrophages silencing of ELMOD2 inhibited TLR3-dependent expression of type I and type III interferon genes. Influenza A virus infection decreased ELMOD2 mRNA expression in A549 cells and macrophages suggesting negative regulation in viral infections. In summary, our results show that TLR3 pathway is dependent on ELMOD2.-Pulkkinen, V., Bruce, S., Rintahaka, J., Hodgson, U., Laitinen, T., Alenius, H., Kinnula, V.

https://openalex.org/W2078224598,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is noted for its transforming potential. Yet, it also acts as a cytostatic and growth-relenting factor in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the growth inhibitory property of LMP1 have remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that LMP1 negatively regulates a major oncogene, TCL1, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and BL cells. MicroRNA (miR) profiling of LMP1 transfectants showed that among others, miR-29b, is upregulated. LMP1 diminished TCL1 by inducing miR-29b through C-terminus activation region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2. miR-29b locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide transfection into LMP1-expressing cells reduced miR-29b expression and consequently reconstituted TCL1, suggesting that LMP1 negatively regulates TCL1 through miR-29b upregulation. The miR-29b increase by LMP1 was due to an increase in the cluster pri-miR-29b1-a transcription, derived from human chromosome 7. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-activating function of LMP1 is important for this effect. The ability of LMP1 to negatively regulate TCL1 through miR-29b might underlie its B-cell lymphoma growth antagonistic property. As LMP1 is also important for B-cell transformation, we suggest that the functional dichotomy of this viral protein may depend on a combination of levels of its expression, lineage and differentiation of the target cells and regulation of miRs, which then directs the outcome of the cellular response."
https://openalex.org/W2069453842,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis. Mice with a heterozygous APCMin mutation develop multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) leading to premature death. Early in colorectal carcinogenesis, APCMin/+ mice show enhanced Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is paralleled by upregulation of oncogenic K+ channels. In this study, we tested the effect of mTOR inhibition with rapamycin on tumor formation in APCMin/+ mice and evaluated ion channel regulation. We found that continuous long-term rapamycin treatment of APCMin/+ mice dramatically inhibits intestinal neoplasia. Moreover, although untreated APCMin/+ mice lose weight, experience intestinal bleeding and succumb to multiple neoplasia by 22.3±1.4 weeks of age, mice treated with rapamycin maintain stable weight and survive long term (39.6±3.4 weeks), with more than 30% surviving >1 year. Impressively, abnormalities in colonic electrolyte transport typical for APCMin/+ mice are abolished, along with the suppression of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and oncogenic K+ ion channels BK, Elk1 and Erg1, both functionally and at mRNA levels. These results show that continuous prophylaxis by rapamycin markedly inhibits the development of APC mutation-related polyposis, and suggest a novel contributing mechanism of action through the blockade of intestinal oncogenic ion channels."

https://openalex.org/W1992893449,"Germline TSC1 or TSC2 mutations cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a hamartoma syndrome with lung involvement. To explore the potential interaction between TSC1 and KRAS activation in lung cancer, mice in which Tsc1 loss and KrasG12D expression occur in a small fraction of lung epithelial cells were generated. Mice with a combined Tsc1-KrasG12D mutation had dramatically reduced tumor latency (median survival: 11.6–15.6 weeks) in comparison with KrasG12D alone mutant mice (median survival: 27.5 weeks). Tsc1-KrasG12D tumors showed consistent activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)C1 and responded to treatment with rapamycin, leading to significantly improved survival, whereas rapamycin had minor effects on cancers in KrasG12D alone mice. Loss of heterozygosity for TSC1 or TSC2 was found in 22% of 86 human lung cancer specimens. However, none of the 80 lung cancer lines studied showed evidence of the lack of expression of either TSC1 or TSC2 or a signaling pattern corresponding to complete loss. These data indicate that Tsc1 loss synergizes with the Kras mutation to enhance lung tumorigenesis in the mouse, but that this is a rare event in human lung cancer. Rapamycin may have unique benefit for patients with lung cancer, for whom the TSC1/TSC2 function is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2050024578,"Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we obtained the structure of Ca(2+)-calmodulin (holoCaM) in complex with peptide C28 from the binding domain of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) pump isoform 4b. This provides the first atomic resolution insight into the binding mode of holoCaM to the full-length binding domain of PMCA. Structural comparison of the previously determined holoCaM.C20 complex with this holoCaM.C28 complex supports the idea that the initial binding step is represented by (holoCaM.C20) and the final bound complex by (holoCaM.C28). This affirms the existing multi-step kinetic model of PMCA4b activation by CaM. The complex exhibits a new binding motif in which holoCaM is wrapped around helical C28 peptide using two anchoring residues from the peptide at relative positions 18 and 1. The anchors correspond to Phe-1110 and Trp-1093, respectively, in full-length PMCA4b, and the peptide and CaM are oriented in an anti-parallel manner. This is a greater sequence distance between anchors than in any of the known holoCaM complexes with a helical peptide. Analysis of the geometry of holoCaM-peptide binding for the cases where the target peptide adopts an alpha(D)-helix with its anchors buried in the main hydrophobic pockets of the two CaM lobes establishes that only relative sequential positions of 10, 14, 17, and 18 are allowed for the second anchor."
https://openalex.org/W2073678225,"We have previously shown that a frequently downregulated gene, transcription elongation factor A-like 7 (TCEAL7), promoted anchorage-independent growth and modulated Myc activity in ovarian surface epithelial cells immortalized with temperature-sensitive large T antigen and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (OSEtsT/hTERT). Analysis of protein/DNA array showed that TCEAL7 downregulation resulted in an approximately twofold increase in nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB binding to its target DNA sequence. In this study we showed that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated downregulation of TCEAL7 in two different immortalized OSE cells showed higher NF-kappaB activity, as determined using reporter and gel-shift assays. Transient transfection of TCEAL7 inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB in TCEAL7-downregulated clones, IOSE-523 and in other ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR8, SKOV3ip and DOV13), suggesting that TCEAL7 negatively regulates NF-kappaB pathway. Consistent with this observation, TCEAL7-downregulated clones showed higher levels of NF-kappaB targets, such as pro-proliferative (cyclin-D1 and cMyc), pro-angiogenic (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), inflammatory (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)) and anti-apoptotic (B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl)) genes when compared with vector controls. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by IkappaB kinase (IKK) inhibitor (BMS 345541) attenuated cell survival and proliferation of TCEAL-knockdown clones. Although TCEAL7 inhibited p65 transcriptional activity, it did not modulate the cytoplasmic signaling of the NF-kappaB pathway, by itself or by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed increased recruitment of p65 and p300 to the promoters of IL-8 and IL-6 in TCEAL7-downregulated clones. Collectively, these results indicate a novel role for TCEAL7 in the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling at the basal level by modulating transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB on its target gene promoters, potentially providing a novel mechanism by which NF-kappaB activity may be deregulated in ovarian cancer cells."

The expression and functional role of Cav-1 have been reported in liver and in hepatocyte cell lines, in human cirrhotic liver, and in hepatocellular carcinomas. Previous studies demonstrated that Cav-1 was dispensable for liver regeneration, because Cav-1(-/-) animals survived and fully regenerated liver function and size after partial hepatectomy. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which the lack of Cav-1 accelerates liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. The data show that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling is impaired in regenerating liver of Cav-1(-/-) mice and in hepatocytes derived from these animals. TGF-beta receptors I and II do not colocalize in the same membrane fraction in the hepatocytes derived from Cav-1(-/-) mice, as Smad2/3 signaling decreased in the absence of Cav-1 at the time that the transcriptional corepressor SnoN accumulates. Accordingly, the expression of TGF-beta target genes, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, is decreased due to the presence of the high levels of SnoN. Moreover, hepatocyte growth factor inhibited TGF-beta signaling in the absence of Cav-1 by increasing SnoN expression. Taken together, these data might help to unravel why Cav-1-deficient mice exhibit an accelerated liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and add new insights on the molecular mechanisms controlling the initial commitment to hepatocyte proliferation."

Genetic ablation of pTα expression in Notch3 transgenic mice abrogates tumor development, indicating that pTα signaling is crucial to the Notch3-mediated leukemogenesis. Here we report a novel direct interaction between Notch3 and pTα. This interaction leads to the recruitment and persistence of the E3 ligase protein c-Cbl to the lipid rafts in Notch3-IC transgenic thymocytes. Conversely, deletion of pTα in Notch3 transgenic mice leads to cytoplasmic retention of c-Cbl that targets Notch3 protein to the proteasomal-degradative pathway. It appears that protein kinase C θ (PKCθ), by regulating tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Cbl, is able to control its function. We report here that the increased Notch3-IC degradation correlates with higher levels of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in Notch3-IC/pTα−/− double-mutant thymocytes, which also display a decreased PKCθ activity. Our data indicate that pTα/pre-T-cell receptor is able to regulate the different subcellular localization of c-Cbl and, by regulating PKCθ activity, is also able to influence its ubiquitin ligase activity upon Notch3 protein."

Similarly, manipulating the expression levels of sima, the Drosophila hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α ortholog, revealed that Sima can either block or restore BCM in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, over-expression of Vhl (Drosophila von Hippel–Lindau) generated a range of phenotypes, including blocked, delayed and accelerated BCM, whereas over-expression of hph (Drosophila HIF prolyl hydroxylase) only accelerated BCM. Mosaic clone analysis of sima or tango (HIF-1β ortholog) mutants revealed that cells lacking Hif-1 transcriptional activity were preferentially detected in the leading cell position of the cluster, resulting in either a delay or acceleration of BCM. Moreover, in sima mutant cell clones, there was reduced expression of nuclear slow border cells (Slbo) and basolateral DE-cadherin, proteins essential for proper BCM. These results show that Sima levels define the rate of BCM in part through regulation of Slbo and DE-cadherin, and suggest that dynamic regulation of Hif-1 activity is necessary to maintain invasive potential of migrating epithelial cells."

This involves several APC domains, including the binding sites for axin/conductin, the recently described β-Catenin Inhibitory Domain (CID) and the third 20 amino acid repeat (20R3) that is a β-catenin-binding site. The four 15 amino acid repeats (15R) and the 20R1 are also β-catenin-binding sites, but their role in β-catenin degradation has remained unclear. We show here that binding of β-catenin to the 15R of APC is necessary and sufficient to target β-catenin for degradation whereas binding to the 20R1 is neither necessary nor sufficient. The first 15R displays the highest affinity for β-catenin in the 15R-20R1 module. Biallelic mutations of the APC gene lead tocolon cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) and result in the synthesis of truncated products lacking domains involved in β-catenin degradation but still having a minimal length.

The protein defective in patients with WS (WRN) is a helicase/exonuclease involved in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance. In this study, we show that a knock down of the WRN protein in normal human fibroblasts induces phosphorylation and activation of several protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. Using a tandem affinity purification strategy, we found that WRN physically and functionally interacts with receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1), a highly conserved anchoring protein involved in various biological processes, such as cell growth and proliferation. RACK1 binds strongly to the RQC domain of WRN and weakly to its acidic repeat region. Purified RACK1 has no impact on the helicase activity of WRN, but selectively inhibits WRN exonuclease activity in vitro. Interestingly, knocking down RACK1 increased the cellular frequency of DNA breaks. Depletion of the WRN protein in return caused a fraction of nuclear RACK1 to translocate out of the nucleus to bind and activate PKCδ and PKCβII in the membrane fraction of cells. In contrast, different DNA-damaging treatments known to activate PKCs did not induce RACK1/PKCs association in cells. Overall, our results indicate that a depletion of the WRN protein in normal fibroblasts causes the activation of several PKCs through translocation and association of RACK1 with such kinases."
