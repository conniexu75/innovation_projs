https://openalex.org/W2115580899,"Antiretroviral therapy fails to cure HIV-1 infection because latent proviruses persist in resting CD4+ T cells. T cell activation reverses latency, but <1% of proviruses are induced to release infectious virus after maximum in vitro activation. The noninduced proviruses are generally considered defective but have not been characterized. Analysis of 213 noninduced proviral clones from treated patients showed 88.3% with identifiable defects but 11.7% with intact genomes and normal long terminal repeat (LTR) function. Using direct sequencing and genome synthesis, we reconstructed full-length intact noninduced proviral clones and demonstrated growth kinetics comparable to reconstructed induced proviruses from the same patients. Noninduced proviruses have unmethylated promoters and are integrated into active transcription units. Thus, it cannot be excluded that they may become activated in vivo. The identification of replication-competent noninduced proviruses indicates that the size of the latent reservoir—and, hence, the barrier to cure—may be up to 60-fold greater than previously estimated.

Here, we reveal a hierarchical mechanism in the direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells mediated by the transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l. Ascl1 acts as an “on-target” pioneer factor by immediately occupying most cognate genomic sites in fibroblasts. In contrast, Brn2 and Myt1l do not access fibroblast chromatin productively on their own; instead, Ascl1 recruits Brn2 to Ascl1 sites genome wide. A unique trivalent chromatin signature in the host cells predicts the permissiveness for Ascl1 pioneering activity among different cell types. Finally, we identified Zfp238 as a key Ascl1 target gene that can partially substitute for Ascl1 during iN cell reprogramming.

The lineage identity of differentiated somatic cells is considered to be very stable because of rigid chromatin configurations, inheritable DNA modifications, and re-enforcing transcription factor networks (Vierbuchen and Wernig, 2012Vierbuchen T.

However, various experimental conditions, including nuclear transfer into oocytes, cell fusion, and overexpression of transcription factors, have been shown to overcome these epigenetic barriers and induce cell-fate reprogramming to both pluripotency and unrelated somatic cell fates (Graf and Enver, 2009Graf T.

We recently discovered that three neuronal transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l (BAM factors) are sufficient to convert mesodermal fibroblasts or endodermal hepatocytes into fully functional neuronal cells, termed induced neuronal (iN) cells (Marro et al., 2011Marro S.

The generation of human iN cells is much less efficient and requires additional factors, such as NeuroD1 or microRNAs (Ambasudhan et al., 2011Ambasudhan R. Talantova M. Coleman R. Yuan X. Zhu S.

Our previous findings suggested that of the three factors, Ascl1 is the central driver of reprogramming because only Ascl1 is sufficient to induce immature iN cells in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In contrast, neither Brn2 nor Myt1l alone achieve any morphological changes in MEFs. However, when combined with Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l greatly improved the conversion efficiency and both were required for the induction of fully reprogrammed iN cells. Ascl1 is a well-studied proneural gene of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors that specifically bind DNA sequences containing an E-box motif (Bertrand et al., 2002Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Proneural genes and the specification of neural cell types.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). It is prominently expressed in a subset of central and peripheral neural progenitors (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L.

Overexpression of Ascl1 and related factors in the developing spinal cord induces rapid neuronal differentiation (Ma et al., 1999Ma Q. Fode C. Guillemot F. Anderson D.J.

Distinct domains within Mash1 and Math1 are required for function in neuronal differentiation versus neuronal cell-type specification.Development. 2004; 131: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Ascl1 mutant mice show severe defects in neurogenesis (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1 is required for the early development of olfactory and autonomic neurons.Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Ascl1 regulates and is regulated by the Notch pathway, which mediates lateral inhibition (Bertrand et al., 2002Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F.

The other two iN cell factors are less well characterized. Brn2 (also known as Pou3f2) belongs to the Pou-Homeodomain family of transcription factors. Brn2 is expressed in ventricular zone progenitor cells throughout the neuraxis and downregulated upon differentiation, except in cortical development, where it remains expressed in layer II/III and V pyramidal neurons (Dominguez et al., 2012Dominguez M.H. Ayoub A.E. Rakic P. POU-III transcription factors (Brn1, Brn2, and Oct6) influence neurogenesis, molecular identity, and migratory destination of upper-layer cells of the cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; (Published online August 14, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs252Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Combined deletion of Brn1 and Brn2 in mice resulted in severe proliferation defects of cortical progenitor cells and migration defects of upper-layer neurons, ultimately leading to a disorganized and thinned cortex (Sugitani et al., 2002Sugitani Y. Nakai S. Minowa O. Nishi M. Jishage K. Kawano H. Mori K. Ogawa M. Noda T. Brn-1 and Brn-2 share crucial roles in the production and positioning of mouse neocortical neurons.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Very little is known about Myt1l. It contains multiple zinc finger domains of the Cys-Cys-His-Cys (C2HC) type that are thought to interact with DNA (Kim and Hudson, 1992Kim J.G. Hudson L.D. Novel member of the zinc finger superfamily: A C2-HC finger that recognizes a glia-specific gene.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5632-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Myt1l is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system in early postmitotic neurons (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J.

Png-1, a nervous system-specific zinc finger gene, identifies regions containing postmitotic neurons during mammalian embryonic development.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 381: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Xenopus ortholog of Myt1 family transcription factors X-Myt1 is required for proper neuronal differentiation and synergizes with proneural bHLH transcription factors to promote ectopic neurogenesis in nonneural ectoderm (Bellefroid et al., 1996Bellefroid E.J. Bourguignon C. Hollemann T. Ma Q. Anderson D.J. Kintner C. Pieler T. X-MyT1, a Xenopus C2HC-type zinc finger protein with a regulatory function in neuronal differentiation.Cell. 1996; 87: 1191-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These observations argue that the three iN cell reprogramming factors promote neuronal differentiation in the context of a neural progenitor cell. It is, however, completely unclear how these factors can exert their proper function in distantly related cell types, such as fibroblasts. Both the chromatin configuration at neuronal genes and the expression of transcriptional coregulators are assumed to be unfavorable for neuronal induction because fibroblasts normally never give rise to neurons and the reprogramming factors were not evolutionarily selected to induce transdifferentiation. Here, we used an integrative genomic approach to characterize the molecular mechanism governing the early phase of MEF-to-iN cell reprogramming. To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying iN cell reprogramming, we have determined the genome-wide transcriptional changes by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at various time points of reprogramming (Figure 1A). In addition to control cells infected with rtTA virus and treated with doxycycline (dox), we have profiled MEFs 0 and 48 hr after the induction of the single or combined BAM factors with dox, as well as TauEGFP-FACS-sorted early and late iN cells, day 13 and 22 after dox, respectively. We observed that 2,522 genes significantly changed expression over this time course (fold change > 2, p value < 0.05) (Figure 1B; Figures S2A and S2B available online). Genes that increased expression were enriched for gene ontology (GO) terms associated with neuronal activity (Figure 1C). We observed that many more genes were upregulated than downregulated at 48 hr when MEFs were infected with Ascl1 or all three factors, whereas Brn2 and Myt1l had subtle transcriptional effects when expressed alone (Figures 1B and 7A). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that Ascl1 uniquely underlies the top two principle components of gene expression in MEFs transduced with the BAM factors (Figure S1C). These data suggest that Ascl1 functions mainly as a transcriptional activator as had been proposed before (Castro and Guillemot, 2011Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Old and new functions of proneural factors revealed by the genome-wide characterization of their transcriptional targets.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 4026-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and that Ascl1 may be the strongest driver of the neuronal transcriptional program. Based on the extensive changes in transcription observed 48 hr after initiation of reprogramming, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for all three BAM factors in MEFs 48 hr after induction of all three factors. We readily identified 5,902 significant Ascl1-occupied loci upon filtering high-quality peaks based on at least 20-fold enrichment and less than 5% FDR (Figure 2A). In contrast, Brn2 and Myt1l ChIP-seq required substantial technical optimization (see Experimental Procedures; Figures S2B and S2C). Under optimized conditions, Brn2 ChIP-seq revealed 2,354 peaks with at least 5-fold enrichment and less than 5% FDR. Using the same criteria, Myt1l ChIP-seq showed only minimal occupancy, despite extensive crosslinking and sonication optimization and use of different epitope tagging strategies. After optimization, we identified 475 peaks with at least 2-fold enrichment and less than 5% FDR. Most of these putative Myt1l isolated sites colocalized with histone modifications associated with accessible chromatin (Figure S2C). We confirmed that overexpressed Myt1l is present in fibroblast nuclei by immunofluorescence and in the chromatin fraction by western blot. However, the relative abundance of Myt1l on chromatin was less than Ascl1 (Figure S2A).Figure S2Distinct Chromatin Association of BAM Factors in Fibroblast Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Chromatin fractionation of MEFs+BAM 48hrs cells.

Given the apparent dominant role of Ascl1, we next asked whether the other two reprogramming factors are required for Ascl1 to access its genomic targets in fibroblasts. We determined the Ascl1 binding sites by ChIP-seq in MEFs 48 hr after infection with Ascl1 alone. Surprisingly, the pattern of binding was virtually identical to Ascl1 binding in the context of all three transcription factors, as the correlation was almost identical to that observed between two biological replicates of Ascl1 ChIP-seq in BAM infected MEFs (∼0.8) (Figures 3A and S3B ). We confirmed these findings by performing Ascl1 ChIP-qPCR with cells expressing Ascl1 alone, in combination with Brn2 or Myt1l, and with cells expressing all three factors (Figure 3E). Thus, exogenous Ascl1 can access its binding sites in fibroblasts without assistance from Brn2 or Myt1l.Figure S3Characterization of Ascl1 Occupancy across Cell Types, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Heat maps of normalized tag densities for Ascl1 ChIP-seq in single infected MEFs, BAM infected MEFs, NPCs overexpressing Ascl1, and in endogenous NPCs.

(C) Gradient Pearson correlation for endogenous Ascl1 peaks in NPCs and Ascl1 overexpressing NPCs. To better characterize the nature of Ascl1 target sites in MEFs, we sought to determine its targets in a close to physiological context. During normal development, Ascl1 is expressed in a subset of neural precursor cells (NPCs) of the ventricular zone of the neural tube and is believed to instruct neuronal differentiation (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1 is required for the early development of olfactory and autonomic neurons.Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, Lo et al., 1991Lo L.C.

Mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1 is transiently expressed by spatially restricted subsets of early neuroepithelial and neural crest cells.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in the neural tube or cultured NPCs Ascl1 induces a rapid exit from the cell cycle and neuronal differentiation (Nakada et al., 2004Nakada Y. Hunsaker T.L. Henke R.M. Johnson J.E. Distinct domains within Mash1 and Math1 are required for function in neuronal differentiation versus neuronal cell-type specification.Development. 2004; 131: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the Ascl1 binding sites by ChIP-seq in NPCs with or without overexpressing Ascl1 for 18 hr. Unexpectedly, the comparison of those results to genome-wide binding site analysis of Ascl1 in MEFs revealed a highly similar occupancy with comparable affinity (Figures 3A, 3C, and S3A–S3C). As has been observed in genome-wide localization studies for Ascl1 and other bHLH transcription factors, the E-box motif CANNTG was highly enriched across its binding sites based on the MEME algorithm (Figure 3B) (Bailey et al., 2009Bailey T.L. Boden M. Buske F.A. Frith M. Grant C.E. Clementi L. Ren J. Li W.W. Noble W.S. MEME SUITE: tools for motif discovery and searching.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W202-W208Crossref PubMed Scopus (5904) Google Scholar). The CAGCTG motif was by far the most frequently bound E-box motif as seen for myogenic factor MyoD but surprisingly less so for the other proneural bHLH factor NeuroD2 (Fong et al., 2012Fong A.P. Yao Z. Zhong J.W. Cao Y. Ruzzo W.L. Gentleman R.C. Tapscott S.J. Genetic and epigenetic determinants of neurogenesis and myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 721-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We observed the largest fraction of binding sites in the body of genes (often intronic sequences) followed by intergenic and promoter regions (Figure 2B). Many of the genes that are bound by Ascl1 are members of the Notch pathway like Hes6, Dll1, and Mfng or are otherwise associated with neural development, such as NeuroD4 (Figure 3D). To better characterize the genomic sites bound by Brn2 in BAM-infected MEFs, we also determined the Brn2 target sites in cultured NPCs by ChIP-seq (Figure 4A). In contrast to Ascl1 targets, we found little overlap between Brn2 binding in fibroblasts and NPCs (Figures 4B and 4C). A POU-like motif was significantly enriched at Brn2 target sites in NPCs, but not in Brn2-bound sites in BAM-infected MEFs. Instead, an E-box motif was significantly enriched in a large fraction of these sites (Figure 4A). Direct comparison of Brn2 and Ascl1 targets in BAM-infected MEFs confirmed a high degree of overlap (Figure 2A). This finding raises the possibility that Ascl1 actively recruits Brn2 to some of its targets. To test this hypothesis, we performed Brn2 ChIP-seq in MEFs infected with Brn2 alone. Surprisingly, there was hardly any overlap with either Brn2 binding in NPCs or BAM-infected MEFs (Figures 4A–4C). About 600 (i.e., 22.2%) of the statistically significant Brn2 targets in BAM-infected MEFs are also significant Ascl1 targets (Figure 4D). Only 29 of these 600 sites (equivalent to 0.7% of all Brn2 targets in MEFs+Brn2) remain Brn2-bound when Brn2 is expressed alone (Figures 4D and S4A). These results show that Ascl1 recruits Brn2 to many of its targets. We have confirmed the colocalization of Brn2 and Ascl1 on the fibroblast chromatin by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Brn2 contained a substantial amount of Ascl1 in MEFs infected with both factors (Figure 4E, middle panel). Consistent with the ChIP-seq data, chromatin pulled down with Ascl1 antibodies contained relatively less Brn2 (Figure 4E, right panel). To define the window of Brn2 action during iN reprogramming, we generated Ascl1-inducible MEFs and infected them with Brn2 1 day before or 2 or 5 days after addition of dox. The neuronal complexity, measured as total neurite length, increased about 6-fold when Brn2 was added at days −1 and 2 and about 2-fold when added at day 5 (Figures 4F and S4B). In summary, these data suggest that the vast majority of Brn2-bound sites in MEFs are nonphysiological, and in part Brn2 gains access to chromatin sites made accessible by Ascl1. Furthermore, they suggest that Brn2 is primarily needed for later stages of reprogramming by contributing to iN maturation even up to 5 days after initiation of iN reprogramming.Figure S4Characterization of Brn2’s Role during Reprogramming, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Frequency of distribution of Ascl1 (E-box) and Brn2 (POU-like) motif across the mouse genome.(B) Quantification of the total neurite length of Ascl1 only, and Ascl1 with the addition of Brn2 at different time points after dox administration (one day before (−1d), two and five days after).

Error bars = SEM, n = 3 randomly selected fields of view, ∗∗p < 0.01. The surprising discovery that Ascl1 binds similar target sites in BAM-infected MEFs as in NPCs raised the question of whether those genomic Ascl1 target sites are in an open (nucleosome-free) or closed (nucleosome-bound) state in fibroblasts before infection. Based on the crystal structure of MyoD, bHLH transcription factors are predicted to only be able to bind nucleosome-free DNA (Ma et al., 1994Ma P.C. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Crystal structure of MyoD bHLH domain-DNA complex: perspectives on DNA recognition and implications for transcriptional activation.Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To measure the nonnucleosomal fractions of the MEF genome, we performed formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by high throughput sequencing (FAIRE-seq) in uninfected MEFs (Giresi et al., 2007Giresi P.G. Kim J. McDaniell R.M. Iyer V.R. Lieb J.D. FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) isolates active regulatory elements from human chromatin.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the FAIRE analysis showed that Ascl1 target sites in MEFs were on average substantially depleted of nucleosome-free DNA (Figure 5A). These results demonstrate that Ascl1 preferentially binds previously closed chromatin in MEFs as early as within 48 hr and thus fulfills the formal criteria of a pioneer transcription factor (Zaret and Carroll, 2011Zaret K.S. Carroll J.S. Pioneer transcription factors: establishing competence for gene expression.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2227-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the differential binding behaviors of Ascl1 and Brn2, we plotted the FAIRE signal from uninfected MEFs at the genomic sites bound by Brn2 in BAM-infected MEFs. We found that, in contrast to Ascl1, Brn2 targets sites in MEFs are predominantly nucleosome free (Figure 5A). We next sought to characterize the histone marks associated with Brn2 targeting in fibroblasts. We generated H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in MEFs and utilized previously published ChIP-seq data sets for the H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 histone marks. Consistent with our observation that Brn2 mostly binds accessible chromatin, Brn2 bound sites in fibroblasts are enriched for “active” marks, such as H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac (Figure 5B). The chromatin configurations of the Myt1l targets are also associated with open and active chromatin as demonstrated by the significant enrichment for the “active” marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at the 475 high-confidence bound sites (Figures 2A, 2B, and 5C). Given that, unlike Ascl1, Brn2 does not act as a pioneer factor, we then wondered whether the proper Brn2 targets in NPCs are perhaps closed in MEFs, which would explain why Brn2 is barred from binding there. Surprisingly, we found that, similar to the observed Brn2-bound sites in MEFs, the Brn2-target sites in NPCs are quite open in MEFs, although to a slightly lesser degree than in the factual binding sites in MEFs (Figure 5D). As expected, the Ascl1 targets in NPCs are in a preferentially closed state in MEFs (Figures 5D and S5A). Thus, nucleosome occupancy is neither predictive for Ascl1 nor for Brn2 binding in MEFs. Pioneer factors can access nucleosomal DNA, yet only a very small proportion of all binding sites present in the genome are actually bound by any given transcription factor. Furthermore, transcription factors (including the well-characterized FoxA pioneer factors) bind different sets of target sites depending on the cellular context (Zaret and Carroll, 2011Zaret K.S. Carroll J.S. Pioneer transcription factors: establishing competence for gene expression.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2227-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Thus, additional parameters must exist that determine selective binding. We sought to explore whether a specific signature of pre-existing histone marks in MEFs is associated with Ascl1 target sites. Average enrichments values of the individual marks showed strong enrichment of H3K4me1, H3K27acetyl, and H3K9me3 at Ascl1 target sites based on binding in NPCs. In contrast, none of those histone marks were significantly enriched in MEFs at the sites in which Brn2 is bound in NPCs (Figure 6A). We next devised a strategy to locate and quantify the trivalent chromatin state comprised of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K9me3. We wished to confirm the co-occurrence of these histone modifications in an unbiased manner because in particular the repressive mark H3K9me3 may not be expected to coexist with the active enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.

https://openalex.org/W1997603362,"This study examines neuronal activity coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and hippocampus during the recall phase of a differential fear conditioning task and during exposure to a novel open field. The authors show that theta frequency power and synchrony between the mPFC and BLA increase with successful discrimination of aversive versus safe cues, and that the mPFC activity leads that in the BLA during safety. Successfully differentiating safety from danger is an essential skill for survival. While decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is associated with fear generalization in animals and humans, the circuit-level mechanisms used by the mPFC to discern safety are not clear. To answer this question, we recorded activity in the mPFC, basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice during exposure to learned (differential fear conditioning) and innate (open field) anxiety. We found increased synchrony between the mPFC and BLA in the theta frequency range (4–12 Hz) only in animals that differentiated between averseness and safety. Moreover, during recognized safety across learned and innate protocols, BLA firing became entrained to theta input from the mPFC. These data suggest that selective tuning of BLA firing to mPFC input provides a safety-signaling mechanism whereby the mPFC taps into the microcircuitry of the amygdala to diminish fear."
https://openalex.org/W2006070103,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is usually associated with aging. To systematically characterize the compensatory stress signaling cascades triggered in response to muscle mitochondrial perturbation, we analyzed a Drosophila model of muscle mitochondrial injury. We find that mild muscle mitochondrial distress preserves mitochondrial function, impedes the age-dependent deterioration of muscle function and architecture, and prolongs lifespan. Strikingly, this effect is mediated by at least two prolongevity compensatory signaling modules: one involving a muscle-restricted redox-dependent induction of genes that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) and another involving the transcriptional induction of the Drosophila ortholog of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, which systemically antagonizes insulin signaling and facilitates mitophagy. Given that several secreted IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) exist in mammals, our work raises the possibility that muscle mitochondrial injury in humans may similarly result in the secretion of IGFBPs, with important ramifications for diseases associated with aberrant insulin signaling."

HIV-1 mosaic antigens are bioinformatically optimized immunogens designed for improved coverage of HIV-1 diversity. However, the protective efficacy of such global HIV-1 vaccine antigens has not previously been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of bivalent HIV-1 mosaic antigens to protect rhesus monkeys against acquisition of infection following heterologous challenges with the difficult-to-neutralize simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3. Adenovirus/poxvirus and adenovirus/adenovirus vector-based vaccines expressing HIV-1 mosaic Env, Gag, and Pol afforded a significant reduction in the per-exposure acquisition risk following repetitive, intrarectal SHIV-SF162P3 challenges. Protection against acquisition of infection correlated with vaccine-elicited binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the coordinated activity of multiple antibody functions may contribute to protection against difficult-to-neutralize viruses. These data demonstrate the protective efficacy of HIV-1 mosaic antigens and suggest a potential strategy for the development of a global HIV-1 vaccine. PAPERCLIP:"

We show here that the key defining feature of glutamatergic neurons, the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4/VGLUT, is expressed in 38 of the 118 anatomically defined neuron classes of the C. elegans nervous system. We show that distinct cis-regulatory modules drive expression of eat-4/VGLUT in distinct glutamatergic neuron classes. We identify 13 different transcription factors, 11 of them homeodomain proteins, that act in distinct combinations in 25 different glutamatergic neuron classes to initiate and maintain eat-4/VGLUT expression. We show that the adoption of a glutamatergic phenotype is linked to the adoption of other terminal identity features of a neuron, including cotransmitter phenotypes. Examination of mouse orthologs of these homeodomain proteins resulted in the identification of mouse LHX1 as a regulator of glutamatergic neurons in the brainstem."

Such contacts and transcription are lost in knockout studies of transcription factors and structural chromatin proteins. To ask whether chromosomal contacts are required for cotranscription in multigene complexes, we devised a strategy using TALENs to cleave and disrupt gene loops in a well-characterized multigene complex. Monitoring this disruption using RNA FISH and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that perturbing the site of contact had a direct effect on transcription of other interacting genes. Unexpectedly, this effect on cotranscription was hierarchical, with dominant and subordinate members of the multigene complex engaged in both intra- and interchromosomal contact. This observation reveals the profound influence of these chromosomal contacts on the transcription of coregulated genes in a multigene complex."

However, the frequency and diversity of somatic lesions detected among lung tumors can confound efforts to identify these targets. To confront this challenge, we have applied parallel screening of chemical and genetic perturbations within a panel of molecularly annotated NSCLC lines to identify intervention opportunities tightly linked to molecular response indicators predictive of target sensitivity. Anchoring this analysis on a matched tumor/normal cell model from a lung adenocarcinoma patient identified three distinct target/response-indicator pairings that are represented with significant frequencies (6%-16%) in the patient population. These include NLRP3 mutation/inflammasome activation-dependent FLIP addiction, co-occurring KRAS and LKB1 mutation-driven COPI addiction, and selective sensitivity to a synthetic indolotriazine that is specified by a seven-gene expression signature. Target efficacies were validated in vivo, and mechanism-of-action studies informed generalizable principles underpinning cancer cell biology."

Here, we use an approach to analyze TF colocalization within a cell type and across multiple cell lines at an unprecedented level. We extend this approach with large-scale mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitations of 50 TFs. Our combined approach reveals large numbers of interesting TF-TF associations.

The structural basis by which the virus selects its own mRNA among more abundant host cellular RNAs for export has been a mystery for more than 25 years. Here, we describe an unusual topological structure that the virus uses to recognize its own mRNA. The viral Rev response element (RRE) adopts an ""A""-like structure in which the two legs constitute two tracks of binding sites for the viral Rev protein and position the two primary known Rev-binding sites ~55 Å apart, matching the distance between the two RNA-binding motifs in the Rev dimer. Both the legs of the ""A"" and the separation between them are required for optimal RRE function. This structure accounts for the specificity of Rev for the RRE and thus the specific recognition of the viral RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2013508534,"AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is implicated in proliferation and invasion of many cancers, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), for which new therapeutic options are urgently required. We investigated whether inhibition of AXL activity by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is efficient in limiting proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Expression of AXL was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 42 PDAC. The AXL role in oncogenesis was studied using the short hairpin RNA approach in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line. We further generated antihuman AXL mAbs and evaluated their inhibitory effects and the AXL downstream signaling pathways first in vitro, in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines and then in vivo, using subcutaneous or orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts. AXL receptor was found expressed in 76% (32/42) of PDAC and was predominantly present in invasive cells. The AXL-knockdown Panc-1 cells decreased in vitro cell migration, survival and proliferation, and reduced in vivo tumor growth. Two selected anti-AXL mAbs (D9 and E8), which inhibited phosphorylation of AXL and of its downstream target AKT without affecting growth arrest-specific factor 6 (GAS6) binding, induced downexpression of AXL by internalization, leading to an inhibition of proliferation and migration in the four pancreatic cancer cell lines studied. In vivo, treatment by anti-AXL mAbs significantly reduced growth of both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts independently of their KRAS mutation status. Our in vitro and preclinical in vivo data demonstrate that anti-human AXL mAbs could represent a new approach to the pancreatic cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2125501486,"This study shows that aggressive behavior by male Drosophila melanogaster to another male is attenuated when the aggressor male fly had prior exposure to females. The study also shows that this prior experience-dependent modulation of aggression behavior is mediated by a sexually dimorphic neural circuit and pheromone-based contact chemosensation mechanism. Intraspecific male-male aggression, which is important for sexual selection, is regulated by environment, experience and internal states through largely undefined molecular and cellular mechanisms. To understand the basic neural pathway underlying the modulation of this innate behavior, we established a behavioral assay in Drosophila melanogaster and investigated the relationship between sexual experience and aggression. In the presence of mating partners, adult male flies exhibited elevated levels of aggression, which was largely suppressed by prior exposure to females via a sexually dimorphic neural mechanism. The suppression involved the ability of male flies to detect females by contact chemosensation through the pheromone-sensing ion channel ppk29 and was mediated by male-specific GABAergic neurons acting on the GABAA receptor RDL in target cells. Silencing or activating this circuit led to dis-inhibition or elimination of sex-related aggression, respectively. We propose that the GABAergic inhibition represents a critical cellular mechanism that enables prior experience to modulate aggression."
https://openalex.org/W2160589153,"Background Intra-tumoral steroidogenesis and constitutive androgen receptor (AR) activity have been associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This study aimed to examine if CRPC bone metastases expressed higher levels of steroid-converting enzymes than untreated bone metastases. Steroidogenic enzyme levels were also analyzed in relation to expression of constitutively active AR variants (AR-Vs) and to clinical and pathological variables. Methodology/Principal Findings Untreated, hormone-naïve (HN, n = 9) and CRPC bone metastases samples (n = 45) were obtained from 54 patients at metastasis surgery. Non-malignant and malignant prostate samples were acquired from 13 prostatectomy specimens. Transcript and protein levels were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. No differences in steroidogenic enzyme levels were detected between CRPC and HN bone metastases. Significantly higher levels of SRD5A1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and HSD17B10 mRNA were however found in bone metastases than in non-malignant and/or malignant prostate tissue, while the CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD3B2, SRD5A2, and HSD17B6 mRNA levels in metastases were significantly lower. A sub-group of metastases expressed very high levels of AKR1C3, which was not due to gene amplification as examined by copy number variation assay. No association was found between AKR1C3 expression and nuclear AR staining, tumor cell proliferation or patient outcome after metastases surgery. With only one exception, high AR-V protein levels were found in bone metastases with low AKR1C3 levels, while metastases with high AKR1C3 levels primarily contained low AR-V levels, indicating distinct mechanisms behind castration-resistance in individual bone metastases. Conclusions/Significance Induced capacity of converting adrenal-gland derived steroids into more potent androgens was indicated in a sub-group of PC bone metastases. This was not associated with CRPC but merely with the advanced stage of metastasis. Sub-groups of bone metastases could be identified according to their expression levels of AKR1C3 and AR-Vs, which might be of relevance for patient response to 2nd line androgen-deprivation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1975940953,"Sérgio Sousa and colleagues show that Lenz-Majewski syndrome, a disorder featuring generalized craniotubular hyperostosis, results from de novo gain-of-function mutations in PTDSS1. The mutations lead to increased phophatidylserine synthesis, suggesting a link between phosphatidylserine production and bone metabolism. Lenz-Majewski syndrome (LMS) is a syndrome of intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies that features generalized craniotubular hyperostosis. By using whole-exome sequencing and selecting variants consistent with the predicted dominant de novo etiology of LMS, we identified causative heterozygous missense mutations in PTDSS1, which encodes phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS1). PSS1 is one of two enzymes involved in the production of phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine synthesis was increased in intact fibroblasts from affected individuals, and end-product inhibition of PSS1 by phosphatidylserine was markedly reduced. Therefore, these mutations cause a gain-of-function effect associated with regulatory dysfunction of PSS1. We have identified LMS as the first human disease, to our knowledge, caused by disrupted phosphatidylserine metabolism. Our results point to an unexplored link between phosphatidylserine synthesis and bone metabolism."

Recent advances in sequencing technology have facilitated identification of gene fusions and have stimulated the research of this field in cancer. In the present study, we performed next-generation transcriptome sequencing in order to discover novel gene fusions in gastric cancer. A total of 282 fusion transcript candidates were detected from 12 gastric cancer cell lines by bioinformatic filtering. Among the candidates, we have validated 19 fusion transcripts, which are 7 inter-chromosomal and 12 intra-chromosomal fusions. A novel DUS4L–BCAP29 fusion transcript was found in 2 out of 12 cell lines and 10 out of 13 gastric cancer tissues. Knockdown of DUS4L–BCAP29 transcript using siRNA inhibited cell proliferation. Soft agar assay further confirmed that this novel fusion transcript has tumorigenic potential. We also identified that microRNA-coding gene PVT1, which is amplified in double minute chromosomes in SNU-16 cells, is recurrently involved in gene fusion. PVT1 produced six different fusion transcripts involving four different genes as fusion partners. Our findings provide better insight into transcriptional and genetic alterations of gastric cancer: namely, the tumorigenic effects of transcriptional read-through and a candidate region for genetic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2113759638,"The conserved multifunctional protein Gle1 regulates gene expression at multiple steps: nuclear mRNA export, translation initiation, and translation termination. A GLE1 mutation (FinMajor) is causally linked to human lethal congenital contracture syndrome-1 (LCCS1); however, the resulting perturbations on Gle1 molecular function were unknown. FinMajor results in a proline-phenylalanine-glutamine peptide insertion within the uncharacterized Gle1 coiled-coil domain. Here, we find that Gle1 self-associates both in vitro and in living cells via the coiled-coil domain. Electron microscopy reveals that high-molecular-mass Gle1 oligomers form ?26 nm diameter disk-shaped particles. With the Gle1-FinMajor protein, these particles are malformed. Moreover, functional assays document a specific requirement for proper Gle1 oligomerization during mRNA export, but not for Gle1's roles in translation. These results identify a mechanistic step in Gle1's mRNA export function at nuclear pore complexes and directly implicate altered export in LCCS1 disease pathology."

We investigated: financial adjustments needed to cope with the cancer-related financial burden; financial distress (defined as a reaction to the state of personal finances); and factors that increase risk of financial difficulties. Two sets of semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 20 patients with breast, lung and prostate cancer and 21 hospital-based oncology social workers (OSWs) in Ireland, which has a mixed public-private healthcare system. Participants were asked about: strategies to cope with the cancer-related financial burden; the impact of the financial burden on the family budget, other aspects of daily life, and wellbeing. OSWs were also asked about patient groups they thought were more likely to experience financial difficulties. The two interview sets were analysed separately using a thematic approach. Financial adjustments included: using savings; borrowing money; relying on family and friends for direct and indirect financial help; and cutting back on household spending. Financial distress was common. Financial difficulties were more likely for patients who were older or younger, working at diagnosis, lacked social support, had dependent children, had low income or had few savings. These issues often interacted with one another. As has been seen in predominantly publically and predominantly privately-funded healthcare settings, a complex mixed public-private healthcare system does not always provide adequate financial protection post-cancer. Our findings highlight the need for a broader set of metrics to measure the financial impact of cancer (and to assess financial protection in health more generally); these should include: out-of-pocket direct medical and non-medical costs; changes in income; financial adjustments (including financial coping strategies and household consumption patterns); and financial distress. In the interim, cancer patients require financial information and advice intermittently post diagnosis."

https://openalex.org/W2033702801,"The phylogenetic relationships between major groups of plesiomorphic pentaradial echinoderms, the Paleozoic crinoids, blastozoans, and edrioasteroids, are poorly understood because of a lack of widely recognized homologies. Here, we present newly recognized oral region homologies, based on the Universal Elemental Homology model for skeletal plates, in a wide range of fossil taxa. The oral region of echinoderms is mainly composed of the axial, or ambulacral, skeleton, which apparently evolved more slowly than the extraxial skeleton that forms the majority of the body. Recent phylogenetic hypotheses have focused on characters of the extraxial skeleton, which may have evolved too rapidly to preserve obvious homologies across all these groups. The axial skeleton conserved homologous suites of characters shared between various edrioasteroids and specific blastozoans, and between other blastozoans and crinoids. Although individual plates can be inferred as homologous, no directly overlapping suites of characters are shared between edrioasteroids and crinoids. Six different systems of mouth (peristome) plate organization (Peristomial Border Systems) are defined. These include four different systems based on the arrangement of the interradially-positioned oral plates and their peristomial cover plates, where PBS A1 occurs only in plesiomorphic edrioasteroids, PBS A2 occurs in plesiomorphic edrioasteroids and blastozoans, and PBS A3 and PBS A4 occur in blastozoans and crinoids. The other two systems have radially-positioned uniserial oral frame plates in construction of the mouth frame. PBS B1 has both orals and uniserial oral frame plates and occurs in edrioasterid and possibly edrioblastoid edrioasteroids, whereas PBS B2 has exclusively uniserial oral frame plates and is found in isorophid edrioasteroids and imbricate and gogiid blastozoans. These different types of mouth frame construction offer potential synapomorphies to aid in parsimony-based phylogenetics for exploring branching order among stem groups on the echinoderm tree of life."
https://openalex.org/W2165390794,"We investigate the influence of initial fraction of cooperators on the evolution of cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games. Compared with the results of heterogeneous networks, we find that there is a relatively low initial fraction of cooperators to guarantee higher equilibrium cooperative level. While this interesting phenomenon is contrary to the commonly shared knowledge that higher initial fraction of cooperators can provide better environment for the evolution of cooperation. To support our outcome, we explore the time courses of cooperation and find that the whole course can be divided into two sequent stages: enduring (END) and expanding (EXP) periods. At the end of END period, thought there is a limited number of cooperator clusters left for the case of low initial setup, these clusters can smoothly expand to hold the whole system in the EXP period. However, for high initial fraction of cooperators, superfluous cooperator clusters hinder their effective expansion, which induces many remaining defectors surrounding the cooperator clusters. Moreover, through intensive analysis, we also demonstrate that when the tendency of three cooperation cluster characteristics (cluster size, cluster number and cluster shape) are consistent within END and EXP periods, the state that maximizes cooperation can be favored."

Expansion of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is currently considered a consequence of intestinal inflammation. Whether VAT per se plays a role in early modifications of intestinal barrier remains unknown. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the direct role of adipocytes in regulating paracellular permeability of colonic epithelial cells (CECs). We show in adult rats born with intrauterine growth retardation, a model of VAT hypertrophy, and in rats with VAT graft on the colon, that colonic permeability was increased without any inflammation. This effect was associated with altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin and ZO-1. In coculture experiments, adipocytes decreased transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco-2 CECs and induced a disorganization of ZO-1 on TJs. Intraperitoneal administration of leptin to lean rats increased colonic epithelial permeability and altered ZO-1 expression and organization. Treatment of HT29-19A CECs with leptin, but not adiponectin, dose-dependently decreased TER and altered TJ and F-actin cytoskeleton organization through a RhoA-ROCK-dependent pathway. Our data show that adipocytes and leptin directly alter TJ function in CECs and suggest that VAT could impair colonic epithelial barrier."

Currently, the toxicology of tungsten is poorly understood, but mounting evidence suggests that both the elemental metal and its alloys have cytotoxic effects. Here, we investigate the association between tungsten and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or stroke using six waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods We investigated associations using crude and adjusted logistic regression models in a cohort of 8614 adults (18–74 years) with 193 reported stroke diagnoses and 428 reported diagnoses of CVD. We also stratified our data to characterize associations in a subset of younger individuals (18–50 years). Results Elevated tungsten concentrations were strongly associated with an increase in the prevalence of stroke, independent of typical risk factors (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.66, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 1.17, 2.34). The association between tungsten and stroke in the young age category was still evident (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.33, 3.53). Conclusion This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the human health effects of tungsten to date. Individuals with higher urinary tungsten concentrations have double the odds of reported stroke.

By focusing on three common opportunistic infections (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human papillomavirus, and cytomegalovirus), we investigate how differential depletion of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells impacts the natural history of these pathogens in HIV infection. A broader understanding of this relationship can better inform treatment strategies against copathogens. During HIV infection, the timing of opportunistic infections is not always associated with severity of CD4 T cell depletion, and different opportunistic pathogens reactivate at different CD4 T cell thresholds. Here, we examine how differences in the phenotype and function of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells influence susceptibility to HIV infection.

A broader understanding of this relationship can better inform treatment strategies against copathogens. Chronic, untreated HIV infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4 T cells, increasing the risk of coinfection with pathogens typically controlled by innate and adaptive immune responses. Though the mechanisms leading to CD4 T cell depletion are complex, susceptibility to opportunistic infections has generally been associated with progressive declines in CD4 T cell counts. However, the timing of opportunistic infections is not always associated with severity of CD4 depletion. Tuberculosis (TB) infection can reactivate when CD4 T cell counts are high, and infection with Candida species can occur at any CD4 T cell count (Figure 1). Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) halts HIV replication and raises CD4 T cell counts but does not always restore pathogen-specific immunity to normal levels. For example, HIV-positive individuals on ART with CD4 >700/mm3 have 4-fold higher rates of TB disease than HIV uninfected individuals in the same community (Gupta et al., 2012Gupta A. Wood R. Kaplan R. Bekker L.G. Lawn S.D. Tuberculosis incidence rates during 8 years of follow-up of an antiretroviral treatment cohort in South Africa: comparison with rates in the community.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34156Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The impact of ART on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been controversial, with some studies demonstrating reduced HPV prevalence and regression of HPV-associated squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), whereas others fail to show any impact on HPV-associated disease.(Adler, 2010Adler D.H. The impact of HAART on HPV-related cervical disease.Curr. HIV Res. 2010; 8: 493-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) It is thought that functional defects and depletion of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells by HIV occur at varying rates, accounting for differences in pathogenesis of specific opportunistic infections (Geldmacher and Koup, 2012Geldmacher C. Koup R.A. Pathogen-specific T cell depletion and reactivation of opportunistic pathogens in HIV infection.Trends Immunol. 2012; 33: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether differences in pathogenesis are due to differences in pathogen-specific CD4 T cell susceptibility to HIV infection or other factors. Here, we examine the immunopathogenesis of three infections causing substantial morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals: TB, HPV, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). We propose that understanding the complex interplay between HIV and these pathogens will provide insight into differences in disease prevalence and impact of ART on the natural history of infection. HIV and TB coinfection remains a serious global health problem. According to the World Health Organization, there were 8.7 million new cases of TB and 1.4 million deaths due to TB disease in 2011 (World Health Organization, 2012World Health OrganizationGlobal tuberculosis report.http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/Date: 2012Google Scholar). TB is a leading cause of death among HIV-infected individuals, especially in Africa, where >50% of deaths in persons with HIV are due to TB disease (Bates et al., 2013Bates M. Mudenda V. Mwaba P. Zumla A. Deaths due to respiratory tract infections in Africa: a review of autopsy studies.Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2013; 19: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). HIV is a leading risk factor for TB disease, with rates of active TB doubling within 1 year of HIV seroconversion and increasing >4-fold in chronic HIV infection (Lodi et al., 2013Lodi S. del Amo J. d’Arminio Monforte A. Abgrall S. Sabin C. Morrison C. Furrer H. Muga R. Porter K. Girardi E.

Although ART reduces the incidence of TB disease, rates of TB in individuals with reconstituted immune systems remain higher than in the general population (Gupta et al., 2012Gupta A. Wood R.

Tuberculosis incidence rates during 8 years of follow-up of an antiretroviral treatment cohort in South Africa: comparison with rates in the community.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34156Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that HIV infection induces functional defects in the immune response to TB that persist despite immune reconstitution. Interactions between the host’s innate and adaptive immune system and the organism dictate the outcome of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Although innate immune cells are an important component of the immune response to TB infection (van Crevel et al., 2003van Crevel R. Ottenhoff T.H. van der Meer J.W. Innate immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 531: 241-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is clear that T cells are essential for containing Mtb. Mice deficient in CD4 T cells have reduced survival and greater bacterial burden following aerosol exposure to Mtb than do their wild-type counterparts (Caruso et al., 1999Caruso A.M. Serbina N. Klein E. Triebold K. Bloom B.R. Flynn J.L. Mice deficient in CD4 T cells have only transiently diminished levels of IFN-gamma, yet succumb to tuberculosis.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5407-5416PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-mediated depletion of CD4 T cells in mice results in rapid reactivation of persistent TB infection and reduced survival (Mogues et al., 2001Mogues T. Goodrich M.E. Ryan L. LaCourse R. North R.J. The relative importance of T cell subsets in immunity and immunopathology of airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Similarly, nonhuman primates (NHP) depleted of CD4 T cells have an increased incidence of active TB disease following Mtb exposure and a higher rate of reactivation TB compared to non-CD4-depleted monkeys (Lin et al., 2012Lin P.L. Rutledge T. Green A.M. Bigbee M. Fuhrman C. Klein E. Flynn J.L. CD4 T cell depletion exacerbates acute Mycobacterium tuberculosis while reactivation of latent infection is dependent on severity of tissue depletion in cynomolgus macaques.AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2012; 28: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). SIV infection of NHP with latent TB infection results in reactivation of TB in all infected monkeys, albeit at different rates (Diedrich et al., 2010Diedrich C.R. Mattila J.T. Klein E. Janssen C. Phuah J. Sturgeon T.J. Montelaro R.C. Lin P.L. Flynn J.L. Reactivation of latent tuberculosis in cynomolgus macaques infected with SIV is associated with early peripheral T cell depletion and not virus load.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Monkeys reactivating earlier exhibited a greater initial decline in CD4/8 T cells following SIV infection and had fewer CD4 T cells within their airways. Taken together, these animal studies support the critical role that CD4 T cells play in controlling TB infection. Why are CD4 T cells important? For one, they are a major source of IFNγ, which is necessary for the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and for the killing of intracellular mycobacteria by macrophages. In fact, IFNγ specifically from CD4 T cells is required for a robust CD8 T cell response and for inhibiting intracellular replication of tubercle bacilli within macrophages (Green et al., 2013Green A.M. Difazio R. Flynn J.L. IFN-γ from CD4 T cells is essential for host survival and enhances CD8 T cell function during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The critical role of IFNγ in controlling Mtb is best demonstrated in mice devoid of IFNγ or with impaired IFNγ signaling, which rapidly succumb to TB disease (Flynn et al., 1993Flynn J.L. Chan J. Triebold K.J. Dalton D.K. Stewart T.A. Bloom B.R. An essential role for interferon gamma in resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Kamijo et al., 1993Kamijo R. Le J. Shapiro D. Havell E.A. Huang S. Aguet M. Bosland M. Vilcek J. Mice that lack the interferon-gamma receptor have profoundly altered responses to infection with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and subsequent challenge with lipopolysaccharide.J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the same vein, humans with mutations in genes encoding IFNγ receptor 1 or with polymorphisms in the IFNγ gene are at increased risk of mycobacterial disease (López-Maderuelo et al., 2003López-Maderuelo D. Arnalich F. Serantes R. González A. Codoceo R. Madero R. Vázquez J.J. Montiel C. Interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms in pulmonary tuberculosis.Am. J. Respir. Crit.

A mutation in the interferon-gamma-receptor gene and susceptibility to mycobacterial infection.N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). CD4 T cells are also crucial in maintaining the integrity and architecture of granulomas in TB infection (Heuts et al., 2013Heuts F. Gavier-Widén D. Carow B. Juarez J. Wigzell H. Rottenberg M.E. CD4+ cell-dependent granuloma formation in humanized mice infected with mycobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, Saunders et al., 2002Saunders B.M. Frank A.A. Orme I.M. Cooper A.M. CD4 is required for the development of a protective granulomatous response to pulmonary tuberculosis.Cell. Immunol. 2002; 216: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression of CXCR5, a chemokine receptor that is important in B and T cell homing to lymphoid tissue, appears to be an important mediator of CD4 T cell localization within granulomas, facilitating lymphoid follicle formation and better protective outcomes (Slight et al., 2013Slight S.R. Rangel-Moreno J. Gopal R. Lin Y. Fallert Junecko B.A. Mehra S. Selman M. Becerril-Villanueva E. Baquera-Heredia J. Pavon L. et al.CXCR5+ T helper cells mediate protective immunity against tuberculosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 712-726PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of chronic viral infections in animals and humans suggest that, with viral control, the ability of CD4/8 T cells to produce multiple cytokines (polyfunctional T cells) increases (Harari et al., 2005Harari A. Vallelian F. Meylan P.R. Pantaleo G. Functional heterogeneity of memory CD4 T cell responses in different conditions of antigen exposure and persistence.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Pantaleo and Harari, 2006Pantaleo G. Harari A. Functional signatures in antiviral T-cell immunity for monitoring virus-associated diseases.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whether this paradigm holds true for TB infection remains debatable. TB vaccine studies in animals have equated increased frequencies of polyfunctional T cells to protection from aerosol Mtb challenge (Aagaard et al., 2009Aagaard C. Hoang T.T. Izzo A. Billeskov R. Troudt J. Arnett K. Keyser A. Elvang T. Andersen P. Dietrich J. Protection and polyfunctional T cells induced by Ag85B-TB10.4/IC31 against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is highly dependent on the antigen dose.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Forbes et al., 2008Forbes E.K. Sander C. Ronan E.O. McShane H. Hill A.V. Beverley P.C. Tchilian E.Z. Multifunctional, high-level cytokine-producing Th1 cells in the lung, but not spleen, correlate with protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerosol challenge in mice.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyfunctional T cells are induced in humans following the administration of novel TB vaccine formulations (Abel et al., 2010Abel B. Tameris M. Mansoor N. Gelderbloem S. Hughes J. Abrahams D. Makhethe L. Erasmus M. de Kock M. van der Merwe L. et al.The novel tuberculosis vaccine, AERAS-402, induces robust and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in adults.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2010; 181: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Scriba et al., 2012Scriba T.J. Tameris M. Smit E. van der Merwe L. Hughes E.J. Kadira B. Mauff K. Moyo S. Brittain N. Lawrie A. et al.A phase IIa trial of the new tuberculosis vaccine, MVA85A, in HIV- and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected adults.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2012; 185: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but whether this results in enhanced protection remains to be seen. Individuals with smear-positive TB disease or untreated TB disease have reduced frequencies of polyfunctional CD4 T cells compared to individuals with smear-negative TB disease or with latent or treated TB infection (Day et al., 2011Day C.L. Abrahams D.A. Lerumo L. Janse van Rensburg E. Stone L. O’rie T. Pienaar B. de Kock M. Kaplan G. Mahomed H. et al.Functional capacity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T cell responses in humans is associated with mycobacterial load.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 2222-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Harari et al., 2011Harari A. Rozot V. Enders F.B. Perreau M. Stalder J.M. Nicod L.P. Cavassini M. Calandra T. Blanchet C.L.

Med. 2011; 17: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, as mycobacterial burden is reduced or controlled, T cell responses are characterized by the ability to produce multiple cytokines. However, not all authors have reached similar conclusions (Caccamo et al., 2010Caccamo N. Guggino G. Joosten S.A. Gelsomino G. Di Carlo P. Titone L. Galati D. Bocchino M. Matarese A. Salerno A. et al.Multifunctional CD4(+) T cells correlate with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.Eur. J.

Pattern and diversity of cytokine production differentiates between Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease.Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is possible that differences in methodology or patient populations may account for the discordant results. HIV coinfection adversely affects T cell responses to Mtb. Peripheral T cells from HIV-TB-coinfected individuals have impaired proliferation and have reduced IFNγ production in response to Mtb antigen stimulation compared to TB monoinfected patients.(Geldmacher et al., 2008Geldmacher C. Schuetz A. Ngwenyama N. Casazza J.P. Sanga E. Saathoff E. Boehme C. Geis S. Maboko L.

T cell cytokine responses in persons with tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus infection.J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar defects have been observed in Mtb-specific CD4 T cells isolated from lung lavage samples of HIV-infected individuals (Bonecini-Almeida et al., 1998Bonecini-Almeida Mda.G. Werneck-Barroso E.

HIV-1 infection impairs the bronchoalveolar T-cell response to mycobacteria.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2009; 180: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, HIV coinfection alters the quality of the T cell response, resulting in reduced frequencies of polyfunctional T cells (Day et al., 2008Day C.L. Mkhwanazi N. Reddy S. Mncube Z. van der Stok M. Klenerman P. Walker B.D. Detection of polyfunctional Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T cells and association with viral load in HIV-1-infected persons.J. Infect.

Care Med. 2009; 180: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). How soon after HIV infection are impairments in T cell responses seen? Dramatic decreases in Mtb-specific memory CD4 T cells (CD27+CD45RO+) were observed within 1 year of HIV seroconversion in four out of five individuals with latent TB infection (Geldmacher et al., 2008Geldmacher C. Schuetz A. Ngwenyama N. Casazza J.P. Sanga E. Saathoff E. Boehme C. Geis S. Maboko L. Singh M. et al.Early depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T helper 1 cell responses after HIV-1 infection.J. Infect. Dis. 2008; 198: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The early depletion of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells can be explained by distinct functional and phenotypic characteristics of these cells. First, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells have increased expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5, which also serves as a HIV coreceptor, leading to increased HIV entry into CD4 T cells (Geldmacher et al., 2010Geldmacher C. Ngwenyama N. Schuetz A. Petrovas C. Reither K. Heeregrave E.J. Casazza J.P. Ambrozak D.R. Louder M. Ampofo W. et al.Preferential infection and depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells after HIV-1 infection.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2869-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). More importantly, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells preferentially produce IL-2 upon stimulation. IL-2 production not only supports proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, but also promotes HIV replication (Geldmacher et al., 2010Geldmacher C. Ngwenyama N. Schuetz A. Petrovas C. Reither K. Heeregrave E.J. Casazza J.P. Ambrozak D.R. Louder M. Ampofo W. et al.Preferential infection and depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells after HIV-1 infection.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2869-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, CMV-specific CD4 T cells tend to secrete β chemokines, such as MIP-1β, which can reduce susceptibility to HIV infection by hindering HIV binding to CCR5. Lastly, most Mtb-specific CD4 T cells express CD27, a cell surface marker associated with an early differentiated phenotype and replicative potential. CMV-specific CD4 T cells, on the other hand, rarely express CD27 and more often express CD57 (Geldmacher and Koup, 2012Geldmacher C. Koup R.A. Pathogen-specific T cell depletion and reactivation of opportunistic pathogens in HIV infection.Trends Immunol. 2012; 33: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Antigen-specific CD4 T cells expressing CD57 are more terminally differentiated, having reduced proliferative capacity and thus harboring lower cellular HIV loads (Brenchley et al., 2004Brenchley J.M. Hill B.J. Ambrozak D.R. Price D.A. Guenaga F.J. Casazza J.P. Kuruppu J. Yazdani J. Migueles S.A. Connors M. et al.T-cell subsets that harbor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vivo: implications for HIV pathogenesis.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although we believe that the early depletion of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells following HIV infection is an important contributor to the increased risk of TB disease, other mechanisms increasing TB reactivation risk in HIV-TB-coinfected individuals should not be overlooked. HIV infection of macrophages reduces the apoptotic response to Mtb and downregulates macrophage autophagy (Patel et al., 2009Patel N.R. Swan K. Li X. Tachado S.D. Koziel H. Impaired M. tuberculosis-mediated apoptosis in alveolar macrophages from HIV+ persons: potential role of IL-10 and BCL-3.J. Leukoc.

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection inhibits autophagy.AIDS. 2008; 22: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This not only results in bacterial persistence, but also could limit antigen presentation to T cells. Observational studies have noted a high frequency of vitamin D deficiency among HIV-infected individuals, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with active TB disease (Viard et al., 2011Viard J.P. Souberbielle J.C. Kirk O. Reekie J. Knysz B. Losso M. Gatell J. Pedersen C. Bogner J.R. Lundgren J.D. Mocroft A.

Influence of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms on tuberculosis among Gujarati Asians in west London: a case-control study.Lancet. 2000; 355: 618-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, restricts Mtb growth by inducing the expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, which is important in the induction of macrophage autophagy (Campbell and Spector, 2012Campbell G.R. Spector S.A. Vitamin D inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in macrophages through the induction of autophagy.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002689Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2006Liu P.T.

Meinken C. et al.Toll-like receptor triggering of a vitamin D-mediated human antimicrobial response.Science. 2006; 311: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Finding ways to manipulate this pathway to modulate the host immune response to TB is of great interest. One additional factor contributing to increased TB risk is the genetic diversity of the pathogen itself. Strains of Mtb vary in their inhibition of innate immune responses and in virulence. A recent study suggests that strains of the modern lineage induce a lower inflammatory response, selecting for more rapid progression to active TB than strains of the ancient lineage (Portevin et al., 2011Portevin D. Gagneux S. Comas I. Young D. Human macrophage responses to clinical isolates from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex discriminate between ancient and modern lineages.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1001307Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further research on the immunobiology and clinical outcomes of various Mtb strains is needed to more fully understand the consequences of strain diversity in Mtb. Suppression of HIV replication by ART leads to increases in CD4 T cell count and demonstrable mortality and morbidity benefits in patients coinfected with TB. This is especially true in individuals with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3 if ART is started after 2 weeks of TB treatment (Havlir et al., 2011Havlir D.V. Kendall M.A. Ive P. Kumwenda J. Swindells S. Qasba S.S. Luetkemeyer A.F. Hogg E. Rooney J.F. Wu X. et al.AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study A5221Timing of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection and tuberculosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 1482-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). ART reduces the risk of TB disease by 67% (Lawn et al., 2011Lawn S.D. Harries A.D. Williams B.G. Chaisson R.E. Losina E. De Cock K.M. Wood R. Antiretroviral therapy and the control of HIV-associated tuberculosis. Will ART do it?.Int. J. of Tuberc. Lung Dis. 2011; 15: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This may be due to increases in naive and central memory CD4 T cell pools along with increases in IFNγ secretion or polyfunctional T cell responses following ART (Sutherland et al., 2010Sutherland J.S. Young J.M. Peterson K.L. Sanneh B. Whittle H.C. Rowland-Jones S.L. Adegbola R.A. Jaye A. Ota M.O.

Care Med. 2009; 180: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, despite HIV viral load suppression and reconstitution of CD4 T cell counts, ART-treated patients continue to have risks of TB disease that exceed that of the HIV-uninfected population (Girardi et al., 2005Girardi E. Sabin C.A. d’Arminio Monforte A. Hogg B. Phillips A.N. Gill M.J. Dabis F. Reiss P. Kirk O.

Dis. 2005; 41: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this is that ART does not restore Mtb-specific immune responses to levels observed in HIV-uninfected individuals (Schluger et al., 2002Schluger N.W. Perez D. Liu Y.M.

HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types is linked to development of dysplastic changes in the cervix, vulva, and anorectal regions. If persistent, these dysplastic changes can progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Infection with HIV is associated with an increased prevalence of HPV infection, infection with multiple HPV types, and increased incidence of cervical cancer and other anogenital malignancies (Luchters et al., 2010Luchters S.M.

Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we have shown overexpression of NAALADL2 in colon and prostate tumours when compared with benign tissue. In prostate cancer, NAALADL2 expression was associated with stage and Grade, as well as circulating mRNA levels of the NAALADL2 gene. Overexpression of NAALADL2 was shown to predict poor survival following radical prostatectomy. In contrast to PSMA/NAALAD1, NAALADL2 was localized at the basal cell surface where it promotes adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Using stable knockdown and overexpression cell lines, we have demonstrated NAALADL2-dependent changes in cell migration, invasion and colony-forming potential. Expression arrays of the knockdown and overexpression cell lines have identified nine genes that co-expressed with NAALADL2, which included membrane proteins and genes known to be androgen regulated, including the prostate cancer biomarkers AGR2 and SPON2. Androgen regulation was confirmed in a number of these genes, although NAALADL2 itself was not found to be androgen regulated. NAALADL2 was also found to regulate levels of Ser133 phosphorylated C-AMP-binding protein (CREB), a master regulator of a number of cellular processes involved in cancer development and progression. In combination, these data suggest that changes in expression of NAALADL2 can impact upon a number of pro-oncogenic pathways and processes, making it a useful biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1998396063,"Spore formation in Bacillus subtilis relies on a regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) pathway that synchronizes mother-cell and forespore development. To address the molecular basis of this SpoIV transmembrane signaling, we carried out a structure-function analysis of the activating protease CtpB. Crystal structures reflecting distinct functional states show that CtpB constitutes a ring-like protein scaffold penetrated by two narrow tunnels. Access to the proteolytic sites sequestered within these tunnels is controlled by PDZ domains that rearrange upon substrate binding. Accordingly, CtpB resembles a minimal version of a self-compartmentalizing protease regulated by a unique allosteric mechanism. Moreover, biochemical analysis of the PDZ-gated channel combined with sporulation assays reveal that activation of the SpoIV RIP pathway is induced by the concerted activity of CtpB and a second signaling protease, SpoIVB. This proteolytic mechanism is of broad relevance for cell-cell communication, illustrating how distinct signaling pathways can be integrated into a single RIP module."

Morphology, proliferative capacity, immunophenotype, differentiation potential, immunomodulatory properties and ability to support long-term hematopoiesis of ALL-MSCs were analysed and compared with those from 41 healthy donors (HD-MSCs). ALL-MSCs were also genetically characterized through array-CGH, conventional karyotyping and FISH analysis. Moreover, we compared ALL-MSCs generated at day+0 with those isolated during chemotherapy. Morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation potential and in vitro life-span did not differ between ALL-MSCs and HD-MSCs. ALL-MSCs showed significantly lower proliferative capacity (p<0.001) and ability to support in vitro hematopoiesis (p = 0.04) as compared with HD-MSCs, while they had similar capacity to inhibit in vitro mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation (p = N.S.). ALL-MSCs showed neither the typical translocations carried by the leukemic clone (when present), nor other genetic abnormalities acquired during ex vivo culture. Our findings indicate that ALL-MSCs display reduced ability to proliferate and to support long-term hematopoiesis in vitro. ALL-MSCs isolated at diagnosis do not differ from those obtained during treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2082988042,"Previous studies on mitochondrial DNA analysis of sheep from different regions of the world have revealed the presence of two major- A and B, and three minor- C, D and E maternal lineages. Lineage A is more frequent in Asia and lineage B is more abundant in regions other than Asia. We have analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequences of 330 sheep from 12 different breeds of India. Neighbor-joining analysis revealed lineage A, B and C in Indian sheep. Surprisingly, multidimensional scaling plot based on FST values of control region of mtDNA sequences showed significant breed differentiation in contrast to poor geographical structuring reported earlier in this species. The breed differentiation in Indian sheep was essentially due to variable contribution of two major lineages to different breeds, and sub- structuring of lineage A, possibly the latter resulting from genetic drift. Nucleotide diversity of this lineage was higher in Indian sheep (0.014 ± 0.007) as compared to that of sheep from other regions of the world (0.009 ± 0.005 to 0.01 ± 0.005). Reduced median network analysis of control region and cytochrome b gene sequences of Indian sheep when analyzed along with available published sequences of sheep from other regions of the world showed that several haplotypes of lineage A were exclusive to Indian sheep. Given the high nucleotide diversity in Indian sheep and the poor sharing of lineage A haplotypes between Indian and non-Indian sheep, we propose that lineage A sheep has also been domesticated in the east of Near East, possibly in Indian sub-continent. Finally, our data provide support that lineage B and additional lineage A haplotypes of sheep might have been introduced to Indian sub-continent from Near East, probably by ancient sea trade route."
https://openalex.org/W2062761325,"We show that expression of the microtubule depolymerizing kinesin KIF2C is induced by transformation of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) by expression of K-RasG12V and knockdown of p53. Further investigation demonstrates that this is due to the K-Ras/ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, as loss of p53 had little effect on KIF2C expression. In addition to KIF2C, we also found that the related kinesin KIF2A is modestly upregulated in this model system; both proteins are expressed more highly in many lung cancer cell lines compared to normal tissue. As a consequence of their depolymerizing activity, these kinesins increase dynamic instability of microtubules. Depletion of either of these kinesins impairs the ability of cells transformed with mutant K-Ras to migrate and invade matrigel. However, depletion of these kinesins does not reverse the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) caused by mutant K-Ras. Our studies indicate that increased expression of microtubule destabilizing factors can occur during oncogenesis to support enhanced migration and invasion of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062359261,"A decade ago, DNA barcoding was proposed as a standardised method for identifying existing species and speeding the discovery of new species. Yet, despite its numerous successes across a range of taxa, its frequent failures have brought into question its accuracy as a short-cut taxonomic method. We use a retrospective approach, applying the method to the classification of New Zealand skinks as it stood in 1977 (primarily based upon morphological characters), and compare it to the current taxonomy reached using both morphological and molecular approaches. For the 1977 dataset, DNA barcoding had moderate-high success in identifying specimens (78-98%), and correctly flagging specimens that have since been confirmed as distinct taxa (77-100%). But most matching methods failed to detect the species complexes that were present in 1977. For the current dataset, there was moderate-high success in identifying specimens (53-99%). For both datasets, the capacity to discover new species was dependent on the methodological approach used. Species delimitation in New Zealand skinks was hindered by the absence of either a local or global barcoding gap, a result of recent speciation events and hybridisation. Whilst DNA barcoding is potentially useful for specimen identification and species discovery in New Zealand skinks, its error rate could hinder the progress of documenting biodiversity in this group. We suggest that integrated taxonomic approaches are more effective at discovering and describing biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2080771720,"Background Emergency department discharge instructions are variably understood by patients, and in the setting of emergency department crowding, innovations are needed to counteract shortened interaction times with the physician. We evaluated the effect of viewing an online video of diagnosis-specific discharge instructions on patient comprehension and recall of instructions. Methods In this prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial conducted between November 2011 and January 2012, we randomized emergency department patients who were discharged with one of 38 diagnoses to either view (after they left the emergency department) a vetted online video of diagnosis-specific discharge instructions, or to usual care. Patients were subsequently contacted by telephone and asked three standardized questions about their discharge instructions; one point was awarded for each correct answer. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, differences between groups were assessed using univariate testing, and with logistic regression that accounted for clustering on managing physician. A secondary outcome measure was patient satisfaction with the videos, on a 10-point scale. Results Among 133 patients enrolled, mean age was 46.1 (s.d.D. 21.5) and 55% were female. Patients in the video group had 19% higher mean scores (2.5, s.d. 0.7) than patients in the control group (2.1, s.d. 0.8) (p=0.002). After adjustment for patient age, sex, first language, triage acuity score, and clustering, the odds of achieving a fully correct score (3 out of 3) were 3.5 (95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2) times higher in the video group, compared to the control group. Among those who viewed the videos, median rating of the videos was 10 (IQR 8 to 10). Conclusions In this single-center trial, patients who viewed an online video of their discharge instructions scored higher on their understanding of key concepts around their diagnosis and subsequent care. Those who viewed the videos found them to be a helpful addition to standard care.

https://openalex.org/W2063760854,"This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combination treatment with lenalidomide and cetuximab in KRAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer patients. This was a phase II multicenter, open-label trial comprising a safety lead-in phase (phase IIa) to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and a randomized proof of concept phase (phase IIb) to determine the response rate of lenalidomide plus cetuximab combination therapy. Phase IIa treatment comprised oral lenalidomide (starting dose 25 mg/day) and intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 followed by weekly 250 mg/m2) in 28-day cycles. In phase IIb patients were randomized to either the phase IIa treatment schedule of lenalidomide plus cetuximab combination therapy or lenalidomide 25 mg/day monotherapy. Eight patients were enrolled into phase IIa. One patient developed a dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide was determined at 25 mg/day. Forty-three patients were enrolled into phase IIb proof of concept. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and study enrollment was terminated prematurely due to lack of efficacy in both treatment arms and failure to achieve the planned response objective. The majority of adverse events were grade 1 and 2. In both phases, the adverse events most commonly attributed to any study drugs were fatigue, rash and other skin disorders, diarrhea, nausea, and stomatitis. Thirty-nine deaths occurred; none was related to study drug. The combination of lenalidomide and cetuximab appeared to be well tolerated but did not have clinically meaningful activity in KRAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer patients.

https://openalex.org/W2096905306,"Snapping shrimp use one oversized claw to generate a cavitating high speed water jet for hunting, defence and communication. This work is an experimental investigation about the jet generation. Snapping shrimp (Alpheus-bellulus) were investigated by using an enlarged transparent model reproducing the closure of the snapper claw. Flow inside the model was studied using both High-Speed Particle Image Velocimetry (HS-PIV) and flow visualization. During claw closure a channel-like cavity was formed between the plunger and the socket featuring a nozzle-type contour at the orifice. Closing the mechanism led to the formation of a leading vortex ring with a dimensionless formation number of approximate ΔT*≈4. This indicates that the claw might work at maximum efficiency, i.e. maximum vortex strength was achieved by a minimum of fluid volume ejected. The subsequent vortex cavitation with the formation of an axial reentrant jet is a reasonable explanation for the large penetration depth of the water jet. That snapping shrimp can reach with their claw-induced flow. Within such a cavitation process, an axial reentrant jet is generated in the hollow cylindrical core of the cavitated vortex that pushes the front further downstream and whose length can exceed the initial jet penetration depth by several times."
https://openalex.org/W2086378543,"Inhabitants of arid ecosystems face severe nitrogen and water limitations. Inventive adaptations by organisms occupying such habitats are essential for survival. This study describes a tri-party symbiotic interaction between a plant (Salsola inermis), a beetle (Conorhynchus pistor), and a bacterium (Klebsiella pneumonia). The weevil survives by living within a mud structure affixed to the plant roots, thus benefiting from increased carbon and water, and refuge from predators and parasites. Active nitrogen-fixing bacteria harbored within the weevil's gut mediate this interaction, by supplying nitrogen to the system, which eventually promotes seed development. We studied the correlation between the weevil's existence and (i) root carbon and nitrogen content, (ii) soil water content and (iii) seed weight. Roots hosting weevils contained more nitrogen, heavier seeds and less carbon. In addition, water content was higher around the roots than in open spaces a short distance from the plant stem. Bacterial studies and nitrogen-fixation analyses, including molecular and chemical assays, indicated atmospheric nitrogen fixation in the larval stage and identified the bacterium. The coexistence of weevil and bacterial behavior coinciding with the plant's life cycle was revealed here by a long period of field observations. Out of over 60,000 known weevils, this is the only report of a weevil living most of its life underground without harming plants. The unique tri-party interaction described herein shows the important ecological role of desert plant roots and provides an example of a sustainable consortium of living organisms coping with the challenging desert environment."
https://openalex.org/W1979580811,"Despite the success of vaccines against some microbial pathogens, their utility in the prevention and treatment of cancer has thus far been limited. We have previously demonstrated that vaccination with dendritic cells activated with the TLR-4 ligand LPS and IFN-γ promotes an antigen-specific anti-tumor response that prevents tumor recurrence. To evaluate this mechanistically, we here studied the effects of this TLR-activated DC on regulatory T cell activity. Dendritic cells activated with LPS and IFN- γ negated the effects of regulatory T cells on responder cell proliferation. Restoration of responder cell proliferation was noted when TLR-activated dendritic cells were separated from both regulators and responders by a semi-permeable membrane. The effect is therefore mediated by a soluble factor but was independent of both IL-6 and IL-12. Furthermore, the soluble mediator appeared to act at least in part on the regulators themselves rather than responder cells exclusively. Because recent studies have demonstrated conversion of T regulatory cells into IL-17-producing effectors, we further questioned whether the TLR-activated dendritic cell would induce cytokine production and effector function in our system. We found that regulators produced a substantial amount of IFN- γ in the presence of TLR-activated dendritic cells but not immature dendritic cells. IFN-γ production was associated with upregulation of the Th1 transcriptional regulator T-bet, and a significant fraction of IFN-γ-producing regulators coexpressed T-bet and FoxP3. While the effects of the LPS-activated dendritic cell on responder cell proliferation were IL-12 independent, upregulation of T-bet was inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody. Collectively, these and prior data suggest that varying innate immune signals may direct the phenotype of the immune response in part by inhibiting suppressor T cells and promoting differentiation of these regulators into particular subsets of effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2021710199,"To assess the prevalence and determinants of haematinic deficiency (lack of B12 folate or iron) and macrocytosis in blood from a national population-based study of middle-aged and older adults.A cross-sectional study involving 1,207 adults aged ≥45 years, recruited from a sub-study of the Irish National Survey of Lifestyle Attitudes and Nutrition (SLÁN 2007). Participants completed a health and lifestyle questionnaire and a standard food frequency questionnaire. Non-fasting blood samples were obtained for measurement of full blood count and expert morphological assessment, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor assay (sTfR), B12, folate and coeliac antibodies. Blood samples were also assayed for thyroid function (T4, TSH), liver function, aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).The overall prevalence (95% C.I.) of anaemia (Hb <13.5 g/dl men and 11.3 g/dl women) was 4.6% (2.9%-6.4%) in men and 1.0% (0.2%-1.9%) in women. Iron deficiency (ferritin <17 ng/ml men and <11 ng/ml in women) was detected in 6.3% of participants (3.7% in males and 8.7% in females, p<0.001). Based on both low ferritin and raised sTfR (>21 nmol/ml) only 2.3% were iron-deficient. 3.0% and 2.7% were found to have low levels of serum folate (<2.3 ng/ml) and serum B12 (<120 ng/l) respectively. Clinically significant macrocytosis (MCV>99fl) was detected in 8.4% of subjects. Strong, significant and independent associations with macrocytosis were observed for lower social status, current smoking status, moderate to heavy alcohol intake, elevated GGT levels, deficiency of folate and vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and coeliac disease. The population attributable fraction (PAF) for macrocytosis associated with elevated GGT (25.0%) and smoking (24.6%) was higher than for excess alcohol intake (6.3%), folate deficiency (10.5%) or vitamin B12 (3.4%).Haematinic deficiency and macrocytosis are common in middle-aged/older adults in Ireland. Macrocytosis is more likely to be attributable to an elevated GGT and smoking than vitamin B12 or folate deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2045828713,"Translation is an important step in gene expression. The initiation of translation is phylogenetically diverse, since currently five different initiation mechanisms are known. For bacteria the three initiation factors IF1 - IF3 are described in contrast to archaea and eukaryotes, which contain a considerably higher number of initiation factor genes. As eukaryotes and archaea use a non-overlapping set of initiation mechanisms, orthologous proteins of both domains do not necessarily fulfill the same function. The genome of Haloferax volcanii contains 14 annotated genes that encode (subunits of) initiation factors. To gain a comprehensive overview of the importance of these genes, it was attempted to construct single gene deletion mutants of all genes. In 9 cases single deletion mutants were successfully constructed, showing that the respective genes are not essential. In contrast, the genes encoding initiation factors aIF1, aIF2γ, aIF5A, aIF5B, and aIF6 were found to be essential. Factors aIF1A and aIF2β are encoded by two orthologous genes in H. volcanii. Attempts to generate double mutants failed in both cases, indicating that also these factors are essential. A translatome analysis of one of the single aIF2β deletion mutants revealed that the translational efficiency of the second ortholog was enhanced tenfold and thus the two proteins can replace one another. The phenotypes of the single deletion mutants also revealed that the two aIF1As and aIF2βs have redundant but not identical functions. Remarkably, the gene encoding aIF2α, a subunit of aIF2 involved in initiator tRNA binding, could be deleted. However, the mutant had a severe growth defect under all tested conditions. Conditional depletion mutants were generated for the five essential genes. The phenotypes of deletion mutants and conditional depletion mutants were compared to that of the wild-type under various conditions, and growth characteristics are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2078202263,"Structural motions along a reaction pathway hold the secret about how a biological macromolecule functions. If each static structure were considered as a snapshot of the protein molecule in action, a large collection of structures would constitute a multidimensional conformational space of an enormous size. Here I present a joint analysis of hundreds of known structures of human hemoglobin in the Protein Data Bank. By applying singular value decomposition to distance matrices of these structures, I demonstrate that this large collection of structural snapshots, derived under a wide range of experimental conditions, arrange orderly along a reaction pathway. The structural motions along this extensive trajectory, including several helical transformations, arrive at a reverse engineered mechanism of the cooperative machinery (Ren, companion article), and shed light on pathological properties of the abnormal homotetrameric hemoglobins from α-thalassemia. This method of meta-analysis provides a general approach to structural dynamics based on static protein structures in this post genomics era."

Fishers often regard cormorants as an unwanted ""satellite species"", but the degree of direct competition and overlap in size-specific selectivity between fishers and cormorants is unknown. This study showed negligible overlap in selectivity between Great Cormorants and legal-sized commercial nets. The selectivity estimation method has general application potential for use in conjunction with population dynamics models to assess fish population responses to size-selective fishing from a wide range of piscivorous predators."
https://openalex.org/W1995864165,"The tolerable duration of continuous high-intensity exercise is determined by the hyperbolic Speed-tolerable duration (S-tLIM) relationship. However, application of the S-tLIM relationship to normalize the intensity of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has yet to be considered, with this the aim of present study. Subjects completed a ramp-incremental test, and series of 4 constant-speed tests to determine the S-tLIM relationship. A sub-group of subjects (n = 8) then repeated 4 min bouts of exercise at the speeds predicted to induce intolerance at 4 min (WR4), 6 min (WR6) and 8 min (WR8), interspersed with bouts of 4 min recovery, to the point of exercise intolerance (fixed WR HIIT) on different days, with the aim of establishing the work rate that could be sustained for 960 s (i.e. 4×4 min). A sub-group of subjects (n = 6) also completed 4 bouts of exercise interspersed with 4 min recovery, with each bout continued to the point of exercise intolerance (maximal HIIT) to determine the appropriate protocol for maximizing the amount of high-intensity work that can be completed during 4×4 min HIIT. For fixed WR HIIT tLIM of HIIT sessions was 399±81 s for WR4, 892±181 s for WR6 and 1517±346 s for WR8, with total exercise durations all significantly different from each other (P<0.050). For maximal HIIT, there was no difference in tLIM of each of the 4 bouts (Bout 1: 229±27 s; Bout 2: 262±37 s; Bout 3: 235±49 s; Bout 4: 235±53 s; P>0.050). However, there was significantly less high-intensity work completed during bouts 2 (153.5±40. 9 m), 3 (136.9±38.9 m), and 4 (136.7±39.3 m), compared with bout 1 (264.9±58.7 m; P>0.050). These data establish that WR6 provides the appropriate work rate to normalize the intensity of HIIT between subjects. Maximal HIIT provides a protocol which allows the relative contribution of the work rate profile to physiological adaptations to be considered during alternative intensity-matched HIIT protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2075877862,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/cancer-initiating cells (CICs) are defined as a small population of cancer cells that have self-renewal ability, differentiation ability and high tumor-initiating ability. CSCs/CICs are resistant to cancer therapies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, CSCs/CICs are thought to be responsible for cancer recurrence and distant metastasis after treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms of CSCs/CICs are still elusive. In this study, we isolated CSCs/CICs as side population (SP) cells from lung carcinoma, colon carcinoma and breast carcinoma cells and analyzed the molecular mechanisms of CSCs/CICs. cDNA micro-array screening and RT-PCR analysis revealed that sperm mitochondria-associated cysteine-rich protein (SMCP) is ectopically expressed in SP cells. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) analysis revealed that the SMCP transcript in SP cells was a variant form (termed vt2) which is composed from only one exon. SMCP vt2 was detected in only cancer cells, whereas the wild-type (vt1) form of SMCP was expressed in the testis. SMCP was shown to have a role in tumor initiation by SMCP overexpression and SMCP knockdown using siRNAs in lung cancer cells. Taken together, the initiation results indicate that an ectopically expressed variant form of SMCP has a role in tumor initiation of CSCs/CICs and that the variant form of SMCP might be a novel CSC/CIC marker and a potential and promising target of CSC/CIC-targeting therapy."

Bone density was measured using lateral DEXA scans and parts of samples were performed with partial or entire endplate removal. All the specimens were divided into three BMD groups. According to endplate integrity of the lumbar vertebrae, each BMD group was then divided into three subgroups: subgroup A: intact endplate; subgroup B: central region of endplate removal; subgroup C: entire endplate removal. The axial compression test was conducted with material testing system at a speed of 2mm/min. The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 17.0.(1) Significant differences of biomechanical properties occurred among normal BMD, osteoporotic and serious osteoporotic group (P<0.05). (2) Spearman analysis showed that BMD was positively correlated with the failure load and stiffness of lumbar vertebrae. (3) For each BMD group, significant differences of biomechanical properties were found between subgroup A and C, and between subgroup B and C (P<0.05). (4) For each BMD group, there was no statistical difference of biomechanical properties between subgroup A and B (P>0.05).Entire endplate removal can significantly decrease the structural properties of lumbar vertebrae with little change in biomechanical properties by preservation of peripheral region of the endplate.

https://openalex.org/W2004810103,"A general model of species diversity predicts that the latter is maximized when productivity and disturbance are balanced. Based on this model, we hypothesized that the response of bacterial diversity to the ratio of viral to bacterial production (VP/BP) would be dome-shaped. In order to test this hypothesis, we obtained data on changes in bacterial communities (determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S rRNA gene) along a wide VP/BP gradient (more than two orders of magnitude), using seawater incubations from NW Mediterranean surface waters, i.e., control and treatments with additions of phosphate, viruses, or both. In December, one dominant Operational Taxonomic Unit accounted for the major fraction of total amplified DNA in the phosphate addition treatment (75±20%, ± S.D.), but its contribution was low in the phosphate and virus addition treatment (23±19%), indicating that viruses prevented the prevalence of taxa that were competitively superior in phosphate-replete conditions. In contrast, in February, the single taxon predominance in the community was held in the phosphate addition treatment even with addition of viruses. We observed statistically robust dome-shaped response patterns of bacterial diversity to VP/BP, with significantly high bacterial diversity at intermediate VP/BP. This was consistent with our model-based hypothesis, indicating that bacterial production and viral-induced mortality interactively affect bacterial diversity in seawater."
https://openalex.org/W2089847016,"Background Respondent-driven-sampling (RDS) has well been recognized as a method for sampling from most hard-to-reach populations like commercial sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men. However the feasibility of this sampling strategy in terms of recruiting a diverse spectrum of these hidden populations has not been understood well yet in developing countries. Methods In a cross sectional study in Nanjing city of Jiangsu province of China, 430 MSM were recruited including 9 seeds in 14 weeks of study period using RDS. Information regarding socio-demographic characteristics and sexual risk behavior were collected and testing was done for HIV and syphilis. Duration, completion, participant characteristics and the equilibrium of key factors were used for assessing feasibility of RDS. Homophily of key variables, socio-demographic distribution and social network size were used as the indicators of diversity. Results In the study sample, adjusted HIV and syphilis prevalence were 6.6% and 14.6% respectively. Majority (96.3%) of the participants were recruited by members of their own social network. Although there was a tendency for recruitment within the same self-identified group (homosexuals recruited 60.0% homosexuals), considerable cross-group recruitment (bisexuals recruited 52.3% homosexuals) was also seen. Homophily of the self-identified sexual orientations was 0.111 for homosexuals. Upon completion of the recruitment process, participant characteristics and the equilibrium of key factors indicated that RDS was feasible for sampling MSM in Nanjing. Participants recruited by RDS were found to be diverse after assessing the homophily of key variables in successive waves of recruitment, the proportion of characteristics after reaching equilibrium and the social network size. The observed design effects were nearly the same or even better than the theoretical design effect of 2. Conclusion RDS was found to be an efficient and feasible sampling method for recruiting a diverse sample of MSM in a reasonable time."
https://openalex.org/W2005616096,"It has been suggested that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism modulates episodic memory performance via effects on hippocampal neural circuitry. However, fMRI studies have yielded inconsistent results in this respect. Moreover, very few studies have examined the effect of met allele load on activation of memory circuitry. In the present study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the BDNF polymorphism on brain responses during episodic memory encoding and retrieval, including an investigation of the effect of met allele load on memory related activation in the medial temporal lobe. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an effect of BDNF genotype or met load during episodic memory encoding. Met allele carriers showed increased activation during successful retrieval in right hippocampus but this was contrast-specific and unaffected by met allele load. These results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism does not, as previously claimed, exert an observable effect on neural systems underlying encoding of new information into episodic memory but may exert a subtle effect on the efficiency with which such information can be retrieved."
