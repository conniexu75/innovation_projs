https://openalex.org/W2007757256,"Approximately 75 grams of biogenetic opal were isolated from 45 kilograms of soil by employing gross particle-size and sink-float specific gravity fractionation procedures. After pretreatment of the sample to remove extraneous organic and inorganic carbon contaminants, the carbon occluded within opal phytoliths was dated at 13,300 Â± 450 years before the present. Therefore, biogenetic opal is stable for relatively long periods."
https://openalex.org/W2043923118,"Seeds of the arctic tundra lupine (Lupinus arcticus) at least 10,000 years old were found in lemming burrows deeply buried in permanently frozen silt of Pleistocene age in unglaciated central Yukon. They readily germinated in the laboratory and have since grown into normal, healthy plants."
https://openalex.org/W1977419618,Two rapid and simple methods have been developed for determining the approximate cooling rates of iron and stony-iron meteorites in which kamacite formed by diffusion-controlled growth along planar fronts. The first method requires only measurements of the mean kamacite bandwidth and the bulk nickel content. The second method requires the determination of the nickel composition near the taenite-kamacite interface with an electron microprobe.
https://openalex.org/W2083669803,"Optical observations of Venus have yielded various values of the rotation period extending from less than one to several hundred days. Radar observations give a retrograde rotation of the solid globe in 244 +/- 2 days. Recent ultraviolet photographs, however, show relatively rapid displacements of clouds in the high atmosphere of Venus which suggest a retrogrode rotation in only 5 days. The two rates seem to be physically incompatible."

https://openalex.org/W2067424271,"This is the first report of an amphibole mineral found in any meteorite. The amphibole richterite (soda tremolite), Na2Ca(Mg,Fe)5Si8O22(OH,F)2, occurs as a primary (preterrestrial) mineral enclosed within graphite nodules in the iron meteorite from Wichita County, Texas."

https://openalex.org/W2084683080,"An extract of immature Wealthy apple seeds, containing substances with gibberellin activity, was applied to unpollinated blossoms of the same variety, resulting in the production of mature seedless fruits. The implications with respect to the normal process of fruit-set are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2054028451,"The small magnetic field strength observed near Mars by Mariner IV suggests that protons from the solar wind may enter the Martian atmosphere and produce ionization in addition to that produced by ultraviolet light and x-rays. It is found that solar protons produce a thin ionized layer at a rate of the order of 3 x 10(3) per cubic centimeter per second at a depth corresponding to the F(1) region in the terrestrial atmosphere. Unless the effective recombinative coefficient is very large (greater than 10(-5) centimeter cubed per second) or unless unusual diffusion effects are present, this layer should have been detected by Mariner IV, and therefore must be present in one of the observed ionized regions. Because of its very compact shape, the subsidiary maximum near 95 kilometers discovered in the Mariner-IV occultation experiment may be the proton ionization peak. If so, the major 120-kilometer maximum is an F(2) layer. Distinction between photon and proton ionization regions can be made by microwave occultation experiments aboard planetary orbiters."
