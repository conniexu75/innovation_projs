https://openalex.org/W2968415893,"Additional forms of pre-exposure prophylaxis are needed to prevent HIV-1 infection. 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies that target non-overlapping epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope. We investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of the intravenous administration of the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in healthy adults.This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center, phase 1 study enrolled healthy adults aged 18-65 years to receive one infusion of 3BNC117 immediately followed by 10-1074 at 10 mg/kg, three infusions of 3BNC117 followed by 10-1074 at 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks, or placebo infusions. The primary outcomes were safety and pharmacokinetics. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02824536.Twenty-four participants were enrolled in a 3:1 ratio to receive the study products or placebo. The combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 was safe and generally well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events considered related to the infusions. The mean elimination half-lives of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 were 16.4 ± 4.6 days and 23.0 ± 5.4 days, respectively, similar to what was observed in previous studies in which each antibody was administered alone. Anti-drug antibody responses were rare and without evidence of related adverse events or impact on elimination kinetics.Single and repeated doses of the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 were well tolerated in healthy adults. These data support the further development of the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 as a long-acting injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV-1 infection."

Constructing functional networks composed of separate excitatory and inhibitory neurons obeying Dale's law presents a number of challenges. We show how a target-based approach, when combined with a fast online constrained optimization technique, is capable of building functional models of rate and spiking recurrent neural networks in which excitation and inhibition are balanced. Balanced networks can be trained to produce complicated temporal patterns and to solve input-output tasks while retaining biologically desirable features such as Dale's law and response variability."
https://openalex.org/W2968516867,"The increasing challenge of antibiotic resistance requires not only the discovery of new antibiotics, but also the development of new alternative approaches. Herein, the synergistic antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles and hydrogen peroxide combination is reported. Unlike the bacteriostatic or slightly bactericidal activity achieved by using each agent alone, using these two agents in combination, even at relatively low concentrations, resulted in complete eradication of both the Gram negative Escherichia coli and the Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus in short treatment times indicating a clear synergistic effect between them. Modifying the surface chemistry of silver nanoparticles and the accompanied change in their surface charge enabled a further enhancement of such synergistic effect implying the importance of this aspect. Mechanistically, a Fenton-like reaction between silver nanoparticles and hydrogen peroxide is discussed and hypothesized to be the basis of the observed synergy. Achieving such a significant antibacterial activity at low concentrations reduces the potential toxicity of these agents and hence enables their utilization as an alternative antibacterial approach in wider range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2967836450,"Local climate conditions play a major role in the biology of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main vector responsible for transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever in urban centers. For this reason, a detailed assessment of periods in which changes in climate conditions affect the number of human cases may improve the timing of vector-control efforts. In this work, we develop new machine-learning algorithms to analyze climate time series and their connection to the occurrence of dengue epidemic years for seven Brazilian state capitals. Our method explores the impact of two key variables—frequency of precipitation and average temperature—during a wide range of time windows in the annual cycle. Our results indicate that each Brazilian state capital considered has its own climate signatures that correlate with the overall number of human dengue-cases. However, for most of the studied cities, the winter preceding an epidemic year shows a strong predictive power. Understanding such climate contributions to the vector’s biology could lead to more accurate prediction models and early warning systems."
https://openalex.org/W2968220644,"Urinary excretion of two orally-administered non-metabolizable sugars, lactulose and mannitol, is a valuable marker for evaluating intestinal permeability. Usually this test involves a time consuming procedure of about 5 hour’s urine collection, which makes the test incompatible to some extent. As the results are expressed as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovered in urine within certain time, it may be possible to get similar result despite the reduced urine collection time of 2 hours. Moreover, different laboratories do the test by different methods, which make the results incomparable between laboratories. Here, we are also trying to find the correlation between results from most commonly used methods: HPAE-PAD and LC-MSMS. The lactulose: mannitol (LM) test was performed in a cohort of Bangladeshi infants considered at-risk for environmental enteropathy. 208 urine specimens from 104 (52 male and 52 female) infants were collected at 2 and 5 hours after LM solution administration and were tested for lactulose and mannitol by two different methods, one HPAE-PAD platform and another LC-MSMS platform. Median age of the children was 15.0 months (range 6.9 to 25.8 months) and their mean weight-for-age z-score was -0.92. A higher percentage of lactulose and mannitol recovery was found in 5 hours urine collection than in the corresponding 2 hours by both HPAE-PAD and LC-MSMS method, but when results were expressed as lactulose to mannitol ratio (LMR) there was no significant difference between 2 and 5 hours urine collection in both HPAE-PAD (P = 0.138) and LC-MSMS (P = 0.099) method. LMR based on 2 hours urine collection correlated well with LMR based on traditional 5 hours urine collection (Spearman’s correlation coefficient 0.578 and 0.604 respectively for HPAE-PAD and LC-MSMS). In future, LM test to assess intestinal permeability in children can be simplified by shortening the urine collection time from 5 hours to 2 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2967267484,"Tropical forests are declining at unprecedented rates in favour of agriculture, and streams can be severely impacted due to effects of multiple stressors that have rarely been considered together in tropical studies. We studied the effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural practices (pesticide toxicity, nutrient enrichment and habitat alteration-quantified as TUmax, soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and sedimentation, respectively) on macroinvertebrate communities in a tropical catchment in Panama (13 stream sites sampled in 20 occasions from 2015 to 2017, with 260 samples in total). We examined how macroinvertebrate abundance, taxonomic richness, community composition and biotic indices (SPEAR and BMWP/PAN, which were specifically designed to detect pesticide toxicity and nutrient enrichment, respectively) varied depending on the studied stressors, considering their single and combined effects. Our analyses revealed significant effects of the studied stressors on macroinvertebrate communities, with two particular results that merit further attention: (1) the fact that pesticide toxicity affected BMWP/PAN, but not SPEAR, possibly because the former had been adapted for local fauna; and (2) that most stressors showed antagonistic interactions (i.e., lower combined effects than expected from their individual effects). These results highlight the need for toxicity bioassays with tropical species that allow adaptations of biotic indices, and of observational and manipulative studies exploring the combined effects of multiple stressors on tropical macroinvertebrate communities and ecosystems, in order to predict and manage future anthropogenic impacts on tropical streams."
https://openalex.org/W2967762425,"Crayfish plague, caused by the pathogen Aphanomyces astaci, is one of the main factors responsible for the decimation of the native European crayfish species Austropotamobius pallipes. In Spain, two North American freshwater crayfish species, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, were intentionally introduced during the 1970s for aquaculture and fishery purposes. Since then, incidences of crayfish plague have been continually reported. In this work, we evaluated more than 50 diagnosed cases of crayfish plague that have occurred in the Iberian Peninsula since 2004 by performing a microscopic examination of infected specimens and by molecularly identifying and haplotyping the pathogen. Our results showed that (i) the pathogen A. astaci has been active 45 years since the first introductions of the invasive North American crayfish species in the Iberian Peninsula, and (ii) P. clarkii and P. leniusculus are chronic reservoirs of the crayfish plague pathogen. Moreover, our data confirmed a correspondence between pathogen origin and spread and the specific haplotypes carried by the North American invasive crayfish located in the vicinity of each outbreak. We generated a crayfish plague incidence map of the Iberian Peninsula that shows (i) a northern area, mainly inhabited by alien P. leniusculus, where crayfish plague cases are associated with the b-haplotype specific to P. leniusculus, and (ii) southern, central and eastern areas that are basically inhabited by alien P. clarkii, where crayfish plague cases are associated with the d1- and d2-haplotypes specific to P. clarkii. The results presented here are evidence of the long standing and negative impact of the two invasive crayfish species on the native species, indicating the need for more extensive control measures."
https://openalex.org/W2967207422,"Fetida Cave is an active sulfuric acid cave influenced by seawater, showing abundant microbial communities that organize themselves under three main different morphologies: water filaments, vermiculations and moonmilk deposits. These biofilms/deposits have different cave distribution, pH, macro- and microelement and mineralogical composition, carbon and nitrogen content. In particular, water filaments and vermiculations had circumneutral and slightly acidic pH, respectively, both had abundant organic carbon and high microbial diversity. They were rich in macro- and microelements, deriving from mineral dissolution, and, in the case of water filaments, from seawater composition. Vermiculations had different color, partly associated with their mineralogy, and unusual minerals probably due to trapping capacities. Moonmilk was composed of gypsum, poor in organic matter, had an extremely low pH (0-1) and low microbial diversity. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, the microbial composition of the biofilms/deposits included autotrophic taxa associated with sulfur and nitrogen cycles and biomineralization processes. In particular, water filaments communities were characterized by bacterial taxa involved in sulfur oxidation and reduction in aquatic, aphotic, microaerophilic/anoxic environments (Campylobacterales, Thiotrichales, Arenicellales, Desulfobacterales, Desulforomonadales) and in chemolithotrophy in marine habitats (Oceanospirillales, Chromatiales). Their biodiversity was linked to the morphology of the water filaments and their collection site. Microbial communities within vermiculations were partly related to their color and showed high abundance of unclassified Betaproteobacteria and sulfur-oxidizing Hydrogenophilales (including Sulfuriferula), and Acidiferrobacterales (including Sulfurifustis), sulfur-reducing Desulfurellales, and ammonia-oxidizing Planctomycetes and Nitrospirae. The microbial community associated with gypsum moonmilk showed the strong dominance (>60%) of the archaeal genus Thermoplasma and lower abundance of chemolithotrophic Acidithiobacillus, metal-oxidizing Metallibacterium, Sulfobacillus, and Acidibacillus. This study describes the geomicrobiology of water filaments, vermiculations and gypsum moonmilk from Fetida Cave, providing insights into the microbial taxa that characterize each morphology and contribute to biogeochemical cycles and speleogenesis of this peculiar seawater-influenced sulfuric acid cave."
https://openalex.org/W2967656253,"Smallholder large ruminant production in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) is characterised by low reproductive efficiency. To determine if common abortifacient bovid infectious diseases are involved, a serological investigation was conducted. Sera was collected from stored and fresh cattle (n = 390) and buffalo (n = 130) samples from 2016-18 from, and then examined for associations in a retrospective risk factor study of 71 herds. The sera were assayed for antibodies to Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella abortus using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. These pathogens were detected in buffalo samples at 78.5% (95% CI 71.4-85.6), 0%, 2.3% (95% CI 0-4.9) and 0%, respectively, and in cattle at 4.4% (95% CI 2.4-6.4), 7.7% (95% CI 3.1-12.3), 12.8% (95% CI 9.5-16.1) and 0.26% (95% CI 0-0.8), respectively. Exposure of buffalo to N. caninum was positively associated with buffalo age, with a predicted seropositivity at birth of 52.8%, increasing to 97.2% by 12 years of age (p = 0.037). Exposure of cattle to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo was more prevalent in females compared to males, was associated with higher titres of BVDV, and was more prevalent in the wet season compared to the dry season. Exposure of cattle to BVDV was more prevalent in males compared to females, the wet and dry seasons were comparable, and was associated with rising antibody titres against N. caninum and L. interrogans serovar Hardjo. The risk factor survey identified that the probability of herds being N. caninum positive increased with farmer age, if farmers believed there were rodents on farm, and if farmers weren't aware that canids or rodents could contaminate bovid feed on their farm. The probability of a herd being positive to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo increased on farms where multiple cows shared the same bull, where farmers had lower husbandry knowledge, and on farms that used water troughs. The probability of a herd being BVDV seropositive increased with increasing herd size and increasing titres to N. caninum. The benchmarking of bovid exposure to emerging abortifacient pathogens and identification of their risk factors potentially informs disease prevention strategies, supporting efforts to establish a biosecure beef supply for enhanced smallholder livestock productivity, public health and food security in Laos and surrounding countries."
https://openalex.org/W2968051244,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed in men worldwide; however, few patients are affected by clinically significant disease within their lifetime. Unfortunately, the means to discriminate between patients with indolent disease and those who progress to aggressive prostate cancer is currently unavailable, resulting in over-treatment of patients. We therefore aimed to determine biomarkers of prostate cancer that can be used in the clinic to aid the diagnosis and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry analysis was carried out on prostate cancer specimens with a range of Gleason scores. Samples were stained and analysed for intensity of the Seven Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate (STEAP)-1, -2, -3, -4 and the Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1) proteins to determine suitable biomarkers for classification of patients likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer. Additionally, these proteins were also analysed to determine whether any would be able to predict future relapse using Kaplan Meier analysis. Data generated demonstrated that the protein expression levels of STEAP2 correlated significantly with Gleason score; furthermore, STEAP4 was a significant predictor of relapse. This data indicates that STEAP2 could be potential prognostic candidate for use in combination with the current prostate cancer detection methods and the presence of STEAP4 could be an indicator of possible relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2967233566,"The bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most common causes of foodborne disease in humans and is also an important model system for bacterial pathogenesis. Oral inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, which are genetically susceptible to Salmonella, results in systemic infection but the murine intestine is not efficiently colonized unless the intestinal microbiota is disrupted. Pretreatment of C57Bl/6 mice with streptomycin, followed by oral inoculation with Salmonella Typhimurium results in colitis resembling human intestinal Salmonellosis. The predominant method of delivery of bacteria is oral gavage, during which organisms are deposited directly into the stomach via a feeding needle. Although convenient, this method can be stressful for mice, and may lead to unwanted tracheal or systemic introduction of bacteria. Here, we developed a method for oral infection of mice by voluntary consumption of regular mouse chow inoculated with bacteria. Mice readily ate chow fragments containing up to 108 CFU Salmonella, allowing for a wide range of infectious doses. In mice pretreated with streptomycin, infection with inoculated chow resulted in reproducible infections with doses as low as 103 CFU. Mice not treated with streptomycin, as well as resistant Nramp1 reconstituted C57Bl/6J mice, were also readily infected using this method. In summary, voluntary consumption of chow inoculated with Salmonella represents a natural route of infection for foodborne salmonellosis and a viable alternative to oral gavage."
https://openalex.org/W2967268865,"The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has been implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes and resistance to targeted therapies. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which this pathway contributes to the biology of NSCLC. The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that signal downstream of the IGF-1R and determine the functional outcomes of this signaling pathway. In this study, we assessed the expression patterns of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in NSCLC to identify associations between IRS-1 and IRS-2 expression levels and survival outcomes in the two major histological subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). High IRS-2 expression was significantly associated with decreased overall survival in adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients, whereas low IRS-1 cytoplasmic expression showed a trend toward association with decreased overall survival in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. Tumors with low IRS-1 and high IRS-2 expression were found to be associated with poor outcomes in ADC and SCC, indicating a potential role for IRS-2 in the aggressive behavior of NSCLC. Our results suggest distinct contributions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to the biology of ADC and SCC that impact disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2967484320,"Purpose Verbal credibility assessments examine language differences to tell truthful from deceptive statements (e.g., of allegations of child sexual abuse). The dominant approach in psycholegal deception research to date (used in 81% of recent studies that report on accuracy) to estimate the accuracy of a method is to find the optimal statistical separation between lies and truths in a single dataset. However, this method lacks safeguards against accuracy overestimation. Method & Results A simulation study and empirical data show that this procedure produces overoptimistic accuracy rates that, especially for small sample size studies typical of this field, yield misleading conclusions up to the point that a non-diagnostic tool can be shown to be a valid one. Cross-validation is an easy remedy to this problem. Conclusions We caution psycholegal researchers to be more accurate about accuracy and propose guidelines for calculating and reporting accuracy rates."
https://openalex.org/W2967764124,"We present a new set of subjective Age of Acquisition (AoA) ratings for 299 words (158 nouns, 141 verbs) in seven languages from various language families and cultural settings: American English, Czech, Scottish Gaelic, Lebanese Arabic, Malaysian Malay, Persian, and Western Armenian. The ratings were collected from a total of 173 participants and were highly reliable in each language. We applied the same method of data collection as used in a previous study on 25 languages which allowed us to create a database of fully comparable AoA ratings of 299 words in 32 languages. We found that in the seven languages not included in the previous study, the words are estimated to be acquired at roughly the same age as in the previously reported languages, i.e. mostly between the ages of 1 and 7 years. We also found that the order of word acquisition is moderately to highly correlated across all 32 languages, which extends our previous conclusion that early words are acquired in similar order across a wide range of languages and cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2968792391,"'Honour killing', the murder of women to preserve family reputation, is well recognised but infrequently systematically researched. This paper has three hypotheses. First, in families where women report an 'honour killing' there is more violence against women and girls, second these women are more likely to report more patriarchal gender attitudes than others, and third these families are exposed to higher levels of poverty. We asked (n = 1461) women enrolled in a trial in Afghanistan, and (n = 535) in a population-based sample in the occupied Palestinian Territories (oPT) if there had ever been an 'honour killing' in their family. In Afghanistan, 2.3% (n = 33), and the oPT 7.7% (n = 41), reported this. We built separate multivariable logistic regression models for each country, and for married and unmarried women in each country. Among Afghan married women, 'honour killing' was associated with borrowing because of hunger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]8.71, 95%CI 2.27-33.40), easier access to money in emergency (aOR11.39, 95%CI 3.05-42.50), and violence within the family; intimate partner violence (IPV) (aOR3.73, 95%CI 1.12-12.36), and IPV and mother-in-law violence (aOR10.52, 2.60-42.56). For unmarried women in Afghanistan, 'honour killing' was associated with easier access money in an emergency (aOR4.06, 95%CI 0.85-19.37), household violence (hit by parent or sibling, or parent and sibling [aOR5.47, 95%CI 0.82-36.70; aOR7.37, 95%CI 1.24-43.86, respectively]); more childhood traumas (aOR1.24, 1.11-1.38), and more patriarchal personal gender attitudes (aOR1.24, 1.00-1.54). In the oPT experiencing IPV (aOR3.07, 1.02-9.23) and borrowing and experiencing IPV (aOR5.89, 1.84-18.79) were risks for married women. For unmarried women borrowing because of hunger was associated with higher risk (aOR2.33, 95%CI 1.18-4.85). Despite limitations-specifically the potential women were reporting the same 'honour killing'-our analysis suggests 'honour killings' are associated with violence, patriarchy, and poverty. Research is needed for the prevention of 'honour killing', which must address the root causes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03236948."
https://openalex.org/W2968415345,"Type 1 IFNs stimulate secretion of IP-10 (CXCL10) which is a critical chemokine to recruit effector T cells to the tumor microenvironment and IP-10 knockout mice exhibit a phenotype with compromised effector T cell generation and trafficking. Type 1 IFNs also induce MHC class 1 upregulation on tumor cells which can enhance anti-tumor CD8 T cell effector response in the tumor microenvironment. Although type 1 IFNs show great promise in potentiating anti-tumor immune response, systemic delivery of type 1 IFNs is associated with toxicity thereby limiting clinical application. In this study, we fused tumor targeting antibodies with IFN-α and showed that the fusion proteins can be produced with high yields and purity. IFN fusions selectively induced IP-10 secretion from antigen positive tumor cells, which was critical in recruiting the effector T cells to the tumor microenvironment. Further, we found that treatment with the anti-PDL1-IFN- α fusion at concentrations as low as 1 pM exhibited potent activity in mediating OT1 CD8+ T cell killing against OVA expressing tumor cells, while control IFN fusion did not exhibit any activity at the same concentration. Furthermore, the IFN-α fusion antibody was well tolerated in vivo and demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in an anti-PD-L1 resistant syngeneic mouse tumor model. One of the potential mechanisms for the enhanced CD8 T cell killing by anti-PD-L1 IFN fusion was up-regulation of MHC class I/tumor antigen complex. Our data supports the hypothesis of targeting type 1 IFN to the tumor microenvironment may enhance effector T cell functions for anti-tumor immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2968466888,"Emerging evidence suggests microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in explaining variation in stroke risk and recovery in humans, yet there are still few longitudinal studies examining the association between whole blood miRNAs and stroke. Accounting for multiple testing and adjusting for potentially confounding technical and clinical variables, here we show that whole blood miR-574-3p expression was significantly lower in participants with chronic stroke compared to non-cases. To explore the functional relevance of our findings, we analyzed miRNA-mRNA whole blood co-expression, pathway enrichment, and brain tissue gene expression. Results suggest miR-574-3p is involved in neurometabolic and chronic neuronal injury response pathways, including brain gene expression of DBNDD2 and ELOVL1. These results suggest miR-574-3p plays a role in regulating chronic brain and systemic cellular response to stroke and thus may implicate miR-574-3p as a partial mediator of long-term stroke outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2968509078,"Bees provide essential ecosystem services and help maintain floral biodiversity. However, there is an ongoing decline of wild and domesticated bee species. Since agricultural pesticide use is a key driver of this process, there is a need for a protective risk assessment. To achieve a more protective registration process, two bee species, Osmia bicornis/Osmia cornuta and Bombus terrestris, were proposed by the European Food Safety Authority as additional test surrogates to the honey bee Apis mellifera. We investigated the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of multiple commercial insecticide formulations towards the red mason bee (O. bicornis) and compared these values to honey bee regulatory endpoints. In two thirds of all cases, O. bicornis was less sensitive than the honey bee. By applying an assessment factor of 10 on the honey bee endpoint, a protective level was achieved for 87% (13 out 15) of all evaluated products. Our results show that O. bicornis is rarely an adequate additional surrogate species for lower tier risk assessment since it is less sensitive than the honey bee for the majority of investigated products. Given the currently limited database on bee species sensitivity, the honey bee seems sufficiently protective in acute scenarios as long as a reasonable assessment factor is applied. However, additional surrogate species can still be relevant for ecologically meaningful higher tier studies."
https://openalex.org/W2967675693,"Plasma lipid levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death worldwide. While many studies have been conducted in genetic variation underlying lipid levels, they mainly comprise individuals of European ancestry and thus their transferability to non-European populations is unclear. We performed genome-wide (GWAS) and imputed transcriptome-wide association studies of four lipid traits in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos cohort (HCHS/SoL, n = 11,103), replicated top hits in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, n = 3,855), and compared the results to the larger, predominantly European ancestry meta-analysis by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC, n = 196,475). In our GWAS, we found significant SNP associations in regions within or near known lipid genes, but in our admixture mapping analysis, we did not find significant associations between local ancestry and lipid phenotypes. In the imputed transcriptome-wide association study in multiple tissues and in different ethnicities, we found 59 significant gene-tissue-phenotype associations (P < 3.61×10−8) with 14 unique significant genes, many of which occurred across multiple phenotypes, tissues, and ethnicities and replicated in MESA (45/59) and in GLGC (44/59). These include well-studied lipid genes such as SORT1, CETP, and PSRC1, as well as genes that have been implicated in cardiovascular phenotypes, such as CCL22 and ICAM1. The majority (40/59) of significant associations colocalized with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), indicating a possible mechanism of gene regulation in lipid level variation. To fully characterize the genetic architecture of lipid traits in diverse populations, larger studies in non-European ancestry populations are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2967515439,"There are limited published data about the circulation of influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and most countries have a vaccine policy that includes the use of the trivalent influenza vaccine. We analyzed influenza surveillance data to inform decision-making in LAC about prevention strategies, such as the use of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine.There are a total of 28 reference laboratories and National Influenza Centers in LAC that conduct influenza virologic surveillance according to global standards, and on a weekly basis upload their surveillance data to the open-access World Health Organization (WHO) platform FluNet. These data include the number of specimens tested for influenza and the number of specimens positive for influenza by type, subtype and lineage, all by the epidemiologic week of specimen collection. We invited these laboratories to provide additional epidemiologic data about the hospitalized influenza B cases. We conducted descriptive analyses of patterns of influenza circulation and characteristics of hospitalized cases. We compared the predominant B lineage each season to the lineage in the vaccine applied, to determine vaccine mismatch. A Chi-square and Wilcoxan statistic were used to assess the statistical significance of differences in proportions and medians at the P<0.05 level.During 2010-2017, the annual number of influenza B cases in LAC was ~4500 to 7000 cases. Since 2011, among the LAC-laboratories reporting influenza B lineage using molecular methods, both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata were detected annually. Among the hospitalized influenza B cases, there were statistically significant differences observed between B/Victoria and B/Yamagata cases when comparing age and the proportion with underlying co-morbid conditions and with history of oseltamivir treatment (P<0.001). The proportion deceased among B/Victoria and B/Yamagata hospitalized cases did not differ significantly. When comparing the predominant influenza B lineage detected, as part of surveillance activities during 63 seasons among 19 countries, to the lineage of the influenza B virus included in the trivalent influenza vaccine used during that season, there was a vaccine mismatch noted during 32% of the seasons analyzed.Influenza B is important in LAC with both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata circulating annually in all sub regions. During approximately one-third of the seasons, an influenza B vaccine mismatch was identified. Further analyses are needed to better characterize the medical and economic burden of each influenza B lineage, to examine the potential cross-protection of one vaccine lineage against the other circulating virus lineage, and to determine the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of using the quadrivalent vaccine rather than the trivalent influenza vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2967866509,"Osteoporosis is a continuous process of loss of bone tissue. Compared to women, osteoporosis in men is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. In this study, we conducted tomographic and biomechanical evaluations of trabecular and cortical bone in the early stage of male osteoporosis. Male Wistar rats were subjected to orchiectomy and sham operation. Four weeks after being castrated, decreased levels of testosterone in plasma were found and resulted in concurrent bone loss. Separately, the orchiectomy led to significant tomographic alterations in the trabecular bone number, trabecular separation, and trabecular pattern factor. Data of a mechanistic compression test further showed that the orchiectomy diminished the maximum loading force, displacement at maximum load, energy at maximum load, and ultimate stress. Interestingly, orchiectomy-triggered changes in the maximum loading force and tomographic parameters were highly correlated. In contrast, tomographic and biomechanical analyses showed that 4 weeks after rats were orchiectomized, the thickness, area, maximum loading force, bone stiffness, energy at maximum load, and ultimate stress of the cortical bone were not changed. Taken together, this study showed specific differences in the microarchitecture and strength of trabecular bone in the early stage of male osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2968539668,"An increasing number of studies reveal crossmodal correspondences between speech sounds and perceptual features such as shape and size. In this study, we show that an interjection Koreans produce when downing a shot of liquor reliably triggers crossmodal associations in American English, German, Spanish, and Chinese listeners who do not speak Korean. Based on how this sound is used in advertising campaigns for the Korean liquor soju, we derive predictions for different crossmodal associations. Our experiments show that the same speech sound is reliably associated with various perceptual, affective, and social meanings. This demonstrates what we call the ‘pluripotentiality’ of iconicity, that is, the same speech sound is able to trigger a web of interrelated mental associations across different dimensions. We argue that the specific semantic associations evoked by iconic stimuli depend on the task, with iconic meanings having a ‘latent’ quality that becomes ‘actual’ in specific semantic contexts. We outline implications for theories of iconicity and advertising."

In this work we present a global analysis of genetic data in the large national multicenter cohort of Spanish LTNP, which is compared with seronegative individuals and HIV-positive patients. We have analyzed whether several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including in key genes and certain HLA-A and B alleles could be associated with a specific HIV phenotype. A total of 846 individuals, 398 HIV-1-positive patients (213 typical progressors, 55 AIDS patients, and 130 LTNPs) and 448 HIV-negative controls, were genotyped for 15 polymorphisms and HLA-A and B alleles. Significant differences in the allele frequencies among the studied populations identified 16 LTNP-associated genetic factors, 5 of which were defined for the first time as related to LTNP phenotype: the protective effect of HLA-B39, and the detrimental impact of HLA-B18, -A24, -B08 and –A29. The remaining eleven polymorphisms confirmed previous publications, including the protective alleles HLA-B57, rs2395029 (HCP5), HLA bw4 homozygosity, HLA-B52, HLA-B27, CCR2 V64I, rs9264942 (HLA-C) and HLA-A03; and the risk allele HLA bw6 homozygosity. Notably, individual Spanish HIV-negative individuals had an average of 0.12 protective HLA alleles and SNPs, compared with an average of 1.43 protective alleles per LTNP patient, strongly suggesting positive selection of LTNP. Finally, stratification of LTNP according to viral load showed a proportional relationship between the frequency of protective alleles with control of viral load. Interestingly, no differences in the frequency of protection/risk polymorphisms were found between elite controllers and LTNPs maintaining viral loads <2.000 copies/mL throughout the follow-up."

An additional 20.4% and 5.7% had mild hypokalemia (3.5-3.9 mmol/L) and mild hyperkalemia (5.0-5.4 mmol/L). Key correlates were black race, higher blood pressure, and use of potassium-wasting diuretics for hypokalemia, and lower kidney function for hyperkalemia. Baseline potassium levels showed a U-shaped association with mortality, with the lowest risk between 4.0-4.5 mmol/L. With respect to potassium levels over a year after HF diagnosis, persistent (>50% of measurements), intermittent (>1 occurrence but ≤50%), and transient (1 occurrence) hypo- and hyperkalemia were also related to increased mortality in a graded fashion regardless of the aforementioned thresholds for dyskalemia. These dyskalemic patterns were also related to other clinical actions and demands such as emergency room visit.Potassium levels below 4 mmol/L and above 5 mmol/L at and after HF diagnosis were associated with poor prognosis and the clinical actions. HF patients (particularly with risk factors for dyskalemia like black race and kidney dysfunction) may require special attention for both hypo- and hyperkalemia."
https://openalex.org/W2966880928,"Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. In endemic areas, only a portion of exposed subjects develops cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), suggesting that the genetic inheritance of the host plays a vital role in both resistance and susceptibility to the disease. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that plays a central role in the regulation of the immune response in infection through the axis IL-2/IL-2R (receptor) complex, triggering a series of intracellular events, among which the signaling of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT). The present study aimed at verifying the possible relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (s) (SNP s) in the genes IL-2, IL-2RB, and JAK3 in subjects with CL caused by Leishmania guyanensis in the city of Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil. 820 patients with CL and 850 healthy subjects (control group) coming from the same endemic areas as the patients were examined. The SNPs -2425G/A (rs4833248) and -330 T/G (rs2069762), located in the IL-2 gene promoter region, seem to influence the expression of the gene and the SNP +10558G/A (rs1003694) and +13295T/C (rs3212760) located in the 3rd intron of the IL-2RB gene and the 13th intron of the JAK3 gene, respectively, were studied by PCR-RFLP. Genotypes and alleles frequencies were obtained by direct counting. For the comparison between the two groups, the χ2 test with OR (odds ratio) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were used. Similar genotypes and alleles frequencies for the different SNPs were observed in both patients with CL and healthy controls. Comparison of genotypic and allelic frequency between patients with CL and healthy subjects did not show any difference. These polymorphisms do not predict susceptibility to, or protection against the development of CL caused by L. guyanensis in the Amazonas."
https://openalex.org/W2966940889,"Understanding the challenges to increasing maize productivity in sub-Saharan Africa, especially agronomic factors that reduce on-farm crop yield, has important implications for policies to reduce national and global food insecurity. Previous research on the maize yield gap has tended to emphasize the size of the gap (theoretical vs. achievable yields), rather than what determines maize yield in specific contexts. As a result, there is insufficient evidence on the key agronomic and environmental factors that influence maize yield in a smallholder farm environment. In this study, we implemented a Bayesian analysis with plot-level longitudinal household survey data covering 1,197 plots and 320 farms in Central Malawi. Households were interviewed and monitored three times per year, in 2015 and 2016, to document farmer management practices and seasonal rainfall, and direct measurements were taken of plant and soil characteristics to quantify impact on plot-level maize yield stability. The results revealed a high positive association between a leaf chlorophyll indicator and maize yield, with significance levels exceeding 95% Bayesian credibility at all sites and a regression coefficient posterior mean from 28% to 42% on a relative scale. A parasitic weed, Striga asiatica, was the variable most consistently negatively associated with maize yield, exceeding 95% credibility in most cases, of high intensity, with regression means ranging from 23% to 38% on a relative scale. The influence of rainfall, either directly or indirectly, varied by site and season. We conclude that the factors preventing Striga infestation and enhancing nitrogen fertility will lead to higher maize yield in Malawi. To improve plant nitrogen status, fertilizer was effective at higher productivity sites, whereas soil carbon and organic inputs were important at marginal sites. Uniquely, a Bayesian approach allowed differentiation of response by site for a relatively modest sample size study (given the complexity of farm environments and management practices). Considering the biophysical constraints, our findings highlight management strategies for crop yields, and point towards area-specific recommendations for nitrogen management and crop yield."
https://openalex.org/W2968399628,"The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of natural prebiotic active compounds on the microbial composition in different regions of the equine gastrointestinal tract. Twelve adult horses (body weight [bwt] 534 ± 64.5 kg; age 14 ± 7.5 years) were randomly divided into two feeding groups. Six horses received a basal diet consisting of 1.5 kg hay/100 kg bwt x d-1 and oat grains equal to 1.19 g starch/kg bwt x d-1, supplemented with Jerusalem artichoke meal providing prebiotic fructooligosaccharides + inulin in a quantity of 0.15 g/kg bwt x d-1. The remaining horses received a placebo added to the basal diet. The horses were fed for 21 d and euthanized at the end of the feeding period. Digesta samples from different parts of the gastrointestinal tract were taken, DNA extracted and the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene amplified. Supplementation with the prebiotic increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.05), with a concurrent reduction of the relative abundance of Streptococcus mainly in the stomach (P < 0.05). In the hindgut, the supplemental prebiotic also increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus but further reduced the relative abundance of fibrolytic bacteria, specifically the unclassified members of the families Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.05) and Ruminococcaceae. The relative abundance of the genus Ruminococcus increased solely in the caecum and colon transversum. Overall, the addition of the prebiotic significantly increased the diversity in nearly all parts of the gastrointestinal tract (P < 0.05). The feeding of this natural prebiotic compound to horses had an impact on the microbial community in the entire gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the effect on the bacterial community in the foregut (especially the stomach) was more pronounced in comparison to the effect in the hindgut. Therefore, the impact on stomach health should be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W2968540550,"Hyaluronan (HA) is an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan essential for the homeostasis of cartilage-related tissues. Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and CD44 have been identified as receptors for HA. Recently, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) has emerged as a potential research target in several areas of physiology. TRPV4 is a Ca2+-permeable, non-selective cation channel that appears to have mechanosensory or osmosensory roles in several musculoskeletal tissues. HA and TRPV4 play key roles in chondrogenesis; however, it has remained unclear whether they have interactive effects on chondrogenesis and, if so, how do they interact with each other? This study investigated the relationship between HA, its receptors ICAM-1 and CD44, and TRPV4 in the chondrogenic pathway using the ATDC5 cell line. It was found that the presence of HA is required for TRPV4-induced chondrogenesis. Loss of HA suppressed TRPV4-induced expression of the chondrogenic markers, SOX9 and Aggrecan. Moreover, HA affects TRPV4-induced chondrogenic development via each of ICAM-1 and CD44 partially. In conclusion, for the first time, the existence of an interaction between HA, its receptor ICAM-1 and CD44, and TRPV4-activity in chondrogenesis in the ATDC5 cell line was reported. TRPV4 is known to function as a mechanosensory channel in several musculoskeletal tissues. Therefore, findings of this study may suggest the existence of a molecular mechanism that underlies the interactive effects of HA and mechanical loading on joint chondrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2967000222,"The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of a semi-automated scoring system for the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale (TWSTRS) severity scale in patients with cervical dystonia. The TWSTRS requires training and experience. We previously developed a system to measure neck angle by analyzing three-dimensional position, obtained using Kinect, a marker-less three-dimensional depth sensor. The system can track patients’ faces and bodies, automatically analyze neck angles, and semi-automatically calculate the TWSTRS severity scale score. We compared the TWSTRS severity scale scores calculated by the system with the video-based scores calculated by a neurologist trained in movement disorders. A correlation coefficient analysis was then conducted. Absolute accuracy was measured using intra-class correlation (ICC) (3,1), with 95% limits of agreement. To analyze the subscales, Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) was calculated. A p-value of < .05 was considered statistically significant. Thirty patients were enrolled. Their average age was 52.3±16.0 years, and the male to female ratio was 3:2. The average disease duration was 11.3±12.7 years. Total score measurements by the system were significantly correlated with those rated by the movement disorder-trained neurologist (r = .596, p < .05). There was a significant correlation (r = .655, p < .05) with regard to the automated part of the scale. An adequate ICC (3,1) of .562 was obtained for total severity score (p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: .259–.765), while the equivalent score was .617 for the total automated part (p < .001, 95% CI .336–.798). Our three-dimensional motion capture system, which can measure head angles and semi-automatically calculate the TWSTRS severity scale score utilizing a single-depth camera, demonstrated adequate validity and reliability. This low-cost and portable system could be applied by general practitioners treating cervical dystonia to obtain objective measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2967843063,"High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity is associated with accumulation of inflammatory cells predominantly in visceral adipose depots [visceral adipose tissue (VAT)] rather than in subcutaneous ones [subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)]. The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenotypic difference remain poorly understood. Controversy also exists on the overall impact that adipose tissue inflammation has on metabolic health in diet-induced obesity. The endothelium of the microcirculation regulates both the transport of lipids and the trafficking of leukocytes into organ tissue. We hypothesized that the VAT and SAT microcirculations respond differently to postprandial processing of dietary fat. We also tested whether inhibition of endothelial postprandial responses to high-fat meals (HFMs) preserves metabolic health in chronic obesity. We demonstrate that administration of a single HFM or ad libitum access to a HFD for 24 h quickly induces a transient P-selectin-dependent inflammatory phenotype in the VAT but not the SAT microcirculation of lean wild-type mice. Studies in P-selectin-deficient mice confirmed a mechanistic role for P-selectin in the initiation of leukocyte trafficking, myeloperoxidase accumulation, and acute reduction in adiponectin mRNA expression by HFMs. Despite reduced VAT inflammation in response to HFMs, P-selectin-deficient mice still developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when chronically fed an HFD. Our data uncover a novel nutrient-sensing role of the vascular endothelium that instigates postprandial VAT inflammation. They also demonstrate that inhibition of this transient postprandial inflammatory response fails to correct metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obesity.-Preston, K.

https://openalex.org/W2967846642,"Emotion plays important and diverse roles across various social relations. Although the social functions of emotion have attracted increased attention, the effects of positive emotions such as pride on impression formation remain poorly understood. Drawing on social projection theory, this study examined how incidental experiences of pride influenced the impressions of those who made a blunder, along with two other characteristics: the person's warmth and competence. Participants were designated randomly to receive inductions of pride, awe, or a neutral emotion. Subsequently, they were asked to indicate their own impression of a person who had made a blunder and to rate their overall sense of that individual's warmth and competence. A laboratory experiment recruiting university students (Study 1, N = 79) demonstrated that pride, a positive emotion elicited by a self-relevant achievement, led to higher competency evaluations of others. However, a pre-registered online experiment in middle-aged adults (Study 2, N = 108) failed to replicate the effects of pride on competency evaluations of others. Furthermore, another pre-registered online experiment in younger adults (Study 3, N = 290) did not show successful manipulation of incidental emotions. These results suggest that strictly controlled experimental settings that induce robust incidental emotions might be better for demonstrating a strong pride effect on the evaluation of others."
https://openalex.org/W2968271328,"Global climate change affects natural populations of many species by increasing the average temperature and the frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. summer heat waves). The ability of organisms to cope with these environmental changes can, however, depend on their genetic properties. For instance, genetic load owing to inbreeding could alter organisms' responses to climate change-mediated environmental changes but such effects are often overlooked. We investigated the effects of an experimental heat wave (25°C versus 15°C) on life history (reproduction, size) and constitutive immune defence traits (phenoloxidase-like and antibacterial activity of haemolymph) in relation to inbreeding by manipulating the mating type (outcrossing, self-fertilization) in two populations of a hermaphroditic freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. High temperature increased reproduction and size of snails but impaired their immune function. In one of the two study populations, inbreeding reduced reproductive output of snails indicating inbreeding depression. Furthermore, this effect did not depend on the temperature snails were exposed to. Our results suggest that L. stagnalis snails can be negatively affected by inbreeding but it may not alter their responses to heat waves."
https://openalex.org/W2967525506,"The purpose of the investigation was to analyze fracture resistance and mode of failure of zirconium oxide (zirconia) abutments placed on dental implants bearing crowns of different esthetic materials: zirconia, lithium disilicate (LDS), and nano-ceramic resin, for replacing single teeth in the anterior sector. Eighty implant-abutment-crown units were divided into four groups: Group T-MC (control): 20 metal-ceramic crowns cemented onto titanium abutments; Group Z-Z: 20 zirconia crowns on zirconia abutments; Group Z-LD: 20 lithium disilicate crowns on zirconia abutments; and Group Z-NCR: 20 nano-ceramic resin crowns on zirconia abutments. Specimens underwent a fatiguing process (dynamic loading and thermocycling), followed by static loading to evaluate mechanical fracture resistance, and the mode of failure produced. Mean fracture resistance values were: Control Group T-MC, 575.85±120.01 N; Group Z-Z 459.64±66.52 N; Group Z-LD, 531.77±34.10 N; and Group Z-NCR, 587.05±59.27 N. In Group T-MC, fracture occurred in the prosthetic fixing screw in 100% of specimens. In Group Z-Z, 80% of fractures occurred in the fixing screw, 15% in the abutment, and 5% in the abutment and crown. In Group Z-LD, 60% of fractures were produced in the fixing screw and 40% in the abutment. In Group Z-NCR, 70% of fractures were produced in the fixing screw and 30% in the abutment. All the abutments and crowns analyzed have the potential to withstand the physiological occlusal forces to which they would be subject in the anterior region. Lithium disilicate and nano-ceramic resin crowns cemented onto zirconia abutments are a good restoration alternative for single implants in the anterior sector."
https://openalex.org/W2967742851,"Background Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to respond to antidepressant (AD) pharmacotherapy. The objectives of this study were to characterize MDD and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) at the level of pharmacologically treated episodes and to describe the sequential treatment patterns by lines of therapy (LOT) in the first two episodes. Methods Adults (≥18 years of age) with continuous enrollment ≥12 months before and after the first MDD diagnosis and treated with an AD, with or without an MDD-indicated antipsychotic (AP), were identified (1/1/2010-12/31/2015). The MDD episode started on the date of MDD diagnosis that was preceded by a clean period without any MDD diagnosis. The MDD episode ended on the last MDD diagnosis or the end of the days’ supply of AD/AP medication, whichever came last. TRD was defined as an MDD episode with ≥3 AD/AP regimens. Measured outcomes included episode duration, number of LOT, relapse hospitalization, and sequential treatment patterns of MDD episode stratified by TRD and non-TRD episodes. Results Of 48,440 patients who received AD/AP in the 1st MDD episode, 3,317 (6.8%) of episodes were considered TRD. Mean duration of 1st TRD episodes was 571 days, mean number of AD/AP LOTs was 3.47, and 13.7% involved relapse hospitalization. Mean duration of 1st non-TRD episodes was 200 days, mean number of AD/AP LOTs was 1.21, and 9.6% involved relapse hospitalization. Among 1st MDD episodes, 25.5% had a second LOT; 7.3% had a third LOT. Most patients received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as the first LOT (63.0%), and the plurality of regimens were SSRIs in second (44.9%) and third LOT (41.1%). Conclusions Compared to non-TRD episodes, TRD episodes were longer and more often involved relapse hospitalizations. SSRIs were the most common treatment; treatment changes and potential treatment unresponsiveness were frequent among MDD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2967932102,"In the size–weight illusion, when two objects of identical weight but different volume are lifted, the smaller object is typically perceived to weigh more than the larger object. A well-known explanation for this and other weight illusions is provided by the hypothesis that perceived weight results from the contrast between actual and expected weight. More recently, it has been suggested that an object’s size may exert a direct and automatic effect on its perceived weight, independently of expected weight. Here we test these two hypotheses by exploring two illusions that have been known for a long time but have remained relatively underexplored, namely the shape–weight and brightness–weight illusions. Specifically, we measured the influence of visually perceived shape and brightness on the perceived size, the expected weight, and the perceived weight of 3D plastic objects. A numerical rating task was used in Experiment 1, and a paired comparison task was used in Experiment 2. The results showed that spheres were perceived to be heavier than tetrahedrons and cubes, and cubes were perceived to be heavier than tetrahedrons. We did not find any consistent relationship between brightness and perceived weight. A systematic comparison between perceived size, expected weight, and perceived weight showed that the visual shape–weight and brightness–weight illusions are partially inconsistent with the hypothesis that perceived weight results from the contrast between actual and expected weight and with the hypothesis that perceived weight results from the contrast between actual weight and perceived size. The results appear to suggest that there may be a dissociation between the processing of variables that contribute to the conscious experience of size, such as brightness and vertical height, and the processing of variables that contribute to perceived weight, such as surface area."
https://openalex.org/W2968908208,"Mutations in ATP13A2 cause Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), a juvenile form of Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia. However, the mechanisms by which mutations in ATP13A2 cause KRS is not understood. The mutations lead to misfolding of the translated Atp13a2 protein and its premature degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, never reaching the lysosome where the protein is thought to function. Atp13a2 is a P-type ATPase, a class of proteins that function in ion transport. Indeed, studies of human, mouse, and yeast Atp13a2 proteins suggest a possible involvement in regulation of heavy metal toxicity. Here we report on the cytoprotective function of Atp13a2 on HeLa cells and dopamine neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). HeLa cells stably overexpressing V5- tagged Atp13a2Isoform-1 protein were more resistant to elevated manganese exposure and to starvation-induced cell death compared to cells not overexpressing the protein. Because PD is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons, we generated transgenic C. elegans expressing GFP-tagged human Atp13a2 protein in dopamine neurons. The transgenic animals exhibited higher resistance to dopamine neuron degeneration after acute exposure to manganese compared to nematodes that expressed GFP alone. The results suggest Atp13a2 Isoform-1 protein confers cytoprotection against toxic insults, including those that cause PD syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2966930459,"This study aimed to measure muscle activity and motion kinematics during chair-based exercises under submerged and non-submerged conditions. Twelve healthy men performed chair-based standing and sitting movements. Surface electrodes were attached at the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, rectus abdominis, and erector spinae. The ankle, knee, and hip joint angles and forward inclination angle of the trunk segment in the sagittal plane were calculated. The mean muscle activities during both movements in the submerged condition for the entire motion were lower than those in the non-submerged condition except in the tibialis anterior and biceps femoris during the sitting movement (in the standing exercise, rectus femoris: 14.1% and 5.2%; and erector spinae: 18.3% and 13.6% in non-submerged and submerged conditions, respectively; and in the sitting exercise, rectus femoris: 12.1% and 4.5% and erector spinae: 12.9% and 9.9% in the non-submerged and submerged conditions, respectively). However, the integrated muscle activity in submerged conditions was similar or higher to that in non-submerged conditions during both movements, except for the rectus femoris. This was mainly due to the increased duration of motion (44.3% and 39.9% longer for standing and sitting exercises in submerged conditions, respectively, compared with non-submerged conditions). The hip joint flexion at the beginning and end of movement and forward inclination angles of the trunk segment at the beginning of the movement in the submerged condition were larger than those in the non-submerged condition during both movements (hip: 126.1° and 111.5° at the beginning, 182.3° and 178.4° at the end and trunk: 2.7° and 17.4° at the beginning in non-submerged and submerged conditions for the standing exercise, respectively; hip: 182.4° and 178.0° at the beginning, 125.9° and 111.1° at the end and trunk: 2.2° and 16.9° at the end in non-submerged and submerged conditions for the sitting exercise, respectively). Reduced or similar muscle activity but similar or higher muscular effort was observed in the submerged condition for all the muscles except the rectus femoris, with the upper body inclined forward. These findings could have beneficial implications for the prescription of exercise and rehabilitation regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2967170985,"Purpose Glaucoma screening can be performed by assessing the vertical-cup-to-disk ratio (VCDR) of the optic nerve head from fundus photography, but VCDR grading is inherently subjective. This study investigated whether computer software could improve the accuracy and repeatability of VCDR assessment. Methods In this cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study, 5 ophthalmologists independently assessed the VCDR from a set of 200 optic disk images, with the median grade used as the reference standard for subsequent analyses. Eight non-ophthalmologists graded each image by two different methods: by visual inspection and with assistance from a custom-made publicly available software program. Agreement with the reference standard grade was assessed for each method by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the sensitivity and specificity determined relative to a median ophthalmologist grade of ≥0.7. Results VCDR grades ranged from 0.1 to 0.9 for visual assessment and from 0.1 to 1.0 for software-assisted grading, with a median grade of 0.4 for each. Agreement between each of the 8 graders and the reference standard was higher for visual inspection (median ICC 0.65, interquartile range 0.57 to 0.82) than for software-assisted grading (median ICC 0.59, IQR 0.44 to 0.71); P = 0.02, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Visual inspection and software assistance had similar sensitivity and specificity for detecting glaucomatous cupping. Conclusion The computer software used in this study did not improve the reproducibility or validity of VCDR grading from fundus photographs compared with simple visual inspection. More clinical experience was correlated with higher agreement with the ophthalmologist VCDR reference standard."
https://openalex.org/W2967269629,"Successful communication often involves comprehension of both spoken language and observed actions with and without objects. Even very young infants can learn associations between actions and objects as well as between words and objects. However, in daily life, children are usually confronted with both kinds of input simultaneously. Choosing the critical information to attend to in such situations might help children structure the input, and thereby, allow for successful learning. In the current study, we therefore, investigated the developmental time course of children's and adults' word and action learning when given the opportunity to learn both word-object and action-object associations for the same object. All participants went through a learning phase and a test phase. In the learning phase, they were presented with two novel objects which were associated with a distinct novel name (e.g., ""Look, a Tanu"") and a distinct novel action (e.g., moving up and down while tilting sideways). In the test phase, participants were presented with both objects on screen in a baseline phase, then either heard one of the two labels or saw one of the two actions in a prime phase, and then saw the two objects again on screen in a recognition phase. Throughout the trial, participants' target looking was recorded to investigate whether participants looked at the target object upon hearing its label or seeing its action, and thus, would show learning of the word-object and action-object associations. Growth curve analyses revealed that 12-month-olds showed modest learning of action-object associations, 36-month-olds learned word-object associations, and adults learned word-object and action-object associations. These results highlight how children attend to the different information types from the two modalities through which communication is addressed to them. Over time, with increased exposure to systematic word-object mappings, children attend less to action-object mappings, with the latter potentially being mediated by word-object learning even in adulthood. Thus, choosing between different kinds of input that may be more relevant in their rich environment encompassing different modalities might help learning at different points in development."
https://openalex.org/W2967401551,"The number of dengue fever (DF) cases and the number of dengue outbreaks have increased in recent years in Zhejiang Province, China. An unexpected dengue outbreak was reported in Hangzhou in 2017 and caused more than one thousand dengue cases. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the actual control measures, estimate the proportion of inapparent infections during this outbreak and simulate epidemic development based on different levels of control measures taking inapparent infections into consideration.The epidemic data of dengue cases in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in 2017 and the number of the people exposed to the outbreaks were obtained from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and Control. The epidemic without intervention measures was used to estimate the unknown parameters. A susceptible-exposed-infectious/inapparent-recovered (SEIAR) model was used to estimate the effectiveness of the control interventions. The inapparent infections were also evaluated at the same time.In total, 1137 indigenous dengue cases were reported in Hangzhou in 2017. The number of indigenous dengue cases was estimated by the SEIAR model. This number was predicted to reach 6090 by the end of November 2, 2017, if no control measures were implemented. The total number of reported cases was reduced by 81.33% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention. The number of average daily inapparent cases was 10.18 times higher than the number of symptomatic cases. The earlier and more rigorously the vector control interventions were implemented, the more effective they were. The results showed that implementing vector control continuously for more than twenty days was more effective than every few days of implementation. Case isolation is not sufficient enough for epidemic control and only reduced the incidence by 38.10% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention, even if case isolation began seven days after the onset of the first case.The practical control interventions in the outbreaks that occurred in Hangzhou City were highly effective. The proportion of inapparent infections was large, and it played an important role in transmitting the disease during this epidemic. Early, continuous and high efficacy vector control interventions are necessary to limit the development of a dengue epidemic. Timely diagnosis and case reporting are important in the intervention at an early stage of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2967770167,"Background The 2017 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association propose substantial changes to hypertension management. The guidelines lower the blood pressure threshold defining hypertension and promote more aggressive treatments. Thus, more individuals are now classified as hypertensive and as a result, medication usage may become more extensive. An inevitable byproduct of greater medication use is higher incidence of adverse effects. Here, we examined these issues by developing models that predict both cardiovascular events and other adverse events based on the treatment chosen and other patient’s data. Methods and results We used data from the SPRINT trial to produce patient-specific predictions of the risks for adverse cardiovascular or kidney outcomes. Unlike prior models, we used both the baseline characteristics collected upon recruitment and the longitudinal data during the follow-up. Importantly, our cardiovascular predictor outperformed extant models on SPRINT participants, achieving AUC = 0.765, and was validated with good performance in an independent cohort of the ACCORD trial. Conclusions Our study illustrates the importance of including longitudinal data for assessing personalized risk and provides means for recommending personalized treatment decisions."

Dried Blood Spot (DBS) samples are used for EID of exposed infants, born to HIV-positive mothers. However, DBS rejection rates in Zimbabwe have been exceeding the target of less than 2% per month set by the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL), in Harare. The aim of this study was to determine the DBS sample rejection rate, the reasons for rejection and the possible associations between rejection and level of health facility where the samples were collected. This is an analytical cross-sectional study using routine DBS sample data from the NMRL in Harare, Zimbabwe, between January and December 2017.A total of 34 950 DBS samples were received at the NMRL. Of these, 1291(4%) were rejected. Reasons for rejection were insufficient specimen volume (72%), missing request form (11%), missing sample (6%), cross-contamination (6%), mismatch of information (4%) and clotted sample (1%). Samples collected from clinics/rural health facilities were five times more likely to be rejected compared to those from a central hospital. Rejection rates were above the set target of <2%. The reasons for rejection were 'pre-analytical' errors including labelling errors, missing or inconsistent data, and insufficient blood collected. Samples collected at primary healthcare facilities had higher rejection rates."

Overall, blue monochromatic spectrum prevails in offshore areas especially below 15m depth, since long wavelengths are quickly attenuated. Light intensity is even more constrained in coastal waters, particularly those of tropical estuaries and bays, because further scattering through dissolved and suspended materials. Biofluorescence, which is the ability of organisms to absorb light and reflect it in a different wavelength, has been reported for many marine fish. In this paper, biofluorescence was recorded for the first time for the longsnout seahorse Hippocampus reidi, under natural conditions at Ilha Grande bay, Brazil, and both adult, juvenile and fry individuals kept in captivity. Although displaying the same colour emissions, seahorses differed in relation to body lighting, colour patterns, and age wherein fluorescence occurs. Newborn seahorses exhibit green biofluorescence only in the eyes and stomach. Further experiments are necessary to address whether H. reidi can change the patterns of biofluorescence emission for sensorial and social purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2967472250,"Background Antitachycardia pacing (ATP) is an effective treatment for ventricular tachycardia (VT). We evaluated the efficacy of different ATP programs based on a large remote monitoring data set from patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Methods A dataset from 18,679 ICD patients was used to evaluate the first delivered ATP treatment. We considered all device programs that were used for at least 50 patients, leaving us with 7 different programs and a total of 32,045 episodes. We used the two-proportions z-test (α = 0.01) to compare the probability of success and the probability for acceleration in each group with the corresponding values of the default setting. Results Overall, the first ATP treatment terminated in 78.4%–97.5% of episodes with slow VT and 81.5%–91.1% of episodes with fast VT. The default setting of the ATP programs with the number of sequences S = 3 was applied to treat 30.1% of the slow and 36.6% of the fast episodes. Reducing the maximum number of sequences to S = 2 decreased the success rate for slow VT (P < 0.0001, h = 0.38), while the setting S = 4 resulted in the highest success rate of 97.5% (P < 0.0001, h = 0.27). Conclusion While the default programs performed well, we found that increasing the number of sequences from 3 to 4 was a promising option to improve the overall ATP performance."
https://openalex.org/W2968038951,"Day care services aim to offer meaningful activities and a safe environment for the attendees and a respite for family caregivers while being cost effective. This study compares the use of formal and informal care in users and non-users of day care centres designed for persons with dementia.Users of day care designed for dementia (DC group) and non-users (NDC group) were followed over a period of 24 months or until nursing home admission (NHA) respectively death. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected at baseline and after 12 and 24 months. The use of care was recorded by Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD).A total of 257 persons with dementia participated in the study, 181 in the DC group and 76 in the NDC group. Users of day care centres cause higher costs due to the expenses for day care, while neither the use of home nursing, secondary care, informal care nor the time until NHA did show any differences between users and non-users. The overall costs were higher in the DC group at baseline and after 12 months, but this difference was no longer present at the end of the two-year study period.Our results indicate no potential cost-saving effect of day care designed for people with dementia, as the use of day care did neither result in a reduced use of care nor in a delay of NHA. Future research should balance the non-monetary benefits of day care against its costs for a full cost-effectiveness analysis, most favourable in a RCT-design."
https://openalex.org/W2968375994,"The use of elasticities of substitution between inputs is a standard method for addressing the effect of a change in the mix of inputs used for production from a technical or cost standpoint. Most estimation methods use parametric production or cost functions or frontiers to estimate these elasticities. A potentially useful nonparametric alternative is data envelopment analysis (DEA). The purpose of this paper is to derive elasticities of input substitution for both technical and cost frontiers using DEA, extending the use of this approach in the field of economics and associated fields. The paper provides derivations for both Hicksian (production and cost frontier) and Morishima (cost frontier) elasticities of input substitution, as well as a parsimonious method for estimating them using DEA. The derivations are presented using an agricultural example form Kansas, USA."
https://openalex.org/W2968492157,"Migration studies emphasize the role of economic, social and cultural capital in shaping out-migration decisions. Yet, little attention is paid to the effect of capital endowment on return migration, particularly among the highly educated. This article examines the extent to which different forms of capital determine return decisions of early-career researchers (ECRs). We hypothesized that individuals from more privileged backgrounds would repatriate at higher rates, due to the benefits that their capital stock might offer them upon homeland re-integration at home. Drawing on a sample of 223 early career Israeli scholars in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines, we used logistic regressions to analyze the effects of material wealth, social ties, and family-oriented cultural capital on their return propensities. No significant differences were found between repatriating and non-repatriating scholars with respect to cultural capital. However, accumulating social and economic capital was positively correlated with the decision to repatriate as was marrying into academic families."
https://openalex.org/W2968495644,"Human genome contains a group of more than a dozen similar genes with diverse biological functions including antiviral, antibacterial and angiogenesis activities. The characterized gene products of this group show significant sequence similarity and a common structural fold associated with binding and cleavage of ribonucleic acid (RNA) substrates. Therefore, these proteins have been categorized as members of human pancreatic-type ribonucleases (hRNases). hRNases differ in cell/tissue localization and display distinct substrate binding preferences and a wide range of ribonucleolytic catalytic efficiencies. Limited information is available about structural and dynamical properties that influence this diversity among these homologous RNases. Here, we use computer simulations to characterize substrate interactions, electrostatics and dynamical properties of hRNases 1–7 associated with binding to two nucleotide substrates (ACAC and AUAU). Results indicate that even with complete conservation of active-site catalytic triad associated with ribonucleolytic activity, these enzymes show significant differences in substrate interactions. Detailed characterization suggests that in addition to binding site electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, dynamics of distal regions may also play a role in binding. Another key insight is that a small difference in temperature of 300 K (used in experimental studies) and 310 K (physiological temperature) shows significant changes in enzyme-substrate interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2969017014,"Background Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infectious disease, continues to be a public health concern in many developing countries. However, lack of data concerning the public health burden and potential risk factors for the disease hampers control programs in target areas. Therefore, the aims of present study were to determine the prevalence of TB and genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis isolates from individuals visiting health facilities in South Gondar Zone, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectonal study was conducted between March 2015 and April 2017. Bacteriological examination, region of difference (RD) 9 based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping were used. Results The overall prevalence of all smear positive TB was 6.3% (186/2953). Extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) was clinically characterized in about 62.4% (116/186) TB-positive cases. Some demographic characteristics, such as patients' origin (districts where patients were recruited) [patients’ origin (chi-square (χ2) value; 62.8,p<0.001) were found to be significantly associated risk factors for the occurrence of TB in the study area. All the mycobacterial isolates were found to be M. tuberculosis. Among the 35 different spoligotype patterns identified, 22 patterns were shared types.The three dominantly identified families were T, CAS and Manu, each consisting of 46.9%, 24.0% and 10.4% of the isolates, respectively. Conclusion The present study revealed that TB continues to be a public health problem in South Gondar Zone which suggests a need of implementing effective disease control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2968132763,"Haptic sound symbolism has been found in adults, between ideophones and various textures, between words and shape, and between written words and texture. However, associations between the sound of nonwords and features other than shape and in early stages of development have been less explored. The present study investigates the haptic manifestation of sound symbolism in an early developmental stage. We examined associations between nonwords and the rough-smooth tactile dimension in 3.5-to-4.5-year-old children. Two experiments were conducted: a pointing selection task and a naming task. Sound symbolic associations were found in the naming task, but not in the pointing task. On the other hand an unexpected bias towards smoothness was found in the pointing task. We explain these results by suggesting that the articulation of nonwords may facilitate or intensify sound symbolism, and that hedonic biases are manifested in the pointing task."
