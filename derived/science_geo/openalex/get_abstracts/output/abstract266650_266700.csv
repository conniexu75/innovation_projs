https://openalex.org/W1996385709,"Current experimental and theoretical progress toward the goal of controlling quantum dynamics is summarized. Two key developments have now revitalized the field. First, appropriate ultrafast laser pulse shaping capabilities have only recently become practical. Second, the introduction of engineering control concepts has put the required theoretical framework on a rigorous foundation. Extrapolations to determine what is realistically possible are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1990324553,"Solid-state compounds have historically been prepared through high-temperature solid-solid reactions. New mechanistic understanding of these reactions suggests possible routes to metastable compositions and structures as well as to thermodynamically stable, low-temperature phases that decompose at higher temperatures. Intermediate-temperature synthetic techniques, including flux and hydrothermal methods, as well as low-temperature intercalation and coordination reactions, have recently been developed and have been used to prepare unprecedented materials with interesting electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. The trend in modern solid-state synthesis resembles increasingly the approach used in small-molecule chemistry, in the sense that attention to reaction mechanism and the use of molecular building blocks result in an ability to prepare new materials of designed structure."
https://openalex.org/W2071641751,"Very complicated inorganic solids can be self-assembled from structurally simple precursors as illustrated by the hydrothermal synthesis of the vanadium phosphate, [(CH(3))(2)NH(2)]K(4)[V(10)O(10)(H(2)O)(2)(OH)(4)(PO(4))(7)].4H(2)O, 1, which contains chiral double helices formed from interpenetrating spirals of vanadium oxo pentamers bonded together by P(5+). These double helices are in turn intertwined with each other in a manner that generates unusual tunnels and cavities that are filled with (CH(3))(2)NH(2)(+) and K(+) cations, respectively. The unit cell contents of dark blue phosphate 1, which crystallizes in the enantiomorphic space group P4(3) with lattice constants a = 12.130 and c = 30.555 angstroms, are chiral; only one enantiomorph is present in a given crystal. Magnetization measurements show that 1 is paramagnetic with ten unpaired electrons per formula unit at higher temperatures and that antiferromagnetic interactions develop at lower temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1978581664,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of graphite tubules (buckytubes) and their derivatives have revealed not only the previously reported buckytube geometries but also additional shapes of the buckytube derivatives. Detailed cross-sectional TEM images reveal the cylindrical cross section of buckytubes and the growth pattern of buckytubes as well as their derivatives. These observations of frozen growth stages of buckytubes and derivatives suggest a helical growth mechanism analogous to that of crystal growth via screw dislocations. The helicacy of buckytubes is analyzed by electron diffraction whereas the anisotropy of electronic structure is revealed by momentum transfer resolved electron energy loss spectrometry. Based on the TEM observations, it is proposed that buckytubes act as precursors to closed-shell fullerene (buckyball) formation and the possible steps in buckyball formation are outlined. In arc evaporation experiments in which residue rods (containing various amounts of buckytubes) were used as the starting anode for fullerene production, the amount of buckytubes in the rod was correlated with fullerene yield."
https://openalex.org/W2034797023,"The recent development of tunable far-infrared lasers and other high-resolution spectroscopic probes of weakly bound clusters is having a significant impact on our understanding of intermolecular forces and on the complex quantum tunneling dynamics that occur in hydrogen-bonded systems. Far-infrared studies of a variety of interactions are discussed, including several prototypical water-hydrophobe complexes, the water trimer, and the ammonia dimer. Particular attention is paid to the inversion of spectroscopic data to yield detailed intermolecular potential energy surfaces. Investigations of nonpairwise additivity are also described."
https://openalex.org/W2063198093,"The availability of macroscopic quantities of fullerenes has resulted in a vast number of physical and chemical studies of these new materials. However, the mechanisms that lead to the formation of these spherical carbon allotropes are not well understood. Mass spectral evidence has been obtained for the size-selective growth of fullerenes through the coalescence of cyclo[n] carbons, molecular carbon allotropes consisting of monocyclic rings with n carbon atoms. Whereas coalescence of cyclo[30]carbon (cyclo-C(30)) produces predominantly buckminsterfullerene (C(60)), the smaller rings cyclo-C(l8) and cyclo-C(24) preferentially produce fullerene C(70) through distinct intermediates. The present studies not only provide new insights into fullerene formation mechanisms but also raise the possibility of tailoring the size distributions of fullerenes by variation of the appropriate properties of the precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2172099827,"Peaks at 720 and 840 atomic mass units were identified by mass spectrometry in a sample extracted from a fulgurite, which is a glassy rock that forms where lightning strikes the ground. The peaks are interpreted as arising from C(60) and C(70) and the associated peaks as produced from other fullerenes. The intense conditions generated by the lightning not only melted the rock it struck and fused the associated soil but also allowed fullerenes to form, presumably from the organic debris in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2000956402,"As diamond-producing catalysts, 12 transition metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel were first reported by General Electric researchers more than 30 years ago. Since then, no additional elemental catalyst has been reported. An investigation of the catalytic action of group V elements is of great interest from the viewpoint of producing an n-type semiconducting diamond crystal. In the present study, diamond was synthesized from graphite in the presence of elemental phosphorus at high pressure and temperature (7.7 gigapascals and 1800 degrees C). Furthermore, single-crystal diamond was grown on a diamond seed crystal."

https://openalex.org/W1482754924,"Global air surface temperatures increased by about 0.6 degrees C during the 20th century, but as Zwiers and Weaver discuss in their Perspective, the warming was not continuous. Two distinct periods of warming, from 1910 to 1945 and since 1976, were separated by a period of very gradual cooling. The authors highlight the work by Stott et al., who have performed the most comprehensive simulation of 20th century climate to date. The agreement between observed and simulated temperature variations strongly suggests that forcing from anthropogenic activities, moderated by variations in solar and volcanic forcing, has been the main driver of climate change during the past century."

https://openalex.org/W1985123282,Sputtering of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by 248-nanometer laser radiation was studied. Neutral carbon atoms and small clusters were ejected with significantly higher translational energies than were expected from a simple model of thermal vaporization in the absence of a potential barrier. The HOPG also developed a remarkable surface morphology that consists of regular cones and domes. Cone formation appears to be initiated by trace metal impurities that serve as heat shunts in this highly anisotropic material.
https://openalex.org/W1982729311,"Interchange of saline lake water between the northwest body of Great Salt Lake, Utah, comprising about one-third of the lake area, and the main body of the lake, has been severely restricted by the completion of a railroad embankment across the lake in 1959. The northwest body has a relatively small volume of inflow and a somewhat greater rate of evaporation than the main body. As a result, there has been a net flow of saline water northward and accompanying deposition of a thick layer of salt over the bottom and shore of the northwest body. A unique set of hydrologic and physical-chemical influences are in action, and further important effects on the entire lake are expected."

Some of the reservoirs are offered more replenish­ ment from rain or from streams than they can accept; others receive negligi­ ble inflow. Moreover, an unmeasured but sizable proportion of the available ground water does not meet prevailing high standards of purity. And finally, these natural peculiarities are not the only source of man's difficulties with the ground-water supply. By his use of land and water man may alter the be­ havior of ground water in unpredict­ able—or, more properly, unpredicted —ways, with sometimes dismaying and irreversible effects."

https://openalex.org/W2078593397,"As long-term participants in international collaborative research projects related to biodiversity informatics, we strongly support the activities described in Science 's [special issue][1] of 29 September and believe that they should be carried out worldwide and that all data should be shared by all countries. Moreover, the collaborations under way should receive more attention, not only technologically, but also conceptually.

The conventional pattern of collaboration—funds come from mainly developed countries and raw data from mainly developing countries—is in need of reform. Many developing countries are willing to contribute to global data systems, but they may also be concerned that without foreign technical assistance their own data systems could not be maintained after completion of the collaborative projects. As an ancient Chinese proverb says, “Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day; teach him how to fish and he will eat for the rest of his days.” The availability of core technology and advice rather than money is more important for a successful collaboration between developed and developing countries. We believe that the biodiversity data “fishing expedition” would benefit from attention to this issue.

At present, the establishment of close collaborations between biodiversity scientists in developing countries and more highly trained computer scientists and engineers from developed countries is still a necessary and valuable step during the development phase of biodiversity informatics systems, for, as another Chinese proverb suggests, “It is better to go back and make a net than to stand by the pond and long for fish.”

https://openalex.org/W1676852359,"Nucleons (protons and neutrons) have been extensively studied over the past 30 or 40 years, but our knowledge of their internal structure remains rather limited, largely because the nucleon's constituents, the quarks, are so tightly bound that the nucleon cannot be taken apart. As Rosner discusses in his Perspective, scattering experiments are providing increasingly detailed information about the spatial distribution of charges, spins, and currents within the nucleon. He highlights the work by Hasty et al., which goes a long way toward determining the role of ""strange"" quarks, originally thought not to play a role in ordinary matter."
