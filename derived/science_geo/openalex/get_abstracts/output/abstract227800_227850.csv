https://openalex.org/W2019047723,"Modulation of tumor suppressor activities may provide new opportunities for cancer therapy. Here we show that disruption of the gene Ppm1d encoding Wip1 phosphatase activated the p53 and p16 (also called Ink4a)-p19 (also called ARF) pathways through p38 MAPK signaling and suppressed in vitro transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) by oncogenes. Disruption of the gene Cdkn2a (encoding p16 and p19), but not of Trp53 (encoding p53), reconstituted cell transformation in Ppm1d-null MEFs. In vivo, deletion of Ppm1d in mice bearing mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter-driven oncogenes Erbb2 (also called c-neu) or Hras1 impaired mammary carcinogenesis, whereas reduced expression of p16 and p19 by methylation-induced silencing or inactivation of p38 MAPK correlated with tumor appearance. We conclude that inactivation or depletion of the Wip1 phosphatase with resultant p38 MAPK activation suppresses tumor appearance by modulating the Cdkn2a tumor-suppressor locus."

We previously identified a locus linked to FCHL on 1q21–q23 in Finnish families with the disease3. This region has also been linked to FCHL in families from other populations4,5,6 as well as to type 2 diabetes mellitus7,8,9,10,11,12. These clinical entities have several overlapping phenotypic features, raising the possibility that the same gene may underlie the obtained linkage results. Here, we show that the human gene encoding thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) on 1q, which underlies combined hyperlipidemia in mice13, is not associated with FCHL. We show that FCHL is linked and associated with the gene encoding upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) in 60 extended families with FCHL, including 721 genotyped individuals (P = 0.00002), especially in males with high triglycerides (P = 0.0000009). Expression profiles in fat biopsy samples from individuals with FCHL seemed to differ depending on their carrier status for the associated USF1 haplotype. USF1 encodes a transcription factor known to regulate several genes of glucose and lipid metabolism14,15,16,17."

Only limited information is available in TRPV1 on the residues that contribute to vanilloid activation. Interestingly, rabbits have been suggested to be insensitive to capsaicin and have been shown to lack detectable [3H]RTX binding in membranes prepared from their dorsal root ganglia. We have cloned rabbit TRPV1 (oTRPV1) and report that it exhibits high homology to rat and human TRPV1. Like its mammalian orthologs, oTRPV1 is selectively expressed in sensory neurons and is sensitive to protons and heat activation but is 100-fold less sensitive to vanilloid activation than either rat or human. Here we identify key residues (Met547 and Thr550) in transmembrane regions 3 and 4 (TM3/4) of rat and human TRPV1 that confer vanilloid sensitivity, [3H]RTX binding and competitive antagonist binding to rabbit TRPV1. We also show that these residues differentially affect ligand recognition as well as the assays of functional response versus ligand binding. Furthermore, these residues account for the reported pharmacological differences of RTX, PPAHV (phorbol 12-phenyl-acetate 13-acetate 20-homovanillate) and capsazepine between human and rat TRPV1. Based on our data we propose a model of the TM3/4 region of TRPV1 bound to capsaicin or RTX that may aid in the development of potent TRPV1 antagonists with utility in the treatment of sensory disorders.

TRPV1 belongs to a superfamily of ion channels known as transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) several of which appear to be sensors of temperature (2Julius D. Basbaum A.I.

TRPV1 can be activated by exogenous agonists (capsaicin and RTX) and by physical stimuli such as heat (>42 °C) and protons (pH 5). Possible endogenous ligands released during tissue injury have also been suggested, including anandamide (arachidonylethanolamine or AEA) and products of lipoxygenases such as 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, N-arachidonyldopamine (NADA), and N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA) (4Hwang S.W.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar) reported that TRPV1 is detectable at increased levels after inflammatory injury in rodents and speculated that the increased level of TRPV1 protein combined with the confluence of stimuli present in inflammatory injury states leads to a reduced threshold of activation of nociceptors that express TRPV1, i.e. hyperalgesia. Indeed the converse is true that TRPV1-deficient mice display reduced thermal hypersensitivity following inflammatory tissue injury (9Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J.

Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar).Structure-function studies of this channel are in their infancy, but fundamental observations have been reported. Publications of species differences, based upon differential binding of the radiolabeled TRPV1 agonist [3H]RTX to dorsal root ganglia membranes, were recorded even before TRPV1 was cloned (10Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Of note, rabbits were found to be resistant to the acute toxicity of capsaicin (11Glinsukon T. Stitmunnaithum V. Toskulkao C. Baranawuti T. Tangkrisanavinont V. Toxicon. 1980; 18: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and were found not to have [3H]RTX binding sites (10Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These observations have provided the basis for an approach to identify key regions involved in TRPV1 binding and activation by RTX and capsaicin by cloning TRPV1 from capsaicin-sensitive and insensitive species (rat (1Caterina M.J.

Rat and human TRPV1 have been pharmacologically characterized proving that capsaicin and RTX are indeed agonists of TRPV1 (capsaicin EC50: 0.05–0.2 μm and RTX EC50: 0.3–11 nm) transiently expressed in HEK293 cells (12Hayes P.

Interestingly, these studies have indicated species differences in antagonism, such as the report that capsazepine blocks human but not rat TRPV1 response to low pH (18McIntyre P. McLatchie L.M.

Kang C.J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mutational analysis of extracellular loops (21Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have identified domains that contribute to capsaicin and proton activation, respectively. These studies have demonstrated that capsaicin appears to function from the intracellular side, and protons act on an extracellular site to activate TRPV1. We have previously reported the cloning of rabbit TRPV1 and that it is capsaicin-insensitive but activated by heat (45 °C) and protons (pH 5) in transiently expressed HEK293 cells (13Edenson S. Tamir R. Neering S. Wild K. Yang R. Treanor J. Lile J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 39.4Google Scholar). Jordt and Julius (15Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) have more recently shown that heterologously expressed chicken TRPV1 (gTRPV1) is similarly insensitive to activation by capsaicin but sensitive to heat (>42 °C) and proton (pH 4.5) stimuli. Furthermore, Jordt and Julius (15Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) showed that the TM3/4 region of TRPV1 appeared to be responsible for capsaicin sensitivity. Experiments by other investigators have identified additional residues on the N- and C-terminal domains of TRPV1 that also appear to modify capsaicin sensitivity as well as [3H]RTX binding (23Jung J.

We determine, utilizing radioactive calcium (45Ca2+) uptake assays and whole cell patch clamp techniques, the sensitivity of oTRPV1 and mutants to the published activators of TRPV1. Binding of [3H]RTX was used to probe residues important for the high affinity binding of this ligand to TRPV1. Furthermore, we examine the functional sensitivity of oTRPV1 and mutants to capsaicin site antagonists and show that gain of capsaicin sensitivity also confers competitive antagonist action at TRPV1. Last, we present a model of capsaicin and RTX bound to the TM3/4 region of rat TRPV1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—A cDNA library was made in pSPORT vector from poly(A)+-containing RNA extracted from dorsal root ganglia dissected from New Zealand White rabbits. The library was screened at high stringency (2× SSC, 65 °C) with a rTRPV1 probe (bases 1063–2185, the sequence with GenBank™ accession number AF029310). Several clones were isolated, and the longest full-length clone, designated oTRPV1, was chosen for expression studies. The sequence of this cDNA has been submitted to the GenBank™ (accession number AY487342).Rat-rabbit (r/o) TRPV1 chimera was generated by restriction cloning. ClaI and PmlI restriction sites were introduced into pcDNA3.1-oTRPV1 construct using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Ser505-Thr550 fragment was PCR-amplified from rTRPV1 (ClaI and PmlI sites were included in PCR primers) and cloned into oTRPV1 ClaI-PmlI. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit following the manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was carried out using 33P-labeled riboprobes as described previously by Wilcox (25Wilcox J.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A unique 500-bp PCR fragment of oTRPV1 cDNA was subcloned into the polylinker site of pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Linearized constructs were transcribed with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense or sense [33P]uridine triphosphate-labeled RNA probes, respectively (Promega SP6/T7 kit). Sections were hybridized overnight at 55 °C with the 33P-labeled antisense or sense riboprobes corresponding to oTRPV1. Sections were examined with dark field and standard illumination (bright field) to allow simultaneous evaluation of tissue morphology and hybridization signal.Transient Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine). Cells were transiently transfected with a cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) encoding an appropriate TRPV1 receptor by using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent (75 μl of FuGENE and 45 μg of plasmid per 1.5–1.7 × 107 cells in a 225-cm2 culture flask). After 24 h the large pool of transfected cells was reseeded into Amersham Biosciences Cytostar plates for 45Ca uptake studies, into 3-cm dishes for whole cell patch-clamp recording studies, into clear polystyrene 96-well plates for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunostaining, or spun down, and pellets were used for [3H]RTX binding assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunostaining with appropriate anti-VR1 antibodies were used to measure expression levels.Stable Transfections—CHO cells stably expressing rTRPV1, oTRPV1, oTRPV1-I550T, oTRPV1-L547M, or oTRPV1-L547M/I550T were generated by transfection with pcDNA 3.1-expression vector encoding an appropriate TRPV1 cDNA. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. The CaOPO4 method was used for stable transfections (5 μg of DNA per 2 × 106 cells in 60-mm dishes). 800 μg/ml Geneticin was used as a selection agent. After about 2 weeks of selection single colonies were picked and screened for expression of TRPV1 in a 45Ca2+ uptake assay. Positive clones were expanded and used in all of our studies similarly to HEK293 transients.Functional Assays—The activation of TRPV1 is followed as a function of cellular uptake of radioactive calcium (45Ca2+, ICN). All the 45Ca2+ uptake assays had a final 45Ca2+ at 10 μCi/ml. The assays were as follows: 1) Agonist assay: agonists were incubated with vector or TRPV1 expressing HEK293 cells in 1:1 ratio of F-12 and Hanks' buffered saline solution supplemented with BSA, 0.1 mg/ml, and 1 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 at room temperature for 2 min in the presence of 45Ca2+ prior to compound washout. 2) Capsaicin antagonist assay: compounds were preincubated with vector or TRPV1 expressing HEK293 or CHO cells in Hanks' buffered saline solution supplemented with BSA, 0.1 mg/ml, and 1 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 at room temperature for 2 min prior to addition of 45Ca2+ in F-12 and then left for an additional 2 min prior to compound washout. 3) Proton antagonist assay: compounds were preincubated with vector or TRPV1 expressing HEK293 or CHO cells at room temperature for 2 min prior to addition of 45Ca2+ in 30 mm HEPES/MES buffer (final assay pH 5) and then left for an additional 2 min prior to compound washout. 4) Compound washout and analysis: assay plates were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 mg/ml BSA using an ELX405 plate washer (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.) immediately after functional assay. Radioactivity in the 96-well plates was measured using a MicroBeta Jet (Wallac Inc.). Compound activity was then calculated using GraphPad Prism. Maximum 45Ca2+ uptake in agonist dose response was considered as 100% for each agonist in calculating the EC50 values.[3H]RTX Binding Assay—Binding studies with [3H]RTX were carried as described previously with minor modifications (10Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding assay mixtures were set up on ice in glass tubes (Kimble Glass Inc.) and consisted of 200 μl of binding buffer (5 mm KCl, 5.8 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 137 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8), 50 μl of [3H]RTX (different concentrations, 37 Ci/mmol specific activity, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 100 μl of cell suspension (0.5–1 × 106/per tube). The assay mix contained BSA at a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml (Cohn fraction V, Sigma). In each set of experiments, total binding and nonspecific binding were defined in the presence of 3.5 μl of cold RTX (1 μm final concentration). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C shaking water bath for 1 h (50 rpm). Binding reactions were terminated by chilling the assay mixtures on ice for 5 min. 100 μl of α1-acid glycoprotein (2 mg/ml; Sigma) was added into the binding mix and incubated for an additional 10 min to reduce nonspecific binding. The bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation in a Beckman 12 Microfuge. The tip of the Microfuge tubes containing the cell pellet was cut off, and the bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Wallac). Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism.Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells transiently expressing the TRPV1 channels were maintained at 37 °Cina5%CO2 atmosphere. Whole-cell membrane currents were recorded using the whole cell patch-clamp technique (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar). The external calcium-free recording solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Recording micropipettes were filled with an internal recording solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The micropipettes had resistances ranging from 2 to 4 mÙ and were connected to an AxoPatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.), driven by a desktop computer through a DigiData 1322A digitizer (Axon Instruments Inc.). Liquid junction potentials were manually corrected before establishing the seal. Upon achieving a GÙ seal, the patch was ruptured and whole cell currents were recorded during the application of voltage pulses generated using pClamp version 8.0 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Currents were filtered at 5 kHz by a low pass 8-pole Bessel filter and acquired at 10 kHz, in episodic mode. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–22 °C) by holding the membrane potential at -60 mV. A “sewer-pipe” perfusion system (Rapid Solution Changer model RSC-200, Bio-Logic Science Instrument SA, France) was used to apply solutions directly to the cell under study. Capsaicin and Ruthenium Red were dissolved directly into external recording solution. Recording solutions were adjusted to the desired pH by adding HCl. Data was analyzed using pClamp version 8.0 and Prism version 3.02 (GraphPad).Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was carried out using Insight II (2000) software (Accelrys Inc.). Transmembrane helices and connecting segments were modeled using the Biopolymer module of Insight II (2000). RTX and capsaicin structures were generated and minimized using Insight II tools.RESULTSAll studies of mutant TRPV1 function were conducted using transient transfections in HEK293 cells. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells followed by immunohistochemical staining for TRPV1 protein indicated that all TRPV1 cDNAs studied in this report appeared to be expressed. However, this technique did not allow for quantitative analysis of the number of functional channels expressed on the cell surface, and as such all of the data presented here are discussed as relative activity. Interpretation of 45Ca2+ uptake assays utilizing different TRPV1 mutants assumed that all have the same permeability to calcium ions. oTRPV1 gain-of-function mutants were also characterized by stable expression in CHO cells.oTRPV1 Is Less Sensitive to Capsaicin Activation Than Rat TRPV1—To determine if oTRPV1 is indeed less sensitive to vanilloids than other species, oTRPV1 was cloned from a bacterial colony screen of a rabbit DRG cDNA library utilizing hybridization with a radiolabeled 32P-rTRPV1 probe. A cDNA clone (2.4 kb) was identified whose predicted protein sequence had high homology to rTRPV1 (86% identity and 91% similarity) and hTRPV1 (87% identity and 92% similarity; Table I and Fig. 1A). In situ hybridization of rabbit dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sections with a probe generated from the oTRPV1 cDNA revealed strong labeling of cells in the DRG (Fig. 1B) with expression restricted to the small and medium diameter cell bodies consistent with that seen in other species. Studies showed that conditions capable of robustly activating rTRPV1 had a mixed effect on oTRPV1. Whereas oTRPV1 was activated by heat (45 °C) or pH 5 similar to rTRPV1, it was not activated by capsaicin at supra-maximal activation concentrations for rTRPV1 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, oTRPV1-transfected HEK293 cells did not show any specific [3H]RTX binding, whereas rTRPV1-transfected cells showed specific binding with a KD value of 0.089 ± 0.01 nm.Table IIdentity and homology between TRPV1 from different species (rabbit, oTRPV1; rat, rTRPV1; human, hTRPV1; chicken, gTRPV1; guinea pig, gpTRPV1) For each species identity is shown at the top, and similarity is shown in the bottom row.oTRPV1hTRPV1gpTRPV1gTRPV1%rTRPV18685856591929177oTRPV1878465929077hTRPV184649077gpTRPV16476 Open table in a new tab Agonist sensitivity was also characterized by electrophysiology. Perfusion of voltage-clamped cells transiently expressing TRPV1 with low pH solution elicited an inward current, with amplitudes that increased with lower pH (e.g. Fig. 1D). Average peak currents at pH 5 for rTRPV1 and oTRPV1 were 310.3 ± 85.8 μA/microfarad (n = 5), 281.9 ± 24.6 μA/microfarad (n = 5), respectively. Low pH elicited a much smaller current of 1.02 ± 0.93 pA/picofarad (n = 6 cells) in mock transfected HEK293 cells, which indicated that the proton-activated current in (rat and rabbit) TRPV1-transfected cells was primarily mediated by TRPV1. Large currents were also observed in response to 1 and 10 μm capsaicin in rTRPV1-transfected cells. In contrast, 1 μm capsaicin failed to generate any current in oTRPV1-transfected cells, although 10 μm evoked a small current (Fig. 1D). These experiments confirmed that oTRPV1 was functionally expressed in HEK293 cells and that oTRPV1 was much less sensitive to activation by capsaicin than rTRPV1. However, the small current elicited with 10 μm capsaicin suggested a rudimentary capsaicin-site in oTRPV1. The ability of Ruthenium Red to block oTRPV1 was also tested in patch-clamp studies. Ruthenium Red (10 μm) application 10 s after pH 5 activation blocked 83.4 ± 8.2% of the oTRPV1 current (n = 5 cells; Fig. 1E). These data verified that proton activation of oTRPV1 is sensitive to pore blockade similar to rTRPV1. In summary, sequence similarities to TRPV1s from other species, the activation profile of oTRPV1 by proton and heat, blockade of the proton and heat responses by Ruthenium Red, and the expression pattern of oTRPV1 mRNA in rabbit dorsal root ganglia confirm that oTRPV1 is the rabbit orthologue of TRPV1. The limited sensitivity of oTRPV1 to capsaicin and RTX and lack of detectable [3H]RTX binding agree with published data on the expected properties of oTRPV1 (10Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M.

Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) previously showed that the TM3/4 region of TRPV1 appears to be responsible for capsaicin sensitivity. Functional analysis of transiently transfected cells by 45Ca2+ uptake showed that the r/o chimera gained sensitivity to vanilloids (EC50 for capsaicin: 0.051 ± 0.029 μm and RTX: 11 ± 5 nm) similar to rTRPV1 (Fig. 2A). Sensitivity of the r/o chimera to capsaicin was also characterized by electrophysiology. Currents evoked by pH 5 and 1 μm capsaicin were similar in the chimera and rTRPV1 (Figs. 1D and 2A, bottom panel). In addition, we also made a human-rabbit chimera (h/o chimera) transferring the Ser505-Thr550 from hTRPV1 to oTRPV1. Similar to r/o chimera, functional analysis showed that h/o chimera gained sensitivity to capsaicin (Fig. 2A), further confirming that the TM3/4 region is responsible for vanilloid sensitivity.Fig. 2Substitution of the Ser505-Thr550 region or I550T alone confer capsaicin sensitivity to oTRPV1. A, top panel: concentration-dependent capsaicin-induced 45Ca2+ uptake by HEK293 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding rat, rabbit, rat/rabbit (r/o) chimera, human, or human/rabbit (h/o) TRPV1 chimera. TRPV1 r/o chimera shows sensitivity to capsaicin similar to rTRPV1 (EC50 values of 0.051 ± 0.029 μm and 0.046 ± 0.036 μm, respectively). TRPV1 h/o chimera shows sensitivity to capsaicin similar to hTRPV1. (EC50 values of 0.048 ± 0.019 μm and 0.072 ± 0.029 μm, respectively). Similar results were obtained in six independent experiments; error bars indicate S.E. Bottom panel: proton and capsaicin-evoked currents in HEK293 cells transfected with TRPV1 r/o chimera. Capsaicin (1 or 10 μm) response of r/o chimera is similar to that of rTRPV1. B, top panel: stimulation of 45Ca2+ uptake into HEK293 cells transiently transfected with rat, rabbit, or rabbit I550T mutant of TRPV1 by capsaicin. I550T mutation alone confers capsaicin sensitivity to oTRPV1 (EC50 value: 0.052 ± 0.034 μm (n = 12), similar to that of rat TRPV1). Bottom panel: representative current trace recorded from HEK293 cells expressing oTRPV1-I550T demonstrate gain of capsaicin sensitivity compared with oTRPV1.

Lysosomal exocytosis is regulated by synaptotagmin VII, a member of the synaptotagmin family of Ca2+-binding proteins localized on lysosomes. Here we show that Ca2+-dependent interaction of the synaptotagmin VII C2A domain with SNAP-23 is facilitated by syntaxin 4. Specific interactions also occurred in cell lysates between the plasma membrane t-SNAREs SNAP-23 and syntaxin 4 and the lysosomal v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7. Following cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, SDS-resistant complexes containing SNAP-23, syntaxin 4, and TI-VAMP/VAMP7 were detected on membrane fractions. Lysosomal exocytosis was inhibited by the SNARE domains of syntaxin 4 and TI-VAMP/VAMP7 and by cleavage of SNAP-23 with botulinum neurotoxin E, thereby functionally implicating these SNAREs in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of conventional lysosomes.

Syt VII-deficient mice show defects in cell resealing and develop a form of autoimmune myositis, with inflammation and increased collagen accumulation in the skin and skeletal muscle (5Chakrabarti S.

Synaptotagmins contain two C2 domains in their cytosolic region, which can bind phospholipids in response to Ca2+, as well as components of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes (10Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins are thought to be key mediators of all intracellular membrane fusion events (11Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized SNARE complex is the one involved in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons. This complex consists of synaptobrevin/VAMP2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 2) on the vesicle membrane, and syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) on the plasma membrane (12Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1 and VAMP2 each contribute one α-helical domain and SNAP-25 two domains to a parallel four-helix coiled-coil bundle, which has been proposed to provide the force necessary to bring the opposing bilayers together and cause membrane fusion (13Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 14Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). There are multiple ubiquitously expressed isoforms of the three SNAREs involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a finding that has led to the hypothesis that SNAREs might be determinants of the specificity of different fusion events within a cell (15Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Syt I specifically interacts with the target SNAREs (t-SNAREs) syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (16Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and these interactions are thought to be key for its proposed function as a Ca2+ sensor for rapid synaptic vesicle exocytosis (10Chapman E.R.

In this study, we sought to identify SNARE proteins involved in the Ca2+-triggered fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane. In analogy to previous findings on Syt I-regulated synaptic vesicle exocytosis, we hypothesized that the SNARE complex mediating lysosomal exocytosis interacts with Syt VII and consists of a VAMP isoform on the lysosome and syntaxin and/or SNAP-25 isoforms on the plasma membrane. Consistent with this view, our studies identified interactions between Syt VII and a Ca2+-triggered SNARE complex containing the lysosomal vesicle SNARE (v-SNARE) TI (toxin-insensitive)-VAMP/VAMP7 (18Galli T.

Lysosomal exocytosis was specifically inhibited by interfering with the capacity of these SNARE proteins to assemble into a complex, thus confirming their functional role in the process. Antibodies and DNA Constructs—Anti-rat SNAP-23 was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (catalog number PA1-738). Anti-syntaxin 2 and 6 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem (catalog numbers 574786 and 574790), and anti-syntaxin 3 and 4 were purchased from Alomone Labs (catalog numbers ANR-005 and ANR-004). G. Reed (Harvard School of Public Health) kindly provided affinity-purified anti-syntaxin 4 rabbit antibodies. The anti-TI-VAMP/VAMP7 monoclonal antibodies (Cl 158.2) were generated in T. Galli's laboratory (22Muzerelle A. Alberts P. Martinez-Arca S. Jeannequin O. Lafaye P. Mazie J.C. Galli T. Gaspar P. Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LY1C6 anti-Lamp-1 monoclonal antibodies were provided by I. Mellman, Yale University. Anti-Syt VII rabbit antibodies were generated as described previously (2Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T.

Secondary Alexa Fluor488-labeled anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Molecular Probes, and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. To obtain the H3 SNARE domain of syntaxin isoforms, we used the following oligonucleotide primers: syntaxin 2, 5′-CATATGCAGATTACTAGGCAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTATTTCCGTCTGGCCTTGC-3′ (reverse); syntaxin 3, 5′-CATATGCAGATTTCCAAGCAAGCCCTCAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTACTTTCGAGCCTGACC-3′ (reverse); syntaxin 4, 5′-CATATGCAGGTGACCCGGCAGGCCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTATTTCTTCCTCGCCTTCTTC-3′ (reverse); syntaxin 6, 5′-CATATGCAGCAGGCACAGCAGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTAGGCACACCACTGGCGCCGATC-3′ (reverse); and syntaxin 7, 5′-CATATGGAAATCACAGAGGATGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTAGGTTTTTCTGGATTTGC-3′ (reverse). To obtain the coiled coil domain of VAMP4, we used the primers 5′-CATATGGGACCTAGAAATGATAAAATTAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTACCTTCGAAGCTGTTTGG-3′ (reverse). To obtain the SNARE domain of TI-VAMP/VAMP7, we used the primers 5′-CATATGAATCAGAGCCTGGACAGAGTGACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCCTTACCGGGCAAGGTTCCTGC-3′ (reverse). These primers all contain an NdeI site in the forward primer and a BamHI site in the reverse primer (underlined). cDNA synthesized from total NRK cell RNA was cleaved by restriction digest, cloned into pET15b (Novagen), and checked by sequencing. His-tagged C2A domains from synaptotagmin I and VII were cloned as described previously (2Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The construct encoding the His-tagged BoNT/E light chain (23Martinez-Arca S. Alberts P. Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was created as described previously (24Vaidyanathan V.V. Yoshino K. Jahnz M. Dorries C. Bade S. Nauenburg S. Niemann H.

These NH2-terminal polyhistidine fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(dE3)pLysS (Stratagene) and purified on nickel-agarose, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Full-length SNAP-23 cDNA was generated from total NRK RNA using the primers 5′-GAATTCATGGATGATCTATCACCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCGACTTAGCTGTCAATGAGTTTC-3′ (reverse) containing the restriction sites for EcoRI in the forward primer and SalI in the reverse primer (underlined). The cleaved cDNA was cloned into pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in BL21(dE3)pLysS (Stratagene), and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—For staining with antibodies against TIVAMP/VAMP7 and Lamp-1, NRK cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, followed by 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min. After permeabilization with 0.01% saponin for 15 min, the cells were incubated with antibodies against Lamp-1 (1:100) and TI-VAMP/VAMP7 (1:100). For staining with antibodies against VAMP7 and synaptotagmin VII, NRK cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After one wash with 0.1 m glycine, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with antibodies against TI-VAMP/VAMP7 (1:100) and Syt VII (1:200). Infection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with T. cruzi trypomastigotes was performed for 1 h as described previously (7Caler E.V. Chakrabarti S. Fowler K.T. Rao S. Andrews N.W. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasma Membrane Isolation—NRK cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 15 mm Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in Biotinylation Buffer (10 mm sodium borate, pH 8.8, 150 mm NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm NH4Cl. The biotinylated cells were then scraped into Cytosolic Lysis Buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture), incubated on ice for 5 min, and disrupted with 25 strokes of a ball-bearing homogenizer. The resulting lysate was spun at 200 × g to pellet nuclei and intact cells. The supernatant was incubated with Ultralink Immobilized Neutravidin beads (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed twice in Cytosolic Lysis Buffer, resuspended in 1× Sample Buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the detection of SDS-resistant complexes, confluent monolayers of NRK cells were washed in PBS and treated with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in PBS for 15 min on ice, followed by 2 mm dithiothreitol in PBS for 15 min on ice to inactivate NEM. Cells were scraped in either Cytosolic Lysis Buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Total membranes were prepared as described in the plasma membrane purification except that instead of binding to the Neutravidin beads, the homogenized cells were spun at 14,000 × g to pellet all membranes, which were then mixed with 1× SDS Sample Buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. Binding Assays—NRK cells were lysed in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2), spun in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and pre-cleared by incubating with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose 4B bound to either GST only or GST fused to the C2A domain of Syt VII. The beads were washed three times with Buffer A and eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A, followed by an elution in the same buffer containing 5 mm EGTA instead of 1 mm CaCl2. The eluted fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 1 × Sample Buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For binding assays to His-tagged C2A constructs, the His-tagged C2A domain of Syt I or Syt VII was bound to Affi-Gel 10 beads in Buffer A for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then treated with 0.25 m Tris, pH 8, for 1 h to block unreacted sites. NRK cells were treated with 1 mm NEM for 15 min on ice followed by treatment with 2 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min on ice. The cells were then lysed in Buffer A and incubated with the C2A-bound beads for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times in Buffer A, suspended in 1× Sample Buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the Seize X IP kit (Pierce). NRK cell lysates prepared as described above were diluted in an equal volume of Binding/Wash Buffer and added to antibody-coupled beads. After a 1-h rotation at room temperature, the beads were washed three times, and bound proteins were eluted and combined with 3× Sample Buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Toxin Cleavage—Recombinant His-tagged BoNT/E was activated by treatment with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C and incubated with NRK lysates prepared as above for at least 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 3× SDS Sample Buffer and boiling for 5 min. Streptolysin-O Permeabilization and β-Hexosaminidase Secretion—NRK cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a concentration of 5 × 105 per 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS and allowed to grow overnight. Cells were washed in ice-cold β-hexosaminidase Assay Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 110 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 11 mm glucose) and treated with streptolysin-O (SLO), obtained from S. Bhakdi, Mainz, Germany) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 7 min on ice. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold Low Ionic Strength Medium (LISM, 5 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm glucose, 220 mm sucrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin), incubated in LISM at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of varying concentrations of recombinant protein, and finally incubated in 5 mm free Mg2+ and 2 mm ATP-containing Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 40 mm KCl, 100 mm potassium glutamate, and 5 mm EGTA) with or without 1 μm free Ca2+ for 10 min at 37 °C. The desired concentrations of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ were obtained with a Ca2+ or Mg2+/EGTA buffering system calculated using the software by Foehr and Warchol. Supernatants were collected, and the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 to determine the total amount of β-hexosaminidase remaining in the cells. For detection of β-hexosaminidase activity, 350 μl was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 50 μl of 6 mm 4-methylumbel-liferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in sodium citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.5. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2 m Na2CO3, 1.1 m glycine, and the fluorescence was measured at excitation 365 nm, emission 450 nm. For toxin treatment, cells were incubated in LISM at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of varying concentrations of activated toxin. Electroporation, Surface Staining for Lamp-1, and Flow Cytometry—Confluent monolayers of NRK cells were trypsinized and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 3% FBS and 10 mm HEPES, NaOH, pH 7, at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. 400 μl of this suspension was added to a Gene Pulser Cuvette (Bio-Rad), and cells were electroporated at 300 V and 450 microfarads, followed by a 5-min incubation on ice. After 1 min at 37 °C, the cells were returned to ice and stained for surface-exposed Lamp-1. Briefly, cells were resuspended in 50 μl of LY1C6 hybridoma supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 10 mm NH4Cl, and stained with Alexa Fluor488 goat-anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. A fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), was used to excite the cells at 488 nm, and the emission was collected through a 530/30-nm bandpass filter. A minimum of 10,000 cells was analyzed in each sample. Data analysis was performed using CellQuest (BD Biosciences). Microinjection and Surface Staining for Lamp-1—Microinjection and staining for surface Lamp-1 was carried out as described previously (4Reddy A. Caler E. Andrews N. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4.5 × 105/4 ml NRK cells were plated on coverslips and allowed to grow overnight. The coverslips were then transferred to Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10% FBS and placed on a heated microscope stage at 37 °C. Previously activated and/or heat-killed BoNT/E was microinjected into the cells at a concentration of 400 nm in microinjection buffer (150 mm potassium gluconate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES) containing Texas Red dextran (4Reddy A. Caler E. Andrews N. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The cells were returned to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by treatment with 10 μm ionomycin for 3 min at 37 °C, and staining on ice for surface-exposed Lamp-1. Viability Assay—Confluent monolayers of NRK cells were scraped in the presence of buffer alone, 1 μm BoNT/E, or heat-inactivated BoNT/E, plated out in serial dilutions of 100 μl in a 96-well plate, and allowed to recover at 37 °C. After 4 h, 10 μl of 12 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added to each well, and the plate was returned to 37 °C. After 4 h, 100 μl of a 10% SDS, 0.01 m HCl solution was added to each well, and the plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was determined at 570 nm. The v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7 Co-localizes with Syt VII on Lysosomes—The v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7 (18Galli T. Zahraoui A. Vaidyanathan V.V. Raposo G. Tian J.M. Karin M. Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was recently shown to be specifically targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes of HeLa cells by its amino-terminal Longin domain (19Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M. Raposo G. Camonis J. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Daviet L. Formstecher E. Hamburger A. Filippini F. D'Esposito M. Galli T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with prior observations in NRK cells, in which Myc-tagged TI-VAMP/VAMP7 was targeted to compartments containing the lysosomal glycoprotein Lamp-1 (25Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody against TIVAMP/VAMP7 (22Muzerelle A. Alberts P. Martinez-Arca S. Jeannequin O. Lafaye P. Mazie J.C. Galli T. Gaspar P. Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) confirmed that endogenous TI-VAMP/VAMP7 is present on lysosomes in NRK cells. Extensive overlap of TI-VAMP/VAMP7 with Lamp-1 (Fig. 1A) and Syt VII (Fig. 1B) staining was observed. Previous studies showed that in NRK cells Syt VII is localized on Lamp-1-positive, dense lysosomes, which also contain the processed form of cathepsin L (2Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data identified TI-VAMP/VAMP7 as a candidate for involvement in a complex with plasma membrane t-SNAREs to drive lysosomal exocytosis, because it is the only v-SNARE detected so far on the membrane of mature lysosomes in mammalian cells. Consistent with this view, endogenous TI-VAMP/VAMP7 was detected on recently formed intracellular vacuoles containing T. cruzi, the protozoan parasite that utilizes Ca2+-regulated lysosomal exocytosis for invasion (Fig. 1C) (6Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J.E. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). TI-VAMP/VAMP7 Interacts with the Plasma Membrane t-SNAREs Syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23—Previous studies indicated that syntaxins 2-4 and SNAP-23 are ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane t-SNAREs (21Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12227-12229Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SNAP-23, a ubiquitously expressed isoform of SNAP-25, has been detected on the plasma membrane of many cell types (26Wong P.P. Daneman N. Volchuk A. Lassam N. Wilson M.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was initially cloned as a syntaxin 4-interacting protein, although it was also shown to be capable of binding multiple syntaxin isoforms in vitro, as well as VAMP1 and VAMP2 (20Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine whether SNAP-23 and the known plasma membrane syntaxins were expressed in NRK cells, we prepared a purified plasma membrane fraction. Monolayers of NRK cells were surface-biotinylated, and disrupted cells were incubated with avidin-coated beads to specifically pull down the plasma membrane. Western blot with isoform-specific antibodies detected SNAP-23, syntaxin 3, and syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane fraction of NRK cells, whereas TI-VAMP/VAMP7 and syntaxin 2 were absent (Fig. 2A). Thus, syntaxin 3 and 4 and SNAP-23 represented potential t-SNARE partners for TI-VAMP/VAMP7 in lysosomal exocytosis. To determine which t-SNAREs were the best candidates for this role, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in NRK cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2B, a monoclonal antibody specific for TI-VAMP/VAMP7 co-immunoprecipitated syntaxin 4, but not syntaxin 2 or 3 or SNAP-23 from total NRK cell lysates. These findings are consistent with recent experiments in HeLa cells, which detected SNARE complexes containing green fluorescent protein-tagged TI-VAMP/VAMP7 and syntaxin 4 (19Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M. Raposo G. Camonis J. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Daviet L. Formstecher E. Hamburger A. Filippini F. D'Esposito M. Galli T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In pulldown experiments, we found that endogenous syntaxin 2 and syntaxin 4 bound to GST-SNAP-23 but not to GST alone (Fig. 2C). This interaction seemed to be specific for these isoforms, as syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 6 (a Golgi syntaxin (27Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)) did not bind to GST-SNAP-23. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, however, detected a preferential interaction of endogenous SNAP-23 with syntaxin 4 and not syntaxins 2 and 3 (Fig. 2D). Syt VII Interacts with the t-SNAREs Syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23—SNAP-23 has been shown to be involved in several Ca2+-regulated exocytic events, including neutrophil degranulation (28Martin-Martin B. Nabokina S.M. Blasi J. Lazo P.A. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2000; 96: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), secretion of dense core granules in platelets (29Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mast cell degranulation (30Vaidyanathan V.V. Puri N. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25101-25106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and zymogen granule exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells (31Huang X. Sheu L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Pancreas. 2001; 23: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In neuroendocrine cells, SNAP-23 was recently shown to interact with Syt VII C2A-B in a Ca2+-dependent manner (32Chieregatti E. Chicka M.C. Chapman E.R. Baldini G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1918-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C2A domain of Syt VII has the capacity to bind SNAP-25-syntaxin 1a heterodimers with high affinity (33Tucker W.C. Edwardson J.M. Bai J. Kim H.J. Martin T.F. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a property not exhibited by the Syt I C2A domain (33Tucker W.C. Edwardson J.M. Bai J. Kim H.J. Martin T.F. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Rickman C. Archer D.A. Meunier F.A. Craxton M. Fukuda M. Burgoyne R.D. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12574-12579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that the Syt VII C2A domain (previously shown to inhibit lysosomal exocytosis (2Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)) and not the Syt I C2A domain interacts with endogenous SNAP-23 in NRK cells (results not shown) and with GST-SNAP-23 in vitro (Fig. 3, A and B). In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, GST-SNAP-23 specifically associated with His-tagged Syt VII C2A, but not Syt I C2A (Fig. 3A). Most interesting, the interaction of GST-SNAP-23 with His-tagged Syt VII C2A was enhanced in the presence of the H3 domain (the region involved in the formation of SNARE coiled-coil bundles) of syntaxin 4 but not of syntaxins 2, 3, or 6 (Fig. 3B). We next examined the material pulled down from NEM-treated lysates (to inactivate N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and stabilize SNARE complexes (18Galli T. Zahraoui A. Vaidyanathan V.V. Raposo G. Tian J.M. Karin M. Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)) by beads coated with His-tagged C2A domains of Syt VII or of Syt I"

We identified mutations in the gene encoding filamin B in four human skeletal disorders. We found homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with respect to stop-codon mutations in autosomal recessive spondylocarpotarsal syndrome (SCT, OMIM 272460) and missense mutations in individuals with autosomal dominant Larsen syndrome (OMIM 150250) and the perinatal lethal atelosteogenesis I and III phenotypes (AOI, OMIM 108720; AOIII, OMIM 108721). We found that filamin B is expressed in human growth plate chondrocytes and in the developing vertebral bodies in the mouse. These data indicate an unexpected role in vertebral segmentation, joint formation and endochondral ossification for this ubiquitously expressed cytoskeletal protein."
https://openalex.org/W2088848655,"Reactive gliosis is a hallmark of disease-, trauma-, and chemical-induced damage to the central nervous system. The signaling pathways associated with this response to neural injury remain to be elucidated, but recent evidence implicates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Here, we used the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), to selectively damage striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals and elicit a glial response. We then analyzed changes in gene expression and protein phosphorylation, in vivo, to identify ligands and mediators of the JAK-STAT pathway that accompany glial activation. Administration of MPTP caused rapid tyrosine (Tyr-705) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 in striatal astrocytes, prior to the induction of glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA and protein. Pharmacological protection of dopaminergic nerve terminals with nomifensine abolished MPTP-mediated phosphorylation and translocation of STAT3 and prevented induction of astrogliosis. Among the Janus kinase family of tyrosine kinases, only JAK2 was associated with the phosphorylation of STAT3 after MPTP and, inhibition of JAK2 by AG490, in vivo, attenuated both the phosphorylation of STAT3 and induction of GFAP. The p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) also was activated by MPTP, but was not associated with activation of STAT3, because serine (Ser-727) was not phosphorylated. The mRNA for ligands of the gp130-JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M were elevated prior to activation of STAT3 and induction of astrogliosis; neuroprotection with nomifensine blocked these effects of MPTP. Taken together, our results suggest that the gp130-mediated activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may play a key role in the induction of astrogliosis.

The mechanisms underlying injury-induced conversion of astrocytes into their reactive form remain to be elucidated. The generalized nature of the astroglial response to central nervous system injuries, however, suggests that there are common signaling events responsible for its initiation, despite the region- and cell type-specific targets of individual insults or disease states. Although a variety of signal transduction pathways have been shown to be involved in the “activation” of astrocytes, in vitro (6Guillemin G. Boussin F.D. Le Grand R. Croitoru J. Coffigny H. Dorman D. Glia. 1996; 16: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Rajan P. McKay R.D.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3620-3629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bajetto A. Barbero S. Bonavia R. Piccioli P.

Glia. 2002; 37: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), very few signaling modules have been linked to induction of reactive gliosis, in vivo. The limited evidence obtained to date with traumatic and ischemic models of brain damage points to an involvement of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways in astroglial responses to injury. These include JNK, ERK, and JAK/STAT pathways as downstream effectors potentially relevant to reactive gliosis. Unfortunately, trauma and ischemia activates these pathways in neurons as well as astrocytes (10Justica C. Gabriel C. Planas A.M. Glia. 2000; 30: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Choi J.S. Kim S.Y. Cha J.H. Choi Y.S. Sung K.W. Oh S.T. Kim O.N. Chung J.W. Chun M.H. Lee S.B. Lee M.Y. Glia. 2003; 41: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is not surprising because these injury models damage a number of different cell types, including astroglia as well as neurons (12Acarin L. Gonzalez B. Castellano B. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki S. Tanaka K. Nogawa S. Dembo T. Kosakai A. Fukuuchi Y. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 170: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 14Xia X.G. Hofmann H.-D. Deller T. Kirsch M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 21: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); therefore, induction and maintenance of astrogliosis may be influenced by a variety of factors emanating from multiple neural cell types. Moreover, non-neural, blood-borne cell types also may be involved in neuronal and glial responses to injury in these models because of their entry via a breached blood-brain barrier. In aggregate, findings from these limited numbers of in vivo studies suggest that discovery of signaling mechanisms that lead to astrogliosis would best be achieved through the use of injury models that target a single cell type without disrupting the blood-brain barrier. Ideally, the affected cell type also should be well characterized in terms of its morphology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. The known dopaminergic neurotoxicant, MPTP, serves as one such injury tool that meets these criteria. MPTP-induced damage is predominantly localized to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway (15Davis G.C. Williams A.C. Markey S.P. Ebert M.H. Caine E.D. Reichert C.M. Kopin I.J. Psychiatr. Res. 1979; 1: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 16Burns R.S. Chiueh C.C. Markey S.P. Ebert M.H. Jacobowitz D.M. Kopin I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1985; 317: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); therefore, damage “signals” leading to gliosis emanate from a single neuronal cell type. Because MPTP can be administered systemically, it does not compromise the blood-brain barrier (19O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Brain Res. 1990; 521: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); therefore, blood-borne factors are unlikely to contribute to signaling events associated with gliosis (19O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Brain Res. 1990; 521: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Miletich R.S. Bankiewicz K.S. Quarantelli M. Plunkett R.J. Frank J. Kopin I.J. DiChiro G. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antagonists of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity have been used to demonstrate that blocking neurotoxicity (21Mayer R.A. Kindt M.V. Heikkila R.E. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Sundstrom E. Goldstein M. Jonsson G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 131: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) completely blocks the induction of astrogliosis (19O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Brain Res. 1990; 521: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Stromberg I. Bjorklund H. Dahl D. Jonsson G. Sundstrom E. Olson L. Brain Res. Bull. 1986; 17: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, these drugs can be used to block signaling elements derived from the damaged targets to relate any observed changes to nerve terminal damaging effects, as opposed to potential pharmacological effects of MPTP. Finally, the onset and offset of MPTP-induced gliosis is rapid and this effect can be quantified by immunoassay of GFAP (19O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Brain Res. 1990; 521: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), making it possible to establish the time course of signaling events that precede or follow induction of gliosis in this model. By taking advantage of these properties of the MPTP injury model, and by using focused microwave irradiation sacrifice to preserve and quantify in vivo steady-state protein phosphorylation, we have found that astrogliosis is associated with the rapid but transient activation (phosphorylation) of the STAT3 pathway. STAT3 activation in astrocytes requires phosphorylation on Tyr-705 but does not require ERK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 nor participation of JAK1. Instead, it appears to involve gp130 and JAK2 responses that likely are initiated by multiple upstream effectors in this pathway. Chemicals and Reagents—MPTP-HCl was obtained from Aldrich.

For analysis of dopamine and specific proteins including phosphoproteins, the animals were sacrificed by focused microwave irradiation (power level of 4 kilowatts for 0.9 s) to preserve steady-state phosphorylation (24O'Callaghan J.P. Sriram K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 135: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), using a microwave applicator (Muromachi Kikai, Inc, Tokyo, Japan; model TMW-4012C, 10 kilowatts). The striatum and, in some cases, substantia nigra, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex, and cerebellum were rapidly dissected. For histopathological assessment, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde; the brains were removed and post-fixed overnight. Following cryoprotection in a graded sucrose series, horizontal sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica CM 3000) at a thickness of 35 μm. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Real-time PCR Amplification— Total RNA from striatum was isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and phase-lock heavy gel (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The RNA was further cleaned up using RNeasy mini-spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript™ II RNase H- and oligo(dT)12–18 primers (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction. The cDNA (1 μl) was then amplified for 40 PCR cycles using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and template-specific primers (400 nm) in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences for ciliary neurotrophic factor (Cntf), leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), Gfap, glycoprotein 130 (gp130; IL-6 receptor β), oncostatin M (Osm), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs-3), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) are as follows: Cntf (U05342; 263 bp), 5′-TGG CTA GCA AGG AAG ATT CG-3′ (FP) and 5′-ATT GCC TGA TGG AAG TCA CC-3′ (RP); Lif (X12810, 300 bp), 5′-ATG GCA GCG CCA ATG CTC GC-3′ (FP) and 5′-ACA GAC GGC AAA GCA CAT TGC-3′ (RP); Gfap (K01347; 272 bp), 5′-CGA AGC TAA CGA CTA TCG CC-3′ (FP) and 5′-TCA CAT CAC CAC GTC CTT GT-3′ (RP); gp130 (M83336; 186 bp), 5′-ATT TGT GTG CTG AAG GAG GC-3′ (FP) and 5′-AAA GGA CAG GAT GTT GCA GG-3′ (RP); Osm (D31942; 267 bp), 5′-AAC ACT GCT CAG TTT GAC CC-3′ (FP) and 5′-ACA GTG CTC AGG AAG TGA GG-3′ (RP); Socs-3 (U88328; 302 bp), 5′-AGA CCT TCA GCT CCA AAA GC-3′ (FP) and 5′-ACC AGC TTG AGT ACA CAG TCG-3′ (RP); Stat3 (U06922; 340 bp), 5-CAG AAA GTG TCC TAC AAG GGC G-3′ (FP) and 5′-CGT TGT TAG ACT CCT CCA TGT TC-3′ (RP). Primer sets for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (122 bp; catalog no. GMO0104) and IL-6 (104 bp; catalog no. GMC0064) were purchased from BIOSOURCE International, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Representative samples (in duplicate) from saline- and 12-h MPTP-treated groups were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the specificity and size of the PCR-amplified product. Sequence detection software (version 1.7; Applied Biosystems) results were exported as tab-delimited text files and imported into Microsoft Excel for further analysis. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold (CT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin 2). Changes in mRNA expression level were calculated following normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The ratios obtained following normalization are expressed as -fold change over saline-treated controls. Tissue Preparation for Total and Specific Protein Analysis—Tissues for protein analysis were homogenized in 10 volumes of hot (85–95 °C) 1% SDS and stored at -75 °C until use. Total protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid method (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. GFAP and TH ELISAs—GFAP was assayed in accordance with a previously described procedure (26O'Callaghan J.P. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1991; 13: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27O'Callaghan J.P. Costa L.G. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2002: 12.81.1-12.8.12Google Scholar). In brief, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GFAP was coated on the wells of Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA). The SDS homogenates and standards were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 solution (PBS-T). After blocking nonspecific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, aliquots of the homogenate and standards were added to the wells and incubated. Following washes, a mouse monoclonal antibody to GFAP was added to “sandwich” the GFAP between the two antibodies. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody directed against mouse IgG was then added, and a colored reaction product was obtained by subsequent addition of the enzyme substrate, p-nitrophenol. Quantification was achieved by spectrophotometry of the colored reaction product at 405 nm in a microplate reader, Spectra Max Plus, and analyzed with Soft Max Pro Plus software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of GFAP in the samples was calculated as micrograms of GFAP/mg of total protein and is expressed as percentage of saline-treated control to normalize regional variations in the levels of GFAP. TH holoenzyme protein was assessed by a fluorescence-based ELISA developed in the laboratory. 2J. P. O'Callaghan, unpublished data. The protocol was essentially the same as for the GFAP ELISA except that a mouse monoclonal antibody to TH was used as the plate capture antibody and a rabbit polyclonal antibody was used to “sandwich” TH protein. The amount of sandwich antibody bound to TH was then detected using a peroxidase-labeled antibody directed against rabbit IgG. Peroxidase activity was detected using the fluorogenic substrate Quantablu (Pierce) that has excitation/emission maxima of 325/420 nm (read at 320/405 nm). The amount of TH in the samples was calculated and expressed as micrograms of TH/mg of total protein. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Determination of Dopamine and Its Metabolites—Dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection (Waters, Milford, MA). Tissues were homogenized in 300 μl of ice-cold 0.2 m perchloric acid, containing 1 μm dihydroxybenzylamine as internal standard, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane, and an aliquot (10 μl) was injected from a temperature-controlled (4 °C) automatic sample injector (Waters 717plus Autosampler) connected to a Waters 515 HPLC pump. Catecholamines were separated on a C18 reverse phase column (LC-18 RP; Waters Symmetry, 25 cm × 4.6 mm; 5 μm), electrochemically detected (Waters 464 Pulsed Electrochemical Detector; range, 10 nA; potential, +0.7 V) and analyzed using Millennium32 Software. The mobile phase (pH 3.0) for isocratic separation of dopamine consisted of dibasic sodium phosphate (75 mm), octane sulfonic acid (1.7 mm), acetonitrile (10%, v/v), and EDTA (25 μm). Flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min. Dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid standards (0.5–25 pmol) were prepared in 0.2 m perchloric acid containing dihydroxybenzylamine. Recovery of each analyte was adjusted with the internal standard and quantified from a standard curve. The levels of dopamine and its metabolites are expressed as micrograms/g of wet tissue. Immunoblot Analysis—Changes in protein expression of GFAP and protein phosphorylation changes of JAKs, p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), and STAT3 were analyzed by immunoblots. A linear range for the protein load in the immunoblot analysis of these proteins has previously been established in our laboratory (28O'Callaghan J.P. Imai H. Miller D.B. Minter A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Aliquots of brain homogenates (1–3 μg for TH, GFAP, and ERK1/2; 20 μg for all other proteins) were diluted in sample buffer, boiled, and loaded on either 7.5% or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins then were electrophoretically resolved and transferred to 0.1-μm nitrocellulose membranes (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Following transfer, immunoblot analysis was performed. All steps were carried out at room temperature except where specified. Briefly, membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk prepared in PBS-T, washed (1 × 15 min; 2 × 5 min) with PBS-T and incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal; 1:500) to GFAP, STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, TYK2, and ERK1/2 for 2 h. Primary antibody incubations (rabbit polyclonal; 1:500) for phospho-STAT3, phospho-JAK1, phospho-JAK2, phospho-TYK2, and phospho-ERK1/2 were performed at 4 °C overnight. Following incubation with primary antibodies, blots were washed with PBS-T (1 × 15 min; 2 × 5 min) and subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2500) for 1 h. Membranes were washed (1 × 15 min; 4 × 5 min) in PBS-T and the signals detected using an ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences) were captured on to an x-ray film (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT), typically by exposure for 10 s to 1 h depending on the signal intensity. Histology—For immunohistochemical analysis of STAT3, GFAP, and TH, sequential sections from each treatment group (saline, MPTP, nomifensine, or nomifensine + MPTP) were stained free-floating using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in hydrogen peroxide, and sections were permeabilized in a solution containing lysine, Triton X-100, and normal horse serum. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C in primary antibody (STAT3, 1:1000; GFAP, 1:10,000; TH, 1:1000), sections were rinsed in Dulbecco's PBS and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (for STAT3, 1:1000; for GFAP, 1:10,000; for TH: 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. Following rinses, sections were incubated with ABC reagent for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed, reacted with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, rinsed, and mounted onto Colorfrost+ slides (Fisher Scientific). Sections were dehydrated through a standard ethanol series, and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific). Double immunohistochemistry was performed as two sequential staining procedures, with nickel chloride enhancement of the initial STAT3 immunoreactive product to yield a blue color. The sections were visualized under a photomicroscope and digital (.tif) images were captured and documented. Statistical Analysis—All analyses were performed using SigmaStat (version 2.03) statistical software. The test of significance was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. Values were considered statistically significant at 5% level of significance (p < 0.05). Graphical representations are mean ± S.E. Striatal Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity Caused by MPTP Results in the Rapid Induction of Astrogliosis—The single, low-dose MPTP regimen employed in this study caused a rapid time-dependent decrease of striatal DA and TH (Fig. 1), findings consistent with a loss of dopaminergic nerve terminals known to be caused by this agent. A significant decrease of DA (33%) was detected within 6 h of dosing, and a decrease in TH holoenzyme protein (34%) was observed within 12 h of dosing (Fig. 1, A and B). DA and TH levels declined by 61 and 76%, respectively, by 48 h after dosing with MPTP (Fig. 1, A and B); no further decrements in these measures were observed (data not shown). Chemically induced damage to the central nervous system, including damage caused by MPTP (19O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Brain Res. 1990; 521: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Stromberg I. Bjorklund H. Dahl D. Jonsson G. Sundstrom E. Olson L. Brain Res. Bull. 1986; 17: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) causes reactive gliosis at the site of damage, the hallmark of which is an increase in GFAP. With our dosing regimen, MPTP caused a rapid induction of striatal GFAP mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D). A 12.5-fold up-regulation of GFAP mRNA, monitored by real-time PCR, was observed within 12 h of MPTP treatment and, by 24 h, GFAP mRNA levels increased by nearly 27-fold (Fig. 1C). Striatal GFAP protein levels increased significantly (76%) by 24 h after MPTP and reached levels of 265% of control by 72 h after dosing (Fig. 1D). Levels of GFAP mRNA and protein began to decline 72 or 96 h after MPTP, respectively (data not shown). The increase in GFAP was restricted to the damaged region of the brain, the striatum (Fig. 1E), a finding characteristic of the site-selective nature of chemically induced neurotoxicity where the blood-brain barrier is not compromised. The dosing regimen of MPTP used in this study did not disrupt the blood-brain barrier (Ref. 19O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Brain Res. 1990; 521: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; re-confirmed experimentally). Together, these findings establish a time course, limited to less than 12 h, for transduction of cell signals that initiate astrogliosis in response to MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Phosphorylation of STAT3 Precedes the Onset of MPTP-induced Astrogliosis in the Striatum—Among the potential signaling modules involved in MPTP-induced astrogliosis, the JAK/STAT3 pathway appeared to be a likely candidate because it is linked to enhanced expression of GFAP, in vitro, in a model of gliogenesis (31Bonni A. Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Bhatt A. Frank D.A. Rozovsky I. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 278: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed changes in the expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 following MPTP. We note here that analysis of protein phosphorylation, in vivo, required sacrifice of the animals by focused-microwave irradiation (see “Experimental Procedures”) to preserve steady-state levels of phosphorylation (24O'Callaghan J.P. Sriram K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 135: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rapid freezing of the tissue in liquid nitrogen failed to preserve the phosphorylation state of the proteins (24O'Callaghan J.P. Sriram K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 135: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Representative immunoblot data for GFAP, pSTAT3 (Tyr-705 and Ser-727), STAT3, and immunoprecipitated STAT3 are shown in Fig. 2A. MPTP caused a rapid, large, and time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the striatum that preceded the induction of GFAP. Phosphospecific antibodies to STAT3 ("
https://openalex.org/W2117724384,"We evaluated the contribution of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the events upstream/downstream of p38 leading to dopaminergic neuronal death. We utilized MN9D cells and primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons treated with 6-hydroxydopamine. Phosphorylation of p38 preceded apoptosis and was sustained in 6-hydroxydopamine-treated MN9D cells. Co-treatment with PD169316 (an inhibitor of p38) or expression of a dominant negative p38 was neuroprotective in death induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. The superoxide dismutase mimetic and the nitric oxide chelator blocked 6-hydroxydopamine-induced phosphorylation of p38, suggesting a role for superoxide anion and nitric oxide in eliciting a neurotoxic signal by activating p38. Following 6-hydroxydopamine treatment, inhibition of p38 prevented both caspase-8- and -9-mediated apoptotic pathways as well as generation of truncated Bid. Consequently, 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell death was rescued by blockading activation of caspase-8 and -9. In primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons, the phosphorylation of p38 similarly appeared in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive, dopaminergic neurons after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment. This neurotoxin-induced phosphorylation of p38 was inhibited in the presence of superoxide dismutase mimetic or nitric oxide chelator. Co-treatment with PD169316 deterred 6-hydroxydopamine-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and activation of caspase-3 in these neurons. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-8 and -9 significantly rescued 6-hydroxydopamine-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons. Taken together, our data suggest that superoxide anion and nitric oxide induced by 6-hydroxydopamine initiate the p38 signal pathway leading to activation of both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial apoptotic pathways in our culture models of Parkinson's disease.

Although its precise etiology is unknown, such factors as oxidative stress, impairment of mitochondrial respiration, and abnormal protein aggregation may play roles in its pathogenesis (1Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar, 2Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: S26-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Although the role of apoptosis in the process of dopaminergic neuronal death has been highlighted in studies using postmortem brains and experimental models of PD, other evidence implicates both apoptosis and non-apoptotic death in PD (3Hartmann A. Hirsch E.C. Adv. Neurol. 2001; 86: 143-153PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless, it is not clearly understood which signals may be involved in determining the mode of dopaminergic neuronal death. Among the upstream signals leading to neuronal degeneration, one may include the stress-activated protein kinases. These are c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 kinases, which are activated in response to various stimuli and are potent effectors of neuronal apoptosis (4Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Most interesting, the phosphorylated forms of JNK and p38 are expressed in postmortem brains of PD (5Ferrer I. Blanco R. Carmona M. Puig B. Barrachina M. Gomez C. Ambrosio S. J. Neural. Transm. 2001; 108: 1383-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence from experimental models of PD has implicated JNK in the process of dopaminergic neuronal death. For example, activation of JNK has been demonstrated in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Blockade of JNK by JNK-interacting protein-1 or by a synthetic inhibitor of the mixed lineage kinase family is neuroprotective (6Saporito M.S. Brown E.M. Miller M.S. Carswell S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 421-427PubMed Google Scholar, 7Saporito M.S. Thomas B.A. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Xia X.G. Harding T. Weller M.

Early JNK activation is found in various culture models following 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treatment (9Cassarino D.S. Halvorsen E.M. Swerdlow R.H. Abramova N.N. Parker Jr., W.D.

Although its role is less defined, p38 activation has been investigated following treatment with dopamine, MPTP, or MPP+ (14De Girolamo L.A. Hargreaves A.J. Billett E.E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Du Y. Ma Z. Lin S. Dodel R.C. Gao F. Bales K.R. Triarhou L.C. Chernet E. Perry K.W. Nelson D.L. Luecke S. Phebus L.A.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As typified in the MPTP mouse model and in MPP+-treated culture models, protection of neuronal degeneration by minocycline is mediated by inhibiting drug-induced glial inducible NOS expression and nitric oxide (NO)-induced phosphorylation of p38 (15Du Y. Ma Z. Lin S. Dodel R.C. Gao F. Bales K.R. Triarhou L.C. Chernet E. Perry K.W. Nelson D.L. Luecke S. Phebus L.A. Bymaster F.P. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14669-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). However, a role for the p38 signal in dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is controversial (17Gomez-Santos C. Ferrer I. Reiriz J. Vinals F. Barrachina M. Ambrosio S. Brain Res. 2002; 935: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Halvorsen E.M. Dennis J. Keeney P. Sturgill T.W. Tuttle J.B. Benett Jr., J.B.

Furthermore, cellular events upstream and downstream of p38 activation leading to dopaminergic neuronal death are not yet understood. Here, we attempted to evaluate the following: (i) to what extent p38 contributes to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced death; (ii) whether p38 is linked to activation of the mitochondrial and extramitochondrial apoptotic pathways; and (iii) the temporal sequence of cell death with regard to oxidative stress, and the activation of p38 and caspases using MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells and primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons. Our data show that superoxide anion and NO induced by 6-OHDA activate p38 that, in turn, activates both the caspase-8 and -9-dependent apoptotic pathways in culture models of PD. Materials—t-Butoxycarbonyl-(Asp)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF), Z-LEHD-fmk, and Z-IETD-fmk were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Fluorogenic caspase substrates Ac-DEVDAMC and Ac-LEHD-AFC were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. The colorimetric assay kit for caspase-8-like activity using IETD-pNA was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The reactive oxygen species-selective indicators used included dihydroethidium (a superoxide anion indicator; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM diacetate; a nitric oxide indicator; Molecular Probes). Fetal bovine serum, minimum Eagle's medium, and laminin were from Invitrogen. Inhibitor of p38 (PD169316) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (Mn-TBAP; a superoxide dismutase mimetic) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO; a nitric oxide scavenger) was from Molecular Probes. Culture dishes and plates were from Corning Glass. All other reagents including 6-OHDA and N-acetyl-l-cysteine were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture, Drug Treatment, and Survival/Death Assay—MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells were established by a somatic fusion between embryonic mesencephalic neurons and N18TG cells (20Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). MN9D cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3) containing FLAG epitope-tagged dominant negative p38 (MN9D/p38DN, T180A, and Y182F; see Ref. 21Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar) and selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G-418 as described previously (22Choi W.S. Lee E.H. Chung C.W. Jung Y.K. Jin B.K. Kim S.U. Oh T.H. Saido T.C. Oh Y.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1531-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both MN9D and MN9D/p38DN cells plated on 25 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated culture dishes or plates were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 for 2-3 days, and switched to N-2 serum-free defined medium containing 100 μm 6-OHDA in the presence or the absence of various experimental reagents. Following drug treatment, the rate of cell survival was measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay as described previously (22Choi W.S. Lee E.H. Chung C.W. Jung Y.K. Jin B.K. Kim S.U. Oh T.H. Saido T.C. Oh Y.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1531-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The rate of cell death was quantitatively assessed by the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released by damaged cells into the bathing medium (23Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—MN9D cells, MN9D/p38DN cells, or primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons were treated with 6-OHDA in the presence or the absence of various inhibitors. Following drug treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm sodium vanadate for 15 min, and triturated with a syringe bearing a 26-gauge needle on ice. An equal amount of proteins from each sample was separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto pre-wetted polyvinylidene difluoride nitrocellulose filters, and processed for immunoblot analysis. Primary antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize p38, phosphorylated form of p38, cleaved forms of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (all antibodies above were used at 1:1000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), cleaved form of caspase-8 (1:1000, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and caspase-8-cleaved form of Bid (1:3000, a generous gift from Dr. S. J. Krajewski at the Burnham Institute). For detecting the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, cells were treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA in the presence or the absence of the indicated inhibitors, lysed, and subsequently fractionated as described previously with minor modifications (24Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Primary antibody used was a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (1:3000; Pharmingen). A mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG conjugated with peroxidase (1:1000, Sigma) was used to check the expression level of FLAG epitope-tagged dominant negative form of p38. For loading controls, a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (1:1000; Molecular Probes) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-IκB (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were utilized. Specific bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—MN9D cells and MN9D/p38DN cells were incubated with 100 μm 6-hydroxydopamine alone or in combination with 20 μm PD169316. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm dihydroethidium for 30 min at 37 °C and washed twice with a buffer containing 144 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm d-glucose as described previously (25Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y. Oh T.H. Choi E.J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cells were also incubated with 5 μm DAF-FM diacetate for 40 min at 37 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and further incubated in 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were quantified at Ex530/Em590 nm (excitation/emission wavelength for dihydroethidium) or at Ex485/Em520 nm (for DAF-FM diacetate) using a FL 600 plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Caspase Substrate Assays—Caspase activity was measured by either a fluorogenic or colorimetric substrate assay. Briefly, following treatment with 100 μm 6-OHDA in the presence or the absence of 20 μm PD169316, MN9D cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100. Cellular lysates (10 μg) were incubated with 25 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC for caspase-3-like activity, 25 μm Ac-LEHD-AFC for caspase-9-like activity, or 100 μm IETD-pNA for caspase-8-like activity for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS for caspase-3- or -9-like activity assay, or the reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer for caspase-8-like activity assay. Activity was measured at Ex360/Em460 nm for Ac-DEVD-AMC and Ex360/Em520 nm for Ac-LEHD-AFC or with a wavelength at 405 nm for IETD-pNA using a FL 600 plate reader. Primary Cultures of Mesencephalic Neurons and Counting of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)-positive Neurons—For primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons, ventral mesencephalic areas were removed from the brains of embryonic day 14 fetal Sprague-Dawley rats (Daehan Biolink, Daejeon, Korea). Dissociated cells were then plated and maintained as described previously in our laboratory (26Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 5 or 6 days in vitro, cultures were washed with minimum Eagle's medium, switched to N-2 serum-free defined medium, and treated with 20 μm 6-OHDA alone or in combination with various experimental reagents. To determine the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons following drug treatment, primary cultures were subjected to immunocytochemical localization of TH as described previously (26Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Manual counts by an individual blind to the treatment conditions were made of all the TH-positive neurons having neurites longer than twice the length of the soma. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemical localization of the phosphorylated form of p38, MN9D cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphorylated form of p38 antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. For a double immunocytochemical localization of TH and phosphorylated form of p38 or cleaved caspase-3, primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons treated with 20 μm 6-OHDA alone or in combination with 5.0 μm PD169316 were processed as described (26Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were a mouse monoclonal anti-TH (1:7500; Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR), a rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphorylated form of p38 antibody (1:500), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes cleaved caspase-3 (1:200). Following three washes with TBST, cultures were further incubated with Alexa fluor® 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Stained cells were visualized under an Axiovert 100 Microscope equipped with epifluorescence and a digital image analyzer (Carl Zeiss, Zena, Germany). Manual counts by an individual blind to the treatment conditions were made of all the phosphorylated forms of p38- or cleaved caspase-3-positive neurons among TH-positive neurons. Statistics—Data were means ± S.E. from the indicated number of experiments. Significance of difference between 6-OHDA treated groups and groups co-treated with various reagents was determined by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were taken as being statistically significant. Inhibition of p38 Is Neuroprotective Following 6-OHDA Treatment—We demonstrated previously (25Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y. Oh T.H. Choi E.J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J.

Noh J.S. Gwag B.J. Oh Y.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 341: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that 6-OHDA induces changes typical of apoptosis. Typically, ∼70% of MN9D cells were found to be dying following treatment with 100 μm 6-OHDA for 24 h. As such, this dose of neurotoxin was selected to determine whether and to what extent p38 contributed to neurotoxin-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 1A, phosphorylation of p38 (phospho-p38) in MN9D cells was detectable as early as 30 min following 6-OHDA treatment and continued to increase in a time-dependent manner. Ten to twelve hours after 6-OHDA treatment, levels of phospho-p38 started to decrease. The levels of p38 remained largely the same (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, immunocytochemistry also indicated that MN9D cells were positive for phospho-p38 following 6-OHDA treatment. Among the concentration ranges of PD169316 (an inhibitor of p38; 1.0-80 μm), we found the maximum dose of p38 inhibitor that blocked 6-OHDA-induced generation of phospho-p38 without causing cytotoxicity, 20 μm PD169316. The appearance of 6-OHDA-induced phospho-p38 was significantly blocked in the presence of 20 μm PD169316 or in MN9D cells expressing a dominant negative p38 (MN9D/p38DN; Fig. 1, B and C). Co-treatment with 20 μm PD169316 or expression of a dominant negative p38 significantly blocked 6-OHDA-induced cell death as determined by MTT reduction assay and LDH assay (Fig. 1, D and E). Activation of p38 Is Downstream of the Oxidative Burst and Upstream of Caspase Activation Following 6-OHDA Treatment—We and others (25Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y. Oh T.H. Choi E.J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously raised the possibility that generation of ROS at an early phase and subsequent ROS-mediated signal pathways play an essential role in 6-OHDA-induced cell death in MN9D cells and primary cultures of cortical and mesencephalic neurons. We hypothesized therefore that ROS induced by 6-OHDA contributes to the appearance of phospho-p38 in MN9D cells. First, we measured levels of ROS by using cell-permeable dihydroethidium (a superoxide anion indicator; see Ref. 30Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and DAF-FM diacetate (an NO indicator; see Ref. 31Itoh Y. Ma F.H. Hoshi H. Oka M. Noda K. Ukai Y. Kojima H. Nagano T. Toda N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) following 6-OHDA treatment in the presence or the absence of 20 μm PD169316 or in MN9D/p38DN cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, generations of superoxide anion and NO were induced regardless of treatments. Quantitative studies demonstrated that co-treatment with 20 μm PD169316 or expression of a dominant negative p38 did not affect the kinetics of superoxide anion and NO generation following 6-OHDA treatment for up to 18 h (Fig. 2B). We then tested whether co-treatment with antioxidants inhibits the 6-OHDA-induced appearance of phospho-p38. As determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C), appearance of phospho-p38 following 6-OHDA treatment was largely inhibited in the presence of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (1.0 mm), a superoxide dismutase mimetic (Mn-TBAP; 25 μm) or by an NO scavenger (carboxy-PTIO; 100 μm), indicating that ROS comprises one of the essential triggers of the p38 signal. Since caspase activation is involved in 6-OHDA-induced MN9D cell death, we next attempted to establish the temporal cell death sequences in relation to p38 and caspases. As shown in Fig. 2D, co-treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor, BAF (100-300 μm) did not inhibit the 6-OHDA-induced appearance of phospho-p38. Similarly, co-treatment with another pantothenate-caspase inhibitor (ZVAD-fmk; 100-300 μm) was without effect (not shown). Phospho-p38 Is Linked to Both Caspase-8 and -9-mediated Apoptotic Pathways Following 6-OHDA Treatment—It has been demonstrated that both caspase-8 and -9 are among the keys initiating caspase cascades that eventually lead to activation of an execution phase of caspases including -3, -6, and -7 (32Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6258) Google Scholar). Once we established the appearance of phospho-p38 as upstream of caspase activation following 6-OHDA treatment, we then attempted to examine whether 6-OHDA-induced phospho-p38 may be linked to the activation of the caspase-8 and -9-mediated apoptotic pathways. First, caspase substrate assays were carried out in MN9D cells treated with 6-OHDA for various times using Ac-DEVD-AMC (for caspase-3-like activity; caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -10), Ac-LEHD-AFC (for caspase-9-like-activity), or IETD-pNA (caspase-8-like activity) in the presence or the absence of 20 μm PD169316. As shown in Fig. 3A, following 6-OHDA treatment, caspase-3-, -8-, and -9-like activities were elevated over the untreated control in a time-dependent manner up to 12 h. Co-treatment with 20 μm PD169316 significantly blocked 6-OHDA-induced activation of these caspases. To more specifically determine how p38 signal affects the activation profiles of caspases following 6-OHDA treatment, cellular lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies recognizing the cleaved forms of caspases. As shown in Fig. 3B, slight but detectable levels of the cleaved form of caspase-8 appeared as early as 6 h following 6-OHDA treatment and continued to increase thereafter. Although very slight levels of the cleaved forms of caspase-9 first appeared as early as 8 h following 6-OHDA treatment, a marked increase in the cleaved forms of caspase-9 occurred by 10-12 h. In addition, immunoblot analysis indicated that the appearance of cleaved forms of caspase-3 and -7 were first detected at 6 h following 6-OHDA treatment. Inhibition of p38 signal by 20 μm PD169316 or by expression of a dominant negative p38 largely diminished 6-OHDA-induced generation of cleaved forms of caspases with a slightly different efficacy (Fig. 3, B and C). Mitochondrial Apoptotic Signal Can Be Activated by Caspase-8-cleaved tBid-dependent and -independent Routes Following 6-OHDA Treatment—In response to extracellular cues and internal insults, mitochondria release various apoptogenic molecules including cytochrome c into the cytosol and trigger the activation of the caspase-9-mediated, mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. In addition, caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid (tBid) promotes mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and eventually leads to the activation of caspase-9 (32Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6258) Google Scholar). MN9D cells were treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA in the presence or the absence of 20 μm PD169316. The appearance of tBid was first detected by 6 h following 6-OHDA treatment and continued to increase thereafter (Fig. 4A). Co-treatment with PD169316 inhibited 6-OHDA-induced generation of tBid. Appearance of tBid was also inhibited in the presence of 100 μm Z-IETD-fmk (a caspase-8 inhibitor) but not by 100 μm Z-LEHD-fmk (a caspase-9 inhibitor; Fig. 4B); this indicates that p38-mediated activation of caspase-8 leads to generation of tBid following 6-OHDA treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, 6-OHDA-induced release of cytochrome c into the cytosol was largely inhibited by 20 μm PD169316 but not by 100 μm Z-IETD-fmk. Although it remains to be directly confirmed, this suggests that following 6-OHDA treatment, the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol may be induced by caspase-8-cleaved tBid-dependent and -independent routes.

https://openalex.org/W1997399224,"The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) regulates proliferation, cell fate specification and differentiation in the developing central nervous system (CNS), but the role of Rb in the developing mouse retina has not been studied, because Rb-deficient embryos die before the retinas are fully formed. We combined several genetic approaches to explore the role of Rb in the mouse retina. During postnatal development, Rb is expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells and differentiating rod photoreceptors. In the absence of Rb, progenitor cells continue to divide, and rods do not mature. To determine whether Rb functions in these processes in a cell-autonomous manner, we used a replication-incompetent retrovirus encoding Cre recombinase to inactivate the Rb1(lox) allele in individual retinal progenitor cells in vivo. Combined with data from studies of conditional inactivation of Rb1 using a combination of Cre transgenic mouse lines, these results show that Rb is required in a cell-autonomous manner for appropriate exit from the cell cycle of retinal progenitor cells and for rod development."
https://openalex.org/W1998119007,"The current concept regarding cell cycle regulation of DNA replication is that Cdt1, together with origin recognition complex and CDC6 proteins, constitutes the machinery that loads the minichromosome maintenance complex, a candidate replicative helicase, onto chromatin during the G1 phase. The actions of origin recognition complex and CDC6 are suppressed through phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) after S phase to prohibit rereplication. It has been suggested in metazoan cells that the function of Cdt1 is blocked through binding to an inhibitor protein, geminin. However, the functional relationship between the Cdt1-geminin system and Cdks remains to be clarified. In this report, we demonstrate that human Cdt1 is phosphorylated by cyclin A-dependent kinases dependent on its cyclin-binding motif. Cdk phosphorylation resulted in the binding of Cdt1 to the F-box protein Skp2 and subsequent degradation. In contrast, in vitro DNA binding activity of Cdt1 was inhibited by the phosphorylation. However, geminin binding to Cdt1 was not affected by the phosphorylation. Finally we provide evidence that inactivation of Cdk1 results in Cdt1 dephosphorylation and rebinding to chromatin in murine FT210 cells synchronized around the G2/M phase. Taken together, these findings suggest that Cdt1 function is also negatively regulated by the Cdk phosphorylation independent of geminin binding.

Recent progress has uncovered molecular mechanisms by which DNA replication is cell cycle-controlled in eukaryotic cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

The current concept is that a multiprotein complex, termed the prereplication complex (pre-RC), 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, prereplication complex; ORC, origin recognition complex; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; SCF, Skp1-Cdc53-F-box protein complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; MCM, minichromosome maintenance. is constructed during the G1 phase based on origin recognition complex (ORC) binding to chromosomal DNA. CDC6 and Cdt1 proteins are recruited to the chromatin by interaction with ORC, and the resultant machinery may function as a loader for the MCM heterohexameric complex, which could function as a replicative helicase (3Ishimi Y.

The mechanism seems basically conserved from yeast to metazoan cells, although it is more complicated in the latter (2Fujita M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D816-D823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) become active at the onset of S phase, pre-RC initiates replication accompanied by further assembly of multiple other proteins or protein complexes (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Cdks physically interact with and phosphorylate ORC and CDC6 (5Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J.

Prior to the DNA unwinding step, CDC45 is loaded onto chromatin, probably via physical interaction with the MCM complex (13Zou L. Stillman B.

Once CDC45 is loaded, the DNA is unwound with the help of replication protein A (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). To prevent rereplication, that is the reestablishment of pre-RC, rebinding of MCM needs to be suppressed during the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle. Recent studies have suggested that Cdks also play a central role in this context. Thus, Cdk activity has a bipartite function in the regulation of DNA replication. The importance of Cdk1 kinase in mammals is clearly demonstrated by the fact that its inactivation results in rebinding of MCM proteins and subsequent rereplication (16Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S.

Ablation of cyclin A, but not cyclin B, leads to rereplication in Drosophila tissue culture cells (18Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cdks prevent reestablishment of pre-RC through multiple redundant mechanisms (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

One mechanism is by phosphorylation of CDC6, leading to degradation in yeast or nuclear export in mammalian cells (5Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In human cells, ORC1 is degraded after S phase, presumably depending on phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk2 (10Méndez J.

It has also been shown that the MCM complex is phosphorylated by Cdks (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 2Fujita M. Front.

In budding yeast, it is necessary to block all three pathways for induction of rereplication without inhibiting Cdk activity (9Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Also in mammalian cells, alteration of the regulation of the individual components alone, for example overexpression of the phosphorylation-deficient CDC6 mutant, fails to induce rereplication (6Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sørensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), preventing the loading of MCM proteins by binding to and inhibiting Cdt1 (22Maiorano D. Moreau J.

Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Contrary to the cyclin A case, reduction in the levels of geminin in Drosophila tissue culture cells results in partial, but not complete, rereplication (18Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdt1 actions might be negatively regulated by both geminin and Cdks. Alternatively interaction between Cdt1 and geminin could be under the control of Cdks. In certain cell types, Cdt1 is degraded on entry into the S phase (26Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which could be directed by Cdk phosphorylation. However, the functional relationship between the Cdt1-geminin system and Cdks remains to be clarified. In this report, we demonstrate that Cdt1 is phosphorylated by cyclin A-dependent kinases (cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin A-Cdk2) dependent on its cyclin-binding motif. Cdk phosphorylation resulted in Cdt1 binding to the F-box protein Skp2 (27Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), a component of the Skp1-Cdc53-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, and subsequent degradation. In contrast, in vitro DNA binding activity of Cdt1 was reduced by the phosphorylation. However, geminin binding to Cdt1 was not affected by the phosphorylation. Finally we show that Cdk1 inactivation results in Cdt1 dephosphorylation and rebinding to chromatin in murine FT210 cells. These findings suggest that Cdt1 function is negatively regulated by Cdk phosphorylation independent of geminin binding. Construction of Expression Vectors for Human Cdt1 and Geminin and Murine Skp2—Cloning of human Cdt1 and geminin cDNAs and construction of mammalian expression vectors (based on pcDEBΔ or pcDEBΔ-T7) were described previously (26Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To generate a mutant Cdt1 (Cdt1 Cy) in which Arg-68, Arg-69, and Leu-70 were all converted into Ala, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with oligonucleotide CAGGCCACCGGCCCGCGCTGCAGCGCGGCTGTCGGTGGACGAG using Mutan-Super Express Km kit (Takara), and the product of the resultant cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. For bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdt1, the Cdt1 cDNA was introduced into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and for in vitro production of His-geminin with bacterial lysate, the geminin cDNA was inserted into pIVEX2.4b Nde (Roche Applied Science). Plasmid pcDNA3-HA-Skp2 (27Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S.

Nakayama (Kyushu University). Antibodies—Preparation of polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human Cdt1 and MCM7 was as described previously (26Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J.

Other antibodies used were purchased from different companies: Cdt1 (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), T7 tag (Novagen), HA tag (BAbCO), GST (G7781, Sigma), geminin (C-16 and N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin A (BF683, Pharmingen), cyclin B (GNS-1, Pharmingen), Cdk1 (C-4973, Sigma), Cdk2 (558896, Pharmingen), Skp2 (H-435, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27 (K25020, Transduction Laboratories), actin (MAB1501, Chemicon). Preparation of Cyclin-Cdks Using Recombinant Baculoviruses— GST-murine cyclin A and GST-murine cyclin B baculoviruses were provided by Dr. H. Masai (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science), and human Cdk1 and Cdk2 baculoviruses were purchased from Orbigen (San Diego, CA). At 48 h after infection (multiplicity of infection of 2 for GST-cyclins and 5 for Cdks) of 2 × 108 High Five cells with recombinant baculoviruses, extracts were prepared with 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing multiple protease inhibitors (Sigma). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and filtration, and GST-cyclin-Cdk complexes were purified with 1.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then resuspended in thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol) and digested with 20 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min at room temperature to allow the cyclin-Cdks to be eluted. The purity of the cyclin-Cdk complexes was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and immunoblotting. The approximate concentrations of the obtained cyclin-Cdks were estimated to be as follows: 1 ng/μl for cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin B-Cdk1 and 10 ng/μl for cyclin A-Cdk2. Production of Recombinant GST-Cdt1, His-geminin, and HA-Skp2 Proteins—GST-Cdt1 and a GST-Cdt1 Cy mutant were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL-21, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, eluted with 20 mm glutathione in elution buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100), and dialyzed. His-tagged Geminin proteins were synthesized using an in vitro transcription-translation system with bacterial extracts (RTS 500, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, purified on nickel affinity gel (Sigma), eluted with elution buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl) containing 250 mm imidazole, and dialyzed. HA-tagged Skp2 proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Kinase Assays—GST-Cdt1 (0.6 μg) or histone H1 (5 μg) were phosphorylated by the cyclin-Cdk complexes (approximately 5–10 ng) in 25 μl of kinase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.025% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 80 μm ATP, 1 μm calyculin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm glycerophosphate) containing 10μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× sample buffer (1× sample buffer: 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and processed for SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed with bioimaging analyzer BAS 2500 (Fuji Film). In Vitro Binding Assays—For assaying the association of Cdt1 with cyclin-Cdks, a 3-μg aliquot of GST-Cdt1 was incubated with 10–50 ng of cyclin-Cdks in binding buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) containing 1 μm calyculin A, 10 mm glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 60 min. Then the GST fusion proteins were collected on glutathione beads, and the beads were washed three times with binding buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with 25 μl of 1× sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cdt1-geminin interaction was assessed as follows. GST-Cdt1 (0.6 μg) and His-geminin (0.2 μg) were subjected to phosphorylation reaction as described above except that radiolabeled ATP was omitted. The mixtures were diluted with binding buffer A, and binding reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 60 min. Then the GST-Cdt1 and associated His-geminin proteins were analyzed as described above. Cdt1-Skp2 interaction was assessed as follows. GST-Cdt1 (0.6 μg) was subjected to phosphorylation reactions as described above with or without the cyclin-Cdks, mixed with the HA-Skp2 produced by in vitro translation in 50 μl of reaction mixture, diluted with binding buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 10 mm glycerophosphate and 5 mm NaF, and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. Then the GST-Cdt1 and associated Skp2 proteins were collected, washed with binding buffer A, and analyzed. DNA binding activity of Cdt1 was examined as follows. GST-Cdt1 (0.6 μg) was subjected to reaction with or without the cyclin-Cdks as above, diluted with binding buffer B, and incubated with 30 μl of double-stranded DNA cellulose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 90 min. Then the beads were washed three times with binding buffer A, and the associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum. The indicated plasmids (6 μg) were transiently transfected into 4 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes with TransIT-293 reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When indicated, cell were synchronized in G2/M phase with 50 ng/ml nocodazole treatment for 14–18 h. After 48 h, cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing multiple protease inhibitors, and the soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation. Aliquots of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody- or control IgG-fixed beads (Novagen), and the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of NET gel buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA). The immunoprecipitates were eluted with the elution buffer (100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5) and subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Fujita M. Ishimi Y. Nakamura H. Kiyono T. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10354-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Establishment of Rat-1 Cells Stably Expressing T7-tagged Cdt1— Rat-1 cells (normal rat fibroblasts) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum. Recombinant retroviruses expressing wild type T7-tagged human Cdt1 or T7-Cdt1 Cy were prepared, and cells were infected with the viruses. Cells were then selected with hygromycin B and cloned. Representative lines expressing wild type T7-Cdt1 (designated WB4) or T7-Cdt1 Cy (designated CB3) were established and used for further study. The levels of T7-Cdt1 in these cells were about 20 times those of endogenous Cdt1. Details of establishment and characterization of these cells will be published elsewhere. 2Y. Tatsumi, N. Sugimoto, T. Kiyono, and M. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. When indicated, cells were synchronized in S phase with 2.5 mm hydroxyurea treatment for 18 h. λ-Phosphatase Treatment of Cdt1-Geminin Complexes Immunoprecipitated from 293T Cells—Cdt1-geminin complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody from 293T cells transfected with Cdt1 and T7-geminin and synchronized in G2/M phase with nocodazole. After washing, the purified immunoprecipitates were treated with 100 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in 50 μl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 30 °C or left untreated in the same buffer. Then proteins released into supernatants or remaining on the beads were separated by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblotting.

For G2/M synchronization, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h at either 32 °C or 39 °C. Cell fractionation was performed as described previously (17Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T.

Cyclin A-dependent Kinases, but Not Cyclin B-Cdk1, Bind to Human Cdt1 through the Cyclin-binding Motif—To explore functional associations between Cdt1 and Cdks, we first assessed physical interactions in vivo by immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 tag antibody after transfection of T7-tagged Cdt1 into 293T cells (Fig. 1). Cyclin A, Cdk1, and Cdk2, but not cyclin B, proteins were specifically co-precipitated with T7-Cdt1. Cdt1 has a putative cyclin-binding motif (7Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sørensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 8Herbig U. Griffith J.W. Fanning E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4117-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Adams P.D.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) in the N terminus. To test its role, we created a T7-Cdt1 mutant in which the conserved Arg-68, Arg-69, and Leu-70 (Cy motif) had been substituted with alanines (T7-Cdt1 Cy). When T7-Cdt1 Cy was introduced into 293T cells and analyzed by immunoprecipitation as above, no or reduced co-precipitation of cyclin A, Cdk1, and Cdk2 was evident (Fig. 1). These data suggest that Cdt1 may interact with cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin A-Cdk2 kinases through the Cy motif. We sought to co-precipitate cyclin A-Cdks with endogenous Cdt1 but failed to do so (data not shown). Therefore, physical interaction between Cdt1 and cyclin A-Cdks may not be very strong. However, as described below, further studies clearly demonstrate that this interaction plays a crucial role in phosphorylation and regulation of Cdt1 by cyclin A-dependent kinases. We next set up an in vitro assay system. Bacterially produced purified wild type GST-Cdt1 and GST-Cdt1 Cy fusion proteins were incubated with cyclin A-Cdk1, cyclin A-Cdk2, and cyclin B-Cdk1 complexes generated in the baculoviral system and purified. Then the GST fusion proteins were collected on glutathione beads, and associated cyclin-Cdks were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin A-Cdk2, but not cyclin B-Cdk1, efficiently bound to GST-Cdt1, whereas no specific binding was noted to GST-Cdt1 Cy or to GST alone (data not shown) under the same conditions. Lower bands observed both in cyclin A and cyclin B samples may be truncated forms nonspecifically cleaved by thrombin, but the kinase complexes have sufficient activities as mentioned below. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin A-Cdk2 kinases directly bind to Cdt1 through the Cy motif. Cyclin A-dependent Kinases Phosphorylate Cdt1 Depending on Their Binding to the Cyclin-binding Motif—The obtained data suggested that Cdt1 could be a good substrate for cyclin A-dependent kinases. Therefore, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay with [γ-33P]ATP. When histone H1 proteins were used as the substrate, all three cyclin-Cdks demonstrated similar phosphorylation under our assay conditions (Fig. 2B). However, the A- and B-type cyclin-Cdk complexes varied significantly in their ability to phosphorylate Cdt1. Both cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin A-Cdk2 were about 6–8-fold more active toward GST-Cdt1 than the cyclin B-Cdk1 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore GST-Cdt1 phosphorylation by the cyclin A-dependent kinases specifically retarded its electrophoretic mobility. As expected, this efficient phosphorylation required binding of the cyclin A-dependent kinases to Cdt1 via the Cy motif (Fig. 2, A and B). It was also notable that phosphorylation efficacy of Cdt1 by the two cyclin A-dependent kinases was virtually the same and that similar electrophoretic retardation was observed after the phosphorylation, suggesting that their phosphorylation sites in Cdt1 may be very similar in vitro. We then asked whether Cdt1 is phosphorylated by cyclin A-dependent kinases in vivo as well as in vitro. However, a problem to be overcome in this context is that Cdt1 itself is degraded during the S, G2, and M phases (26Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) when cyclin A-dependent kinases are active. Especially given that Cdt1 phosphorylated by cyclin A-dependent kinases is targeted for degradation (see below), we anticipated that it would be difficult to analyze this in vivo. One possibility for dealing with phosphorylated Cdt1 may be to trea"
https://openalex.org/W2021159608,"The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 has been recognized as a major mediator of basement membrane degradation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. The factors that regulate its expression have not, however, been fully elucidated. We previously identified the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) receptor as a regulator of MMP-2 synthesis. The objective of the present study was to investigate the signal transduction pathway(s) mediating this regulation. We show here that in Lewis lung carcinoma subline H-59 cells treated with IGF-I (10 ng/ml), the PI 3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase) /protein kinase B (Akt) and C-Raf/ERK pathways were activated, and MMP-2 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein synthesis were induced. MMP-2 induction was blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, by overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt or wild-type PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), and by rapamycin. In contrast, a MEK inhibitor PD98059 failed to reduce MMP-2 promoter activation and actually increased MMP-2 mRNA and protein synthesis by up to 30%. Interestingly, suppression of PI 3-kinase signaling by a dominant-negative Akt enhanced ERK activity in cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml but not with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. Furthermore, at the higher (100 ng/ml) IGF-I concentration, C-Raf and ERK, but not PI 3-kinase activation, was enhanced, and this resulted in down-regulation of MMP-2 synthesis. This effect was reversed in cells expressing a dominant-negative ERK mutant. The results suggest that IGF-I can up-regulate MMP-2 synthesis via PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling while concomitantly transmitting a negative regulatory signal via the Raf/ERK pathway. The outcome of IGF-IR (the receptor for IGF-I) activation may ultimately depend on factors, such as ligand bioavailability, that can shift the balance preferentially toward one pathway or the other. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 has been recognized as a major mediator of basement membrane degradation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. The factors that regulate its expression have not, however, been fully elucidated. We previously identified the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) receptor as a regulator of MMP-2 synthesis. The objective of the present study was to investigate the signal transduction pathway(s) mediating this regulation. We show here that in Lewis lung carcinoma subline H-59 cells treated with IGF-I (10 ng/ml), the PI 3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase) /protein kinase B (Akt) and C-Raf/ERK pathways were activated, and MMP-2 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein synthesis were induced. MMP-2 induction was blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, by overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt or wild-type PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), and by rapamycin. In contrast, a MEK inhibitor PD98059 failed to reduce MMP-2 promoter activation and actually increased MMP-2 mRNA and protein synthesis by up to 30%. Interestingly, suppression of PI 3-kinase signaling by a dominant-negative Akt enhanced ERK activity in cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml but not with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. Furthermore, at the higher (100 ng/ml) IGF-I concentration, C-Raf and ERK, but not PI 3-kinase activation, was enhanced, and this resulted in down-regulation of MMP-2 synthesis. This effect was reversed in cells expressing a dominant-negative ERK mutant. The results suggest that IGF-I can up-regulate MMP-2 synthesis via PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling while concomitantly transmitting a negative regulatory signal via the Raf/ERK pathway. The outcome of IGF-IR (the receptor for IGF-I) activation may ultimately depend on factors, such as ligand bioavailability, that can shift the balance preferentially toward one pathway or the other. The breakdown of the extracellular matrix by proteinases is an essential step in the processes of cancer invasion and metastasis. Malignant progression is frequently associated with up-regulated production and/or activity of one or several matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT-MMP, membrane type-metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; IGF-I, type I insulin-like growth factor; IGF-IR, IGF-I receptor; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; Akt, protein kinase B; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (used interchangeably with ERK, extracellular response kinase); MEK, MAP kinase kinase; JNK, Jun kinase; mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcriptase; DN, dominant-negative; h, human. a family of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes that have been implicated in tumor invasion by in vitro and in vivo studies (1Johansson N. Ahonen M. Kahari V.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The 72-kDa type IV collagenase, MMP-2, is thought to play a critical role in tumor cell invasion by facilitating the degradation of basement membrane type IV collagen, by exposing cryptic, growth-affecting sites on extracellular matrix proteins, and by increasing the bioavailability of matrix-associated growth factors (2Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of MMP-2 have been reported in various human malignancies including breast, oral, gastric, bladder, and pancreatic cancers (3Allgayer H. Babic R. Beyer B.C. Grutzner K.U. Tarabichi A.

Kawata R. Murakami Y. Fujimoto N. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, this enzyme was identified as critical for the process of angiogenesis (8Haas T.L. Madri J.A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and used as a target for anti-cancer therapy (9Wojtowicz-Praga S.M. Dickson R.B. Hawkins M.J. Investig. New Drugs. 1997; 15: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Similarly to other members of the metalloproteinase family, MMP-2 synthesis and function are regulated at multiple levels including transcriptional activation, post-transcriptional processing, and positive or negative regulation of proteolytic activity by membrane type-MMPs (MT-MMPs) and a family of endogenous inhibitors collectively known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (10Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-2 is secreted as an inactive, 72-kDa zymogen and is activated by proteolytic cleavage extracellularly. This process involves MT1-MMP that binds MMP-2 on the cell membrane in a multimeric complex with TIMP-2 (11Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A.

Other cell surface-binding sites such as the integrin αvβ3 have also been implicated (12Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of MMP-2 is not fully understood. Among those factors implicated in its regulation are transforming growth factor-β (13Graham C.H. Connelly I. MacDougall J.R. Kerbel R.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Lala P.K. Exp.

Although the MMP-2 promoter lacks well characterized regulatory elements, several transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 were recently implicated in its transcriptional activation in astroglioma cells (20Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The receptor for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-IR) and its ligands IGF-I and IGF-II play critical roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and transformation. IGFs have increasingly been recognized as important mitogens for many tumor types and overexpression and/or constitutive activation of IGF-IR in non-malignant cells resulted in the acquisition of a transformed phenotype and tumorigenic potential (21Brodt P. Samani A. Navab R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vivo, IGF-I-dependent tumor cell growth can be regulated in a paracrine manner by serum or stromal cell-derived IGFs, or it may be regulated through an autocrine loop. Indeed, increased expression of IGF-IR, IGF-I, and IGF-II or a combination thereof has been documented in many animal and human malignancies (22Macaulay V.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In addition, prospective clinical studies identified high plasma IGF-I levels as a potential risk factor for carcinomas of the breast, prostate, and colon (reviewed in Ref. 23Samani A.A. Brodt P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 289-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several animal tumor models, inhibition of IGF-IR or IGF-I expression by various strategies including antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, antisense RNA, or IGF-I peptide analogues caused a suppression of tumor cell growth in vivo (23Samani A.A. Brodt P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 289-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Baserga R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 150-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), identifying this receptor/ligand system as a target for cancer therapy (21Brodt P. Samani A. Navab R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent activation of the intrinsic IGF-IR tyrosine kinase results in the phosphorylation of several substrates including members of the insulin receptor substrate family and Shc (25Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H. Karas M. Okubo Y. LeRoith D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Petley T. Graff K. Jiang W. Yang H. Florini J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the IGF-IR can trigger multiple signaling pathways including the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway implicated in receptor-mediated mitogenesis and transformation and the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway implicated in the transmission of cell survival signals (23Samani A.A. Brodt P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 289-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that these pathways may in fact be interdependent and exert regulatory control on each other through trans phosphorylation (28Lehman J.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Moelling K. Schad K. Bosse M. Zimmermann S. Schweneker M. J. Biol.

We previously identified the IGF-IR as a regulator of carcinoma cell invasion and MMP-2 synthesis and activity (31Long L. Navab R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3243-3247PubMed Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the signal transduction pathways that link MMP-2 production to the IGF-IR axis and investigated the role of inter-pathway cross talk. Cells and Chemicals—The origin and invasive/metastatic phenotypes of Lewis lung carcinoma sublines, H-59 and M-27, were described in detail previously (32Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2442-2448PubMed Google Scholar). M-27IGF-IR cells were produced by stable transfection of M-27 cells with the pCI-neo vector expressing the full-length human IGF-I receptor cDNA (33Brodt P. Fallavollita L. Khatib A. Samani A. Zhang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 33608-33615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfected cells were maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G 418. All cell lines were routinely tested for infectious agents and were found to be free of infection during the course of this study. Recombinant hIGF-I was from United States Biological (Swampscott, MA), LY294002, PD98059, and rapamycin were from Calbiochem, and wortmannin was from Sigma. Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system, Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (both from Invitrogen), and the following primers: for MMP-2, sense, 5′-GAG TTG GCA GTG CAA TAC CT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCC GTC CTT CTC AAA GTT GT-3′ (expected product 665 bp); and for GAPDH, sense, 5′-GGT GAA GGT CGG TGT GAA CGG ATT T-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAT GCC AAA GTT GTC ATG GAT GAC C-3′ (expected product 520 bp). The cDNA was amplified using 30 cycles for MMP-2 (25 cycles for GAPDH) each of 30 s at 94 °C, 30sat58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, and this was followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Real-time Quantitative PCR—PCR was performed with the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I® (Roche Applied Science) in a standard PCR reaction mixture containing 0.5 μm of each primer (described above), 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 μl of cDNA. Amplification and detection were performed in a LightCycler® instrument (Roche Applied Science) as follows: 20 μl of the reaction mixture were initially incubated for 10 min at 95 °C to denature the DNA and activate the Fast Start TaqDNA; amplification was then performed for 43 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 10 s, ramp rate 20 °C/s), annealing (58 °C, 5 s, ramp rate 20 °C/s), and extension (72 °C, 26 s, ramp rate 20 °C/s). A single fluorescence reading was taken at each extension step. The crossing points, marking the cycle when the fluorescence of a given sample significantly exceeded the baseline signal, were recorded and expressed as a function of the cycle number. The crossing points were plotted against known concentrations determined on the basis of a pre-established standard curve. The identity of the amplification products was confirmed by determining the melting curve. The melting point of the MMP-2 amplification product (665 bp) was 88 ± 0.5 °C. Plasmids and Transfection—Wild-type and dominant-negative Akt (DN-Akt) constructs were gifts from Dr. David Kaplan (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The DN-Akt cDNA encoding a catalytically inactive mutant was constructed by a lysine-methionine substitution (residue 179) within the ATP-binding domain (34Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Taichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The PTEN cDNA was cloned into the NotI site of the pCEP4 vector (35Simpson L. Li J. Liaw D. Hennessy I. Oliner J. Christians F. Parsons R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3947-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was a gift from Dr. Nahum Sonenberg (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The expression vectors encoding the hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type ERK1 or a dominant-negative mutant, in which threonine 192 was replaced by alanine have been characterized elsewhere (36Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of H-59 cells seeded in 10-cm culture dishes, at a density of 106 cells/dish, were performed using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of DNA/dish, as suggested by the manufacturer. The transfected cells were incubated first for 5 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and then for 18 h in serum-depleted medium, prior to stimulation with IGF-I. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT)-Reporter Assay—Tumor cells were co-transfected with a pCAT basic vector expressing the CAT reporter gene downstream of a 680-bp (nucleotides –390 to +290) fragment of the human MMP-2 promoter (18Luca M. Huang S. Gershenwald J.E. Singh R.K. Reich R. Bar-Eli M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1105-1113PubMed Google Scholar) and a pSV40-Luciferase plasmid expressing the luciferase gene under the control of an RSV promoter, using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were incubated for 5 h in complete medium and then in serum-depleted RPMI medium for 18 h. To each dish, fresh medium was then added with or without 10 ng/ml hIGF-I, and the cells were incubated for another 6–48 h. Cell lysates were prepared using the Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and CAT activity was measured using the [3H]chloramphenicol assay (37Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were normalized relative to luciferase activity as measured using an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (LKB Instruments). Western Blot Assay—Subconfluent monolayers (∼8 × 106 cells) were washed extensively to remove serum, and the cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium with or without the indicated concentration of recombinant hIGF-I (United States Biological). For analysis of MMP-2, 50-fold concentrated conditioned media were used, and 50 or 100 μg of protein (as specified) were loaded per lane and separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with a monoclonal antibody to MMP-2 (manufactured by Fuji Co. for Medicorp, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) or with a rabbit antiserum raised against human cathepsin L (a kind of a gift from Dr. John Mort, Shriners Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (38Iwata Y. Mort J.S. Tateishi H. Lee E.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). A peroxidase-conjugated affiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. For detection of phospho-Akt, ERK, C-Raf, and tubulin, the cells were incubated with IGF-I, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% aprotinin. Proteins (50 or 100 μg/lane) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed with antibodies to Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr308), ERK1/2 (p42/44 MAPK), phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-C-Raf (Ser259) (all from Cell Signal Technology), C-Raf and phospho-C-Raf (Tyr340/341) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and tubulin and hemagglutinin (from Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated affiniPure donkey anti-rabbit, donkey anti-goat, or goat anti-mouse IgG antisera were used as required, as secondary antibodies. Gelatin Zymography—The gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 was analyzed by zymography, as we described previously (39Zhang D. Brodt P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, concentrated conditioned media (50×) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 and destained with 10% acetic acid-20% methanol until the desired color intensity was obtained. The gelatinolytic activity, seen as a clear zone on the blue background, was quantified by laser densitometry using photographic negatives of the gels. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Stimulation with IGF-I and cell lysis was performed as described above. C-Raf activity was measured by the Raf-1 immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, cell lysates (1 ml) were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-C-Raf antibody and 50% (v/v) protein G agarose. The precipitate was washed in ice-cold lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in assay buffer containing inactive MEK-1 and -2, and 4 μl of the mixture were added to the assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and 2 mg/ml myelin basic protein as the substrate, for a 10-min incubation at 30 °C. From each reaction mixture, 25 μl were spotted onto the center of a 2-cm2 P81 filter paper, and the papers were washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid and transferred into the scintillation mixture for counting. Reaction mixtures containing no enzyme were used as controls. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test was used for analysis of the CAT assay and real-time PCR data. IGF-I Induces MMP-2 mRNA and Protein Synthesis—The effect of IGF-I on MMP-2 expression was measured at the mRNA and protein levels. An RT-PCR analysis showed that in response to 10 ng/ml IGF-I, MMP-2 mRNA expression in both H-59 and M-27IGF-IR, but not in control, M-27 cells began to rise at 2 h, reached maximal levels at 8 h, and persisted for up to 24 h (Fig. 1A). A quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed these results, showing a 4-fold increase in MMP-2 transcription at 8 h (Fig. 1B). The increase in MMP-2 mRNA expression was reflected in increased protein production and enzyme activity, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1C, I) and gelatin zymography (Fig. 1C, II) respectively, performed on medium conditioned by H-59 cells. Gelatin zymography revealed two bands corresponding to the native (72-kDa) and activated (64-kDa) forms of MMP-2 (Fig. 1C, II). In contrast, tumor cell treatment with 100 ng/ml IGF-I reduced MMP-2 mRNA expression by 70%, as measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 1B), and this resulted in a corresponding reduction in protein synthesis (Fig. 1C). MMP-2 promoter activation by IGF-I was subsequently analyzed in H-59 cells that were transiently transfected with a pCAT basic vector in which a 680-bp fragment of the MMP-2 promoter (nucleotides –390 to +290) was cloned upstream of the CAT reporter gene. This promoter region was selected because it contains the Sp1- and AP-2-binding sites that were previously identified as critical for MMP-2 gene transcription (20Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To control for transfection efficiency, the cells were cotransfected with a second plasmid vector expressing the luciferase gene under the control of a constitutive RSV promoter. CAT activity in the transfected cells increased 2.4-fold relative to controls when the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IGF-I for 6 h (Fig. 2, p < 0.01). The activity remained elevated relative to controls for up to 24 h, declining to basal levels by 36 h (data not shown). A similar IGF-I-induced increase in CAT activity was seen in M-27IGF-IR cells (p < 0.01), but no response was observed in control, M-27 cells (p > 0.05, Fig. 2). The PI 3-Kinase/Akt and MEK/MAPK Pathways Transmit Opposing Signals for MMP-2 Synthesis in Response to IGF-I— Signal transduction by the IGF-IR is known to involve both the ERK and the PI 3-kinase pathways (25Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H. Karas M. Okubo Y. LeRoith D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Petley T. Graff K. Jiang W. Yang H. Florini J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To identify the pathway(s) regulating MMP-2 induction by IGF-I, we first tested the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways on MMP-2 expression, using a combination of RT-PCR, Western blotting, and the CAT-MMP-2 promoter assay. Results in Fig. 3 show that treatment of H-59 cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 (20 μm) and wortmannin (5 nm), under conditions that had no deleterious effect on cell viability (38Iwata Y. Mort J.S. Tateishi H. Lee E.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), blocked IGF-I-induced MMP-2 mRNA synthesis (Fig. 3A) and reduced MMP-2 protein synthesis by 82 and >90%, respectively, relative to non-treated, IGF-I stimulated cells. Moreover, in H-59 cells that were transiently transfected with plasmid vectors expressing a dominant-negative (DN) Akt mutant or wild-type PTEN, IGF-I-mediated MMP-2 induction was completely blocked, whereas it increased by 3–3.6-fold in non-transfected or wild-type Akt-transfected cells (Fig. 3, C and E), confirming the involvement of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in the induction. The decrease in MMP-2 induction in DN-Akt transfected cells was seen despite increased levels of phospho-ERK in these cells (Fig. 3D). In addition, treatment with PD98059 (20 μm) increased MMP-2 mRNA and protein levels, as measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 3A) and by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Moreover, cell pretreatment with LY294002 and wortmannin, but not with PD98059, blocked IGF-I-induced MMP-2 promoter activation, as measured by the CAT reporter assay (Fig. 3F). Taken together, the data indicate that IGF-I can up-regulate MMP-2 synthesis via PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling while also transmitting a negative regulatory signal via C-Raf/ERK signaling. Inhibition of IGF-I-mediated MMP-2 Protein but Not mRNA Synthesis by Rapamycin—The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a substrate downstream of Akt that is involved in the regulation of translation initiation (40Navab R. Chevet E. Authier F. Di Guglielmo G.M. Bergeron J.J. Brodt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13644-13649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To evaluate its involvement in IGF-I-induced MMP-2 synthesis, the cells were treated with rapamycin at non-toxic concentrations prior to stimulation with IGF-I (10 ng/ml). This treatment blocked the increase in MMP-2 protein synthesis (a decrease of 70 and 85% in cells treated with 20 and 100 ng/ml rapamycin, respectively, relative to non-treated cells, Fig. 4A) while not affecting MMP-2 mRNA synthesis (Fig. 4B). Changes in Signaling in Response to High Dose IGF-I, Evidence for Inter-pathway Cross-talk—Because IGF-I at a concentration of 100 ng/ml decreased, rather than enhanced, MMP-2 synthesis (Fig. 1, B and C), it was of interest to compare the signals generated at this dose to those seen at the MMP-2-inducing concentration of 10 ng/ml. We observed that in cells treated with 10 ng/ml IGF-I, the PI 3-kinase/Akt and Raf/ERK pathways were both activated. Increased Akt phosphorylation was observed by 2 min following the treatment, returning to basal levels by 20 min. Phospho-ERK levels began to increase at 5 min, were maximal at 20 min, concomitantly with maximal C-Raf kinase activity, and returned to basal levels at 40–60 min (Fig. 5, A and B). This pattern was altered at 100 ng/ml IGF-I. At this concentration, there was no measurable increase in phospho-Akt levels, whereas C-Raf activation and ERK phosphorylation were both enhanced and more sustained and could be detected for up to 1 and 2 h, respectively, after IGF-I treatment (Fig. 5B, I and II). C-Raf was recently identified as an Akt substrate in several cell lines including human breast carcinoma line MCF-7 (29Moelling K. Schad K. Bosse M. Zimmermann S. Schweneker M. J. Biol.

These targets can be classified into genes that shorten or extend life-span upon their induction. Genes that shorten life-span include a variety of stress response genes, among them genes encoding catalases; however, no evidence directly implicates catalases in the aging process of nematodes or other organisms. Using genetic mutants, we show that lack of peroxisomal catalase CTL-2 causes a progeric phenotype in C. elegans. Lack of peroxisomal catalase also affects the developmental program of C. elegans, since Δctl-2 mutants exhibit decreased egg laying capacity. In contrast, lack of cytosolic catalase CTL-1 has no effect on either nematode aging or egg laying capacity. The Δctl-2 mutation also shortens the maximum life-span of the long lived Δclk-1 mutant and accelerates the onset of its egg laying period. The more rapid aging of Δctl-2 worms is apparently not due to increased carbonylation of the major C. elegans proteins, although altered peroxisome morphology in the Δctl-2 mutant suggests that changes in peroxisomal function, including increased production of reactive oxygen species, underlie the progeric phenotype of the Δctl-2 mutant. Our findings support an important role for peroxisomal catalase in both the development and aging of C. elegans and suggest the utility of the Δctl-2 mutant as a convenient model for the study of aging and the human diseases acatalasemia and hypocatalasemia.

These target genes usually contain specific nucleotide sequences in their upstream regulatory regions capable of binding DAF-16 and can be directly repressed or activated upon binding of DAF-16 (5Murphy C.T.

Specific transcriptional regulation of target genes by DAF-16 is purported to lead to an extended or shortened life-span for the nematode. Among the target genes regulated by DAF-16 are those encoding heat shock proteins and cytochrome p450s involved in the cell stress response and genes encoding proteins responsible for antioxidant defense, such as the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD-3, the metallothionein homolog MTL-1, and the catalases CTL-1 and CTL-2 (5Murphy C.T.

Kimura K.D. Lee M.S. Ruvkun G. Science. 2000; 290: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The daf-16 mutation also largely suppresses the increases in catalase activity observed in age mutants (10Houthoofd K. Braeckman B.P. Johnson T.E. Vanfleteren J.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).In addition to the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I signaling pathway, dietary restriction and oxidative stress are also thought to be major determinants of the aging process in C. elegans and other model organisms (10Houthoofd K.

Gerontol. 1998; 33: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Under conditions of dietary restriction that extend monoxenic, and especially axenic, worm life-span, catalase and SOD levels have been found to be increased dramatically in a DAF-16-independent manner (10Houthoofd K. Braeckman B.P. Johnson T.E. Vanfleteren J.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A correlation between increases in SOD and catalase activity and hyperresistance to oxidative stress has also been observed in some long lived mutants (8Larsen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). During the dauer larval stage when the nematode is developmentally arrested, nonfeeding, and able to survive several times the normal life-span, catalase and/or SOD activities are substantially up-regulated (8Larsen P.L.

Lau J.F. Ma C. Hahn J.H. Hoque R. Rothblatt J. Chalfie M. Nature. 1999; 399: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Togo S.H. Maebuchi M. Yokota S. Bun-Ya M. Kawahara A. Kamiryo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A previous attempt to engage CTL-1 directly in the control of aging in C. elegans was unsuccessful (21Taub J. Lau J.F. Ma C. Hahn J.H. Hoque R. Rothblatt J. Chalfie M. Nature. 1999; 399: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Molecular features of the catalase gene locus in C. elegans, namely the presence of different catalase genes exhibiting a high level of sequence identity, make it difficult, if not impossible, to use the results of methods such as RNA interference (4Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 5Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C.

Genomics. 2002; 10: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to permit definitive statements on the roles of individual catalases in the aging process in C. elegans. Here, using C. elegans strains mutated for individual catalase genes, we present evidence directly implicating peroxisomal catalase CTL-2, but not cytosolic CTL-1, in the aging process and developmental program of C. elegans and show that a lack of CTL-2 causes a progeric phenotype in the nematode.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains—Wild-type worms C. elegans variety Bristol, strain N2 and mutant strains ctl-1(u800)II (Δctl-1) and clk-1(qm30)III (Δclk-1) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center (Minneapolis, MN). Deletion of the ctl-1 gene in the strain Δctl-1 was confirmed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing (Fig. S1). The ctl-2 deletion mutant strain LB90 (ua90)II (Δctl-2) was isolated by screening an ethyl methane sulfonate-generated mutant worm library by PCR amplification using nested primers (Fig. S1). All strains were grown at 20 °C on a lawn of Escherichia coli strain OP50 (24Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Synchronization of worm cultures was performed as described (26Hope I.A. C. elegans: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 62-63Google Scholar).Determination of Catalase Activity—Catalase activity of lysates of mixed stage animals prepared by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm sorbitol was measured either colorimetrically (27Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. de Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) or by staining in situ with ferricyanide following native gel electrophoresis (28Woodbury W. Spencer A.K. Stahman M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar).Determination of Life-span—To measure nematode life-span, plates containing 10–14 worms were incubated at 20 °C and scored daily for surviving animals. Worms were transferred to fresh plates every 2–3 days. The starting point for life-span determination was at hatching. Lost, bagged, and exploded animals were excluded from analysis. To measure chronological life-span in wild-type and mutant strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells were grown to stationary phase in YNBD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 0.08% Complete Supplement Mixture (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA)), pelleted, and washed three times in distilled, deionized water and then transferred to distilled, deionized water at a density of 2–3 cells/μl. Cells were incubated at 30 °C with rotational shaking in Erlenmeyer flasks at a flask volume/medium volume ratio of 5:1. To score for surviving cells, cell suspensions were seeded onto YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) agar plates, and the individual yeast colonies were counted.Measurement of Protein Carbonylation—Protein carbonylation was determined using the OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantitated by analysis of autoradiograms with a GS-800 calibrated densitometer using Quantity One version 4.2.3 software (Bio-Rad).Confocal and Electron Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed with a LSM510 META laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY). Peroxisomes were visualized with a fluorescent protein chimera of green fluorescent protein tagged at its carboxyl terminus with the peroxisome targeting signal 1 tripeptide Ser-Lys-Leu (23Petriv O.I. Pilgrim D.B. Rachubinski R.A. Titorenko V.I. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 10: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for electron microscopy as described (29Hall D.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 395-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and examined with a Philips 410 electron microscope. Electron microscopic images were captured with a MegaView III CCD camera (Soft Imaging System, Lakewood, CO). Sizes of peroxisomes and lipid droplets were determined using UTHSCSA Image Tool 2.00.RESULTSCharacterization of the Catalase Genes of C. elegans and Analysis of Catalase Enzymatic Activity in the Nematode—The C. elegans genome contains three catalase genes in tandem: ctl-3, ctl-1, and ctl-2 (Figs. 1 and S1). 2NCBI database entry NP_496979; Wormbase, open reading frames Y54G11A.6, Y54G11A.5a, Y54G11A.5b, and Y54G11A.13. DAF-16 binding motifs (1McElwee J. Bubb K. Thomas J.H. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) are present upstream and downstream of all three genes (Fig. 1). The catalase genes exhibit extensive sequence identity. ctl-1 is identical to ctl-2 between nucleotides 1 and 304 and to ctl-3 from nucleotide 304 until its end (Figs. 1 and S1). The coding region of ctl-2 exhibits 76.7% sequence identity to the coding region of ctl-3 (Figs. 1, S1, and S2). The intervening region between the ctl-1 and ctl-3 genes is 100% identical in sequence to the intervening region between the ctl-1 and ctl-2 genes (Figs. 1 and S1). Extensive sequence identity among the catalase genes makes it difficult to analyze their individual expression by techniques such as Northern blotting and suggests that the results of RNA interference and gene microarray analysis should be interpreted with caution.The catalases themselves can be distinguished from one another because of differences in their biochemical properties. Because the pI values of the three catalases differ significantly (Table I), they can be readily separated by native gel electrophoresis and detected by staining for enzymatic activity (Fig. 2A). We isolated a worm strain, LB90 (ua90)II, harboring a deletion of the ctl-2 gene (Figs. 1 and S1, Δctl-2). The Δctl-2 mutant strain exhibits no detectable CTL-2 enzymatic activity (Fig. 2A). DNA sequencing of the strain ctl-1(u800)II, which had been claimed to exhibit decreased catalase activity due to a premature termination codon in the ctl-1 gene (21Taub J. Lau J.F. Ma C. Hahn J.H. Hoque R. Rothblatt J. Chalfie M. Nature. 1999; 399: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), showed that the entire ctl-1 gene and extensive sequence upstream were missing in this mutant (Figs. 1 and S1, Δctl-1). Native gel electrophoresis confirmed the absence of CTL-1 enzymatic activity in the Δctl-1 strain (Fig. 2A). Attempts to isolate mutants of the ctl-3 gene were unsuccessful. In dauer larvae, a developmental stage during which animals do not feed and fat metabolism is shifted to fat storage (30Guarente L. Ruvkun G. Amasino R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11034-11036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the level of CTL-1 activity is increased, whereas the level of peroxisomal CTL-2 activity appears to be similar to that found in wild-type worms (Fig. 2A). Δctl-2 and Δctl-1 mutants do not fail to form the dauer stage (data not shown).Table IThree genes encode catalases in C. elegansGeneORFaOpen reading frame designationcDNA lengthProtein massProtein pIbpkDactl-1Y54G11A.6149457.36.71ctl-2Y54G11A.5(A)150357.58.02ctl-3Y54G11A.131539596.66a Open reading frame Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Activity of catalases in C. elegans.

Therefore, peroxisomal catalase CTL-2 contributes most of the total catalase activity in C. elegans.Table IILife-span, catalase activity, and egg laying in C. elegans mutantsStrainMean life-spanMaximum life-spanCatalase activity in vitroEggs laid/wormdays from hatchingaBased on unpaired t test for two populationsdays from hatchingaBased on unpaired t test for two populations% of wild typeWild type14.6 ± 1.4 (n = 717)20.8 ± 3.1 (n = 6)100310 ± 31.3Δctl-115.3 ± 1.2 (n = 364)bComparison with wild-type strain21.7 ± 0.5 (n = 4)bComparison with wild-type strain74.6 ± 6.7 (n = 8)332.5 ± 25.9Δctl-212.1 ± 0.9 (n = 365)b,Comparison with wild-type straincSignificantly different at p < 0.0116.6 ± 1.1 (n = 5)b,Comparison with wild-type straindSignificantly different at 0.01 < p < 0.0519.6 ± 6.1 (n = 11)231.1 ± 22.5Δclk-124.7 ± 2.7 (n = 277)32.7 ± 1.5 (n = 3)171.5 ± 19.8 (n = 4)160.6 ± 20.6Δclk-1;Δctl-224.3 ± 1.6 (n = 161)eComparison with clk-1 strain29.3 ± 1.2 (n = 3)c,Significantly different at p < 0.01dSignificantly different at 0.01 < p < 0.05NDfNot determined130.7 ± 24.7a Based on unpaired t test for two populationsb Comparison with wild-type strainc Significantly different at p < 0.01d Significantly different at 0.01 < p < 0.05e Comparison with clk-1 strainf Not determined Open table in a new tab Lack of Peroxisomal, but Not Cytosolic, Catalase Causes Accelerated Aging of C. elegans—We compared the mean and maximum life-span and egg laying capacity of catalase mutant worms versus wild-type worms to determine whether the different catalases in C. elegans could have a role in the development and aging of the nematode. Δctl-1 mutants showed no difference in life-span or egg laying capacity compared with wild-type worms, whereas Δctl-2 mutants had a significantly shortened (16%) life-span and decreased egg laying capacity (Fig. 3 and Table II). Introduction of the Δctl-2 mutation into long lived Δclk-1 mutant worms did not result in a shortening of their mean life-span (Fig. 3 and Table II), consistent with a previous finding that the extended life-span of Δclk-1 mutant worms is not related directly to the antioxidant action of catalase (34Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. Brys K. Lenaerts I. De Vreese A. Van Eygen S. Raes H. Vanfleteren J.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we observed a significantly shortened (14%) maximum life-span and an acceleration of ∼12 h in the onset of the egg laying period in Δclk-1;Δctl-2 double mutant worms as compared with Δclk-1 mutant worms (Fig. 3 and Table II).Fig. 3Effects of mutation of the ctl-1 and ctl-2 genes on life-span and egg laying capacity of wild-type and Δclk-1 mutant worms. A, mutation of the ctl-2 gene (Δctl-2) shortens the mean life-span of wild-type (WT) worms (strain N2) by 16% and the maximum life-span of the Δclk-1 long living mutant by 14%. In contrast, the Δctl-1 mutation does not influence significantly the mean life-span of wild-type worms. B, Δctl-2 mutants lay 25% less eggs than do wild-type or Δctl-1 mutant worms (see also Table II). Lack of CTL-2 also advances the egg laying period in the Δclk-1 mutant by 12 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Increased protein carbonylation has been observed during cell aging (31Goto S. Nakamura A. Radak Z. Nakamoto H. Takahashi R. Yasuda K. Sakurai Y. Ishii N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1999; 107: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Carbonylation of major worm proteins such as vitellogenin-6 (32Nakamura A. Yasuda K. Adachi H. Sakurai Y. Ishii N. Goto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) increases from 5 days to 10 days in both wild-type worms and Δctl-1 and Δctl-2 mutant worms, but the overall increase in carbonylation is less for both mutants than for wild-type worms (Fig. 4). This smaller increase in carbonylation observed for the Δctl-1 and Δctl-2 mutants may result from a compensatory up-regulation of other antioxidant enzymes in these mutants. Evidence for such compensatory changes in the synthesis of unknown enzymes with catalase activity could be seen for the Δctl-1 and Δctl-2 mutants (Fig. 2A, arrowheads). The carbonylation of major protein species therefore appears not to be the cause of the progeric phenotype of the Δctl-2 mutant.Fig. 4Carbonylation levels of the major proteins of wild-type and catalase mutant worms. At 10 days, the level of protein carbonylation in wild-type worms (WT) is more than twice that observed at 5 days (taken as 100%), whereas only a modest increase is observed for the Δctl-1 and Δctl-2 mutant worms over the same period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cells of the Δctl-2 Mutant Exhibit Abnormal Peroxisome Morphology—A deficiency in the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase leads to increased levels of intraperoxisomal H2O2 and alters the morphology of peroxisomes (33Fan C.Y.

A lack of peroxisomal catalase CTL-2 might be expected to exert a similar effect on peroxisome morphology due to decreased break-down of intraperoxisomal H2O2. We therefore examined the morphology of peroxisomes in wild-type and Δctl-2 mutant worms by fluorescent confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. The mean size of peroxisomes is increased in Δctl-2 mutant worms versus wild-type worms (Fig. 5A), and peroxisomes tend to cluster in the Δctl-2 mutant (Fig. 6A). Electron microscopy revealed that these clustered peroxisomes are often associated with lipid vesicles (Fig. 6B, left panel) or with specific multivesicular structures of unknown origin and function (Fig. 6B, right panel). Fat metabolism is apparently normal in Δctl-2 mutant worms, since they accumulate lipid droplets in their cells of the same size accumulated by cells of wild-type worms (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Cells of Δctl-2 mutant worms contain enlarged peroxisomes but lipid droplets of normal size. A, the mean diameter of peroxisomes in hypodermal cells of Δctl-2 mutant worms is significantly larger than that of peroxisomes in hypodermal cells of wild-type (WT) worms. B, no significant difference in the mean diameter of lipid droplets of gut cells is observed between wild-type worms and Δctl-2 mutant worms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Peroxisomes exhibit altered morphology in Δctl-2 mutant worms.

To our knowledge, no other metazoan organism has been reported to have multiple catalase genes. The most active form of catalase in C. elegans is peroxisomal catalase CTL-2, which contributes ∼80% of total catalase activity in the nematode. The remaining catalase activity is contributed by cytosolic catalase CTL-1, a previously unreported catalase CTL-3 encoded by the open reading frame Y54G11A.13, and unknown enzymes exhibiting catalase activity (cf. Fig. 2A). Attempts to obtain a strain mutant for the ctl-3 gene were unsuccessful; however, expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter under the control of a promoter fragment extending 657 bp upstream from the ctl-3 initiating codon was localized to pharyngeal muscle cells and neurons (Supplemental Data, Fig. S3).Previous results from studies employing RNA interference had suggested the importance of CTL-2 activity for longevity in C. elegans (5Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C. Nature. 2003; 424: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). However, because of the high degree of nucleotide identity among the catalase genes, the results of RNA interference studies must be interpreted with caution. Using worms deleted for the ctl-2 gene, we have demonstrated directly for the first time that a lack of peroxisomal catalase accelerates aging in C. elegans. A lack of CTL-2 resulted in a 16% reduction in the mean life-span of worms. The reduced viability of Δctl-2 mutant worms was also reflected in the significantly smaller number of eggs they laid and their slightly delayed and extended egg laying period. Importantly, mutation of the ctl-1 gene did not affect either nematode life-span or egg laying capacity, demonstrating that the effects of ctl-2 mutation on these characteristics were not simply the result of reduced overall catalase activity. Introduction of the Δctl-2 mutation into the long lived Δclk-1 mutant increased the survival of Δclk-1 mutant worms during the first 19 days of life but resulted in the rapid death of the Δclk-1;Δctl-2 double mutant worms after 19 days (cf. Fig. 3A), resulting in a shortened maximum life-span, but no overall change in mean life-span, for the double mutant worms. These findings are consistent with previous data showing that the extended mean life-span of the Δclk-1 mutant is not related directly to the antioxidant action of catalase (34Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. Brys K. Lenaerts I. De Vreese A. Van Eygen S. Raes H. Vanfleteren J.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, introduction of the Δctl-2 mutation into the Δclk-1 mutation background accelerated the egg laying period of the Δclk-1;Δctl-2 double mutant by 12 h compared with the Δclk-1 mutant. Development and behavior are considerably retarded, and reproduction is strongly reduced"

In the current studies, we used wild-type (WT) S49 T-lymphoma cells and the kin– variant (which lacks protein kinase A (PKA)) to examine cAMP/PKA-mediated apoptosis. The cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, increased phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), activated caspase-3, and induced apoptosis in WT but not in kin– S49 cells. Using an array of 96 apoptosis-related genes, we found that treatment of WT cells with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h induced expression of mRNA for the pro-apoptotic gene, Bim. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that 8-CPT-cAMP increased Bim RNA in WT cells in <2 h and maintained this increase for >24 h. Bim protein expression increased in WT but not kin– cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP or with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Both apoptosis and Bim expression were reversible with removal of 8-CPT-cAMP after <6 h. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone also promoted apoptosis and Bim expression in S49 cells. In contrast, both UV light and anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody promoted apoptosis in S49 cells but did not induce Bim expression. 8-CPT-cAMP also induced Bim expression and enhanced dexamethasone-promoted apoptosis in human T-cell leukemia CEM-C7–14 (glucocorticoid-sensitive) and CEM-C1–15 (glucocorticoid-resistant) cells; increased Bim expression in 8-CPT-cAMP-treated CEM-C1–15 cells correlated with conversion of the cells from resistance to sensitivity to glucocorticoid-promoted apoptosis. Induction of Bim appears to be a key event in cAMP-promoted apoptosis in both murine and human T-cell lymphoma and leukemia cells and thus appears to be a convergence point for the killing of such cells by glucocorticoids and agents that elevate cAMP. The mechanisms by which cAMP mediates apoptosis are not well understood.

The second messenger cAMP alters the balance between cell growth and apoptosis in a cell type-dependent manner; cAMP stimulates growth arrest and apoptosis in certain lymphoid cells, especially poorly differentiated lymphoblastic cells, but promotes growth of other cell types (e.g. epithelial cells) and protects other cell types (e.g. neutrophils and eosinophils) from drug- and cytokine-promoted apoptosis (1Roger P.P.

Overexpression of certain anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, can protect lymphoma cells from cAMP-mediated apoptosis; such protection appears to be distinct from the effects of cAMP on cell cycle arrest (10Zhang L. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1642-C1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although over-expression of Bcl-2 can protect cells from cAMP-mediated apoptosis, whether endogenous levels of Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family members are involved in cAMP-induced apoptosis is not known. In the current study, we used murine S49 lymphoma cells and human CEM cells as model systems to investigate changes in gene expression that contribute to cAMP-promoted apoptosis. S49 cells, which arose in a Balb/c mouse as a transplantable T-cell tumor, grow in suspension culture with a doubling time of 16–18 h and respond to agonists that elevate cAMP by undergoing G1 arrest and apoptotic cell death (8Yan L.

Thus, WT and kin– S49 cells are a useful system to use in defining PKA-dependent events involved in cell growth and death. CEM cells provide a model of human lymphoid tumor cells with glucocorticoid sensitivity or resistance, one in which cAMP can be used to enhance glucocorticoid sensitivity (14Thompson E.B. Medh R.D.

We show here that the Bcl-2 family member, Bim, may be a key protein in both cAMP/PKA- and glucocorticoid-promoted apoptosis of both murine S49 and human leukemia cells. Materials—Cell culture reagents and a Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit were obtained from Invitrogen, mouse apoptosis GEArray Q series kit (MM-001 N) from SuperArray, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate from BD Pharmingen, Master Mix SYBR green from Applied Biosystems, propidium iodide, 8-CPT-cAMP, (–)-isoproterenol, IBMX, and dexamethasone (Dex) from Sigma, caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit from R&D Systems, biotin-16-dUTP from Roche Applied Science, RNase inhibitor and Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase from Promega, Bim primers and GAPDH primers from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., subcellular proteome extraction kit from Calbiochem, Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer and BCA Protein Assay kit® from Pierce, and Immobilon-P® polyvinylidine difluoride membrane from Millipore. The following antibodies were used: CREB antibody, phospho-CREB antibody, anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody, Jo2, and polyclonal rabbit anti-Bim from BD Pharmingen; and actin (mouse monoclonal IgG1) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture—S49 lymphoma cells (2–3 × 105 cells/ml) were grown in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 mm HEPES in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. The CEM-C7–14 and CEM-C1–15 human acute T-cell leukemia cell lines were provided by Dr. E. Brad Thompson (University of Texas, Galveston) and were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were initiated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and grown in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Apoptosis Assay and Analysis of DNA Content and Cell Cycle by Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis was evaluated by assessment of annexin V binding or by propidium iodide analysis of cells for apoptotic sub-G1 levels of DNA (10Zhang L. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1642-C1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP were collected by centrifugation at the appropriate times. Caspase-3 activity was assessed according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA Microarray Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated by using a Qiagen RNeasy mini-column with extract prepared from cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm) or vehicle for 24 h. The biotin-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe was generated in the presence of a designed set of gene-specific primers using total RNA (5 μg/filter) and 200 units of Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Hybridization of the array filters, washing conditions, and chemiluminescent detection steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescent signals were captured with a UVP BioImaging system. WT and kin– control cDNA microarrays were performed twice, each time with new filters, and RNA was isolated at different times. 8-CPT-cAMP-treated cDNA microarrays were analyzed once. Data were analyzed with a GEArray analyzer (SuperArray Inc.) and Microsoft Excel software and normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. Preparation of cDNA and Real-time PCR—Preparation of total RNA was performed as described above. Each cDNA template was made from total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative analysis of cDNA amplification was assessed by incorporation of SYBR Green into double-stranded DNA. For mouse Bim we used 5′-CGACAGTCTCAGGAGGAACC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CCTTCTCCATACCAGACGGA-3′ as the reverse primer. For mouse GAPDH we used 5′-ATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CACATTGGGGTAGGAACAC-3′ as the reverse primer. PCR containing 50 ng of cDNA template, 0.5 μm each of forward and reverse primers, and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix was performed in a total volume of 25 μl. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial incubation of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 57 °C annealing temperature, and 30sat72 °C. All cDNA samples were tested in duplicate using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with ABI Prism Sequence Detection Software version 1.7 (PE Applied Biosystems). Samples were compared using the relative Ct method. The Ct value, which is inversely proportional to the initial template copy number, is the calculated cycle number where the fluorescence signal is significantly above background levels. Fold induction or repression was measured relative to controls and calculated after adjusting for GAPDH using 2–(ΔΔCt), where Δ Ct = Ct Bim–Ct GADPH and ΔΔ Ct = Δ Ct control – Δ Ct treatment (15Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Cytosol and Membrane Extraction—We used a subcellular proteome extraction kit (S-PEK) according to the manufacturer's instructions to extract cytosol and membrane/organelle fractions of S49 lymphoma cells. Cells were treated with 8-CPT-cAMP or vehicle, pelleted (4 × 106 cells), washed twice, resuspended in 150 μl of ice-cold Extraction I containing 0.75 μl of protease inhibitor mixture, and then incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used as the cytosol fraction; the pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of ice-cold Extraction II containing 0.75 μl of protease inhibitor mixture and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. It was then centrifuged at 6000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant used as the membrane/organelle fraction. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were centrifuged at the appropriate time points after various treatments, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed (4 × 106 cells/aliquots) in 0.2 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (for Bim protein expression) or 0.2 ml of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) (for CREB immunoblotting), incubated for 30 min on ice, sonicated three times for 10 s, and centrifuged (5 min at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm); the resulting supernatants were used as cell lysates. Protein concentration, determined using a BCA protein assay kit, was equalized by the addition of ultrapure water. Lysates were treated and assayed on 12% NuPAGE bis-Tris gels according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filters were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C, and probed with anti-Bim antibody or phospho-CREB antibody overnight at 4 °C. After five washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at a final dilution of 1/6,000 and then washed five times. Protein was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a UVP BioImaging system. Filters were stripped in Restore™ and reprobed with actin antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1) or CREB antibody for normalization. Statistical Analyses—All determinations were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Values are the means ± S.E. Differences were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Comparison between two groups was based on a one-tailed t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. 8-CPT-cAMP Acts via PKA to Increase Caspase-3 Activity and Induce Apoptosis of WT S49 Cells—WT S49 cells undergo apoptosis in response to the agents that increase cAMP levels (8Yan L. Herrmann V. Hofer J.K. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1665-C1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the pro-apoptotic effects of the cAMP analog 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm) on both WT and kin– S49 cells. Recent work has indicated that among several cAMP analogs (e.g. 8-Cl-cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, Bt2-cAMP and 8-CPT-cAMP), only CPT-cAMP acts purely as a cyclic nucleotide, having no effect on S49 kin– but strongly inhibiting growth of S49 WT cells (16Lamb D. Steinberg R.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We found that 8-CPT-cAMP promoted apoptosis in WT but not kin– S49 cells in a time-dependent fashion, akin to that of another cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP (8Yan L. Herrmann V. Hofer J.K. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1665-C1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a prominent increase in apoptosis after 24 h (Fig. 1A). 8-CPT-cAMP also increased caspase-3 activity (which is activated during apoptosis (17Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar)) of WT but not kin– S49 cells by 24 h of 8-CPT-cAMP treatment (Fig. 1B). As a further confirmation that this effect of cAMP is through PKA, we tested the compound 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, a cyclic AMP analog that does not activate PKA but instead activates Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Rap (18Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This analog failed to elicit apoptosis (n = 3, data not shown). Results shown in Fig 1A and in subsequent figures with detection of apoptosis by propidium iodide were confirmed by use of an annexin V binding assay (data not shown). 8-CPT-cAMP/PKA Induce Bim expression in WT but Not kin– S49 Cells—Because of the relatively slow time course of 8-CPT-cAMP-promoted caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, we hypothesized that cAMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis may result from changes in gene expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, 8-CPT-cAMP increased phosphorylation of the CREB protein in WT but not kin– S49 cells (Fig. 1A, inset). Enhanced phosphorylation of CREB by cAMP/PKA would be expected to stimulate gene expression in WT but not kin– S49 cells. To document this effect, we isolated total RNA from WT and kin– cells, either treated with vehicle or with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h, and used a GEArray Q series mouse apoptosis cDNA expression array to assess gene expression. This array assesses the expression of 96 murine genes involved in apoptosis and has been shown to be 98% reliable as confirmed by real-time PCR (19Luo Y. Cai J. Liu Y. Xue H. Chrest F.J. Wersto R.P. Rao M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1481-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We found that WT and kin– S49 cells show similar “basal” gene expression pattern as assessed by this array (data not shown). After 8-CPT-cAMP treatment of WT but not kin– cells for 24 h, the expression of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) increased 3-fold; this was the greatest increase in mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the microarray. We did not observe a change in Bcl-2 expression, a result confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (data not shown). Based on these data, we hypothesized that Bim contributes to cAMP/PKA-mediated apoptosis, because Bim acts as a “death ligand” that can neutralize members of the pro-survival Bcl-2 subfamily (20O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we quantified expression of Bim mRNA by preparation of cDNA for real-time PCR using total RNA from WT and kin– cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP. Bim was induced as early as 2 h following 8-CPT-cAMP treatment and remained elevated for at least 24–48 h in WT but not kin– S49 cells (Fig. 2A). Bim possesses a hydrophobic C terminus, localizes to intracytoplasmic membranes including mitochondrial membranes, and exists in three main isoforms (BimEL, BimL, and BimS), all of which promote apoptosis (20O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 21Nakazawa Y. Kamijo T. Koike K. Noda T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Using immunoblot analysis, we detected BimEL and BimL protein in S49 membrane but not cytosol fractions and found that 8-CPT-cAMP increased expression of both BimEL and BimL in WT but not kin– cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, Bim expression induced by 8-CPT-cAMP in S49 cells depends on PKA activity, whereas basal levels of Bim mRNA and protein expression did not differ between WT and kin– S49 cells (data not shown). Bim Expression Increases with cAMP Analog, Isoproterenol-, and Dexamethasone-promoted Apoptosis but Not with UV Light- or anti-Fas Antibody-promoted Apoptosis—To test whether a G protein-coupled receptor that increases cAMP in S49 cells would lead to apoptosis and Bim expression in a manner akin to 8-CPT-cAMP, we used the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 μm, in the presence of 0.2 mm IBMX). As shown in Fig. 3, isoproterenol increased apoptosis and Bim protein expression in WT but not kin– cells over a time course akin to that observed with 8-CPT-cAMP. Not only cAMP, but also glucocorticoids, UV light, and anti-Fas antibody promote apoptosis of S49 cells (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, left panels, Dex prominently induced expression of BimEL and BimL protein. Although UV light and anti-Fas antibody promoted apoptosis more rapidly and vigorously than did 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 4A, right panel), these treatments did not induce Bim protein expression (Fig. 4B, right panels).Fig. 4Effect of Dex, 8-CPT-cAMP, UV light, and anti-mouse Fas on apoptosis and Bim expression in WT S49 cells. A, WT S49 cells were treated with 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm), Dex (1 μm), 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm) + Dex (1 μm), UV light (1 min), and anti-mouse Fas (500 ng/ml) for the indicated time intervals. Data are expressed as percent apoptosis (sub-G1 [DNA]). The results are from four separate experiments. *, p < 0.05, and **, p < 0.01 8-CPT-cAMP and UV light treatment versus control; ##, p < 0.01 Dex and anti-Fas treatment versus control. B, Bim protein expression in WT S49 cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm), Dex (1 μm), or 8-CPT-cAMP + Dex for 24 h (left panels) and UV light (1 min) and anti-Fas (500 ng/ml) for 6 h (right panels) was determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. Quantitative analysis of immunoblots (normalized to actin expression) from 3–6 separate blots is shown below the blots. *, p < 0.05, and **, p < 0.01, versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sustained Treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP Is Necessary for cAMP-promoted Apoptosis and Increased Expression of Bim mRNA—We undertook studies to assess the reversibility of the response to 8-CPT-cAMP as well as the time required to “commit” cells to apoptosis. Cells were incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for various times, washed to remove 8-CPT-cAMP, and then returned to culture for up to 48 h. The results (Fig. 5A) show that a 2- or 6-h incubation with 8-CPT-cAMP was too short a period to promote apoptosis; cells appeared to require >6 h treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP to commit to apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5B, in parallel with the reversal of apoptosis, washout of 8-CPT-cAMP returned Bim mRNA expression to basal levels. Synergy between CPT-cAMP/PKA and Dex on Apoptosis and Bim Expression in Human CEM Cells—To assess whether induction of Bim by cAMP occurs in other lymphoid cells and in other species, we assessed apoptosis and Bim expression in response to 8-CPT-cAMP, Dex, and the combination of 8-CPT-cAMP and Dex in the human acute leukemia CEM cell line, in particular CEM-C7–14 (glucocorticoid-sensitive) and CEM-C1–15 (glucocorticoid-resistant) cells (24Medh R.D. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3684-3693PubMed Google Scholar). Previous data have shown that treatment with cAMP analogs enhances glucocorticoid sensitivity in CEM-C1–15 cells (24Medh R.D. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3684-3693PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Dex induced apoptosis in CEM-C7–14 but not in CEM-C1–15 cells (Fig. 6A, left panel), whereas 8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm), alone or together with Dex, yielded similar results in the two cell lines (Fig. 6A, middle and right panels). 8-CPT-cAMP acted synergistically with Dex to promote apoptosis, even in the Dexresistant cell line CEM-C1–15. Western blots revealed that all three isoforms of Bim were induced by 8-CPT-cAMP in CEM-C7–14 and CEM-C1–15 cells but that Dex induced Bim only in CEM-C7–14 cells. The combination of 8-CPT cAMP and Dex also synergistically induced Bim expression (Fig. 6B). Thus, the results in human leukemia CEM cells show a similar ability of cAMP to promote apoptosis and increase Bim expression as observed in murine lymphoma S49 cells. Although the second messenger cAMP was shown to regulate cell growth and cell death many years ago (e.g. Refs. 11Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Friedrich U. Hochman J. Insel P.A. Lemaire I. Melmon K.L. Tomkins G.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1976; 32: 669-684PubMed Google Scholar and 25Pastan I.H. Johnson G.S. Anderson W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 491-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), the precise determinants of cAMP-promoted cell death are poorly understood. Previous studies in the S49 cell system have documented that cell death promoted by cAMP analogs occurs via apoptosis (8Yan L. Herrmann V. Hofer J.K. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1665-C1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that apoptosis and G1 growth arrest are independent events that occur in WT but not kin– cells (10Zhang L. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1642-C1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Friedrich U. Hochman J. Insel P.A. Lemaire I. Melmon K.L. Tomkins G.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1976; 32: 669-684PubMed Google Scholar), thus implicating activation of PKA in the apoptotic process. In the current studies we show that the cAMP analog 8-CPT-cAMP increases phosphorylation of CREB and activates caspase-3, as well as promoting apoptosis in WT but not kin– S49 cells (Fig. 1). Using a commercial cDNA microarray to define cAMP/PKA-mediated changes in gene expression, we found that mRNA expression for Bim yielded the greatest change among pro-apoptotic genes in WT S49 cells in response to 8-CPT-cAMP. Real-time PCR and immunoblotting confirmed the induction of Bim mRNA and protein by 8-CPT-cAMP in WT S49 cells and in human CEM leukemia cells. In addition, we found that the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol promoted apoptosis and enhanced expression of Bim protein over a time course similar to that of 8-CPT-cAMP, implying that G protein-coupled receptors that increase cAMP levels have an action similar to the cAMP analog. Taken together, the results show a close correlation between Bim expression and apoptosis in both murine and human lymphoid cells and, as will be discussed subsequently, are consistent with the idea that Bim mediates apoptosis. Bim is a member of the Bcl-2 family, which regulates apoptosis. This family is characterized by at least one of four conserved Bcl-2 homology domains present in Bcl-2 (26Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Some members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, promote cell survival, whereas others, e.g. Bax, Bak, Bad, Bik, and Bim, are proapoptotic. Bim, Bad, and Bik contain a single Bcl-2 homology 3 domain and appear to promote cell death by neutralizing prosurvival Bcl-2 family members and activating pro-apoptotic family members (27Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bim is expressed as three major splice variants, BimEL, BimL, and BimS; BimS is the most potent in promoting apoptosis (20O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 28Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocytes from Bim–/– knockout mice survive 10–30 times better than cells from Bim+/+ mice following cytokine withdrawal or in response to apoptotic stimuli (29Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 30Bouillet P. Purton J.F. Godfrey D.I. Zhang L.C. Coultas L.

Interleukin-3 withdrawal from murine hematopoietic progenitor cells results in an up-regulation of Bim expression and induction of apoptosis (31Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 32Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of Bim induces apoptosis in the absence of other signals (32Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and expression of Bim isoforms can occur several hours prior to caspase activation (33Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 34Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Bim appears to be required for certain apoptotic responses but not others. Compared with Bim+/+ cells, Bim–/– pre-T cells are refractory to Dex and γ-irradiation but are equally sensitive to treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or Fas ligand (29Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Consistent with those observations, we found that Dex- and 8-CPT-cAMP-promoted apoptosis of WT S49 cells were accompanied by increases in Bim expression, but anti-Fas- and UV radiation-induced apoptosis were not (Fig. 4, A and B). However, sustained treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP appears to be necessary for cAMP-promoted apoptosis and increased Bim mRNA expression (Fig. 5, A and B). Importantly, in the S49 cell system, responses promoted by 8-CPT-cAMP and isoproterenol, i.e. Bim protein expression and apoptosis, both depend on the presence of PKA activity (Figs. 1, 2, 3). To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that cAMP/PKA-induced apoptosis closely correlates with Bim expression. The precise mechanism by which cAMP/PKA increases Bim expression in WT S49 cells will require further study. Such regulation might be transcriptional or post-transcriptional (22Seward R.J. von Haller P.D. Aebersold R. Huber B.T. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol.

Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2003; 38: 899-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation by cAMP is often mediated through the interaction of CREB with a cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter of target genes but the mouse Bim promoter lacks a consensus CRE (36Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Adams J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, this promoter contains two potential c-Myb binding sites and multiple potential binding sites for the SP1 transcription factor (36Bouillet P. Zhang L.C. Huang D.C. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Shore P. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Adams J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is possible that cAMP/PKA regulates Bim expression by c-Myb or SP1. Farrar et al. (37Farrar W.L. Evans S.W. Rapp U.R. Cleveland J.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2075-2080PubMed Google Scholar) found that 8-Br-cAMP stimulated c-Myb mRNA accumulation. We, too, have found that 8-CPT-cAMP can increase c-Myb mRNA expression in WT (but not kin–) S49 cells as early as 2 h with sustained expression for 24 h (data not shown). Perhaps 8-CPT-cAMP increases c-Myb expression and c-Myb then binds to the Bim promoter to stimulate expression of Bim mRNA. An alternate hypothesis would be if the CREB-binding protein (CBP), which serves as a co-activator of CREB and c-Myb (38Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), were to stimulate c-Myb-dependent transcriptional activation. CBP preferentially interacts with the phosphorylated (activated) form of CREB; the domain of CBP that interacts with c-Myb is also required for binding to CREB (38Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because Sp1 is also a cAMP-responsive transcription factor, it provides another means by which expression of Bim might be regulated via cAMP/PKA (39Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our studies with human leukemia CEM cells show that cAMP-induced Bim expression is not unique to murine lymphoma S49 cells. CEM cells, T-lymphoblasts derived from a child with acute lymphocytic leukemia, show glucocorticoid-cAMP interaction; activators of cAMP/PKA synergize with glucocorticoids in promoting apoptosis, perhaps via cooperative effects on gene transcription by glucocorticoid receptors and the PKA pathway (24Medh R.D. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3684-3693PubMed Google Scholar). Our results confirmed that the glucocorticoid Dex promotes apoptosis of S49 cells and CEM cells and induces Bim expression in these cells (40Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 41Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Murine thymocytes and T-lymphocytes can show a decrease in glucocorticoid sensitivity with a loss in PKA activity (42Gruol D.J. Rajah F.M. Bourgeois S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and enhancement in glucocorticoid-promoted apoptosis if treated with agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (43McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Okret S. Jondal M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids and cAMP may share distal events in inducing apoptosis of mouse WEHI-7 lymphoma cells (44Dowd D.R. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3600-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, 8-Cl-cAMP, Bt2-cAMP, and 8-Br-cAMP are cytotoxic to myeloma cells, enhancing glucocorticoid effects and killing glucocorticoid-resistant clones (7Krett N.L. Zell J.L. Halgren R.G. Pillay S. Traynor A.E. Rosen S.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1781-1787PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings show that 8-CPT-cAMP and Dex are synergistic in promoting apoptosis in both glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-resistant CEM cells and that these effects correlate with synergistic induction of Bim. Overall, our results are consistent with the conclusion that Bim expression is a convergence point for killing of lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids and agents that elevate cAMP. Increased expression of Bim by 8-CPT-cAMP appears to be a key apoptosis-promoting stimulus in both murine and human lymphoid cells. Bim expression thus appears to be a distal molecular target shared by the cAMP/PKA signaling and glucocorticoid receptor pathways in promoting apoptosis. We thank Dr. E. Brad Thompson for providing CEM cells, Joan Kanter for helpful discussions, and Steven Burch for assistance with manuscript preparation."

We screened a collection of 4825 haploid deletion mutants for their ability to grow at mild alkaline pH, and we identified 118 genes, involved in numerous cellular functions, whose absence results in reduced growth. The list includes several key genes in copper and iron homeostasis, such as CCC2, RCS1, FET3, LYS7, and CTR1. In contrast, a screen of high-copy number plasmid libraries for clones able to increase tolerance to alkaline pH revealed only two genes: FET4 (encoding a low affinity transporter for copper, iron, and zinc) and CTR1 (encoding a high affinity copper transporter). The beneficial effect of overexpression of CTR1 requires a functional high affinity iron transport system, as it was abolished by deletion of FET3, a component of the high affinity transport system, or CCC2, which is required for assembly of the transport system. The growth-promoting effect of FET4 was not modified in these mutants. These results suggest that the observed tolerance to alkaline pH is because of improved iron uptake and indicate that both iron and copper are limiting factors for growth under alkaline pH conditions. Addition to the medium of micromolar concentrations of copper or iron ions drastically improved growth at high pH. Supplementation with iron improved somewhat the tolerance of a fet3 strain but was ineffective in a ctr1 mutant, suggesting the existence of additional copper-requiring functions important for tolerance to an alkaline environment.

Extracellular pH represents one of the most important factors influencing cell physiology and growth. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grows better at acidic pH than in neutral or alkaline media, and maintenance of an acidic environment is mainly based on the activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which actively extrudes protons. Maintenance of a proton gradient is crucial for the uptake of diverse nutrients and cations (1Serrano R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, consequently, even a transient exposure to mild alkaline pH represents a stress situation for S. cerevisiae to which the yeast must adapt to survive and proliferate (3Penalva M.A. Arst Jr., H.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 426-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Adaptation of S. cerevisiae to alkaline pH involves a change in its expression profile.

Different studies identified a common set of induced genes, which include a substantial number of genes relevant for the metabolism of copper and iron cations, such as FRE1, FET3, CTR1, ARN1, ARN3, and others (4Causton H.C.

We utilized two complementary genetic screens to define the mechanisms behind adaptation to an alkaline environment: a search in a systematic deletion mutant library for genes whose absence would increase sensitivity to alkaline pH, and a screen for genes that, in high-copy number, could increase the tolerance to high pH of wild-type yeast. The results of these approaches point to the acquisition of iron and copper as the limiting factors for the growth of yeast cells under such conditions.

Growth was recorded after 24 and 48 h and evaluated visually by two different individuals. Clones that showed weak or no macroscopic growth after 48 h at any of the alkaline pHs tested were considered as positives. These clones were recovered from the original 96-well plates, diluted with YPD up to an A660 of 0.05, and evaluated in duplicate for pH sensitivity by drop test on YPD plates ranging from pH 6.8 to 7.5 (in steps of 0.1–0.2 pH units). The intensity of the phenotype was scored from 1 (the most sensitive) to 5, on the basis of the lowest pH at which the strain showed no or marginal growth after 48 h. In several cases, the mutation conferring sensitivity to alkali was generated in a different wild-type background to confirm the phenotype. Screening for Genes Able to Confer in High-copy Number Tolerance to Alkaline pH—The wild-type strain DBY746 was transformed with two different genomic libraries constructed in the multicopy plasmids YEp24 (a generous gift of Dr. Ramón Serrano, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia) and YEp13 (American Type Culture Collection 37415), respectively. About 48,000 transformants were recovered in plates containing synthetic medium lacking uracil (YEp24) and 100,000 in plates lacking leucine (YEp13). Clones from each library were recovered in 1 ml of selective medium and plated at a density of 4000 clones/plate in YPD plates containing 50 mm TAPS and adjusted with potassium hydroxide at different pHs (10 plates/pH condition) in the range 7.3–7.8. Clones able to form macroscopic colonies after 3 days in the plates at pH 7.6–7.8, in which cells carrying an empty plasmid were unable to grow, were considered as positive. The gene FET4 was isolated from the genomic clone B6 by digestion with HindIII and XhoI and ligation of the resulting 3.4 kbp fragment (which contains the entire open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 1117 bp of 5′ region and 610 bp of 3′ region) into the HindIII and SalI sites of plasmid YEplac195 (12Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar), to produce plasmid pFET4. The same strategy with clone 2.1.2 produced pFET4-s, which contains only 442 bp of 5′ promoter sequence. The gene CTR1 was recovered from clone B15 as a 2.7-kbp EcoRV fragment containing the entire ORF flanked by 1040 bp 5′ and 378 bp 3′ regions, respectively, and cloned into the SmaI site of YEplac195. Other Techniques—Growth in plates and liquid medium at high pH was monitored essentially as described previously (6Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All pH values were determined after autoclaving the medium, and pH of the plates was measured using a surface electrode. When metal ions were added, cells were resuspended at an A620 of 0.002 in liquid YPD medium buffered at the appropriate pH and supplemented from a freshly prepared 25-fold concentrated solution of the desired salt: (NH4)2Fe-(SO4)2·6H2O for iron; CuSO4·5H2O for copper; and ZnSO4·7H2O for zinc. Addition of the salts did not affect the pH of the medium. Screening of a Systematic Deletion Mutant Library for Mutations that Confer Sensitivity to Alkaline Conditions—To identify mutations that would confer a growth defect under alkaline conditions, a library of 4825 haploid deletion mutants was arrayed at a density of 384 clones/plate on YPD plates buffered at pH 6.2 (standard growth conditions), 7.2, and 7.5 (alkaline conditions) and visually screened for formation of macroscopic colonies after 48 h. More than 300 clones that showed reduced or no growth under alkaline conditions were subjected to a more detailed test by growing dilutions of the cultures at a range of pHs (6.2, 6.8, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.5). The final output of the screen was the identification of 118 genes whose deletion confers sensitivity to alkaline pH. The degree of sensitivity varied greatly, and it was quantified, according to the lowest pH able to severely impair growth, from 1 (the highest sensitivity) to 5 (only slightly more sensitive than the isogenic wild-type strain). We found genes involved in a variety of cellular processes, in many cases not previously related to pH tolerance (Table I), suggesting that many different aspects of the yeast biology could be compromised and become limiting for growth in an alkaline environment. Although a detailed analysis of all of them is beyond the scope of this work, it is worth noting that we were able to identify in our screening a large number of genes (24Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) involved in vacuolar organization and biogenesis, including most of the components of the hydrogen-exporting vacuolar ATPase complex. A significant number of mutations in genes relevant for sterol metabolisms, such as ERG2, ERG6, and ARV1, and response to phosphate starvation (PHO2, PHO81, PHO85) were also identified. Further examination of a set of mutants defective in phosphate response indicated that the pho4 mutant and, particularly, a pho84 pho89 strain, lacking high affinity phosphate uptake, were also sensitive to high pH (not shown). In addition, our screen detected quite a few mutants for genes related to different aspects of iron and copper homeostasis: FET3 and CTR1, responsible for the high affinity uptake of copper and iron, respectively; LYS7 and CCC2, which are intracellular copper transporters; RCS1/AFT1, a transcription factor responsible for induction of a set of genes under iron starvation; or SOD1, a copper and zinc superoxide dismutase. This led us to evaluate the relative impact of alkaline pH in the growth of a set of mutants related to copper and iron metabolism. As can be observed in Fig. 1, ctr1, rcs1, sod1, and lys7 account for the most dramatic effect among the mutants tested. We also observed a slight growth defect in ftr1 and fet4 mutants, which was unnoticed under the conditions of the original screening.Table IMutations that result in growth defect under alkaline conditions.FunctionAlkaline pH sensitive mutantsVacuole organization and biogenesisCUP5 (1), TFP1 (1), VMA2 (1), VMA22 (1), VMA4 (1), VMA5 (1), VMA6 (1), VMA7 (1), CWH36 (1), VMA21 (2), PEP3 (2), PEP5 (2), PPA1 (2), TFP3 (2), VMA13 (2), VPS16 (2), VPS33 (2), VPS34 (2), ARP5 (3), VPS15 (3), FAB1 (4), PEP7 (4), VMA8 (4), VPS65 (5)Transport in other organellesGCS1 (3), SEC22 (3), DRS2 (3), VPS20 (4), GLO3 (4), COG8 (4), SYS1 (4)Metal ion homeostasisCTR1 (1), RCS1 (1), SOD1 (1), LYS7 (2), SOD2 (2), CCC2 (4), FET3 (4), PMR1 (4)MetabolismAminoacid metabolismGLY1 (1), PHO2 (1), PRO1 (1), CYS3 (3), ARO2 (4), ILV1 (4), TYR1 (5)Lipid metabolismERG2 (2), ERG6 (2), ARV1 (3), BTS1 (3), AGP2 (4), DAP1 (4), FEN1 (4), MGA2 (4)Phosphate metabolismPHO4 (2), PHO81 (2), PHO85 (3)Protein biosynthesisTEF4 (3), FES1 (4), HCR1 (4), RPL13B (4), RPL27A (4)Cell polarity, cell wall organization and biogenesisRHO4 (1), BUD25 (1), BEM1 (2), GAS1 (2), SLT2 (2), BCK1 (3), BEM4 (4), CNB1 (5)Chromatin modification, architecture & transcriptionSWI3 (1), BUR2 (3), DAL81 (3), GCN5 (3), HTZ1 (3), REF2 (3), REG1 (3), RPB9 (3), SPT20 (3), SSN8 (3), UME6 (3), ADA2 (4), KEM1 (4), MED2 (4), SPC72 (4), SRB5 (4), SWI4 (4), TOP1 (4), MRS1 (5)OthersPHO86 (1), KEX2 (1), RIB4 (1), DIA2 (2), SPS1 (2), FYV6 (3), MAP1 (3), TPD3 (3), ADE12 (4), ATP1 (4), ATP11 (4), NEM1 (4), PTC1 (4), URE2 (4), ZWF1 (4), COX16 (5), RIB1 (5), SCP160 (5)UnknownYEL045C (1), YKL118W (1), YOR331C (1), YJL175W (3), HUR1 (4), ILM1 (4), PKR1 (4), YLR358C (4), YJR018W (5), YOR251C (5), YOR305W (5) Open table in a new tab FET4 and CTR1 Are the Only Genes Whose Overexpression Is Able to Improve Growth under Alkaline pH—The result of the screen revealed that alteration of many different functions could impair the ability of yeast cells to adapt to alkaline conditions. To elucidate which of those functions could represent a limiting factor for growth at alkaline pH, we identified genes that, when overexpressed, would confer to wild-type yeast strain the ability to growth at high pH. A first screen was performed by plating about 40,000 clones transformed with a genomic library in the high-copy number YEp24 vector. 71 positive clones were obtained; 30 of those clones were retested for pH tolerance, and then the plasmid was subsequently recovered. Restriction mapping of the inserts revealed that they corresponded only to two different genomic regions that appeared roughly at 50% frequency and are represented by clones B6 and B15 (Fig. 2). A second screen was performed using a different genomic library. An equivalent number of clones were plated, and a total number of 46 putative positives were recovered. Upon analysis of the plasmids, two different genomic regions, represented in Fig. 2 as clones 2.1.2 and 5.3.4, were identified. Comparison of all four clones clearly showed that clones B6 and 2.1.2 define overlapping genomic regions, having in common the FET4 ORF, whereas clones B15 and 5.3.4 share the CTR1 ORF. This evidence suggested that the CTR1 and FET4 genes were responsible for the alkaline tolerance phenotype. Subcloning of the appropriate regions in the YEplac195 plasmid allowed confirmation of this hypothesis (Fig. 2). Simultaneous high-copy number expression of both genes did not result in increased tolerance to alkaline pH (not shown). As observed, FET4 was somewhat less effective than CTR1 in increasing pH tolerance. However, a version of FET4 (pFET-s) that lacks five of the six sequences required for inhibition by the Rox1 repressor (13Waters B.M. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33749-33757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was as effective as CTR1 (not shown). Therefore, the observed difference could be the result of a different level of expression. The Tolerance Conferred by Overexpression of CTR1 Requires a Functional Fet3 Protein—As mentioned above, CTR1 encodes a high-affinity (Km 1–4 μm) plasma membrane copper transporter (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), whereas FET4 codes for a low affinity (Km around 35 μm), broad specificity plasma membrane transporter that is able to mediate uptake of iron, copper, and other metal cations (17Dix D.R.

Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, uptake of copper seems to be the common characteristic for both gene products. However, it is known that high affinity uptake of iron, mediated by the Fet3 oxidase-Ftr1 permease complex, requires an efficient uptake of copper (16Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that the tolerance conferred by overexpression of CTR1 could be because of a secondary effect resulting from improved uptake of iron. To test this possibility, we overexpressed CTR1 and FET4 in strains lacking FET3, as well as in ccc2 mutants devoid of the protein that delivers copper to Fet3 (22Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and in atx1 mutants, which lack a metallochaperone that provides copper to Ccc2 (24Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L.

Fig. 3 shows a schematic depiction of the functional relationship between these proteins. Overexpression of FET4 was able to improve growth at alkaline pH in all of these mutants with the same efficiency as in a wild-type strain (Fig. 3). In contrast, expression of CTR1 in cells lacking Fet3 or Ccc2 did not increase tolerance. This result suggests that the beneficial effect of CTR1 is mainly because of an improved iron uptake. Expression of the copper transporter was able to increase somewhat the tolerance of an atx1 strain. This observation is consistent with the existence of a Atx1-independent way to furnish Ccc2 with copper (24Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The finding that expression of the metal transporters Fet4 and Ctr1 were able to improve growth at alkaline pH suggests that the availability of copper and/or iron may be limiting factors for the growth of yeast cells in an alkaline ambient. This is consistent with the increased expression of genes responsible for uptake and utilization of these metals when cells are grown in an alkaline ambient (4Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 5Lamb T.M. Xu W. Diamond A.

Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Supplementation of the Medium with Copper or Iron Ions Increases Tolerance to Alkaline pH—To test the possibility that lack of copper and/or iron may be responsible for failure to grow at high pH, we carried out a set of experiments in which the medium was supplemented with these transition metals. Addition of copper in the low micromolar range (1–10 μm) was able to dramatically improve the growth of a wild-type strain at alkaline pH (Fig. 4). Supplementation of media with iron had a similar effect, although higher concentrations were needed (5–50 μm). Addition of both copper and iron had a synergistic effect as, at a concentration of 5 μm copper, the presence of very low concentrations of iron were sufficient to allow maximal growth at the pH tested. Addition of zinc cations, also transported by FET4, did not confer tolerance at all of the concentrations tested (1–100 μm). To gain insight into the role of copper and iron ions under alkaline conditions, we tested the effect of supplementation of these cations in strains lacking specific components of their uptake and transport pathways. The addition of copper improved the growth of an atx1 mutant but was completely ineffective in fet3 or ccc2 cells (Fig. 5, upper panel). These results support the view that increased copper improves growth at alkaline pH by increasing uptake of iron. Supplementation with iron (Fig. 5, lower panel) significantly improved the growth of the atx1 strain and, when added at high concentrations (75–100 μm), allowed growth of fet3 and ccc2 cells with equal efficiency. Addition of copper at relatively low concentrations was sufficient to sustain growth of a fet4-null mutant but, as expected, did not allow growth of a ctr1 strain (Fig. 5, lower panel). Although iron was sufficient to promote growth of the fet3 strain (although relatively high concentrations were needed), the ctr1 mutant did not grow even at the higher concentration of iron tested. This suggests that copper is required at alkaline pH not only to mediate an efficient iron uptake, but also to fulfill other physiological roles. Growth at alkaline pH requires a number of physiological adaptations. We present evidence that the availability of copper and iron is a key factor limiting growth of baker's yeast in an alkaline environment. A genome-wide analysis identified a rather large number of genes required for growth at alkaline pH, pointing to a variety of functions as possibly limiting factors for growth at high pH. For instance, mutation of several genes related to response to phosphate starvation resulted in sensitivity to alkali. As exposure to high pH results in a dramatic increase in the transcriptional response of genes required for efficient uptake and metabolism of phosphate (4Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T.

Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to consider the lack of available phosphate as a possible limiting factor for growth. Among the mutations conferring a severe sensitivity to alkali, we found genes required for the efficient uptake of iron and copper. Iron and copper are transition metals involved in redox reactions that are essential for all eukaryotes, but whose intracellular concentrations must be carefully monitored, as they are potentially toxic (26Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). High affinity copper uptake is mediated by the products of the CTR1 and CTR3 genes (15Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Low affinity copper uptake can be mediated by a number of membrane transporters, including Fet4, which transports with similar affinity iron, as well as zinc, cadmium, and other cations (17Dix D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2007152413,"Previous electron microscopic studies of bacterial RCLH1 complexes demonstrated both circular and elliptical conformations of the LH1 ring, and this implied flexibility has been suggested to allow passage of quinol from the QB site of the RC to the quinone pool prior to reduction of the cytochrome bc1 complex. We have used atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that these are just two of many conformations for the LH1 ring, which displays large molecule-to-molecule variations, in terms of both shape and size. This atomic force microscope study has used a mutant lacking the reaction center complex, which normally sits within the LH1 ring providing a barrier to substantial changes in shape. This approach has revealed the inherent flexibility and lack of structural coherence of this complex in a reconstituted lipid bilayer at room temperature. Circular, elliptical, and even polygonal ring shapes as well as arcs and open rings have been observed for LH1; in contrast, no such variations in structure were observed for the LH2 complex under the same conditions. The basis for these differences between LH1 and LH2 is suggested to be the H-bonding patterns that stabilize binding of the bacteriochlorophylls to the LH polypeptides. The existence of open rings and arcs provides a direct visualization of the consequences of the relatively weak associations that govern the aggregation of the protomers (α1β1Bchl2) comprising the LH1 complex. The demonstration that the linkage between adjacent protomer units is flexible and can even be uncoupled at room temperature in a detergent-free membrane bilayer provides a rationale for the dynamic separation of individual protomers, and we may now envisage experiments that seek to prove this active opening process.

In the purple photosynthetic bacteria, the reaction center, which is the site of photochemistry, receives excitation energy from the light harvesting LH1 complex, which receives energy in turn from the LH2 complex (reviewed in Ref. 1Blankenship R.E.

The LH2α polypeptides formed an inner ring, with the β ring outermost; in all, 27 bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) molecules are bound to this structure (2McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A.

More recent work has established that LH1 surrounds the RC using an arrangement of 16 αβ protomers and 32 Bchls (4Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A.

In other bacteria, an LH1 ring of 15 αβ protomers, together with either PufX or a putative PufX homologue (W), form a continuous ring of protein around the RC (5Roszak A.W. Howard T.D. Southall J.

The demonstration of both circular and elliptical forms of this LH1 complex provided evidence for its flexibility (4Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This property of the LH1 complex was suggested to be a significant factor in the export of quinol, the product of RC photochemistry, to the cytochrome bc1 complex (4Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For organisms such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, which assemble an (αβ)16 LH1 complex completely enclosing the RC, such flexibility would clearly be an essential feature of this LH complex and would imply a dynamic series of conformations in vivo. However, only the extremes of this dynamic population have been reported, and the flexibility hypothesis requires the imaging of several conformations at room temperature. For other photosynthetic bacteria such as R. sphaeroides, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris other possibilities for quinol export became apparent when it was found that these bacteria assemble another polypeptide, PufX (W), into the LH1 complex. It was discovered that puf X- mutants were unable to photosynthesize (7Farchaus J.W. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Farchaus J.W. Barz W.P. Grunberg H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was suggested that PufX forms part of the LH1 ring, providing a portal for quinol (11Cogdell R.J. Fyfe P.K.

This concept would seem to be supported by work on mutants with an LH1 complex that is too small to completely surround the RC; these mutants can, therefore, allow free movement of quinones/quinols to the RC QB site, and so they are fully capable of photosynthetic growth, even in the absence of PufX (12McGlynn P. Hunter C.N. Jones M.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Studies on RC-LH1-PufX complexes in native membranes show that PufX causes a specific orientation of the RC, which is the likely cause of the long range organization of the core complexes (6Siebert C.A.

It is not known whether the LH1 complex of R. sphaeroides is flexible, and if so, to what extent; perhaps there is no need if PufX does indeed provide a quinol portal. In terms of LH1 flexibility, we are confined at present to the knowledge, based upon cryo-electron microscopy studies of two-dimensional crystals, that the R. rubrum LH1 complex lacking PufX can assume both circular and elliptical forms. This observation is subject to the limitations that the crystals are frozen in glucose at ∼77 K and that LH1 molecules in disordered regions will not be represented. The use of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to image the surface of two-dimensional crystals presents us with the opportunity to obtain high signal-to-noise data without the need for processing the data, and particularly without the need to obtain large, highly ordered crystals. Previous studies have amply illustrated the usefulness of AFM for imaging two-dimensional crystals of the LH2 complexes of Rubrivivax gelatinosus (16Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J.L. Ranck J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), R. sphaeroides (17Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and R. acidophila (18Stamouli A. Kafi S. Klein D.C.G. Oosterkamp T.H. Frenken J.W.M. Cogdell R.J. Aartsma T.J. Biophys.

S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) achieved the imaging of native membranes of Blastochloris viridis containing RC-LH1 complexes by AFM and were able to show that LH1 formed an ellipse round the RC, but that it became circular upon removal of the RC. In view of the possible functional significance of alterations in conformation of the LH1 ring, it is important to visualize all of the possible shapes and aggregation states of which LH1 is capable. This should be compared with the peripheral LH2 complex, using the same methodology. Scheuring et al. (17Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have extensively characterized large planar two-dimensional crystals of the LH2 complex from R. sphaeroides by AFM. In our work, we have examined different crystal forms of the LH2 complex, to establish whether alterations in crystal packing produce distortions of the LH2 complex. In this regard, it is already known that lateral packing forces exerted in two-dimensional crystals can distort RC-LH1 complexes into circles or ellipses, depending on whether the crystal form is tetragonal or orthorhombic, respectively (4Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, high-resolution AFM was used to image two-dimensional crystals of the RCLH1 complex of R. rubrum (20Fotiadis D. Qian P. Pilippsen A. Bullough P.A. Engel A. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2063-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was shown that the RC-LH1 complex may adopt an irregular shape in regions of uneven packing forces in the crystal, reflecting a likely flexibility when in the natural membrane. This study also imaged a few LH1-only complexes, formed as a consequence of removing the RC with the AFM tip, which showed some of the possibilities for distorting this complex. To examine this in more detail, it is important to obtain images of many LH1 complexes free of the RC; it is only then that the inherent flexibility and even deformability of LH1 will be revealed, because the RC, which sits fairly tightly within the LH1 ring, normally provides a barrier to substantial deformation. We have used AFM to compare two-dimensional crystals of LH1 and of LH2 of R. sphaeroides. We find that the LH2 crystals have three different packing forms and despite the differing packing forces, the complexes are essentially always circular. In contrast, LH1 molecules displayed a wide range of both ring sizes and packing geometries that generated circular, elliptical, and even polygonal ring shapes as well as arcs and open rings. From these data, we conclude that the LH1 ring is intrinsically highly deformable, and we relate this property to the manner in which it is assembled and further to its operation within the photosynthetic unit. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) except the detergent β-OG (n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside), which was obtained from Calbiochem (Merck Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) and the lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), which was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All chemicals were of Analar or equivalent grade. Strains and Plasmids—The R. sphaeroides strains used have all been described previously: DD13, LH2- LH1- RC- (21Jones M.R. Fowler G.J.S.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The LH2-only strain DPF2 was grown semi-aerobically, and the intracytoplasmic membranes were prepared according to the methods in Olsen et al. (23Olsen J.D. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRKEK1 was introduced into the double-deletion strain DD13 by conjugative transfer. Colonies were examined for the presence of the LH1 wild-type complex using a Guided Wave 260 fiber-optic spectrophotometer and a home-built plate holder. Representative colonies were then grown semi-aerobically in liquid culture, and intracytoplasmic membranes were isolated as described previously (23Olsen J.D. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that in this work we used a lower growth temperature of 30 °C and then concentrated the membranes by centrifugation at 186,000 × g for 4.5 h after diluting the sucrose present to less than 5%, prior to LH purification. Two-dimensional Crystallization—LH2 was purified and crystallized as described in Waltz et al. (3Walz T. Jamieson S.J. Bowers C.M. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For LH1, ∼500 absorbance units of concentrated LH1-only membrane sample were solubilized with 1.5 ml of 20% β-OG with gentle stirring at 10 °C and then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 15-ml DEAE column. The column was washed for an hour at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% β-OG, then eluted with a 155-400 mm NaCl salt gradient over 60 min at 1 ml/min. The best fractions were determined by the ratio of the absorbance at ∼850 nm versus 280 nm, and these were used for two-dimensional crystallization trials using the lipid DOPC. Atomic Force Microscopy and Image Processing—Muscovite mica purchased from Ted Pella (Redding, CA) was chosen as a support for the samples. For AFM measurements, the sample of LH2 crystals was prepared by adsorbing 1 μl of sample solution onto the surface of freshly cleaved mica for ∼30 s, then the sample was immersed into the distilled and filtered water for 1 min to remove weakly bound crystal patches. The sample was immediately placed onto the AFM stage, and 300 μl of recording buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl) was added to the liquid cell. For firm attachment of LH1 crystals, the adsorption buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2) was applied, and the adsorption time was increased to 1 h. The imaging buffer used was the same as for the LH2 crystals. For the experiments, a home-built stand-alone AFM was employed (24van der Werf K.O. Putman C.A.J. de Grooth B.G. Segerink F.B. Schipper E.H. van Hulst N.F. Greve J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 2892-2897Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Standard silicon nitride cantilevers with a length of 85 μm, force constant of 0.5 N·m, and operating frequencies of 25-35 kHz (in liquid) purchased from ThermoMicroscopes (Sunnyvale, CA) were used. High-resolution AFM images were obtained using tapping mode in liquid with a free amplitude of 2-5 nm; the amplitude setpoint was adjusted to minimal forces (damping of the free amplitude was 10-20%). Images contained 256 × 256 pixels and were recorded at a line frequency of 2-4 Hz. The calibration of the setup was made with UltraSharp Calibration Gratings from NT-MDT (Moscow, Russia). Topographical images were quantitatively analyzed by means of Scanning Probe image processor program (Image Metrology ApS, Lyngby, Denmark). All the images presented here were processed by applying a low-pass filter and are represented in three-dimensional view, unless otherwise specified. Morphology of Two-dimensional Crystals Formed from LH1 Complexes: Comparison with LH2 Crystals—The “empty” LH1 complex containing no RC formed a homogeneous population of planar single-layered crystals between 100 and 700 nm in width (an example of a crystal ∼300 nm in diameter is shown in Fig. 1A). The height of the crystals above the mica surface was 6.7 ± 0.4 nm, (n = 81; Table I, supplemental material). Most of the LH1 crystals displayed dense packing of LH1 complexes, whereas some of the crystals also contained empty areas of lipid bilayer with an average height above the mica surface of 4.1 ± 0.2 nm, n = 20 (Table I, supplemental material). In contrast, tubular crystals (Fig. 1B) were found most frequently for the LH2 complex, some of which had ruptured, forming single-layered sheets up to 1 μm wide. Intact tubes could be distinguished from the single-layered sheets (open tubes) also by analyzing their average height above the mica surface. The height histogram of the accumulated data showed two peaks in the height distribution, 7.2 ± 3.2 nm and 16 ± 2.4 nm (n = 62), corresponding to single-layered sheets and double-layered intact tubular crystals, respectively. Empty lipid patches were also observed for LH2 crystals, with an average height of 4.1 ± 0.1 nm (n = 16), which corresponds well with the number obtained from the analysis of LH1 crystals. Vesicular LH2 crystals (Fig. 1C) were observed less frequently and consisted of small round patches (average diameter ∼ 200 nm). The average height of the vesicular two-dimensional crystals was 15.9 ± 0.8 nm (n = 11). Variations in Packing in Two-dimensional Crystals—The different packing arrangements of LH1-only complexes are shown in Fig. 2, A and B). No long range crystalline ordering was observed for LH1, unlike the situation for LH2 (Fig. 3; Refs. 3Walz T. Jamieson S.J. Bowers C.M. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar and 17Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In rare cases, LH1 rings formed small areas of well ordered crystalline lattices with a tentative assignment of hexagonal packing (Fig. 2A). This could only be observed in vesicles of larger than average size, i.e. more than 500 nm. This ordering was also accompanied by a marked preference for a single orientation, as determined by the height of the protruding face of the complex (see Table II, Supplemental material). The majority of LH1 rings (86%) were positioned in the lipid membrane in the “down” orientation, characterized by a height from the lipid surface to the highest point of LH1 of 0.8 ± 0.1 nm (n = 261). In the opposite orientation, this height is 1.4 ± 0.1 nm (n = 43). It should be emphasized that LH1 rings, which tended to be circular in the well ordered areas of crystals (see Fig. 2A), still displayed some heterogeneity in size. For example, the left and right arrows in Fig. 2A indicate ring sizes of 12.6 and 14.1 nm, respectively. The high level of disorder of LH1 aggregates typified by Fig. 2B was accompanied by heterogeneity of the LH1 complexes in terms of differing ring sizes, with each size category displaying at least two different shapes. Broken rings and also incomplete arcs were found.Fig. 3LH2 crystals displaying three types of periodicity. A, type A (zigzag): frame size, 200 × 200 nm2; full gray-scale, 1.8 nm. B, type B (rectangular): frame size, 200 × 200 nm2; full gray-scale, 2.4 nm. C, type C (disordered): frame size, 200 × 200 nm2; full gray-scale, 4.8 nm. D, an LH2 crystal displaying the co-existence of all three types of periodicity: frame size, 500 × 500 nm2; full gray-scale, 10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Crystalline packing of LH2 complexes was clearly resolved, and AFM images indicated that this fell into three categories; type A, a zigzag pattern; type B, a rectangular pattern; and type C, disordered. These are displayed separately in Fig. 3; in Fig. 3D, it can be seen that all three types of packing could be found within one crystal. A Fourier transform of AFM images of type A crystals directly allowed the definition of a unit cell (a = 19.9 nm, b = 15.9 nm, γ = 87°). The unit cell encompasses four LH2 rings, two facing upwards and two downwards, which are clearly resolved. One face of the complex protrudes more than the other; the height from the lipid surface to the extremity of LH2 (“up”) was 1.0 ± 0.1 nm (n = 105), and in the opposite orientation (“down”), this was 0.5 ± 0.1 nm (n = 96). This up-down configuration has been reported before from two-dimensional EM data (3Walz T. Jamieson S.J. Bowers C.M. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and from subsequent AFM studies on LH2 two-dimensional-crystals (16Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J.L. Ranck J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The primary difference between type B and type A crystal packing is that in the former, there is no close contact between adjacent up rings in the unit cell, whereas in type A, they are brought together very closely. Type C crystals do not show any distinct periodical pattern (Fig. 3C), as the LH2 complexes are incorporated into the lipid bilayer in a random, chaotic way. We could not resolve any up-down configuration in this case, but the distance between the up LH2 molecules provides enough space for oppositely oriented rings. Detailed Characteristics of LH1 and LH2 Rings—Fig. 4A shows a high-resolution image of LH1 complexes embedded in a representative, disordered two-dimensional crystal. LH1 complexes displayed a high level of heterogeneity in shapes, sizes, and conformation. In contrast, LH2 complexes showed no such heterogeneity. Fig. 4, B and C show high magnification images of LH2 rings. The most noteworthy finding was that under no circumstances, not even for disordered regions of two-dimensional crystals, did the LH2 complex display the heterogeneity in size and shape we observed for LH1. Regardless of the type of packing or disorder, all LH2 rings appear to be circular and of identical diameter, within experimental error. The average height of strongly protruding (up) and weakly protruding (down) LH2 complexes above the plane of the lipid bilayer was 1.0 and 0.5 nm, respectively. This result is in agreement with the data of Scheuring et al. (17Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) on the same complex. From this we conclude that strongly protruded rings correspond to the periplasmic side of the LH2 complex. Without the use of single-particle averaging methods, we found that in some of the LH2 rings, the resolution was high enough to count the number of units per LH2 ring, which was nine. A Variety in Shapes, Sizes, and Conformation for LH1 Complexes—The variety of types of LH1 complex imaged by AFM could be observed from our analysis of ∼300 individual LH1 complexes from ∼10 different membrane patches. An overview of the variation in LH1 complexes is represented in Fig. 5. Circles (Fig. 5, A-C), polygonal rings (Fig. 5D), open rings (Fig. 5E), ellipses (Fig. 5, F-H), and more anomalous structures such as arcs (Fig. 5, I and J) were all observed. Polygonal rings are deformed rings, in which circular or elliptical ring architectures were considerably distorted. The ellipses and circles formed the two major groups, comprising 41 and 35% of the total number of complexes, respectively. Polygonal and open rings were observed less frequently, at 19 and 5%, respectively. The differing ring sizes observed for LH1 had outer diameters of 11.6 ± 0.5 nm, 12.6 ± 0.5 nm, and 14.5 ± 0.8 nm, which are hereafter referred to as small, medium, and large. In the circular LH1 rings, the percentage of small rings (Fig. 5A) was 14%, medium rings (Fig. 5B) were 64%, and large rings (Fig. 5C) were 22%. Using the known size of the αβ-protomer, we suggest that the small rings contain 15 subunits, the medium contain 16, and the large contain 18 subunits. For ellipses, the occurrence of small, medium, and large (Fig. 5, F-H) was 24, 45, and 31%, respectively. The circularity of some of the LH1 complexes was confirmed by the practically equal diameters for two orthogonal directions. For the elliptical complexes, the ratio between short (b) and long (a) axes was found to vary slightly for different sizes: small ellipses, b/a = 0.75; medium and large ellipses, b/a = 0.8. Table II in the supplemental material details other parameters that were measured for LH1 complexes. The height of weakly protruded LH1 rings above the lipid bilayer was 0.8 nm, which is similar to the height of empty LH1 rings on the periplasmic side for the B. viridis complex (19Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The height of stronger protrusions of the LH1 complexes observed here and ascribed to the cytoplasmic face of the complex was 1.4 nm. The inner diameters of cytoplasmic and periplasmic faces of the small rings were 6.1 and 6.6 nm, respectively, medium rings were 6.5 and 7.3 nm, respectively, and large rings were 7.6 and 9 nm, respectively. Thus, in each case the inner diameter of the strongly protruding cytoplasmic surface of the LH1 rings is noticeably smaller than that of the weakly protruding periplasmic surface. The flexibility, which has been suggested to be a functionally essential property of the LH1 complex, would require a dynamic series of conformations in vivo. We have used AFM to examine a population of LH1 molecules in a membrane environment at room temperature. Our work highlights the extraordinary variety of shapes and sizes exhibited by the isolated LH1 complex. This variety has not been visualized directly before by AFM, because previous studies have concentrated on the RC-LH1 complex, either in native membranes of B. viridis (19Scheuring S. Seguin J.

The Azotobacter vinelandii NifU protein is an ∼60-kDa homodimer proposed to provide a molecular scaffold for formation of [Fe-S] clusters or Fe-S cluster precursors required for full activation of the nitrogenase catalytic components (1Fu W.

Primary sequence comparisons among NifU homologs indicate that it is a modular protein having three distinct domains (3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J.

The N-terminal domain includes three cysteine residues conserved among all known NifU and NifU-like proteins. Incubation of the recombinantly expressed NifU N-terminal domain with NifS (a cysteine desulfurase), l-cysteine, and Fe2+ results in formation of labile [2Fe-2S] clusters on the NifU fragment, providing evidence that this domain could provide a scaffold for assembly of “transient” [Fe-S] clusters destined for nitrogenase activation (2Yuvaniyama P.

In support of this hypothesis biochemical and genetic studies established that individual substitution of any of the three cysteine residues contained in the N-terminal domain of NifU impaired but did not eliminate the physiological maturation of the nitrogenase component proteins (3Agar J.N.

The IscS and IscU proteins together with a suite of other proteins, IscA, HscB, HscA, and Fdx, whose corresponding genes are clustered on both the A. vinelandii and Escherichia coli genomes, have been shown by genetic experiments using E. coli to be involved in the maturation of a variety of Fe-S cluster-containing proteins involved in intermediary metabolism, such as aconitase and glutamate synthase (8Schwartz C.J.

In the case of A. vinelandii, the iscSUAhscBAfdx gene cluster cannot be deleted because this gene cluster is essential under growth conditions for which the nif-specific genes are either expressed or not expressed (5Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Thus, under nitrogen fixing conditions NifU is apparently unable to effectively substitute for IscU function. Similarly, NifU deletion strains are severely impaired in their capacity for diazotrophic growth, indicating that IscU cannot effectively replace the function of NifU (12Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, the iscSUAhscBAfdx genes are not essential in E. coli because there is some redundant function provided by another [Fe-S] cluster assembly apparatus encoded by sufABCDSE. Elegant genetic studies have demonstrated that the E. coli iscSUAhscBAfdx genes are essential in the absence of sufABCDS and vice versa (13Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although the A. vinelandii genome encodes proteins homologous to SufSE, recently shown to encode a two-component cysteine desulfurase (14Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Lascoux D. Loiseau L. Barras F.

The central domain of NifU contains four conserved cysteines that have been shown to coordinate one redox-active [2Fe-2S]2+/1+ cluster per each NifU subunit (3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These clusters have been provisionally designated “permanent” clusters because they do not appear to be precursors destined for nitrogenase maturation. Rather, it has been proposed that these clusters could have a redox function or some other role related to the physiological formation or release of transient clusters assembled on the N-terminal domain (2Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In line with this hypothesis substitution of any of these cysteine residues also results in a decreased capacity of A. vinelandii for diazotrophic growth. The C-terminal domain of NifU contains two conserved cysteine residues, and previous mutagenesis studies demonstrated that they could be substituted by alanine, with no apparent affect on the physiological maturation of nitrogenase (3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, small proteins exhibiting significant sequence similarity to the C-terminal domain of NifU, including conservation of the two cysteine residues, have been shown capable of providing in vitro templates for the assembly of labile [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters (17Tong W.H.

These results suggest that the C-terminal NifU domain might provide a second transient cluster assembly site and could explain why strains deleted for nifU are severely impaired in their capacity for diazotrophic growth, whereas strains individually substituted for cysteines contained in the N-terminal module remain capable of significant diazotrophic growth. In the present work complementary biochemical and genetic experiments were performed to examine the functional significance of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of NifU in nitrogenase maturation. Toward this end, the capacity for diazotrophic growth of mutant strains having various combinations of alanine substitutions for conserved cysteines located within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains was examined. Furthermore, an effective method for NifU-directed in vitro activation of an apo form of the nitrogenase Fe protein was developed, and the capacity for in vitro activation of apo-Fe protein using altered forms of NifU having various combinations of alanine substitutions for conserved cysteines located within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains was also examined. Recombinant plasmids (pDB42 and pDB133) that contain A. vinelandii nifU and nifS genes (21Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to construct plasmids for heterologous expression in E. coli or for mutagenesis of genomically expressed NifU or NifS. Mutagenesis was performed using a commercial kit (GeneEditor, Promega), and nucleotide sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analyses performed by the Virginia Tech sequencing service. For heterologous expression of nifU and nifS an ∼6.5-kilobase PciI-BamHI restriction enzyme-generated DNA fragment was cloned into the pAra13 expression vector (22Cagnon C. Valverde V. Masson J.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and digested with NcoI and BglII to create pDB1284. This procedure places expression of nifU and downstream genes under the control of the ara transcriptional and translational elements. In addition to nifU and nifS, pDB1284 contains nifUS-VWZM, which was excised by XhoI digestion and religation to create pDB1289. Plasmid pDB1289 and its derivatives, created by site-directed mutagenesis, were used for the heterologous expression of nifU and nifS for biochemical experiments. Plasmid pDB551 (23Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) was used for heterologous expression of nifS in the absence of nifU. A version of a nifUS expression plasmid for which eight histidine codons were placed between nifS codons 396 and 397 was constructed by inserting a synthetic DNA fragment into the unique StuI restriction site of pDB1289. For the construction of mutant A. vinelandii strains, the appropriate plasmids were used in DNA transformation experiments, resulting in double-reciprocal recombination between the genome and the plasmid vector as previously described in detail (12Jacobson M.R.

Plasmids used in this work are not capable of autonomous replication in A. vinelandii, and they are listed in Table I. A. vinelandii cells were cultured in a defined minimal medium without the addition of a fixed nitrogen source (24Strandberg G.W. Wilson P.W. Can. J.

The various recombinant plasmids used for heterologous expression were derived from pAra-13, as described above. For the individual expression of nifS, a previously described plasmid (pDB551 (23Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar)) was used that places the control of nifS expression under control of the T7 promoter. For these experiments pT7-7 was the vector, and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as the host. For heterologous expression cells harboring the appropriate plasmid were cultured in 2-liter flasks containing 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 mg of ampicillin in a reciprocal shaker at 30 °C/300 rpm until they reached 160–180 Klett (Red filter). Expression of cloned nif genes was induced by the addition of 1.5 g of arabinose or 5 g of lactose, depending on the expression system used. After induction cells were cultured for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen at-20 °C until used. NifU and NifS Purification—All protein manipulations were performed under anoxic conditions maintained using either Schlenk lines or a Coy anaerobic chamber containing 3% hydrogen gas balanced with nitrogen gas. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for each gram of cells (wet weight), and crude extracts prepared by sonication followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 1.5 × 15-cm Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The loaded column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and a linear gradient of 150 ml (0.1–0.7 m NaCl) was then applied. Partially purified NifU or NifU and NifS were eluted around 0.5 m NaCl and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. NifS purification was performed as previously described (23Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Individually purified NifU or NifS samples were quantified using the biuret method (25Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas the amount of NifU and NifS in partially purified samples was estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) using highly purified NifU and NifS as standards. [Fe-S] Cluster Assembly—Each 5-ml [Fe-S] cluster assembly mixture included a 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) that contained 50 μm NifU, 50 μm NifS, 0.5 mm l-cysteine, 2 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and ∼200 mm NaCl. For control experiments described in the text and in Table II, NifU, NifS, Fe2+, or l-cysteine was omitted from the assembly mixture, or an altered form of NifS having the active site cysteine-325 residue substituted by alanine was used. Other experiments, also described in the text and in Fig. 3, involved using various altered forms of NifU having one or more cysteine residues substituted by alanine. All assembly reactions were incubated on ice for 1 h and then applied to a mixed bed chromatography column containing 1 × 1.5 cm uncharged chelating Sepharose (Pharmacia) and 1 × 3 cm Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, Tris-HCl (pH7.4) buffer. After loading, the sample was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, which removes unreacted l-cysteine. Proteins were then eluted using 400 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer. Free Fe2+, free S2–, and polymeric iron sulfides remain bound to the column. NifU and NifS concentrations were estimated as described above, and iron analysis was performed as described by Fortune and Mellow (27Fortune W.B. Mellow M.G. Ind. Eng. Chem. Anal. Ed. 1938; 10: 61-64Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To prepare a sample of [Fe-S] cluster-loaded NifU that was separated from NifS the same procedures described above were followed except for the use of a NifS that carries a His tag located near the C terminus. Expression of nifU and His-tagged nifS for this experiment was controlled using pDB1306 (Table I). After completion of the assembly reaction and after mixed bed chromatography as described above, the sample was applied to a 1.5 × 3.0-cm chelating Sepharose column charged with NiSO4. Under these conditions [Fe-S] cluster-loaded NifU passes through the column, whereas His-tagged NifS remains bound to the column.Table IIActivation of the nitrogenase Apo-Fe proteinComponentIncluded in assembly mixNifU+++–+++NifS++++–+ aFor this sample the NifS used in the assembly mix carried an alanine substitution for the active-site cysteine 325 residue.

Open table in a new tab Apo-Fe Protein Preparation—Diazotrophically grown A. vinelandii cells were broken using osmotic shock followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C as previously described (28Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The crude extract was then applied to a Q-Sepharose chromatography column (5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm dithionite. The column was then washed with 400 ml of the same buffer. The fraction containing Fe protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1–0.7 m NaCl) with the Fe protein peak appearing between 0.58–0.62 m NaCl. This fraction was concentrated under an Ar atmosphere to 15 ml using an Amicon YM30 filter (Millipore). To remove the [4Fe-4S] cluster from the Fe protein 5 ml of solution containing 25 mm ATP, 75 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithionite, and 20 mm α-α′-dipyridyl was added, and the sample was incubated on ice for 1.5 h. This treatment resulted in a color change in the sample from deep brown to dark cherry red. Ten ml of this sample were loaded on a Amersham Biosciences S-300 column (2.6 × 35 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl (no dithionite), and eluted with the same buffer. The colorless, dithionite-free fraction containing apo-Fe protein was collected between 110–120 ml of the elution volume. Apo-Fe Protein Activation—Apo-Fe protein activation cocktails contained 5.6 μm apo-Fe protein, 5.6 μm cluster-loaded NifU, 5.6 μm NifS, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm MgATP in a 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). For titration experiments the concentrations of NifU and NifS were varied as shown in Fig. 3. Fractions containing NifU and NifS were added last, and Fe protein was assayed immediately. Prolonged incubation did not increase the level of reconstituted activity, indicating that [Fe-S] cluster transfer from NifU to apo-Fe protein is rapid. Fe Protein Assay—Fe protein activity was measured by the nitrogenase proton reduction assay described previously (29Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28076-28083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were carried out under an Ar atmosphere in sealed 9.2-ml vials. Each assay sample contained 500 μl of activation mix, corresponding to 2.8 nmol of Fe protein (0.19 mg) and 1.4 nmol of MoFe protein (0.31 mg) in a final volume of 1 ml. Control experiments were used to show that total hydrogen evolution catalyzed under these conditions was linear with respect to Fe protein concentration. Assay vials were incubated for 20 min in a 30 °C shaking water bath, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 0.25 m EDTA. Hydrogen gas produced was measured using a Shimadzu GC-14 gas chromatograph equipped with a molecular sieve 5A column and a thermal conductivity detector. Under these assay conditions Fe protein purified in this laboratory has a specific activity of 800 nmol of H2 produced per min per mg of Fe protein. Levels of activation of apo-Fe protein were calculated as a percentage of this value. Under the assay conditions described here the apo-Fe protein is unable to support any H2 evolution. Functional Analysis of the N-terminal and C-terminal Domains of NifU—In previous work it was shown that deletion of the A. vinelandii nifU gene nearly eliminates diazotrophic growth capacity (12Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of alanine for any of the three N-terminal cysteines proposed to be involved in providing ligands for [Fe-S] cluster assembly lowers diazotrophic capacity but not as severely as for the nifU deletion strain (3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These findings were also confirmed in the present work (Fig. 1). There are three plausible explanations for these results. (i) Substitution of only one cysteine within the proposed N-terminal assembly scaffold does not entirely eliminate [Fe-S] cluster assembly within the N-terminal domain, (ii) a second [Fe-S] cluster assembly site is located within NifU, or (iii) NifU has some other function involving nitrogenase activation. These possibilities were examined by determining the effect on diazotrophic growth capacity as a result of substitution of one, two, or all three cysteines located within the N-terminal domain. The different combinations of alanine for cysteine substitutions are shown in Fig. 1A, and the effect of these substitutions on diazotrophic growth is shown in Fig. 1B. These and previous results show that the same diazotrophic growth phenotype results as a consequence of alanine substitution for any or all three of the N-terminal cysteines, indicating that cluster assembly necessary for nitrogenase maturation does not absolutely require a functional N-terminal NifU domain. Recent studies show that a class of small proteins, sometimes designated Nfu, exhibit modest primary sequence identity when compared with the C-terminal domain of NifU, including conservation of the two cysteines located within this domain, and can be used as in vitro scaffolds for the assembly of [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters (17Tong W.H. Jameson G.N. Huynh B.H. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9762-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Nishio K. Nakai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22615-22618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous work has also shown that substitution of either of these cysteines within NifU has no apparent affect on the capacity for diazotrophic growth for the respective mutant strains (3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present work a quadruple mutant strain was constructed where all three cysteines located within the N-terminal domain plus one cysteine located within the C-terminal domain is substituted by alanine. This mutant strain (Fig. 1) has a much lower capacity for diazotrophic growth than either the wild type strain or strains having combinations of substitutions within the N-terminal domain. Although a mutant strain having substitutions within both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains is severely impaired in diazotrophic growth it is still able to grow at a faster rate than a mutant strain that carries a large deletion in nifU (DJ1413, Table I). These results are the same as previously reported for a different strain (DJ105 (12Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)) which carries a relatively small deletion spanning a region of nifU that encodes portions of the N-terminal and central domains. In the current work the strain having a much larger deletion was constructed so that it could be certain all the functional properties of NifU were eliminated. Both DJ1413 and DJ105 carry in-frame deletions so the phenotype cannot be assigned to a polar affect on downstream gene expression. Our interpretation of these results is that the central domain within NifU, which includes one [2Fe-2S]2+/1+ per NifU monomer, must have some function that contributes to the physiological formation, stability, or delivery of transient [Fe-S] clusters that are formed on one or both of the proposed [Fe-S] cluster assembly scaffolds. Although the precise function of the central domain has yet to be determined, previous studies have already established that alanine substitution for any of the four cluster-coordinating cysteine residues eliminates assembly of the permanent [2Fe-2S]2+/1+ cluster but does not have a severe impact on the capacity for diazotrophic growth (3Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In summary, the available genetic information indicates a redundant function for the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in the assembly of [Fe-S] clusters for nitrogenase maturation and that the central domain could have a nonessential function that contributes to the effective formation or delivery of [Fe-S] clusters during nitrogenase maturation. Development of an in Vitro System for Activation of the Nitrogenase Fe Protein—Examination of the NifU primary sequence as well as genetic studies have long been interpreted to indicate that NifU could have some function in the maturation of nitrogenase proteins related to assembly of their associated [F"
https://openalex.org/W2095326001,"The apoptosome is a large caspase-activating (∼700–1400 kDa) complex, which is assembled from Apaf-1 and caspase-9 when cytochrome c is released during mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic cell death. Apaf-1 the core scaffold protein is ∼135 kDa and contains CARD (caspase recruitment domain), CED-4, and multiple (13Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) WD40 repeat domains, which can potentially interact with a variety of unknown regulatory proteins. To identify such proteins we activated THP.1 lysates with dATP/cytochrome c and used sucrose density centrifugation and affinity-based methods to purify the apoptosome for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. First, we used a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-casp91–130) containing the CARD domain of caspase-9-(1–130), which binds to the CARD domain of Apaf-1 when it is in the apoptosome and blocks recruitment/activation of caspase-9. This affinity-purified apoptosome complex contained only Apaf-1XL and GST-casp91–130, demonstrating that the WD40 and CED-4 domains of Apaf-1 do not stably bind other cytosolic proteins. Next we used a monoclonal antibody to caspase-9 to immunopurify the native active apoptosome complex from cell lysates, containing negligible levels of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac), or Omi/HtrA2. This apoptosome complex exhibited low caspase-processing activity and contained four stably associated proteins, namely Apaf-1, pro-p35/34 forms of caspase-9, pro-p20 forms of caspase-3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), and cytochrome c, which was only bound transiently to the complex. However, in lysates containing Smac and Omi/HtrA2, the caspase-processing activity of the purified apoptosome complex increased 6–8-fold and contained only Apaf-1 and the p35/p34-processed subunits of caspase-9. During apoptosis, Smac, Omi/HtrA2, and cytochrome c are released simultaneously from mitochondria, and thus it is likely that the functional apoptosome complex in apoptotic cells consists primarily of Apaf-1 and processed caspase-9. The apoptosome is a large caspase-activating (∼700–1400 kDa) complex, which is assembled from Apaf-1 and caspase-9 when cytochrome c is released during mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic cell death. Apaf-1 the core scaffold protein is ∼135 kDa and contains CARD (caspase recruitment domain), CED-4, and multiple (13Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) WD40 repeat domains, which can potentially interact with a variety of unknown regulatory proteins. To identify such proteins we activated THP.1 lysates with dATP/cytochrome c and used sucrose density centrifugation and affinity-based methods to purify the apoptosome for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. First, we used a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-casp91–130) containing the CARD domain of caspase-9-(1–130), which binds to the CARD domain of Apaf-1 when it is in the apoptosome and blocks recruitment/activation of caspase-9. This affinity-purified apoptosome complex contained only Apaf-1XL and GST-casp91–130, demonstrating that the WD40 and CED-4 domains of Apaf-1 do not stably bind other cytosolic proteins. Next we used a monoclonal antibody to caspase-9 to immunopurify the native active apoptosome complex from cell lysates, containing negligible levels of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac), or Omi/HtrA2. This apoptosome complex exhibited low caspase-processing activity and contained four stably associated proteins, namely Apaf-1, pro-p35/34 forms of caspase-9, pro-p20 forms of caspase-3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), and cytochrome c, which was only bound transiently to the complex. However, in lysates containing Smac and Omi/HtrA2, the caspase-processing activity of the purified apoptosome complex increased 6–8-fold and contained only Apaf-1 and the p35/p34-processed subunits of caspase-9. During apoptosis, Smac, Omi/HtrA2, and cytochrome c are released simultaneously from mitochondria, and thus it is likely that the functional apoptosome complex in apoptotic cells consists primarily of Apaf-1 and processed caspase-9. The morphological and biochemical changes of apoptotic cell death largely result from the activation of a group of cysteine aspartic acid-specific proteases known as caspases (for review see Refs. 1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4112) Google Scholar, 2Hengartner M. Science. 1998; 281: 1298-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). The activation of caspases is a central feature of apoptosis, and key components of this mechanism are highly conserved throughout evolution from Caenorhabditis elegans to Drosophila melanogaster and ultimately to mammals. In C. elegans there are at least four genes, ced-3, ced-4, ced-9, and egl-1, which are critical for the execution of apoptotic cell death. In C. elegans, CED-4 is normally bound to mitochondria and cell membranes by CED-9 (4Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of EGL-1 inactivates CED-9, releasing CED-4, which oligomerizes/recruits and induces autocatalytic processing and activation of CED-3 (5Chen F.L. Hersh B.M. Conradt B. Zhou Z. Riemer D. Gruenbaum Y. Horvitz H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). ced-3 encodes for a cysteine protease, which is homologous to interleukin-1β-converting enzyme or ICE, now known as caspase-1. Thirteen other caspases have now been identified in mammals, some of which are involved in cell death (CED-3 subfamily), whereas others are involved in inflammation (ICE subfamily). Caspases are synthesized as inactive procaspases or zymogens, which in mammals are activated in a cascade mechanism, involving an initiator or activating caspase that cleaves/activates a downstream caspase, which in turn activates the next caspase and so on. There are at least two primary (extrinsic and intrinsic) caspase activation pathways, involving either stimulation of cell surface death receptors or perturbation of mitochondria (for review see Ref. 6Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is essentially homologous to C. elegans in that it involves the formation of the apoptosome, a large caspase-processing complex (for review see Refs. 7Adrain C. Martin S.J.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Mammalian homologues of CED-3, CED-9, and EGL-1 have been identified by conventional cloning strategies, but Apaf-1 a mammalian homologue of CED-4 was only identified by a classical biochemical approach. In these cell-free studies, caspase activation was induced in cell lysates by dATP, and three apoptotic protease-activating factors (Apaf-1–3) were isolated (9Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 was identified as a CED-4 homologue (10Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X.S. Lutschg A. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar), Apaf-2 as cytochrome c (9Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar) and Apaf-3 as caspase-9 (11Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6196) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 is a large ∼135 kDa protein, which consists of an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), 1The abbreviations used are: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethylketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; IEF, isoelectrofocusing; F/T, freeze-thaw; ProT, prothymosin α; PHAP, putative HLA-DR-associated proteins. 1The abbreviations used are: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethylketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; IEF, isoelectrofocusing; F/T, freeze-thaw; ProT, prothymosin α; PHAP, putative HLA-DR-associated proteins. a region homologous to CED-4 followed by a large C-terminal domain containing 12–13 WD40 repeats. The CARD domain interacts with a similar domain on procaspase-9 and the central CED-4-(98–412) region contains a putative ATPase domain with conserved Walker's A (P-loop) and B boxes forming nucleotide binding sites (11Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6196) Google Scholar, 12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar). The function of the WD40 regions is largely unknown although a critical number of 13 WD40 repeats is required for cytochrome c binding as Apaf-1 splice forms containing only 12 WD40 repeats do not bind cytochrome c and do not activate caspases (13Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). WD40 repeats usually form β-propeller structures arranged in a rigid circular structure and in the case of Apaf-1 it is likely that these would be arranged as two asymmetric (7- and 6-bladed) structures (8Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 has been shown to oligomerize in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP to form a very large apoptosome complex with a molecular weight between ∼700 kDa and ∼1.4 MDa (14Cain K. Brown D.G.

The size of the apoptosome complex varies from ∼1.4 MDa when reconstituted from recombinant proteins (16Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) to >1.3 MDa (17Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) when isolated from HeLa cell lysates, However, in dATP-activated THP.1 and B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell lysates we have identified both an ∼700-kDa and an ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complex (15Cain K.

Dinsdale D. Hunter A. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The ∼700-kDa complex predominates in apoptotic cells and is the most active complex in processing exogenous procaspase-9 and -3 (15Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Almond J. Snowden R.T. Dinsdale D. Hunter A. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the size of the apoptosome complex may vary according to cell type and/or the conditions in which the apoptosome is formed, and it is possible that other cellular proteins can bind to the Apaf-1/caspase-9 holo-enzyme complex. We therefore decided to purify the native ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex to homogeneity in order to identify the additional components of the apoptosome. However, our attempts to purify the apoptosome by classical biochemical methodology using multistep chromatography were unsuccessful because of the co-purification of other large ∼700 kDa protein assemblies such as the IKK (20Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and rabaptin-5/rabex 5 complexes (21Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We have therefore developed two affinity-based techniques to purify the apoptosome from dATP-activated lysates. First, we used a GST-caspase-9-(1–130) (GST-casp91–130) construct, which does not contain the large and small subunits of caspase-9, and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of caspase activation by occupying the Apaf-1 CARD domain in the apoptosome complex. We then sequentially purified the ∼700-kDa complex tagged with GST-casp91–130 by sucrose density gradient purification and glutathione beads. Second, we have used a monoclonal anti-caspase-9 antibody to purify the intact fully functional ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex, which contains Apaf-1 and processed caspase-9. The purified apoptosome complexes were analyzed by Western blotting and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry ([email protected] R, Micromass, Manchester, UK), and surprisingly the respective apoptosome complexes contained only Apaf-1 and GST-casp91–130 or Apaf-1 and the p35 and p34 processed forms of caspase-9. Caspase-3 was not detected in the complex and appears to only interact transiently with the apoptosome complex in conditions of low (non-physiological) ionic strength. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) was also not detected in the purified complex due to the presence of endogenous Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) and Omi/HtrA2, which sequester free XIAP and thereby prevent it from interacting with the apoptosome complex. However, when the apoptosome was formed in lysates, which were essentially free of Smac and Omi/HtrA2, we demonstrated recruitment of XIAP and caspase-3 to the apoptosome complex. These studies indicate that when the apoptosome is formed in the apoptotic cell it initially can be inhibited by XIAP, but increasing cytosolic concentrations of Smac and Omi/HtrA2 remove XIAP from the apoptosome complex, which then achieves maximum caspase-activating activity. Cell Culture, Apoptosis Assays, Preparation of Control and Caspase-activated Cell Lysates—Human monocytic tumor cell (THP.1) and cell lysates (100,000 × g supernatants) from control cells were prepared by freeze-thawing (F/T) as described previously (8Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 15Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In some experiments, to minimize mitochondrial breakage and release of pro-apoptotic proteins (see Fig. 9), THP.1 cell lysates (Dig/Hom) were prepared in an isotonic buffer (MSH), containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SCD, 1 tablet/10 ml protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), pH 7.4 using a modified digitonin/homogenization technique. In this procedure, THP.1 cells were pelleted and gently resuspended (108 cells/ml) in MSH buffer plus 0.05% w/v digitonin. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 7 min, before adding 4 volumes of MSH buffer and homogenizing with a ball bearing homogenizer (5 cycles with an 8.002-mm ball, clearance 18 microns, HGM Laboratory equipment, EMBL, Germany). The cell lysates were then prepared as described for the freeze-thawed lysates and concentrated in Vivaspin columns (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) to a final protein concentration of 15–20 mg/ml. Caspase activation in lysates (10–15 mg/ml) was induced by incubation at 37 °C with 2 mm dATP, 2 mm MgCl2, plus or minus 7 μm cytochrome c. Preparation of Recombinant Procaspase-3 and SmacΔ55—BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with a pET-21b (Novagen) plasmid expression vector containing pro-caspase-3 cDNA with a C-terminal His6 purification tag and grown at 37 °C in terrific broth, 1% glucose, and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Expression of the caspase-3 zymogen was optimal when the culture (OD600 = 0.6) was induced for 15 min at 30 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, one protease inhibitor-EDTA tablet (10 ml), pH 8.0, and procaspase-3 purified with nickel-coated Sepharose beads (Qiagen). The truncated form of Smac (i.e. lacking the mitochondrial targeting signal) was prepared in BL21 (DE3) cells in a similar manner using SmacΔ55 pET-15b as previously described (22MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36611-36616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Purification of GST-casp91–130 Fusion Protein—BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with a pGEX4TK2 construct, encoding a fusion protein construct (GST-casp91–130), consisting of the prodomain (amino acids 1–130) of caspase-9 fused in-frame with glutathione S-transferase. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in TB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and at a culture density of 0.6 AU. GST-casp91–130 protein expression was induced at 22 °C for 3 h with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were sedimented and lysed by sonication in PBS containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The GST-tagged protein was affinity-purified from the bacterial lysate with GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in cold PBS and the GST-casp91–130 eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. The protein concentration and purity of the GST-casp91–130 was determined by Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue, respectively. Fluorometric Assays of Proteolytic Activity—DEVDase activity (i.e. primarily caspase-3 and -7) of lysates or column fractions was measured fluorometrically (λex/λem = 405/510 nm) at 37 °C in 96-well plates in 200 μl of assay buffer (20 μm Z-DEVD.AFC, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, 100 mm HEPES, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.0) using a Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel counter (15Cain K.

The protease activities were expressed as either pmol/min/mg protein or pmol/min/fraction. In some experiments, the chymotrypsin-like (LLVYase) activity of the 20 S proteasome was measured with 40 μm Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Peptide Institute Inc, Osaka, Japan). Liberation of AMC the substrate from was monitored continuously using an excitation/emission wavelength pair (λex/λem) of 380/460 nm, respectively. The caspase processing/activating activity of soluble apoptosome complexes was assayed essentially as previously described (15Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) except that purified recombinant procaspase-3 was used as an apoptosome substrate. Briefly, 200-μl aliquots of the column fractions were incubated with recombinant procaspase-3 (200 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then assayed for DEVDase activity, which is a measure of how much procaspase-3 has been processed and activated by the apoptosome. The caspase activating activity of apoptosome complexes bound to anti-caspase-9 antibody-labeled magnetic beads (see later) was assayed in a similar manner. Briefly, the purified apoptosome complexes bound to the Dyna beads were incubated/mixed with recombinant procaspase-3 (200 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C. The apoptosome/bead complexes were then removed, and the active caspase-3, which had been released into the supernatant, assayed for DEVDase activity. Aliquots of the DEVD assay mixtures were diluted 1:1 with 2× SDS loading buffer and analyzed for caspase-3 processing by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Separation of Apoptosome Complexes—Lysates were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 columns using an FPLC (HR 10/30 column) protein purification system (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were eluted at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 calibrated with protein standards as previously described (15Cain K.

Large scale preparation of ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes were prepared by centrifuging THP.1 lysates (30–60 mg) at 25,000 rpm for 17 h at 4 °C on continuous sucrose gradients (10–40%), 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.0 at 4 °C (14Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The gradients were collected in 2-ml fractions, which were analyzed for the LLVYase activity of the 20 S proteasome, which co-sediments with the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex (14Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the gradient fractions were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for Apaf-1 and appropriate fractions pooled and concentrated with Vivaspin concentrators (Millipore). Affinity Purification of Apoptosome Complexes—GST-casp91–130-tagged apoptosome complexes were purified from lysates by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with an equal volume of GSH-Sepharose beads (50% slurry in PBS). Column and sucrose density fractions were extracted in the same way except that a 1:5 bead/sample volume ratio was used. The beads were washed four times in PBS by centrifugation/resuspension and then eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. Immunoaffinity purification of ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes was carried out by first preclearing THP.1 cell lysates (∼25 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C with 400 μl/ml of lysate of protein G-Sepharose-coated beads, which had been prewashed three times in wash buffer (assay buffer supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20). Precleared lysates were diluted to 15 mg/ml with assay buffer, caspase was activated and treated as indicated under “Results,” except that cytochrome c (7 μm) was included in the activation buffer. Apoptosome capture was then carried out by cooling to 4 °C and incubating with periodic mixing for 2 h with 10 μg of anti-caspase-9 monoclonal antibody (R&D mAb8301, Abingdon, UK). The apoptosome complexes were then incubated with constant mixing for 1 h at 4 °C with 400 μl of prewashed (three times in wash buffer) protein G-coated Dyna Beads® (Dynal Biotech Ltd., Cheshire, UK). Beads were then harvested magnetically and washed twice (1 ml) with wash buffer. Aliquots of the beads were either eluted for SDS-PAGE or IEF by incubating with the appropriate loading buffer and magnetic removal of the stripped Dyna beads. In some experiments the anti-caspase-9 antibody was covalently attached to protein G Dyna Beads® as described by Dynal Biotech Ltd. Briefly, 100 μl of beads were washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and then roller-mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 6.25 μg of anti-caspase-9 antibody. The labeled beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.2 buffer before resuspending in 1 ml of cross-linking buffer containing 0.2 m ethanolamine, 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate pH 8.2. The beads were roller-mixed for 30 min at room temperature, before terminating the cross-linking reaction by resuspending and incubating for 15 min in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5 buffer. The beads were washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 before resuspending in 100 μl of the same buffer. Apoptosome complexes were captured by adding 20 μl of cross-linked beads to 100 μl of dATP-activated THP.1 lysate and roller mixed overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted from the beads as described above. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Analysis of Purified Apoptosome Complexes—Protein complexes were eluted from the protein G-coated Dyna beads with IEF rehydration buffer (6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (w/v) ampholines (pH 3–10), IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 18 mm DTT, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue. IPG strips (pH 5–8, Bio-Rad) were rehydrated overnight at 50 μA in 185 μl of rehydration buffer with the gel side face down. Protein aliquots dissolved in rehydration buffer (100 μl) were applied to the IPG strips using cup loading, and the strips run for 20,000 Vh with a terminal voltage of 8000 volts. For the second SDS-PAGE dimension, the IPG strips were incubated for 15 min in an equilibration buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), bromphenol blue 0.002% (w/v), and 64 mm DTT, pH 8.8. The strips were then given a further 15-min incubation in a modified equilibration buffer in which the DTT was replaced by 135 mm iodacetamide. The strips were then immersed in Tris-glycine buffer, applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresed under standard conditions. Gels were stained with either Coomassie Blue or SYPRO ruby and imaged using ProXPRESS proteomic imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Progenesis Work station image analysis software (Non-Linear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). Proteomic Analysis—Gel plugs (0.8 mm × 1 mm) were excised from stained SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gels using an automated spot picker (ProPic, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An automated digestion robot (ProGest, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to perform in situ digestion on the plugs, which were sequentially reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol, alkylated with 100 mm iodacetamide, and digested with modified sequencing-grade porcine trypsin (Promega). Peptides were extracted from the digested gel plugs with 21 μl of 0.1% formic acid, and aliquots (5 μl) of the extracted peptides desalted with C18 Zip tips (Millipore). Aliquots (0.5 μl) of the desalted peptide extracts were combined with equal volumes of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid in 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile and were loaded on to a MALDI target plate using an automated spotting robot (ProMS, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Peptide mass analysis was then performed on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer using a mass range of 900–3000 Da. Mass spectrometric data were analyzed automatically or manually by ProteinLynx and MASCOT software, respectively. Protein identity was determined by submission to SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL data bases. Reagents and Western Blot Analysis—The GST-casp91–130 construct was generated using conventional cloning strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2136558272,"Pulmonary surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), members of the collectin family, play important roles in the innate immune system of the lung. Here, we show that SP-A but not SP-D augmented phagocytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages, independent of its binding to the bacteria. Analysis of the SP-A/SP-D chimeras, in which progressively longer carboxyl-terminal regions of SP-A were replaced with the corresponding SP-D regions, has revealed that the SP-D region Gly346-Phe355 can be substituted for the SP-A region Leu219-Phe228 without altering the SP-A activity of enhancing the phagocytosis and that the SP-A region Cys204-Cys218 is required for the SP-A-mediated phagocytosis. Acetylated low density lipoprotein significantly reduced the SP-A-stimulated uptake of the bacteria. SP-A failed to enhance the phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages derived from scavenger receptor A (SR-A)-deficient mice, demonstrating that SP-A augments SRA-mediated phagocytosis. Preincubation of macrophages with SP-A at 37 °C but not at 4 °C stimulated the phagocytosis. The SP-A-mediated enhanced phagocytosis was not inhibited by the presence of cycloheximide. SP-A increased cell surface localization of SR-A that was inhibitable by apigenin, a casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor. SP-A-treated macrophages exhibited significantly greater binding of acetylated low density lipoprotein than nontreated cells. The SP-A-stimulated phagocytosis was also abolished by apigenin. In addition, SP-A stimulated CK2 activity.

SP-A and SP-D are believed to play important roles in the innate immune system of the lung. SP-A-deficient mice exhibit reduced bacterial clearance and elevated pulmonary inflammation in response to microbial challenge (4Borron P. McIntosh J.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Taylor J.

However, the relationship between the binding to the bacteria and the phagocytic effect and the mechanism of the SP-A-mediated uptake of the bacteria are not completely understood. Macrophage scavenger receptor A (SR-A) interacts with a number of ligands including the modified lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and Gram-negative and -positive bacteria (15Dunne D.W.

These receptors are responsible for the phagocytosis of various bacteria and are essential components in the innate immune system. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the SP-A-mediated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages. In this report, we show that SP-A augments the SR-A-mediated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages, independent of its binding to the bacteria, and that SP-A increases cell surface localization of SR-A in a CK2-dependent manner. This study reveals a novel mechanism of bacterial clearance by alveolar macrophages. Reagents—Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Alexa 594-donkey anti-goat IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes. Mannan, C1q, cycloheximide, apigenin, PD98059, bisindolylmaleimide, and β-casein were purchased from Sigma. H89, acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Seikagaku Corp., Biomedical Technologies Inc., and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Goat anti-scavenger receptor A (anti-SR-A) antibody and rabbit anti-casein kinase 2 (anti-CK2)-α chain antiserum were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Surfactant Proteins and Recombinant Proteins—SP-A and SP-D were purified from rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluids as previously described (18Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J.

Binding of SP-A to S. pneumoniae—S. pneumoniae was heat-killed (95 °C for 10 min) and used for the experiments. The binding study was performed using S. pneumoniae coated onto microtiter wells. S. pneumoniae (106 colony-forming units) in 40 μl of PBS was added onto the wells, and the wells were dried under vacuum, and then the bacteria was fixed in 100 μl/well of 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the wells with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% (w/v) BSA (buffer A). The wells were then incubated with the indicated concentrations of SP-A or the recombinant proteins in the buffer A for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-SP-A antibody was added and incubated after the wells had been washed with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The amount of the proteins binding to S. pneumoniae was determined by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate for the peroxidase reaction. In some experiments, 5 mm EDTA was used instead of CaCl2. 125I-SP-A labeled by Bolton-Hunter reagent (22Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar) was also used for the binding study to S. pneumoniae coated onto microtiter wells, and the amount of 125ISP-A binding to the bacteria was determined by measuring the radioactivities using a γ-counter. Phagocytosis Assay of S. pneumoniae by Macrophages—FITC labeling of heat-treated S. pneumoniae was performed by a method based on that described by Tino and Wright (14Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L677-L688PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-ml suspension of S. pneumoniae in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 9.0) was mixed with 1 μl of FITC (Molecular Probes; 10 mg/ml in Me2SO) and stirred at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. FITC-labeled bacteria was washed four times with PBS by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The final pellet of FITC-bacteria obtained was suspended in PBS and stored in 100-μl aliquots at -80 °C. The phagocytosis assay was carried out using macrophages in suspension by a modification of the method described by Geertsma et al. (11Geertsma M.F. Nibbering P.H. Haagsman H.P. Daha M.R. Van Furth R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L578-L584PubMed Google Scholar). SR-A I/II knockout mice (SR-A-/-) are described in detail elsewhere (23Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada M. Kataoka M.

Briefly, alveolar macrophages were first isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats or C57BL/6 mice by washing the lung with 0.9% NaCl containing 1 mm EDTA and centrifuging the lavage fluids at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Alveolar macrophages (2 × 105 in 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution) were mixed with FITC-labeled S. pneumoniae (2 × 106 colony-forming units in 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark in the absence or the presence of the indicated concentrations of SP-A. The assay was stopped by the addition of ice-cold PBS to the macrophage-bacteria suspension. The bacteria that had not been associated with the cells were separated from cell-associated bacteria by centrifugation of the suspension at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were next suspended with 5 μl of 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide in PBS and pipetted to a microscopic slide glass. The number of macrophages with or without intracellular (green fluorescent) bacteria were counted for at least 100 macrophages in duplicate samples using a fluorescence microscope at × 400 magnification. The results were expressed as the percentage of macrophages that contained intracellular bacteria in total macrophages counted. Mouse-derived macrophages were used only for the phagocytosis experiments with SR-A-deficient cells. Other experiments were performed using rat macrophages. Casein Kinase 2 Assay—Alveolar macrophages isolated from rats were first incubated with or without 40 μm apigenin at 37 °C for 1 h, SP-A (20 μg/ml) was then added, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and processed for the CK2 assay. The CK2 assay was performed by the method described by Mead et al. (24Mead J.R. Hughes T.R. Irvine S.A. Sigh N.N. Ramji D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17741-17751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, alveolar macrophages (1 × 106) were suspended in 500 μl of phosphatase-free cell extraction buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.05), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate. 5 μm ZnCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was vortexed for 45 s at 4 °C and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as the whole cell extract and stored at -80 °C. The whole cell extracts were first precleared by the addition of protein A-agarose beads (20 μl) and the incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the beads. The precleared supernatant was mixed with anti-CK2-α chain antiserum (2 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The CK2-antibody immune complex was isolated by the addition of protein A-agarose beads (20 μl) with gentle shaking for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads binding to the immune complex were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with the phosphatase-free cell extraction buffer. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 mg/ml β-casein. The mixture was then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of reducing solubilizing buffer (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE after boiling for 10 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed for 20 min in a solution containing 40% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid and dried after washing once with distilled water. The phosphorylated β-casein was finally visualized by autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting analysis was performed to examine whether the whole cell extracts under different conditions contained equal amounts of CK2. The proteins were precipitated from 10 μg of the whole cell extracts using 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins on the gel were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked by the incubation with TBS (20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated with anti-CK2 antiserum, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. After washing the membrane with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscope—Alveolar macrophages (5 × 105) were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with or without protein kinase inhibitors at 37 °C for 1 h and further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on polylysine-coated coverslips in the absence or the presence of 20 μg/ml SP-A. The cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS or in methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA (BSA/PBS) and incubated with BSA/PBS for 30 min and then incubated with anti-SR-A antibody (2 μg/ml) in BSA/PBS at room temperature for 60 min. The cells were then washed three times with BSA/PBS and incubated with Alexa 594-anti-goat IgG (1:500) in BSA/PBS at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. The cells were finally washed three times with BSA/PBS and with PBS, sealed in the presence of Vectashield Antifade (Vector Laboratories), and examined using a laser microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan) with a ×63 (methanol-fixed samples) or a ×20 (for paraformaldehyde-fixed samples) oil planapochromatic lens (numerical aperture 1.4). Digital images were acquired and processed using Adobe Photoshop, version 5.0 (Mountain View, CA) and CorelDRAW software (Corel Corp.). In some experiments, alveolar macrophages were first incubated with 20 μg/ml SP-A at 4 °C or at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with ice-cold PBS by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were then suspended with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated onto lysine-coated coverslips. Binding of 125I-Acetylated LDL to Alveolar Macrophages—AcLDLs were labeled with 125I using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Biosciences) by the method described by Bolton and Hunter (22Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The methods used in this study were adapted from those for binding of LDL to its receptor (25Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat alveolar macrophages were cultured at a density of 5 × 105/well in a 24-well plate in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 2 h. The cells were then incubated with or without SP-A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h and washed three times with 500 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The 24-well plate was then put on ice, and the cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of 125I-AcLDL in 500 μl/well of ice-cold RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 4 °C for 4 h. After a 4-h incubation, the medium containing 125I-AcLDL was aspirated, and the cells were washed rapidly with 500 μl of ice-cold buffer B (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mg/ml BSA). The cell monolayer was then incubated on ice for 10 min with 500 μl of the ice-cold buffer B. The medium was removed, and these washing steps were repeated. Next, the cell monolayer was rapidly washed with 500 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl. The cells were removed from the wells by dissolution in 500 μl of NaOH, and the amount of 125I-AcLDL bound to the cells was determined with a γ-counter. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Alveolar macrophages and peritoneal macrophages isolated from rats (1 × 106 cells) were incubated with or without 20 μg/ml SP-A at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After fixation, the macrophages were collected by centrifugation at 150 × g for 10 min and washed once with PBS. The fixed macrophages were incubated with anti-SR-A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control goat IgG in PBS containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm sodium azide, followed by the incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-goat IgG. After another washing, the labeled macrophages were analyzed by using FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). In some experiments, rat alveolar macrophages were treated with 0.1% saponin at 4 °C for 30 min after paraformaldehyde fixation, and total SR-A expression was analyzed as described above. Binding of SP-A to S. pneumoniae—We first examined whether SP-A bound to S. pneumoniae using 125I-labeled SP-A. 125I-SP-A exhibited a concentration-dependent binding to S. pneumoniae (Fig. 1a). Inclusion of 5 mm EDTA in the binding buffer inhibited the binding of SP-A to the bacteria, indicating that the binding of SP-A to S. pneumoniae is Ca2+-dependent. Recombinant wild type SP-A as well as native SP-A showed a concentration-dependent and saturable binding to S. pneumoniae (Fig. 1b). The mutant SP-AR197A,K201A,K203A exhibited a binding comparable with that of wild type SP-A. SP-A Enhances the Phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by Alveolar Macrophages—The effect of SP-A on the phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages was studied. The presence of SP-A significantly increased the phagocytosis of the bacteria in a manner dependent upon SP-A concentrations (Fig. 2a). SP-A augmented the phagocytosis in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 2b). Only 5-min coincubation of macrophages with SP-A significantly increased the uptake of the bacteria. At the end of the phagocytosis assay, the viabilities of alveolar macrophages were determined. No differences in the viabilities were found in the absence or the presence of SP-A (90.3 ± 1.2 versus 89.8 ± 0.4% (means ± S.E.), n = 3). This result rules out a possibility that the stimulation of the phagocytosis by SP-A is due to the effect of SP-A on the macrophage viability. Excess mannan, C1q, or EDTA failed to alter the SP-A-stimulated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae (Fig. 2c). This suggests that mannose receptor or C1q receptor is not involved in the SP-A-mediated enhanced phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae. The results also indicate that the augmentation of the phagocytosis by SP-A is independent of the binding of SP-A to S. pneumoniae, since the addition of EDTA that inhibited SP-A binding to S. pneumoniae showed no effect on the uptake enhanced by SP-A. In addition, SP-A retained the activity of enhancing the phagocytosis in the presence of polymyxin B. Neither the heat-treated SP-A nor lipopolysaccharide stimulated the phagocytosis (Fig. 2c). These results rule out the possibility that the enhanced phagocytosis is due to the endotoxin contamination in the SP-A preparation. We also examined whether another collectin SP-D, a structural homologue to SP-A, enhanced the uptake of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages. Unlike SP-A, SP-D failed to augment the phagocytosis of the bacteria (Fig. 2d). Thus, the effect of SP-A/SP-D chimeras, in which progressively longer carboxyl-terminal regions of SP-A were replaced with the corresponding SP-D regions, was examined to identify the SP-A region required for augmentation of the phagocytosis (Fig. 2d). Only the chimera ad1, containing the extreme carboxyl terminus of SP-D, and not the chimeras ad2-ad5 exhibited the enhanced phagocytosis, indicating the importance of the carbohydrate recognition domain in the SP-A-stimulated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae. The data clearly show that the SP-D region Gly346-Phe355 can be substituted for the SP-A region Leu219-Phe228 without altering the SP-A activity of enhancing the phagocytosis. The results also suggest that the SP-A region Cys204-Cys218 is required for the SP-A-mediated phagocytosis, since the chimera ad2 failed to augment the uptake of the bacteria. In addition, SP-AR197A,K201A,K203A did not enhance the phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae (Fig. 2d). Because this mutant avidly bound to S. pneumoniae at a level comparable with that of wild type SP-A (Fig. 1a), taken together with the results obtained from the experiments with EDTA, these results demonstrate that SP-A augments the phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages, independent of its binding to the bacteria. SP-A Augments Scavenger Receptor A-mediated Phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae—When the phagocytosis assay was performed in the presence of 0-100 μg/ml AcLDL, the increasing concentrations of AcLDL significantly reduced the uptake of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages (Fig. 3a). SP-A exhibited almost no stimulatory effect on the phagocytosis in the presence of 20 and 100 μg/ml AcLDL, suggesting that SP-A enhances SR-A-mediated phagocytosis. Consistent with these results, SP-A failed to stimulate the phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae by alveolar macrophages derived from SR-A-/- mice (Fig. 3b). These results demonstrate that SP-A stimulates SR-A-mediated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae. When FITC-labeled S. pneumoniae was incubated with rat alveolar macrophages at 4 °C in the absence or the presence of fucoidan and mannan, fucoidan but not mannan significantly decreased the binding of the bacteria to macrophages (Fig. 3c). Since fucoidan is a ligand for SR-A (16Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), these results indicate that S. pneumoniae binds to SR-A. The effects of SP-A on the phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Staphylococcus aureus, an SR-A ligand (15Dunne D.W. Resnick D. Greenberg J. Krieger M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and of FITC-labeled latex beads were also examined. SP-A significantly increased the uptake of S. aureus as well as S. pneumoniae by rat alveolar macrophages (Fig. 3d). However, SP-A did not enhance the phagocytosis of latex beads. Taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that SP-A augments SR-A-mediated phagocytosis. It is unlikely that SP-A stimulates the general phagocytosis phenomenon. Requirement of SP-A-Macrophage Interaction—Since the SPA-mediated phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae is independent of its bacterial binding, alveolar macrophages were first preincubated with SP-A at 37 °C for various lengths of time, the medium containing SP-A was removed, and the cells were washed. The cells were then incubated with FITC-labeled S. pneumoniae. The alveolar macrophages preincubated with SP-A still exhibited the enhanced phagocytosis even after the cells had been washed (Fig. 4a). The longer the preincubation with SP-A, the greater the uptake of S. pneumoniae. However, preincubation at 4 °C failed to stimulate the uptake in the presence of SP-A (Fig. 4b). The basal uptake of the bacteria by peritoneal macrophages in the absence of SP-A is significantly greater than that by alveolar macrophages (Fig. 4c). Peritoneal macrophages did not exhibit stimulated phagocytosis in response to SP-A. The effect of cycloheximide on the phagocytosis was also examined. SP-A still enhanced the uptake of the bacteria by alveolar macrophages in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Fig. 4d), suggesting that new protein synthesis is not involved in the SP-A effect. SP-A Increases Cell Surface Localization of Scavenger Receptor A on Alveolar Macrophages—The effect of SP-A on cell surface expression of SR-A was next examined. Alveolar macrophages were preincubated with SP-A, and the cells were processed for immunochemistry with anti-SR-A antibody after fixation in paraformaldehyde. Incubation of SP-A with the macrophages clearly increased the expression of SR-A (Fig. 5a). Observation of the immunostained cells that had been fixed in methanol revealed that SP-A induced translocation of SR-A from cytoplasmic vesicles to plasma membrane. Consistent with these results, the binding of acetylated LDL, an SR-A ligand, to alveolar macrophages that had been preincubated with SP-A was significantly increased (Fig. 5b). These data support the concept that SP-A increases cell surface localization of SR-A. SP-A still increased cell surface localization of SR-A even in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 5c). In addition, preincubation of the cells with SP-A at 4 °C failed to enhance the immunostaining of SR-A (Fig. 5c). These results correlate well with those obtained from the phagocytosis assay (Fig. 4, b and d) and suggest that SP-A stimulates the phagocytosis and the cell surface SR-A localization by the mechanism that is temperature-dependent but is not involved in the new protein synthesis. We further assessed the cell surface expression of SR-A on alveolar and peritoneal macrophages by flow cytometry. SR-A was constitu"

We discovered that regulated secretory proteins such as the hormone precursors pro-vasopressin, pro-oxytocin, and pro-opiomelanocortin, as well as the granins secretogranin II and chromogranin B but not the constitutive secretory protein α<sub>1</sub>-protease inhibitor, accumulate in granular structures at the Golgi and in the cell periphery in transfected COS-1 fibroblast cells. The accumulations were observed in 30–70% of the transfected cells expressing the pro-hormones and for virtually all of the cells expressing the granins. Similar structures were also generated in other cell lines believed to be lacking a regulated secretory pathway. The accumulations resembled secretory granules morphologically in immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. They were devoid of markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, and lysosomes but in part stained positive for the trans-Golgi network marker TGN46, consistent with their formation at the trans-Golgi network. When different regulated proteins were coexpressed, they were frequently found in the same granules, whereas α<sub>1</sub>-protease inhibitor could not be detected in accumulations formed by secretogranin II, demonstrating segregation of regulated from constitutive secretory proteins. In pulse-chase experiments, significant intracellular storage of secretogranin II and chromogranin B was observed and secretion of retained secretogranin II was stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. The results suggest that expression of regulated cargo proteins is sufficient to generate structures that resemble secretory granules in the background of constitutively secreting cells, supporting earlier proposals on the mechanism of granule formation."

Light triggers hydrolysis of cGMP, thus causing cGMP-gated channels to close and resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell plasma membrane. In addition to hyperpolarization, closure of cGMP-gated Na+/K+,Ca2+ channels decreases the intracellular Ca2+ level by stopping Ca2+ influx through the channels. The change in intracellular Ca2+ accelerates recovery phase of phototransduction by stimulating cGMP synthesis by retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC), a process that is mediated by GCAPs (5Dizhoor A.M.

The fluorescence of myristoylated bovine GCAP-1 is at its maximum in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, and the changes in fluorescence as a function of free Ca2+ ([Ca]f) are biphasic (Fig. 1A). In the absence of Mg2+, increasing [Ca]f initially decreases the intensity of the fluorescence (phase I) until it reaches its minimum at 100–200 nm [Ca]f, followed by a small increase in the fluorescence intensity (phase II) until it reaches a plateau at ∼1 μm [Ca]f (Fig. 1A). All GCAPs contain four helix-turn-helix EF-hand structures, of which only three can bind Ca2+ (10Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

The affinity of the individual EF-hands to Ca2+ and the order in which the Ca2+ ions bind EF-hands in GCAP-1 are not immediately apparent; however, the biphasic profile of the Ca2+-dependent changes in fluorescence of GCAP-1 implies that by using this method, the interaction of at least two EF-hands with Ca2+ can be observed. Apparently, conformational changes in GCAP-1 corresponding to phase I reflect higher affinity binding of Ca2+ (it starts at [Ca]f as low as 10 nm), while much higher [Ca]f is necessary to attain the phase II. Surprisingly, we have found that not only Ca2+ but also Mg2+ inhibits fluorescence of GCAP-1. Unlike Ca2+, the Mg2+-dependent change in fluorescence appears monophasic, and the concentration of free Mg2+ ([Mg]f) required for the half-maximal decrease in GCAP-1 tryptophan fluorescence is near 0.25 mm (Fig. 1B). More importantly, Mg2+ also dramatically alters Ca2+-dependent changes in GCAP-1 fluorescence by affecting both phase I and II in a different manner (Fig. 1A). First, Mg2+ strongly diminishes the fluorescence of the Ca2+-free GCAP-1, such that the fluorescence corresponding to the phase I becomes eliminated within the millimolar range of [Mg]f, and the amplitude of the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence change corresponding to the phase II becomes more prominent in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A). Second, Mg2+ affects the Ca2+-sensitivity of the phase II in such a manner that higher [Ca]f is required to reach the halfmaximal amplitude corresponding to the phase II (Fig. 1A). Taken together, these observations indicate that GCAP-1 directly binds Mg2+, and the Mg2+ binding strongly influences both conformation of GCAP-1 and its affinity for Ca2+. Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of myristoylated GCAP-2 were much smaller than in GCAP-1, probably because of higher tryptophan content in GCAP-2. In addition to the conformational changes in GCAP-1, we found that Mg2+ binding dramatically affected Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation in bovine rod outer segment membranes reconstituted with recombinant myristoylated GCAP-1 or GCAP-2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Lowering [Mg]f from 5.0 to 0.5 mm decreases the free Ca2+ concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition of RetGC ([Ca]½) by GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 from 1.3 and 0.2 μm to 0.16 and 0.03 μm, respectively. While the [Ca]½ for both purified GCAPs increases proportionally with the increase in [Mg]f (Fig. 2C), the basal RetGC activity in washed membranes that lack GCAPs remains insensitive to Ca2+ at all tested concentrations of Mg2+. Mg2+ needs to be present as a part of Mg-GTP substrate complex in the catalytic center of RetGC and is essential for its activity (27Ramamurthy V. Tucker C. Wilkie S.E. Daggett V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26218-26229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); therefore, the decrease in RetGC activity at [Mg]f below 1 mm (Fig. 2D) could be explained by a decrease in concentration of Mg-GTP substrate complex (inset on Fig. 2D). However, even at [Mg]f as low as 0.5 mm RetGC retains more than 70% of its catalytic activity. Despite the small decrease in absolute RetGC activity at low Mg2+, the amplitude of its stimulation by GCAPs remains virtually the same (Fig. 2, A and B) and varying [Mg]f at above 1 mm affects neither basal nor GCAP-stimulated RetGC activity (Fig. 2D). Hence, Mg2+ changes Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC by affecting Ca2+ binding properties of GCAPs rather than catalytic activity of the cyclase itself. We have found a similar effect of Mg2+ on Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation by the endogenous GCAPs in mouse retina (Fig. 3). The overall Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation in mouse retina homogenate differs from that of individual bovine recombinant GCAPs reconstituted with washed bovine ROS membranes (Fig. 2, A and B). For example at 2 mm [Mg]f the [Ca]½ is 113 nm for mouse retina homogenate and 530 and 87 nm for bovine ROS reconstituted with GCAP-1 and GCAP-2, respectively. Apparently, the integral Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC in retinal homogenates, which contain both GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 (13Hwang J.Y. Lange C. Helten A. Hoppner-Heitmann D. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Koch K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), reflects the combined effect of both GCAPs. Importantly, the effect of Mg2+ on Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation by the endogenous GCAPs in whole mouse retina homogenates remained and was similar to that observed in the case of recombinant GCAPs. The dependence of [Ca]½ on [Mg]f is also linear within a wide range of [Mg]f (Fig. 3B). While Mg2+ dramatically changes the Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation, it does not affect its cooperativity, which remains close to 2.0 at all free Mg2+ concentrations tested in our experiments (Fig. 3C). In this study we have found that the key factor affecting Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAPs is their binding of Mg2+; therefore, GCAPs should be more correctly defined as Ca2+/Mg2+ sensor proteins. Mg2+ does not affect the extent to which RetGC becomes activated by GCAPs at low [Ca]f or inhibited at high [Ca]f, and it does not change the cooperativity of RetGC regulation by Ca2+, either. However, it critically affects the Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation. The shaded area in Fig. 3A corresponds to the 23–250 nm free Ca2+ range in mouse photoreceptors within which [Ca]f changes between light and dark (15Woodruff M.L. Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Krasnoperova N.V. Lem J. Fain G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 843-854Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Only at free Mg2+ concentrations between 0.5 and 2 mm the Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation fits with the actual free Ca2+ found in mouse photoreceptors. The possible explanation why most of the [Ca]½ values for GCAPs reported in the literature do not fit well with the 23–250 nm free Ca2+ range is that those values were typically obtained using Mg2+ concentrations that were much higher than physiological. The majority of published RetGC assay mixtures contained nearly 10 mm total Mg2+, which corresponds to 6–8 mm [Mg]f depending on the particular composition of the reaction (1Gorczyca W.A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). According to our data, for GCAP Ca2+ sensitivity to better correspond to the physiological range of the intracellular Ca2+, the intracellular [Mg]f in the photoreceptors has to be close to 1 mm. The actual concentration of the free Mg2+ in mouse photoreceptor has not been determined; however, 0.81–0.86 mm [Mg]f was recently measured in salamander photoreceptors (28Chen C. Nakatani K. Koutalos Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 125-135Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which agrees well with our data. The effect of Mg2+ on Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation can also explain why [Ca]½ observed in whole-cell recordings (16Koutalos Y. Nakatani K. Tamura T. Yau K.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 863-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Nakatani K. Koutalos Y. Yau K.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 69-76Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was much lower than in most of biochemical assays in vitro that used recombinant GCAPs, because [Mg]f used in those electrophysiological experiments typically corresponded to 0.5 mm. To conclude, our data demonstrate that GCAPs are Ca2+/Mg2+ sensor proteins. Intracellular Ca2+ is changed in response to light. Therefore, the primary function of GCAPs is to react to the changes in free Ca2+ concentrations caused by light and thus to activate or inhibit RetGC. In contrast, [Mg]f remains virtually unchanged by light (28Chen C. Nakatani K. Koutalos Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 125-135Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However Mg2+ binding by GCAPs contributes to the cyclase regulation by setting the proper dynamic range for the RetGC regulation corresponding to the physiological change in free Ca2+. It remains to be determined which EF-hand(s) in GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 is responsible for adding Mg2+ sensitivity to the cyclase regulation. GCAPs are members of a separate family of neuron-specific recoverin-like proteins within the EF-hand superfamily. Unlike calmodulin, all proteins of the recoverin family have N-terminal myristoylation and four EF-hand like structures, of which only two or three can bind Ca2+ (29Haeseleer F. Imanishi Y. Sokal I. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It was recently observed that recoverin binds Mg2+ at high concentrations; however, the physiological importance of the Mg2+ binding by recoverin has not been revealed (31Ozawa T. Fukuda M. Nara M. Nakamura A. Komine Y. Kohama K. Umezawa Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14495-14503Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our finding of GCAPs being Ca2+/Mg2+ sensors raises the possibility that Ca2+/Mg2+ binding is a mechanism that adjusts Ca2+ sensitivity of other recoverin-like proteins to the physiological range of the intracellular Ca2+.

However, clinical trials revealed that aerosolized nucleotides provide only a transient improvement of MCC to patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study, we identified the mechanism that eliminates extracellular nucleotides from human airways. Polarized primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were impermeable to extracellular nucleotides but rapidly dephosphorylated ATP into ADP, AMP, and adenosine. The half-life of a therapeutic ATP concentration (0.1 mm) was ∼20 s within the periciliary liquid layer. The mucosal epithelial surface eliminated P2 receptor agonists (ATP = UTP > ADP > UDP) at 3-fold higher rates than the serosal surface. We also showed that mucosal (not serosal) ectoATPase activity increases toward areas most susceptible to airway obstruction (nose < bronchi << bronchioles). Bronchial cultures from patients with CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or α1-antitrypsin deficiency exhibited 3-fold higher mucosal (not serosal) ectoATPase activity than normal cultures. Time course experiments indicated that CF enhances ATP elimination and adenosine accumulation on the mucosal surface. Furthermore, nonspecific alkaline phosphatase was identified as the major regulator of airway nucleotide concentrations in CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency. The ectoAT-Pase activity and mRNA expression of mucosally restricted nonspecific alkaline phosphatase were 3-fold higher on bronchial cultures from these patients than from healthy subjects.

Extracellular nucleotides regulate all major components of MCC on human airway epithelial surfaces. Through G protein-coupled P2Y receptors, they stimulate Ca2+- and PKC-dependent mucin secretion, cilia beating activity, and ion channels that regulate PCL volume, namely Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (6Donaldson S.H.

Two members of the P2Y receptor subfamily were identified on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia: the P2Y2 receptor equally activated by ATP and UTP (not ADP or UDP) (7Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and the P2Y6 receptor potently activated by UDP and weakly by ADP (8Lazarowski E.R.

Cystic fibrosis patients are unable to maintain normal PCL volume using the adenosine receptor-CFTR pathway and therefore depend on mechanically-stimulated ATP release (i.e. coughing, wheezing, and clapping) for Ca2+-activated Cl- channels activation. However, clinical studies indicated that nucleotides provide only a short-term improvement of MCC in CF patients (30Knowles M.R. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. New Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Aerosolized UTP, in conjunction with amiloride (sodium channel blocker), increased MCC to normal levels in ∼20 min in CF patients (31Bennett W.D. Olivier K.N. Zeman K.L. Hohneker K.W. Boucher R.C.

In polarized cultures of CF nasal epithelial cells, UTP restored normal PCL volume in <1 h (4Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The transient nature of these responses suggests that nucleotide concentrations above resting levels are rapidly eliminated from human airway epithelial surfaces. Given the importance of P2 receptor-mediated MCC for CF patients, we investigated the mechanisms of nucleotide clearance from human airway epithelial surfaces under normal and pathological conditions. We tested whether they are eliminated by paracellular permeation through the epithelial layer and/or cell surface metabolism. We also describe, for the first time, the polarity and distribution of these ectonucleotidase activities throughout human airways with epithelial cultures of nasal, bronchial, and bronchiolar cells. The impact of chronic inflammatory lung diseases on nucleotide clearance was examined with epithelial cultures from patients diagnosed with CF, PCD, or αAT. Finally, we addressed the identity of the proteins responsible for nucleotide metabolism. Three families of ectonucleotidases have been identified on mammalian cells: ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases, alkaline phosphatases (AP), and ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (33Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 2000; 362: 299-309Crossref Scopus (806) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated the presence of NS AP on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia (34Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because NS AP expression was up-regulated by the major airway pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (34Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we tested the impact of CF, PCD, and αAT on the activity and expression of NS AP. This study demonstrates that P2 receptor agonists are rapidly eliminated from human airway epithelial surfaces by ectonucleotidases, including NS AP. Furthermore, we show that nucleotide clearance is accelerated in CF by mechanisms that involve chronic inflammation. Cell Culture—Polarized cultures of human airway epithelial cells from healthy donors and patients with CF, PCD, or αAT were grown as previously described (35Gray T.E. Guzman K. Davis C.W. Abdullah L.H. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were isolated by protease digestion (36Wu R. Yankaskas J. Cheng E. Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 311-320PubMed Google Scholar) and plated on porous Transwell Col filters (well diameter, 12 mm; pore size, 0.45 μm) in air-liquid interface medium (50:50 mixture of LHC Basal and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H, 0.5 ng/ml epithelial growth factor, 50 nm retinoic acid, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8% bovine pituitary extract, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/μl streptomycin) (37Lechner J.F. LaVeck M.A. J. Tissue Cult. Meth. 1985; 9: 43-48Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The confluent cultures were maintained in air-liquid interface with medium added only to the serosal compartment. Passage 1 (P1) cultures were obtained by plating the digested cells on a collagen-coated tissue culture dish (5–10 days) in LHC9 medium (36Wu R. Yankaskas J. Cheng E. Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 311-320PubMed Google Scholar) containing 25 ng/ml epithelial growth factor, 50 nm retinoic acid, 40 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8% bovine pituitary extract, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/μl streptomycin, and 0.125 mg/ml amphotericin. Once they reached confluence, the cells were trypsinized and subpassaged on porous Transwell Col filters. After 4 weeks, primary and P1 cultures were composed of columnar ciliated cells (>90%) and secretory cells covering a layer of basal-like cells (38Matsui H. Davis C.W. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted on cultures of transepithelial electrical resistance ≥300 Ω/cm2. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was employed as a test of cellular integrity. Ectonucleotidase Assays—Epithelial cultures were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with Krebs buffer (KRB) (in mm): 140 Na+, 120 Cl-, 5.2 K+, 25 HCO3-, 2.4 HPO4-, 1.6 Ca2+, 1.6 Mg2+, 5.2 glucose, and 25 HEPES (pH 7.4) and then preincubated in KRB (0.35 ml of mucosal/serosal) for 30 min at 37 °C (5% CO2/95% O2). All reactions were initiated by the addition of the substrate (dissolved (10×) in 0.035 ml of KRB) to the mucosal and/or serosal buffer and stopped by transferring 10-μl aliquots to tubes containing 0.3 ml of ice-cold water. The samples were boiled 5 min, filtered, and analyzed by reversed-phase paired-ion HPLC. PCL Layer Assays—Primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were assayed for the metabolism of 0.1 mm ATP within the PCL, as previously described (4Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M.

In brief, several wells of the same culture were washed three times with PBS and preincubated for 60 min to restore normal PCL height. The substrate was prepared by suspending 0.1 mg of ATP and 3 μCi (3 μl) of [3H]ATP into 0.2 ml of perfluorocarbon (FC-72). The mixture was sonicated for 10 min, and 10 μl was added to the mucosal surface of each well. Perfluorocarbon evaporates in seconds, leaving the substrate within the PCL layer. The reactions were ended at different time intervals by washing the epithelial surface with PBS (0.3 ml) and transferring the entire volume to a tube containing 40 μl of 50 mm EDTA. The samples were boiled for 3 min, filtered, and analyzed by HPLC. Synthesis of [3H]ADP and [3H]UDP—Tritiated ADP was obtained from [3H]ATP by an hexokinase reaction, as described previously (8Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μCi of [3H]ATP were incubated with 10 units/ml hexokinase (30 min, 37 °C) in 0.2 ml of KRB. The samples were boiled for 3 min to eliminate the hexokinase activity, and full conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]ADP was confirmed by HPLC. Enzyme Release Assays—Mucosal epithelial surfaces were washed three times with PBS and once with KRB and then incubated in bilateral KRB (350 μl of mucosal/serosal) for 0, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C (5% CO2/95% O2). The conditioned buffer was collected, centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4 °C; 20 min) to remove detached cells and debris. Released ATPase activity was measured by transferring 315 μl to a tube containing 1 mm ATP in 35 μl of KRB (37 °C) and collecting aliquots over time for HPLC analysis. These rates of ATP hydrolysis were compared with measurements performed the next day on the mucosal surface of the same wells to determine the contribution of released enzyme to total surface activity. HPLC Separation of Nucleotides—The separation system consisted of a Dinamax C-18 column and a mobile phase developed with buffer A (10 mm KH2PO4 and 8 mm tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBASH), pH 5.3) from 0–10 min, buffer B (100 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm TBASH, and 10% MeOH, pH 5.3) from 10–20 min, and buffer A from 20–30 min. Absorbance was monitored at 254 nm with an online Model 490 multiwavelength detector (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD), and radioactivity was determined online with a Flo-One radiomatic detector (Packard, Canberra, Australia) as described previously (39Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). RNase Protection Assays—Total RNA and RNase protection assay probes for NS AP were prepared as previously described (34Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was extracted from primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells and amplified by RT-PCR with primers generated from the sequence of human NS AP. The [α32P]CTP-labeled RPA probes were prepared from plasmids containing the NS AP cDNA. The probes were purified by electrophoresis, eluted, and hybridized with 20 μg of total RNA (RPA III kit; Ambion). The protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis and the gels dried on a vacuum dryer (60 °C, 4 h) and exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences). The screen was scanned with an optical scanner (Storm; Amersham Biosciences) and the signals quantified by digital image-analyzing software (ImageQuant; Amersham Biosciences). Sense strand and yeast RNA controls yielded no signal on the gels. Materials—All 5′-nucleotides and adenosine were purchased from Roche Applied Science. KH2PO4, tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate, and HEPES were obtained from Sigma and perfluorocarbon (FC-72) from 3 M (St. Paul, MN). HPLC-grade water was bought from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Cell culture media, bovine serum albumin, bovine pituitary extract, epithelial growth factor, gentamicin, penicillin, retinoic acid, and streptomycin were bought from Invitrogen. [2,83H]ATP (40–50 Ci/mmol) and [2,83H]UTP (40–50 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Salts and solvents were of analytical grade. Data Analysis—Enzyme assays and RNase protection assays were conducted on polarized cultures of airway epithelial cells from at least three healthy donors or three patients diagnosed with CF, PCD, or αAT, unless stated otherwise. Nucleotide metabolism was calculated from the initial linear rate of substrate decay monitored by HPLC and presented as nmoles·min-1·cm-2. Values were expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean. Unpaired Student's t tests were used to assess the significance between two independent data sets. Paired t tests were used for comparisons between mucosal and serosal surfaces of the same culture or between conditioned buffer and the corresponding mucosal surface. All linear regressions, curve fits, and data transformations were performed with PC computer programs Excel, Origin, and Sigma plot. Mechanism of Nucleotide Clearance—We first determined whether extracellular nucleotides are eliminated from human airways by permeation through the epithelial layer and/or by cell surface metabolism. The P2 receptor agonist 0.1 mm [3H]ADP was added to the mucosal surface of bronchial cultures, and buffer samples collected through time were analyzed by HPLC. Fig. 1A indicates that no radiolabeled compound accumulated in the serosal compartment over 60 min, except for traces of [3H]hypoxanthine. Similar results were obtained with 0.1 mm [3H]ATP added to the mucosal surface of human bronchial cultures (34Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reciprocal experiments conducted with 0.1 mm [3H]ADP added to the serosal surface showed that all radiolabeled compounds were confined to the serosal compartment (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that nucleotide clearance in human airways does not involve permeation through the epithelial layer. These experiments also showed that less phosphorylated nucleotides accumulated on the epithelial surface exposed to [3H]ADP (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that P2 receptor agonists may be eliminated by cell surface metabolism. To test this hypothesis, the mucosal surface of bronchial cultures was incubated with 0.1 mm [3H]ATP or [3H]UTP in KRB, and buffer samples collected over 5 min were analyzed by HPLC. Fig. 2A shows that [3H]ATP gradually disappeared and [3H]ADP, [3H]AMP, [3H]adenosine, and [3H]inosine accumulated. Likewise, the epithelial surface eliminated [3H]UTP by a mechanism that generated [3H]UDP, [3H]UMP, and [3H]uridine. The inhibition of concentrative (2 mm phloridzin) (40Leung G.P. Cheung K.H. Tse C.M. Wong P.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and equilibrative (100 μm dipyridamole) (41Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cabrita M.A. Graham K.A. Griffiths M. Jennings L.L. Mackey J.R. Ng A.M. Ritzel M.W. Vickers M.F. Yao S.Y. Pharm. Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 313-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nucleoside/nucleobase transporters accelerated the accumulation of [3H]adenosine, [3H]inosine, and [3H]hypoxanthine from [3H]ATP and of [3H]uridine from [3H]UTP (Fig. 2B), supporting their cell surface production. Accordingly, total radioactivity measured after 5 min corresponded to >90% of initial [3H]ATP or [3H]UTP counts (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these results suggest that P2 receptor agonists are eliminated from human airway epithelia by cell surface dephosphorylation. Mucosal and Serosal Surfaces: Two Distinct Compartments—The permeability experiments suggested that extracellular nucleotide metabolism occurs on both mucosal (Fig. 1A) and serosal (Fig. 1B) surfaces of human airway epithelia. We therefore investigated whether the distinct nucleotide and nucleoside compositions reported for mucosal (adenosine >> AMP > ADP >> ATP) and serosal (ADP = AMP > adenosine [tmt] ATP) surfaces (42Lazarowski E.R. van Heusden C.A. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2001; 22 (suppl.), (abstr.): 193Google Scholar) may reflect local differences in cell surface metabolism. Time course experiments showed that 0.1 mm [3H]ATP, [3H]ADP, and [3H]AMP are all sequentially dephosphorylated on both epithelial surfaces (Fig. 3). However, all three nucleotides were eliminated at 3-fold higher rates on the mucosal surface. Furthermore, mucosal and serosal profiles for [3H]ATP metabolism differed with respect to [3H]ADP and [3H]adenosine production. On the mucosal surface, [3H]ATP dephosphorylation resulted in a transient production of [3H]ADP and a sustained accumulation of [3H]adenosine. The nucleoside represented more than 80% of total reaction products by the end of the incubation period. On the serosal surface, although [3H]ADP and [3H]adenosine concentrations increased steadily, [3H]ADP remained the major reaction product throughout the experiment. These results suggest that local ATP release and metabolism are responsible for the distinct nucleotide/nucleoside composition of human airway epithelial surfaces. Further examination of the time course experiments revealed an additional discrepancy between mucosal and serosal nucleotide metabolism with respect to adenosine production. On the mucosal surface, reactions initiated with 0.1 mm [3H]AMP generated higher adenosine levels than with [3H]ATP or [3H]ADP as substrate (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with our recent finding that ATP and ADP are competitive inhibitors of mucosal ectoAMPase activities on human airway epithelia (34Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, ATP and ADP did not interfere with adenosine production on the serosal surface. Collectively, the above experiments clearly demonstrate that in human airways, mucosal and serosal epithelial surfaces constitute separate and distinct compartments for nucleotide metabolism. Cell-associated and Secreted Ectonucleotidases—These experiments were designed to determine whether extracellular nucleotide metabolism on human airway epithelial surfaces results from the activities of cell-associated or soluble ectonucleotidases. Because all enzymatic assays conducted on the epithelial cultures involved a 30-min preincubation followed by a 30- to 40-min incubation period, enzyme release was assessed in KRB collected after a 0–60-min conditioning period on a mucosal or serosal surface (see “Experimental Procedures”). Primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells were assayed for total and released activities with 1 mm ATP (Fig. 4A). On the mucosal surface, ectoATPase activity released in conditioned KRB increased with exposure time and represented <8% of total surface activity after 60 min. The enzyme fraction remaining on the epithelial surface after conditioned KRB was collected could not be removed by excessive wash (five times) with PBS. On the serosal surface, no significant enzyme activity was detected in conditioned KRB over 60 min. These results suggest that the enzymes supporting nucleotide metabolism on human airway epithelia are cell-associated ectonucleotidases. Impact of PCL Volume on ATP Metabolism—The biochemical characterization of extracellular nucleotide metabolism on the epithelial cultures required an artificially large liquid volume (350 μl). Indeed, the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia in culture is covered by a thin PCL layer of ∼5–10 μm in height (4Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2148397698,"Treatment of human breast tumor cells with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) elevates caspase-8 expression and sensitizes these cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis through the increased processing and activation of apical procaspase-8. We have characterized the human caspase-8 gene promoter and studied the transcriptional regulation of caspase-8 gene expression in MCF-7 breast tumor cells treated with IFN-γ. Our findings show that IFN-γ induces the up-regulation of caspase-8 mRNA expression through a protein synthesis-dependent mechanism involving the action of the IFN-γ-inducible transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and without altering mRNA stability. The human caspase-8 gene promoter lacks recognizable TATA and CAAT boxes but contains a consensus Sp1 binding site. We have identified two major IFN-γ-inducible transcriptional start sites in these cells by S1 nuclease mapping, confirmed by primer extension analysis. Deletion analysis of the promoter defined an 82-bp minimal region responsible for IFN-γ-inducible promoter activity. In this region, we have identified an IFN-stimulated response element that is important for both the basal and IFN-γ-enhanced transcriptional activities. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis demonstrated that IFN-γ induces a complex between an oligonucleotide probe containing the ISRE motif and IRF-1 over a similar time scale to the induction of caspase-8 mRNA. Exogenously expressed IRF-1 in MCF-7 cells up-regulated the activity of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing an 82-bp region of the caspase-8 promoter. These data define a new pathway through which IFN-γ might control the sensitivity of tumor cell to death receptor-mediated apoptosis.

Cytoplasmic death domains in both receptors serve to recruit intracellular adapter molecules that in turn engage procaspase-8, thereby forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase-8 is activated in the DISC, allowing the initiation of a cascade that leads to apoptotic cell death (2Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Death receptor-mediated apoptosis can occur by at least two different pathways (3Scaffidi C. Fulda S.

In one, caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid generates a truncated form that translocates to mitochondria and promotes the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO via a Bax/Bak-dependent mechanism, thus allowing the activation of caspase-9 and effector caspases (4Yamada H.

In contrast, in the mitochondria-independent pathway, activated caspase-8 directly processes and activates the effector caspase-3 (3Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J.

In both pathways, caspase-8 is an indispensable mediator for death receptor-induced apoptosis.Unlike TNF-α or CD95L, TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in tumor cells without being toxic to most normal cells in culture (1Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G.

Moreover, preclinical studies in mice and nonhuman primates have shown no systemic toxicity upon injection of recombinant versions of TRAIL at doses that effectively suppress solid tumors such as colon and mammary carcinomas (7Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TRAIL could be a suitable target in cancer therapy.However, not all types of tumor cell are sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Different mechanisms of resistance exist because apoptotic control can be exerted at many stages, such as the levels of death receptors at the cell surface or the expression of intracellular pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. Recently, several reports have shown that caspase-8 expression and activation may play a critical role in the sensitivity of tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. The expression of the cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein, which blocks the activation of caspase-8 at the DISC, has been suggested to be a major cause of TRAIL resistance (8Siegmund D.

IFN-γ, or type II IFN, is produced mainly by cells of the immune system in response to activation (19Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar) and has an important antitumoral role. The antitumoral response promoted by IFN-γ is the result of different coordinated events that involve both immunologic and nonimmunologic processes. IFN-γ activates cells of the innate immune system such as NK cells, NKT cells, and macrophages to proliferate, produce cytokines, and acquire lytic activity against tumor cells (20Takeda K.

Gajewski T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1095-1100PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IFN-γ can exert direct antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on a wide variety of tumor cells by the induction of cell cycle inhibitors and different apoptosis-related proteins such as death receptors and their respective ligands, caspases, and several members of the Bcl-2 family (24Mandal M.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1122-1129PubMed Google Scholar). We have now studied the regulation of human caspase-8 gene expression in IFN-γ-treated MCF-7 breast tumor cells in detail. We demonstrate that IFN-γ up-regulates caspase-8 mRNA levels without altering mRNA stability, in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. We have also studied the human caspase-8 gene promoter to determine the mechanism by which IFN-γ regulates its transcriptional activity. We identify and characterize an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the promoter region that binds the IFN-γ-inducible transcription factor IRF-1 and is essential for IFN-γ-induced caspase-8 gene promoter activation in breast tumor cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. All restriction enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).Cell Culture—The human breast tumor cell line MCF-7 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. In some experiments, MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml human IFN-γ (PreproTech EC Ltd., London, UK) for the indicated times. The U2A and 2fTGH fibrosarcoma, kindly donated by Dr. G. Stark (The Cleveland Clinic Foundation), and 3T3 cell lines were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamycin.Immunoblot Detection of Proteins—After detachment with trypsin plus 0.25% EDTA, cells (3 × 105) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein content was measured before lysing in Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions. Cell lysates were sonicated, and proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected as described (31Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with a mouse anti-human caspase-8 monoclonal antibody from Cell Diagnostica (Münster, Germany).Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. Twenty micrograms of total RNA were run on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). Membrane-bound RNAs were then hybridized to a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe for caspase-8 (Amersham Biosciences), generated with a random primer labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The caspase-8 cDNA probe was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR, using the following primers for PCR amplification: sense, 5′-GATATTGGGGAACAACTGGAC-3′; antisense, 5′-CATGTCATCATCCAGTTTGCA-3′ (28Ruiz-Ruiz C. Muñoz-Pinedo C. López-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription PCR—cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA isolated from MCF-7 cells by using a RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the supplied oligo(dT) primer under conditions described by the manufacturer. PCRs were performed with the following primers: human IRF-1 sense (5′-CTTAAGAACCAGGCAACCTCTGCCTTC-3′) and antisense (5′-GATATCTGGCAGGGAGTTCATG-3′) and human β-actin sense (5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′) and antisense (5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′). These gave products of 406 and 661 bp, respectively. Cycle conditions for PCRs were 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles.S1 Nuclease Analysis—For nuclease S1 protection assay, we designed the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CAACCAGCCTTCAGACCAGCTCAGACACAAGGTGAAACAGAAACCAAAAACTCAAGCACATG-3′, which spans the 5′-end of the first exon of the longest isoform of caspase-8 cDNA. This oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and then purified on a G25 spin Column (Roche Applied Science). Fifty micrograms of total RNA from MCF-7 cells were precipitated and resuspended into 15 μl of 2× hybridization buffer. The RNA solution was then mixed with 106 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide and 15 μl of formamide, heated at 68 °C for 10 min, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After this incubation, samples were treated with S1 nuclease (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. The S1-digested products were resolved on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel. Four microliters of the nondigested and diluted (1:800) labeled oligonucleotide (i.e. probe) were also run at the same time.Primer Extension Assay—The antisense oligonucleotides PE#1 (5′-CAGGCAGCCACCAGTCACCTTCTT-3′) and PE#2 (5′-CACCTTCTTCTGAAGCTGTTGGCGG-3′), which correspond to sequences located within the 5′-end of the noncoding exon 1 of the human caspase-8 gene, were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of 4–6 × 1010 cpm/μg. 1.5 × 106 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide were mixed with 20 μg of total RNA from control or IFN-γ-treated MCF-7 cells, 2 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and First Strand Buffer. tRNA and total RNA from mouse liver cells were used in place of MCF-7 RNA as negative controls. The samples were heated at 68 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool to 42 °C, at which point the annealed primers were then extended with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 42 °C. The extended products were resolved on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels. Sequencing reactions, performed on a promoter-containing plasmid with the same oligonucleotide (Sequenase Quick-Denature plasmid sequencing kit; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), were run at the same time in order to accurately determine the 5′-end termini.Plasmid Constructs—Different caspase-8 promoter fragments were generated by PCR amplification with KlenTaq-LA polymerase mix (Clontech) with genomic DNA from Jurkat cells as template. The following sense primers were used for the indicated fragments: –1588, 5′-CATGCACAACCCTATGGC-3′; –668, 5′-GCAAGAATTACTATGGC-3′; –197, 5′-CGACAACTCACAGTGC-3′; –162, 5′-GTGTGATAAACGGTGG-3′; –82, 5′-GTGGTTGGAGCAAAGG-3′.A single antisense primer, 5′-GCTCCACCCAGCCTCCATC-3′ (+230), was used to obtain all of the promoter fragments. Numbering is relative to the first nucleotide of exon 1. Constructs pC8-1588luc and pC8-82luc were generated by cloning the corresponding PCR fragments into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the promoterless pXP2 luciferase reporter plasmid, whereas pC8-668luc, pC8-197luc, and pC8-162luc plasmids were created by subcloning the respective PCR promoter fragments into the HindIII site of pXP2-Luc vector.Mutant versions of the luciferase reporter plasmids pC8–197 (pC8-197mt) and pC8-82 (pC8-82mt) were prepared by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GCTCTGAGTTTTTGGTTGATGTTTCACCTTGTGTCTGAGC-3′ and its complementary antisense oligonucleotide. Mutated positions are underlined. The final products of the reactions were sequenced to confirm the introduction of the expected mutations. The pCDNA-IRF-1 plasmid was generously provided by Dr. T. Maniatis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA).Cell Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35-mm tissue culture dish the day before transfection with FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids described above as appropriate and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured in an FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems) according to the instructions of the Luciferase system kit (Promega). Where indicated, cells were treated with IFN-γ for an additional period before measuring luciferase activity. For co-transfection experiments, 0.25 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of the IRF-1 expression plasmid or the empty vector, and 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase vector were mixed with the FuGENE reagent. All transfection experiments were carried out in duplicate. Transfection efficiency was always normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luciferase units.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—For nuclear protein extractions, MCF-7 cells were lysed in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, protease inhibitors, 0.75 mm spermidine, and 0.15 mm spermine) containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were then centrifuged and washed once with a detergent-free hypotonic buffer and incubated in 50 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on a rocking platform at 4 °C. Nuclei were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were immediately stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford procedure.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (32Lorenzo E. Ruiz-Ruiz C. Quesada A.J. Hernandez G. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Rivas A. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10883-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (4 μg) were incubated with 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA carrier and 4 μl of 5× DNA binding buffer (10% polyvinylethanol, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 20 μl for 10 min on ice. Next, 2 μl (5 × 104 cpm/μl) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated at room temperature for 40 min. For competition assays, the nuclear extracts were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide for 10 min at 4 °C before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. Where indicated, 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antisera against IRF-1 (sc-497X) or STAT-1α p91 (sc-345X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the nuclear extracts, which were then maintained for 30 min at 4 °C prior to adding the 32P-labeled probe. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in these studies were as follows: 5′-gatcGTTTTTGGTTTCTGTTTCACCTTGTG-3′ (ISRE sequence located within the promoter of the human caspase-8 gene) and 5′-agctTACAACAGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGC-3′ (GAS sequence from –138 to –107 of the IRF-1 promoter) (33Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar).RESULTSIFN-γ Enhances TRAIL-induced Caspase-8 Activation and Caspase-8 Expression in Breast Tumor Cells—We recently reported that IFN-γ sensitizes breast tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by enhancing the activation of mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways (6Ruiz-Ruiz C. Lopez-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 825-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have further examined this sensitization process by determining the time course of TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation in MCF-7 cells preincubated with IFN-γ. The results presented in Fig. 1 show that processing of procaspase-8 was first observed at 4 h after the addition of TRAIL to MCF-7 cells. In contrast, upon pretreatment with IFN-γ, procaspase-8 cleavage could be clearly detected as early as 2 h after TRAIL receptor activation. This suggests that facilitation by IFN-γ of apical procaspase-8 activation by TRAIL may play a pivotal role in the sensitization observed.The significance of IFN-γ-activated procaspase-8 processing in the mechanism of IFN-γ-induced sensitization to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast tumor cells was also suggested by our previous results demonstrating that IFN-γ up-regulates caspase-8 mRNA as well as protein expression (28Ruiz-Ruiz C. Muñoz-Pinedo C. López-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar). To further define the observed modulation of caspase-8 mRNA by IFN-γ, we tested whether IFN-γ affected the stability of this mRNA. MCF-7 cells were harvested at different times over a 12-h period after the addition of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor actinomycin D, and the level of caspase-8 mRNA was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A, actinomycin D induced a significant decrease in basal caspase-8 mRNA levels after 6 h of exposure, whereas a more substantial reduction was detected at 12 h. Moreover, in cells preincubated with IFN-γ for 12 h before the addition of actinomycin D, a similar time course of reduction in caspase-8 mRNA was observed (Fig. 2B). Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels in Fig. 2, A and B, confirmed that pretreatment with IFN-γ did not increase caspase-8 mRNA stability (data not shown). These data suggest that the up-regulation of caspase-8 mRNA levels by IFN-γ in breast tumor cells is likely to be the result of the induction of caspase-8 gene transcription.Fig. 2IFN-γ treatment does not affect caspase-8 mRNA stability. MCF-7 cells were incubated for the indicated times in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (A). B, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 12 h before incubation with actinomycin D as in A. Expression levels of caspase-8 mRNA were detected by Northern blot analysis. The lower panels show ethidium bromide staining of loaded RNA. Results shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification and Analysis of the 5′ Upstream Region of the Human Caspase-8 Gene—The human caspase-8 gene maps to chromosome 2q33-q34 and contains 13 putative exons, with the ATG start codon located in exon 5 (34Grenet J.

https://openalex.org/W2068094391,"ILKAP is a protein phosphatase 2C that selectively associates with integrin linked kinase, ILK, to modulate cell adhesion and growth factor signaling. We investigated the role of endogenous cellular ILKAP in antagonizing ILK signaling of two key targets, PKB and GSK3β. Silencing of endogenous ILKAP by short interfering RNA (siRNA) stimulated GSK3β phosphorylation at S9, with no effect on PKB S473 phosphorylation. In LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells, transient or stable expression of ILKAP suppressed ILK immune complex kinase activity, demonstrating an interaction between ILKAP and ILK. Consistent with the silencing data, ILKAP inhibition of ILK selectively inhibited S9 phosphorylation of GSK3β without affecting S473 phosphorylation of PKB. The ILKAP-mediated inhibition of S9 phosphorylation was rescued by overexpression of ILK, but not by a dominant-negative ILK mutant. The expression level of cyclin D1, a target of ILK-GSK3β signaling, was inversely correlated with ILKAP protein levels, suggesting that antagonism of ILK modulates cell cycle progression. ILKAP expression increased the proportion of LNCaP cells in G1, relative to vector control cells, and siRNA suppression of ILKAP increased entry of cells into the S phase, consistent with ILK antagonism. Anchorage-independent growth of LNCaP cells was inhibited by ILKAP, suggesting a critical role in the suppression of cellular transformation. Taken together, our results indicate that endogenous ILKAP activity inhibits the ILK-GSK3β signaling axis, and suggest that ILKAP activity plays an important role in inhibiting oncogenic transformation."

In this study we identified a likely candidate for the first mitochondrial flavin-linked sulfhydryl oxidase of the Erv1-type from a photosynthetic organism. The central core of the plant enzyme (AtErv1) exhibits all of the characteristic features of the Erv1/Alr protein family, including a redox-active YPCXXC motif, noncovalently bound FAD, and sulfhydryl oxidase activity. Transient expression of fusion proteins of AtErv1 and the green fluorescence protein in plant protoplasts showed that the plant enzyme preferentially localizes to the mitochondria. Yet AtErv1 has several unique features, such as the presence of a CXXXXC motif in its carboxyl-terminal domain and the absence of an amino-terminally localized cysteine pair common to yeast and human Erv1/Alr proteins. In addition, the dimerization of AtErv1 is not mediated by its amino terminus but by its unique CXXXXC motif. In vitro assays with purified protein and artificial substrates demonstrate a preference of AtErv1 for dithiols with a defined space between the thiol groups, suggesting a thioredoxin-like substrate.

Yeast Erv1p (essential for respiration and vegetative growth) and the human homologue Alrp (augmenter of liver regeneration) were identified as the first mitochondrial sulfhydryl oxidases (1Lee J.-E.

Liver Dis. 2001; 33: 173-180Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Their activity is essential for the survival of the cell, for the biogenesis of mitochondria, and for the supply of cytoplasmic proteins with mitochondrially assembled iron-sulfur clusters (3Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recently, these enzymes have been identified in a large number of different eukaryotic cell types and tissues (4Klissenbauer M. Winters S. Heinlein U.A.O. Lisowsky T. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 1979-1986PubMed Google Scholar). As FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidases, these enzymes use molecular oxygen to form disulfide bonds coupled with the generation of hydrogen peroxide (5Hoober K.L. Thorpe C.

The mitochondrial enzymes have a low enzymatic activity and seem to be adapted to the special requirements of this compartment. The catalytic core of yeast Erv1p comprises only about 100 amino acids and contains the FAD-binding site and the redox-active YPCXXC motif (1Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This highly conserved ERV1 domain is the hallmark of the Erv1/Alr protein family (8Polimeno L. Lisowsky T. Francavilla A.

During evolution, the fusion of the catalytic ERV1 domain with a thioredoxin domain generated a new facile catalyst for disulfide formation with dramatically enhanced enzymatic activity (6Hoober K.L.

The first complete sequence of such an ERV1/thioredoxin fusion protein was derived from a human protein that was differentially expressed as fibroblasts enter quiescence (6Hoober K.L. Glynn N.M.

Based on this phenotype, these proteins were termed quiescin/sulfhydryl oxidases (QSOX). 1The abbreviations used are: QSOX, quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase; At, A. thaliana; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: QSOX, quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase; At, A. thaliana; GFP, green fluorescent protein. In these enzymes, the ERV1 domain contains the FAD-binding site and the redox-active primary CXXC motif. The first structural data for yeast Erv2p (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and human Alrp (13Wu C.-K. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.-C. Rose J. Prot. Sci. 2003; 12: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) exhibit a unique four-helix bundle conformation for FAD binding. Recent publications demonstrate that interdomain redox communication between the primary redox-active CXXC motif and additional cysteine pairs is another characteristic feature of sulfhydryl oxidases (11Raje S. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4560-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The adaptation of sulfhydryl oxidases to specific functions at different subcellular locations seems to correlate with the position and arrangement of these additional cysteine pairs (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Hofhaus G. Lee J.-E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J.

QSOX enzymes are not found in mitochondria but rather at many other subcellular locations and are also excreted from cells (9Thorpe C. Hoober K.L. Raje S. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Turi G.K. Coppock D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). QSOX enzymes have adapted to a broad spectrum of functions for cellular development and are thought to be involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix and in redox regulation of enzymatic activities (5Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The general importance of these enzymes is demonstrated by their presence in all multi-cellular organisms including plants. Recently, data base screening identified two genes for potential QSOX enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana (9Thorpe C. Hoober K.L. Raje S. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Turi G.K. Coppock D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, no mitochondrial sulfhydryl oxidase of the yeast ERV1-type has been described to date for any photosynthetic organism. This prompted us to investigate the model plant A. thaliana for the presence of such a mitochondrial sulfhydryl oxidase.

The presence of the hexahistidyl tag at the carboxyl terminus of the proteins allowed rapid purification on nickelagarose under native conditions in NaCl/phosphate buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) (Qiagen) (1Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The proteins were bound to nickel-agarose and eluted with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Purification to homogeneity was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by antibody tests of Western blots. Finally, the proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Spectroscopy of Plant Erv1p-His6—The isolated 15-kDa protein following nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography was used for spectroscopy. The visible spectrum of this protein solution was recorded with the UV-visible spectrometer Lambda 25 (Perkin Elmer). A reference of purified FAD (Sigma) was measured under identical conditions. Enzymatic Assay for Sulfhydryl Oxidase—Purified plant AtErv1 15-kDa protein (corresponding to 10 pmol of bound FAD/reaction) was incubated in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer (68 mm NaCl, 75 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 3 mm EDTA) together with reduced substrates corresponding to 50 nmol of reduced thiol groups. All of the reactions were carried out at 25 °C. Aliquots of 100 μl were used for each time point. For determination of the thiol content, the 0.1-ml samples were diluted with 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and then 100 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman′s reagent) (23Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20877) Google Scholar, 24Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. After 2 min, the extinction at 412 nm was measured, and the thiol content was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 14 mm-1 × cm-1 (24Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The initial content of thiol groups was determined from a sample without enzyme. Artificial in vitro substrates including cysteine, glutathione, dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, and di-mercaptoethanol were purchased in the reduced form. Recombinant purified bacterial thioredoxin (Calbiochem) from E. coli was reduced with an excess of dithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (for further details see Refs. 1Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 22Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Non reducing SDS-PAGE (gradient gels of 4–12%) (Novex/Invitrogen) was used to separate 200-ng aliquots of 15- and 22-kDa AtErv1. The protein samples were run with or without 20 mm dithiothreitol, as indicated. Membrane-bound proteins were probed with anti-His5 Ig (Qiagen). Bound antibodies were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. Structural Modeling—Partial structural information of yeast Erv2p is available in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1JR8). The crystallized protein is a 119-residue proteolytic fragment of Erv2p that contains the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal domain with FAD-binding site and redox-active CXXC (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This fragment was aligned without gaps with the conserved domain of AtErv1 (residues 76–191). The software package INSIGHT II (www.accelrys.com/insight/index.html) was used to develop the molecular model. Graphical modifications and data files were generated with the Visual Molecular Dynamics Program (25Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35699) Google Scholar). Plants Growth, Protoplast Transformation, and Fluorescence Microscopy—Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated and transfected as described in Ref. 26Kovtun Y. Chiu W.L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar. Typically, 2 × 104 protoplasts were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. Physcomitrella patens was grown on solid minimal NH4 medium (27Ashton N.W. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 87-95Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar) at 25 °C under a 16/8-h light/dark cycle. The protoplasts were isolated from 5–6-day-old protonemal cultures according to Ref. 20Meiri E. Levitan A. Guo F. Christopher D.A. Schaefer D. Zryd J.P. Danon A. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. For transformation of P. patens, 10 μg of plasmid DNA was added to 300 μl of a protoplast suspension. Following gentle mixing, 300 μl of solution containing 40% polyethylene glycol, 0.1 m CaNO3, 0.38 m mannitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0) was added, and the suspension was incubated with occasional mixing for 5 min at 45 °C and for 10 min at room temperature. The protoplast suspension was diluted to a final volume of 7.1 ml with liquid NH4 medium supplemented with 6.8% mannitol and incubated for 16 h in the dark. The fluorescence images were taken 24 h after transformation using a laser confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV500). The images were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, with GFP and chlorophyll images collected through 505–525- and 630-nm filters, respectively. Mitochondria were visualized using the mitochondrial-specific dye MitoTracker (Molecular Probes), with excitation of 543, dichromic mirror of 545, and emission long pass of 560 nm. Miscellaneous Methods—E. coli strains DH5-α (15Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar) and BL21 (Clontech) were used for cloning experiments and amplification of plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli by alkaline lysis (Qiagen kit). Transformation of yeast cells was done with lithium acetate according to a standard protocol (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 3: 253-263Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Purification, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, and analysis of yeast DNA or PCR products on agarose gels were performed using standard techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences of the DNA constructs were determined by automatic DNA sequencing (SeqLab Company, Göttingen, Germany). Cloning of the Plant cDNA for AtERV1—The first aim was to identify putative Erv1 homologues in higher plants. Screening of Arabidopsis sequence data bases with the yeast Erv1 protein sequence identified only one nuclear gene as a possible candidate. The most reliable sequence data were used to synthesize primers for the putative full-length cDNA. These primers (Table III) were included in PCR experiments with an Arabidopsis cDNA library (Clontech). DNA fragments of about 600 bp were amplified. Three independent clones were isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing. All three DNA inserts exhibited identical DNA sequences. The cDNA (AtErv1) contained an open reading frame with the capacity to encode a protein of 191 amino acids (EMBL accession number AJ551263). The comparison of the putative plant protein with yeast Erv2p and yeast and human Erv1p/Alrp is shown in Fig. 1. The central domain with the catalytic core is highly conserved, whereas the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions reveal unique features. Unique CXXXXC Motif and Highly Conserved Central Core— Comparing the sequences of yeast, human, and plant sulfhydryl oxidases identifies a carboxyl-terminal CXXXXC motif as a unique feature of AtErv1 (Fig. 1). Close inspection of the available data bases from the genome sequencing projects of higher plants identified several Erv1 homologues. Notably, a carboxylterminal cysteine pair separated by exactly four amino acids is present in all putative plant Erv1 homologues from dicots and monocots identified thus far (Fig. 2), arguing for the functional importance of the new CXXXXC motif in Erv1 from higher plants. In contrast, the highly conserved central core exhibits all features typical to members of the Erv1/Alr protein family. The available structural data (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) from the conserved central domain of yeast Erv2p (30Sevier C.S. Cuozzo J.W. Vala A. Aslund F. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Hofhaus G. Lill R. Lisowsky T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23486-23491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the first crystallized member of the Erv1/Alr protein family (Protein Data Bank accession number 1JR8), allowed the comparative modeling of AtErv1. The modeled structure of the conserved core from amino acids 76 to 176 of plant AtErv1 is presented in Fig. 3. A four-helix bundle forms the putative FAD-binding site, and the conserved catalytic cysteine pair, YPCXXC, is in close proximity to the isoalloxazine ring. A structural disulfide bridge between a second cysteine pair that is separated by exactly 16 amino acids in Erv1p, Alrp, and Erv2p is also predicted for AtErv1. This disulfide bridge fixes the short fifth α-helix against the four helix-bundle and is important for stabilizing the FAD-binding pocket (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Hofhaus G. Lee J.-E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Expression and Characterization of Recombinant Plant AtErv1—To define the functional characteristics of plant AtErv1 two recombinant proteins with a His6 tag were synthesized in E. coli. The putative full-length protein of 22 kDa and the carboxyl-terminal domain of 15 kDa were successfully expressed. Analysis of the proteins on nonreducing SDS-PAGE demonstrated that both fragments form dimers and multimers (Fig. 4A), indicating that in contrast to the yeast protein, the amino terminus of AtErv1 does not participate in dimerization. Although the cause of multimerization of AtErv1 is yet unknown, it is not unique, because it is typically observed for all Erv1/Alr proteins. In vitro experiments show that multimerization of all these proteins is dependent on the concentration and the number of cysteine residues in mutant proteins (14Hofhaus G. Lee J.-E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For the 22-kDa protein, degradation products were routinely found, indicating increased instability of this gene product. The 15-kDa fragment did not show any prominent degradation products. Therefore further characterization of AtErv1 was performed with the 15-kDa fragment that contained both the redox-active YPCXXC motif and the FAD-binding domain. The disappearance of AtErv1 dimers upon reduction with dithiothreitol (Fig. 4A) indicated that as in Erv1p and Erv2p dimerization of AtErv1 is mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bridge. The conservation of the carboxyl-terminal CXXXXC motif in all plant homologues of AtErv1 suggested that it functionally replaced the amino-terminal cysteine pair of Erv1p. To determine whether the CXXXXC motif participates in an interdisulfide bridge, two mutant forms of AtErv1, one lacking the carboxyl-terminal member of the cysteine pair and a second missing the entire CXXXXC motif, were produced and purified from E. coli. The disappearance of dimer formation in the mutant form lacking the plant conserved carboxyl-terminal cysteine pair and the increased dimer and multimers formation in the single cysteine mutant protein (Fig. 4B) strongly argue for the functional replacement of the amino-terminal cysteine pair of Erv1p by the carboxyl-terminal CXXXXC motif in AtErv1. The presence of FAD in the purified protein was verified by spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The spectrum of the 15-kDa fragment exhibited the characteristic features of a protein-bound FAD moiety. Assays for enzymatic activity using artificial in vitro substrates demonstrated sulfhydryl activities (Fig. 6) with turnover numbers comparable with those reported for the yeast mitochondrial enzyme (1Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Lisowsky T. Lee J.-E. Polimeno L. Francavilla A. Hofhaus G. Digest. Liver Dis. 2001; 33: 173-180Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Like the yeast protein, the plant enzyme did not use mercaptoethanol or glutathione as a substrate. Notably, AtErv1 exhibited a high preference for dithiol reductants and particularly for thioredoxin.Fig. 6In vitro sulfhydryl oxidase activity of AtErv1 with different substrates. Activities of the 15-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment were measured at 25 °C with 10 pm enzyme and 50 nm thiol groups from different substrates (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Turnover numbers were calculated per protein-bound FAD. Three independent measurements were performed for each substrate, and the respective mean values are listed. Standard deviations are indicated by errorbars. The substrates were: reduced bacterial thioredoxin (TRXred), dithiothreitol (DTT), di-mercaptoethanol (Di-ME), cysteine (Cys), β-mercaptoethanol (ME), and glutathione (GSH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Complementation Studies between Yeast erv-ts, Δerv1, and the Plant Enzyme—The available mutants of yeast Erv1p (16Lisowsky T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) allowed in vivo complementation studies with plant Erv1p. For this purpose, the full-length cDNA for AtERV1 was cloned into a yeast expression vector. Neither the erv1-ts mutant nor the deletion mutant could be rescued by the plant enzyme (Fig. 7). To exclude any defects in the import of the plant enzyme into yeast mitochondria, a new set of experiments was initiated where the yeast import sequence from Cytb2 was fused to the amino terminus of AtErv1. This fusion protein also gave no detectable complementation activity in vivo. The presence of the His6 tag, which had been shown previously not to obstruct complementation with the yeast Erv1p or human Alrp proteins, allowed us to readily confirm that the fusion protein is correctly expressed in yeast and imported into mitochondria (data not shown). Thus, despite their sequence similarities, the yeast and plant homologues are also functionally distinct. Localization Experiments in Plant Cells with Fusion Proteins of GFP and AtErv1—Analysis of the AtErv1 sequence with the current computer programs for predicting subcellular localization (MitoProt II, Predotar, PSORT II, SignalP) identified no typical import sequence for mitochondria and even predicted a possible plastid localization (data not shown). Therefore, it was essential to confirm the subcellular localization of this protein in vivo. Two constructs of GFP fused either to the carboxyl terminus (AtErv1-GFP) or the amino terminus of AtErv1 (GFP-AtErv1) were transiently expressed in plant protoplasts from Arabidopsis or Physcomitrella. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of protoplasts expressing the AtErv1-GFP construct revealed the accumulation of GFP in distinct, somewhat spherical, bodies localized outside the chloroplasts in both plants (Fig. 8). Staining the protoplasts expressing the AtErv1-GFP construct with the mitochondria-specific dye, MitoTracker, showed that the GFP fluorescence colocalized with the mitochondria. In contrast, the fluorescence of the reverse orientation GFP-AtErv1 fusion proteins appeared diffuse and outside the mitochondria and chloroplasts (Fig. 8), suggesting that the amino-terminal leader of AtErv1 is required for efficient targeting to the mitochondria. In this communication we describe the cloning and characterization of AtErv1, the first mitochondrial FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase identified from a photosynthetic organism. The central core of the plant enzyme exhibits the characteristic structural and functional features of mitochondrial Erv1p/Alrp sulfhydryl oxidases, whereas the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions show distinct differences. Screening of genomic, cDNA, and protein data bases for A. thaliana identified only one possible candidate for a sulfhydryl oxidase homologous to yeast Erv1p (1Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cloning of the cDNA and sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of an open reading frame that could encode a 191-amino acid protein. The central domain showed perfect alignment with Erv1p/Alrp from yeast and mammals. Structural modeling revealed the highly conserved four-helix bundle for FAD binding, the close proximity of the conserved YPCXXC motif with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, and a cysteine pair that participates in the structural alignment of the fifth short helix in a defined position (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Wu C.-K. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.-C. Rose J. Prot. Sci. 2003; 12: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal domains of AtErv1 display no significant amino acid homologies to other family members. This is a common feature of all Erv1/Alr proteins (8Polimeno L. Lisowsky T. Francavilla A. Ital. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 494-500PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hofhaus G. Stein G. Polimeno L. Francavilla A. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The most significant differences from other Erv1/Alr proteins are the absence of a cysteine pair in the amino-terminal domain of the plant enzyme and the presence of a unique carboxyl-terminal cysteine pair. For the yeast enzyme, it was shown that the amino-terminal cysteine pair is essential for dimerization and interdomain redox communication, and thus this cysteine pair is indispensable for its in vivo function (14Hofhaus G. Lee J.-E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The functional replacement of such an aminoterminal cysteine pair by a carboxyl-terminal CGC motif has recently been described for Erv2p, a second yeast sulfhydryl oxidase that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, the additional amino- or carboxyl-terminal cysteine pairs that transfer disulfides, initially generated at the primary YPCXXC motif, appear to be a unique hallmark of the enzymatic mechanism of sulfhydryl oxidases bearing the Erv1p/Alrp domain (11Raje S. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4560-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, an additional indication for the functional conservation of an additional cysteine pair in all mitochondrial Erv1/Alrp proteins is illustrated by recent studies of avian QSOX, demonstrating that the formation of a divalent metal ion-binding site by the ERV1/ALR domain and a second CXXC motif requires the two cysteine pairs (32Brohawn S.G. Miksa I.R. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11074-11082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that so far the physiological role of metal binding by QSOX or Erv1p/Alrp has yet to be addressed experimentally. The disulfide transfer reaction by the amino- or carboxyl-terminal cysteine pair is important for the interaction with substrate molecules or peptides in vivo (14Hofhaus G. Lee J.-E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this respect it is highly significant that the plant enzyme contains a new cysteine pair near its carboxyl terminus that functionally replaces the intermolecular disulfide-mediated dimerization of the protein by the amino-terminal cysteine pair in Erv1p and Alrp, because this might indicate that the plant enzyme developed an alternative mechanism for the transfer of the disulfide bond from the primary redox center to possible mitochondrial substrates. The strict conservation of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine pair with always exactly four amino acids between these two residues in the available Erv1 sequences of all spermatophyta is a further indication for a unique specificity of the plant protein. The specific structural feature of the CXXXXC motif at the carboxyl terminus of the plant enzyme is a plausible explanation why the plant enzyme cannot substitute for the yeast enzyme in vivo despite its highly conserved catalytic core. Even enforced mitochondrial import of the plant enzyme into the intermembrane space of yeast mitochondria via the highly efficient pre-Cytb2 import sequence did not result in functional complementation. Nevertheless, it is highly likely that plant AtErv1 and yeast Erv1p, which clearly evolved from the same ancestral enzyme and are both localized to the mitochondria, share similar organellar functions. Yet the more complex requirements in a photosynthetic multicellular organism may have resulted in adaptation of AtErv1 to new substrates and functions that are not present in the unicellular yeast. Our experiments demonstrate that the targeting of full-length Arabidopsis plant enzyme to mitochondria is conserved because it also efficiently localized in vivo to mitochondria of a lower plant, Physcomitrella. The failure of the current computer programs to identify a mitochondrial import sequence for AtErv1 is not surprising in light of the fact that proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space have individual and peculiar import pathways and therefore do not exhibit a conserved consensus targeting sequence (33Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, none of the known mitochondrial Erv1/Alr proteins show any detectable processing of the amino terminus after import into mitochondria (2Lisowsky T. Lee J.-E. Polimeno L. Francavilla A. Hofhaus G. Digest. Liver Dis. 2001; 33: 173-180Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 34Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although we found no experimental evidence that AtErv1 is localized to plastids, it cannot be ruled out that a small fraction of AtErv1 is also directed toward this compartment. Our data show that the central core of AtErv1 has all the characteristic structural and functional properties of mitochondrial Erv1p/Alrp sulfhydryl oxidases. AtErv1 forms homodimers, and similarly to yeast Erv1p, its in vitro activity shows a high preference for dithiol reductants, in particular for reduced thioredoxin, over monothiol reductants, such as cysteine, glutathione, and mercaptoethanol. Hence, it is plausible that a dithiol oxidoreductase, such as thioredoxin or protein disulfide isomerase, is an essential redox partner for the mitochondrial Erv1p. An additional argument for functional interactions between Erv1p/Alrp enzymes and thioredoxin-like proteins is suggested by the structure of the QSOX enzymes, in which the ERV1 domain was physically linked with a thioredoxin domain during evolution. Notably, the QSOX enzymes exhibit dramatically enhanced enzymatic activity (9Thorpe C. Hoober K.L. Raje S. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Turi G.K. Coppock D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and its truncated form lacking the thioredoxin-like domain displayed 1000-fold slower activity (11Raje S. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4560-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to notice that a recent study identified a mitochondrial thioredoxin system in plants (35Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One specific essential function of Erv1p in yeast concerns the presence of an iron/sulfur cluster assembly mechanism inside mitochondria, which is also required for cytosolic iron/sulfur protein assembly (36Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical experiments suggested that yeast Erv1p interacts with the ABC transporter Atm1p of the inner mitochondrial membrane for the export of iron/sulfur clusters from mitochondria (3Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recent studies identified the first components of an iron/sulfur assembly machinery in plant mitochondria and demonstrated that the plant mitochondrial ABC transporter, Sta1, is a functional homologue of yeast Atm1p (37Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Storozhenko S. Davey M.W. Papenbrock J. De Rycke R. Engler G. Stephan U.W. Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. Van Montagu M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This indicates that plant mitochondria also contribute to the cytosolic assembly of iron sulfur clusters. Furthermore, the recent finding of a plastid-localized cysteine desulfurase encoded by the nuclear gene, AtNFS2, from A. thaliana (38Leon S. Touraine B. Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Leon S. Touraine B. Ribot C. Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggests that plastids could harbor a eubacterial Fe/S cluster synthesis mechanism of their own. It will be interesting to identify the specific adaptations of the AtErv1 enzyme to the requirements of plant mitochondria and the specific substrates present in these organelles. Furthermore, it is important to determine whether a fraction of plant Erv1 is also present at other subcellular locations in a manner similar to Erv1p/Alrp in mammals and whether the enzyme takes part in redox regulation of cellular development via modification of specific thiol groups in target proteins (9Thorpe C.

Increased DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferse (Dnmt1) activity is involved in the mechanism of transformation by both oncogenes, suggesting that inappropriate epigenetic transcription regulation may be a common route of oncogenesis, and that cell transformation may model aspects of the epigenetic deregulation that often occurs in tumors. Here, we have taken a microarray-based gene expression approach to identify differentially expressed genes in cells transformed by c-fos, v-fos, ras or Dnmt1. The cohort of genes differentially expressed in all four transformation systems includes an over-representation of repressed genes, many of which have been functionally implicated in the suppression of transformation or tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we identified four potential tumor suppressor genes subject to epigenetic transcriptional repression in transformed cells. The results emphasize the role of transcription repression in oncogenesis, and they provide insights into the potential common epigenetic mechanisms impacting cell transformation."

Because the inner structure, Galβ1-4GlcNAc, is found commonly in various glycoproteins and glycolipids, and the terminal sulfo-3-glucuronyl group is essential for both immunoreactivity with HNK-1 monoclonal antibodies (16Ilyas A.A. Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. Costello C. Quarles R.H. J. Neurochem. 1988; 55: 594-601Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and for their functions (17Schmitz B. Schachner M. Ito Y. Nakano T. Ogawa T. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the terminal structure is unique and important. Therefore, in order to elucidate the functions of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope, it is important to characterize the enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway, which are unique to the HNK-1 epitope. The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope is synthesized in a stepwise manner through the addition of β-1,3-linked glucuronic acid (GlcA) 1The abbreviations used are: GlcA, glucuronic acid; UDP-GlcA, uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ASOR, asialo-orosomucoid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. by glucuronyltransferase(s) to precursor N-acetyllactosamine followed by the addition of sulfate group by sulfotransferase(s).

These enzymes catalyze the transfer of GlcA from a donor substrate, uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), to a reducing terminal residue of oligosaccharide chain in the presence of manganese.

To elucidate acceptor substrate specificity of GlcAT-P, we overexpressed it in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized acceptor substrate specificity in vitro. We then solved crystal structures of GlcAT-P in four different forms: (1) apo-form, (2) with UDP-GlcA and Mn2+, (3) with UDP-GlcA, Mn2+, and an acceptor substrate analogue, N-acetyllactosamine, and (4) with UDP-GlcA, Mn2+, and a natural acceptor substrate, an asparagine-linked biantennary nonasaccharide. Based on the structural and biochemical results, we describe the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition of HNK-1 associated glucuronyltransferase, GlcAT-P. Materials—UDP-[14C] glucuronic acid (12.1 GBq/mmol) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) was prepared by hydrolysis of orosomucoid in 0.05 m H2SO4 at 80 °C for 1 h. An asparagine-linked biantennary nonasaccharide conjugated with Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group) was prepared according to the method described previously (35Kajihara Y. Suzuki Y. Sasaki K. Juneja L.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 44-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). N-Acetyllactosamine and lacto-N-biose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lacto-N-neotetraose was kindly provided by Dr. Koizumi (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd.). Protein Expression and Purification—The coding region of the catalytic domain of GlcAT-P was amplified from a cloned human GlcAT-P cDNA (24Mitsumoto Y. Oka S. Sakuma H. Inazawa J. Kawasaki T. Genomics. 2000; 15: 166-173Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as a template by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into a bacterial expression vector, pET-28a(+) (Novagen). The expressed protein contained the following sequence: Leu83-Ile334 (the amino acid positions of human GlcAT-P are shown by superscript numbers). An E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene), which was transformed with the plasmid, was cultivated in an LB broth containing 0.4% glucose and 20 μg/ml kanamycin at 30 °C by vigorous aeration, and then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0. After centrifugation of the sonicated cell suspension, a cleared lysate was diluted by addition of an equal volume of the same buffer, and then applied to an open column, which was made from Hi-trap Heparin HP (Amersham Biosciences) resin. The column was washed with a 0.4 m NaCl buffer, 10× column volume, and then eluted by a 0.75 m NaCl buffer. The fractions containing GlcAT-P were collected, diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer to adjust the NaCl concentration to 0.45 m, and then loaded to the Hi-Trap Heparin HP column. The sample was eluted by NaCl gradient (0.45-0.75 m), and the fractions containing GlcAT-P were collected. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 8.0 by addition of 1 m Tris. Hi-Trap Chelating (Amersham Biosciences) column was charged with bivalent metal ions by flowing 0.1 m CuSO4 and then equilibrated with a buffer containing of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The sample was then loaded onto the column, washed with the same buffer, eluted by glycine gradient (0-50 mm), and the GlcAT-P-containing fractions were collected. Then, the sample was diluted to the NaCl concentration of 0.25 m, loaded to the Hi-Trap Heparin HP column, which had been equilibrated with 0.25 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, washed with 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, and eluted with 0.7 m NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0. The peak fractions were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Millipore UFV4BCC25 at 2,000 rpm. The yield of GlcAT-P protein sample was 1 mg per 2 liters of culture. Enzymatic Assay—The glucuronyltransferase activity for ASOR or oligosaccharides was measured as described previously (21Oka S. Terayama K. Kawashima C. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. An equivalent amount of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (ASOR) or 3 h (oligosaccharides) in a reaction mixture, with a final volume of 50 μl, containing 100 mm MES (pH 6.5), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm MnCl2, 20 μg ASOR, or 200 μm oligosaccharide, 100 μm UDP-[14C]GlcA (200,000 dpm). In the case of ASOR, the assay mixture was spotted onto a 2.5-cm Whatman No.1 disc after incubation of the mixture. The disc was washed with a 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution three times, followed by washing with ethanol/ether (2:1, v/v) and then with ether. The disc was air-dried, and the radioactivity of [14C]GlcA-ASOR was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6000). In the case of oligosaccharides, the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The products were then separated by passing through anion exchange resin AG1-X4 (1 ml), which had been equilibrated with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The column was washed with 5 ml of the buffer, and the flow-through and washing fractions were collected. The radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6000). Crystallization—Crystallization conditions for the apo-form of GlcAT-P were screened using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The apo-form of GlcAT-P was crystallized in 2.0-μl hanging drops over 0.2-ml reservoirs containing 20% (w/v) PEG2000MME, and 0.24 m di-sodium tartrate. The crystals were grown to 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm in 2-3 days at 289 K. For data collection, the crystals were transferred to a mother liquor solution containing 15% glycerol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. To obtain the ternary (and quaternary) complex crystals of the GlcAT-P, the apo-form crystals were soaked into the buffer containing 20% (w/v) PEG2000MME, 0.24 m di-sodium tartrate, 15% glycerol, 10 mm UDP-GlcA, 10 mm MnCl2 (and 10 mmN-acetyllactosamine) for 0.5-6 h, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. To obtain crystals of the GlcAT-P in complex with Mn2+, UDP and asparagine-linked bi-antennary nonasaccharide, 10 mm UDP-GlcA, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm asparagine-linked bi-antennary nonasaccharide were added to the protein solution and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the mixture was crystallized in 2.0-μl hanging drops over 0.2 ml reservoirs containing 20% (w/v) PEG2000MME, and 0.1 m MES-NaOH (pH 6.0). X-ray Data Collection and Processing—For crystal structure analysis, the data sets were collected at 100 K with synchrotron radiation at PF-AR-NW12 and were processed using HKL2000 (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Computer-aided Model Building—The structure of the complete substrate-enzyme complex was calculated by adding a GlcA moiety to the crystal structure of the quaternary complex (UDP-GlcA, Mn2+, and N-acetyllactosamine) since the x-ray structure of the quaternary complex did not show electron density for the GlcA moiety of the UDP-GlcA. The UDP moiety in the crystal structure was modified by adding the GlcA residue at the β-phosphate oxygen, and the UDP-GlcA structure was modified by energy minimization at the binding cleft. The initial conformation of the glucuronyl group was selected at the binding cleft by searching a proper position for the SN2-type reaction with the hydroxyl group of the galactose residue of N-acetyllactosamine. Several water molecules overlapped with the newly introduced glucuronyl group were removed, and only the remaining water molecules were energy-minimized, using Discover 3 (version 98.0, Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA). After capping solvent water provided from the Assembly module of Insight II (version 2000, Molecular Simulations Inc), the complex structure was energy-minimized until the final root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) became less than 0.1 kcal/mol/Å. During this minimization, residues longer than 10 Å away from the substrates, UDP-GlcA and N-acetyllactosamine, all Cα atoms, and the Mn2+ atom were fixed. All minimizations and molecular dynamics calculations were carried out under the same conditions, unless otherwise mentioned. The entire system was then covered by solvent water (20 Å thick) and these solvent water molecules were fixed in the following molecular dynamics calculation. The energy-minimized complex structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics calculations at 298 K with the cell multipole method, a distance-dependent dielectric constant, and a time step of 1 fs for 100 ps by sampling conformations every 1 ps using Discover 3. One hundred conformations were minimized in this way until the final r.m.s.d. became less than 0.1 kcal/mol/Å, and the lowest energy conformation was selected as an optimized structure. To generate a model for lacto-N-biose in the acceptor binding site of GlcAT-P, the 1,4-glycosidic bond of N-acetyllactosamine was changed to a 1,3-glycosidic bond maintaining the position of the galactose residue in the substrate-binding cleft. Water molecules, which collide with the N-acetylglucosamine residue, were removed. Following an energy minimization of the remaining water molecules using Discover 3, the cap water molecules were added at the acceptor binding site within 20 Å from the reaction center at C1 of the glucuronic acid moiety, and the complex structure was optimized by the minimization/molecular dynamics procedures described above. A Lewis X structure was generated by connecting α-l-fucose residue to C-3-OH of N-acetyllactosamine in the substrate-binding cleft. After removal of water molecules that collide with the fucose residue, the complex structure was optimized by the minimization/molecular dynamics procedure within the water shell described above. Overall Structure of GlcAT-P—The recombinant protein was designed as an N-terminal truncated form because the GlcAT-P is a type II membrane protein and its N terminus contains a transmembrane and a stem regions. The truncated GlcAT-P (residues 83-334) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified protein showed a glucuronyltransferase activity, transfer of GlcA from UDP-GlcA to a donor substrate (described below). It indicates that the recombinant enzyme purified from E. coli maintains the activity of the natural enzyme (23Terayama K. Seiki T. Nakamura A. Matsumori K. Ohta S. Oka S. Sugita M. Kawasaki T. J.

J. 2000; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using the recombinant protein, we succeeded in obtaining crystals of GlcAT-P in a variety of conditions: apo, with a donor substrate and manganese, and another with additional acceptor substrate. We first solved the structure of the apo-form of GlcAT-P by the molecular replacement method using the catalytic domain of GlcAT-I (PDB code: 1FGG) as a search model at 1.85 Å (Tables I and II). The asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice contains one protein dimer as in the GlcAT-I crystal structure (31Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 1). One of the two molecules, molecule B, in the asymmetric unit has a longer disordered region (residues 151-162) than the other molecule A (residues 157-161). Therefore, the structure of molecule A is described here. The overall structure of GlcAT-P is a GT-A fold (33Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with a Rossmann-like fold consisting of twelve β-strands and seven α-helices (Fig. 2). It is divided into two regions as in the case of GlcAT-I. These two regions are connected by the DXD motif (Asp195-Asp196-Asp197), which are conserved in many UDP-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (33Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region (residues 83-197), referred to as a UDP-sugar binding region, contains an α/β Rossmann-like fold, β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3′-α3-β4, and the β-strands form a parallel β-sheet (order: β4-β1-β2-β3).

However, the effects of leptin resistance on leptin-regulated metabolic processes and the biochemical defects that cause leptin resistance are poorly understood. We have addressed in rats the effect of dietinduced obesity (DIO), a situation of elevated tissue lipid levels, on the well described lipid-lowering effect of leptin in liver, an action that is proposed to be important for the prevention of tissue lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. In addition, we have addressed the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in mediating the acute effects of leptin on hepatic lipid levels in lean and DIO animals. A 90-min leptin (∼10 ng/ml) perfusion of isolated livers from lean animals decreased triglyceride levels by 42 ± 5% (p = 0.006). However, leptin concentrations ranging from ∼10 to ∼90 ng/ml had no effect on triglyceride levels in livers from DIO animals. The acute lipid-lowering effect of leptin on livers from lean animals was mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism, because wortmannin and LY294002, the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, blocked the effects of leptin on hepatic triglyceride levels and leptin increased liver PI 3-kinase activity by 183 ± 6% (p = 0.003) and insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation by 185 ± 30% (p = 0.02) in the absence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Contrary to the effects of leptin in lean livers, leptin did not activate PI 3-kinase in livers from DIO rats. These data present evidence for a role for 1) leptin resistance in contributing to the excessive accumulation of tissue lipid in obesity, 2) PI 3-kinase in mediating the acute lipid-lowering effects of leptin in liver, and 3) defective leptin activation of PI 3-kinase as a novel mechanism of leptin resistance.

However, despite substantial progress, our understanding of the consequences of leptin resistance for the metabolic actions of leptin and the molecular defects causing leptin resistance remains vague. Metabolic abnormalities arising from defective leptin action are most clear in leptin-deficient states caused by leptin gene mutations or lipodystrophy in humans or rodents. These states are characterized by hyperlipidemia, excessive storage of lipid in tissues such as liver and skeletal muscle, and insulin resistance, defects that are markedly improved by administration of leptin (4Farooqi I.S.

The current study was undertaken to address each of these issues. Specifically, we determined the effects of DIO in rats on the acute triglyceride-lowering effects of leptin in liver. Additionally, we addressed the role of STAT3, PI 3-kinase, and PDE3B activation in the regulation of hepatic triglyceride levels by leptin and determined whether these mechanisms are defective in obesity. The data demonstrate that DIO rat liver is resistant to the acute lipid-lowering effects of leptin, that leptin acts directly on liver through a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism to decrease liver triglyceride levels, and that a mechanism of hepatic leptin resistance is defective leptin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates a role for impaired activation of PI 3-kinase by leptin in leptin resistance. Animal Care and Maintenance—Male Wister rats were purchased from Charles River (Madison, WI) at a weight of 175–200 g. After arrival, rats were maintained on a constant 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to water and ad libitum fed with standard rat chow diet (11% of calories from fat), a high fat diet (TD 96001, 45% of calories from fat, Harlan Teklad, Madison WI) for 3 days or 5–6 weeks or a highly palatable diet (Catalog 9389, 33% of calories from fat, Purina Mills Ltd.)

All of the experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pittsburgh and were in accordance with the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Isolated Liver Perfusion System—The isolated liver perfusion system consisted of a peristaltic pump (model 66, Harvard Apparatus, Boston, MA), silicone tubing, a scaled flask serving as a perfusate reservoir in a heated bath, an air bubble trap, and a humidified and a thermostatically controlled (37 °C) perfusion chamber (Microplate Incubator, Model 260700, Boekel Scientific, Feasterville, PA). Oxygenation of the perfusate was accomplished by directing 95% O2, 5% CO2 through ∼3.6 meters of gas-permeable silastic tubing coiled in the perfusate reservoir (0.76-mm inner diameter, 1.65-mm outer diameter, Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI).

The hepatic portal vein was isolated from the hepatic artery and the bile duct and was cannulated by inserting a 16-gauge needle (Protective Acuvance, Johnson & Johnson Medical Division/Ethicon, Inc., Arlington, TX). The needle was secured by pre-placed sutures and then connected to the perfusion system. Perfusion of the liver with oxygenated buffer began immediately, ensuring that total time of ischemia was <10 s. The thoracic vena cava was then exposed and severed, and the abdominal aorta and vena cava were ligated above the kidneys. The liver was rapidly excised, and a PE-260 catheter was inserted and secured into the opening of the thoracic vena cava before the liver was transferred onto a liver platform inside the perfusion chamber. Total surgery time was ∼5 min. Experimental Design—Livers were perfused with sterile-filtered Krebs-Henseleit buffer (25 mm NaHCO3, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2) containing 4 mm d-(+)-glucose, 10 mm l-lactate, and 0.2% BSA in a re-circulating system at the rate of ∼2.7 ml min–1 g–1 liver. After a 30-min equilibration period, recombinant rat leptin (R&D systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) in Krebs-Henseleit buffer or Krebs-Henseleit buffer alone (vehicle) was admixed into the portal vein perfusate using a syringe pump (Model 11, Harvard Apparatus) at a rate of 270 ng/min for 12 min and thereafter at a rate of 35 ng/min for the remainder of the 90-min perfusion period. This administration regime was based on pilot studies with a 400-ml recirculating volume and ensured that the leptin concentration in the perfusate reached a steady state rapidly and remained constant throughout the 90-min perfusion (Fig. 1). In experiments requiring higher perfusate leptin concentrations, the rate of leptin delivery was increased accordingly (3- or 9-fold). For experiments requiring the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (final concentration 100 nm, Sigma) or LY294002 (final concentration 10 μm, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or the PDE3B inhibitor, cilostamide (final concentration 1 μm, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), livers were perfused for 30 min with the inhibitors prior to a 90-min co-perfusion of the inhibitors with either vehicle or leptin. Liver viability during the experiment was assessed by tissue color, perfusate flow, perfusate pH and potassium concentration, and liver oxygen consumption (31Gores G.J. Kost L.J. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 1986; 6: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The pH (∼7.4) and potassium (∼4.8 mm) values of the perfusate were unchanged throughout the experiment, indicating an absence of hepatocyte damage (31Gores G.J. Kost L.J. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 1986; 6: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was above 1.2 μmol/min/g tissue throughout the experiments, indicating adequate oxygen delivery and extraction for normal hepatic function (31Gores G.J. Kost L.J. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 1986; 6: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 32Schmucker D.L. Jones A.L. Michielsen C.E. Lab. Investig. 1975; 33: 168-175PubMed Google Scholar). The calculation of the oxygen consumption was based on the difference in oxygen concentration of the perfusate before and after the liver. Perfusate and Tissue Measurements—Perfusate leptin concentration was measured using a rat-specific RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Oxygen and potassium concentrations and pH of the perfusate were measured by a gas analyzer (Rapidlab 348, Bayer Corporation, Norwood, MA). Intrahepatic triglycerides were determined as described previously (33Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ∼50 mg of frozen liver tissue was extracted in 1 ml of a chloroform-methanol mixture (2:1). After re-dissolving the lipid pellet with 60 μl of tert-butanol and 40 μl of Triton X-114-methanol (2:1) mixture, the triglycerides were measured spectrophotometrically (Beckman DU 530) using the GPO-triglyceride kit (Sigma) and Lintrol lipids as standard (Sigma). PI 3-kinase activity was assayed according to a standard protocol. Immunoprecipitation of active PI 3-kinase was achieved by incubating 250 μg of liver protein from homogenized tissue with 3 μg of α-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, New York, NY) for 2 h followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose for 1.5 h (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C with phosphatidylinositol (10 μg, Avanti Polar Lipids Inc, Alabaster, AL) in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 32P-Containing PI(3)P was separated by TLC and was quantitated by scraping the PI(3)P spot from the TLC plate followed by scintillation counting. For quantification of phosphorylation of IRS-1, 500 μg of liver protein was immunoprecipitated overnight with α-IRS-1 and the immunocomplexes were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and probed with α-phosphotyrosine (PY20, 1:1000, CRP Inc., Denver, PA) or α-phosphoserine-IRS-1 (Ser-612, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Beverly, MA) antibodies. Leptin receptor protein level was determined by immunoblotting using an α-leptin receptor antibody (K-20, 1:3000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and α-goat IgG-HRP (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Leptin receptor mRNA was measured using the ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). Radiolabeled ([α-32P]UTP) riboprobes were synthesized from rat leptin receptor cDNA fragments that were specific for the rat long form receptor mRNA (ObRb mRNA, GenBank™ accession number U52966) or that recognized all of the rat leptin receptor isoform mRNAs (ObRtot mRNA, GenBank™ accession number U53144) as described previously (34Sahu A. Nguyen L. O'Doherty R.M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2002; 14: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A rat-specific β-actin riboprobe served as an internal control. RPAs were performed as described previously (34Sahu A. Nguyen L. O'Doherty R.M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2002; 14: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The antisense riboprobes (1 × 105 cpm) were incubated with 10–20 μg of total RNA for 18 h at 45 °C in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX). After hybridization, 200 μl of digestion buffer containing a 1:100 dilution of a RNase A/RNase T1 mixture (Ambion) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. RNase digestion was stopped, and the reaction products were precipitated and size-fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide-denaturing gel. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were scanned (Hewlett Packard Scanjet 6300C), and the image was quantitated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Values for ObRb mRNA and ObRtot mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase activity (AMPK) was measured by quantifying the incorporation of 32P into a synthetic substrate peptide-HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR (SAMS) as described previously (35Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). AMPK was extracted from a liver homogenate using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method (35Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured colorimetrically. Subsequently, AMPK activity was measured in a 25-μl total volume in the presence of a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 80 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, and [γ-32P]ATP/Mg at 30 °C for 5 min. Statistical Methods—All of the results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's unpaired t test using the Systat statistical program (Evanston, IL). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. The Acute Lipid-lowering Effects of Leptin on Liver Are Absent in Diet-induced Obesity—We first compared the effects of leptin on liver triglyceride levels in perfused isolated livers from lean and diet-induced obese animals. In initial experiments, recombinant leptin was admixed into the perfusate at a rate that resulted in a steady-state leptin concentration in the perfusate of ∼10 ng/ml (Fig. 1), consistent with physiological leptin concentrations in rodents. A 90-min leptin perfusion decreased liver triglyceride levels by 42 ± 5% (p = 0.006) in livers from lean animals compared with vehicle-perfused control livers (Fig. 2). Leptin also increased liver oxygen consumption by 292 ± 21% (p = 0.02) compared with vehicle-perfused controls, demonstrating a leptin-induced increase in oxidative processes (Fig. 3). However, the activity of AMPK, a proposed mediator of leptin effects on fatty acid oxidation, was similar in leptin-perfused compared with saline-perfused livers (736 ± 12 versus 699 ± 30 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, n = 4). In livers from rats fed for 5–6 weeks on a high fat diet to induce obesity (DIO), hepatic triglycerides levels were increased by 98 ± 3% (p < 0.0001) compared with livers from lean animals (Fig. 2). Contrary to the triglyceride-lowering effects of leptin on livers from lean animals, leptin had no effects on triglyceride levels in livers from DIO rats (Fig. 2). Furthermore, liver oxygen consumption was similar in vehicle-perfused and leptin-perfused DIO livers (Fig. 3), demonstrating that acute leptin effects on oxidative processes were absent in DIO. Because plasma leptin concentration is elevated in DIO, we hypothesized that triglyceride levels in livers from DIO rats would be reduced by increasing leptin in the perfusate to concentrations associated with obesity. Surprisingly, this was not the case. Livers from DIO animals perfused with a leptin concentration of ∼30 or ∼90 ng/ml had similar levels of triglycerides as vehicle-perfused livers (data not shown). These data demonstrate that livers from DIO animals were completely refractory to the acute lipid-lowering effects of leptin. Recently, Wang et al. (28Wang J. Obici S. Morgan K. Barzilai N. Feng Z. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2786-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) reported that 3 days of feeding of a highly palatable diet that increased caloric intake by ∼2-fold resulted in the development of resistance to the effects of leptin on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. After 3 days of the high fat diet, leptin at a concentration of ∼10 ng/ml was sufficient to decrease liver triglyceride levels by 37 ± 6% (p = 0.008) (Fig. 4). However, unlike the study of Wang et al. (28Wang J. Obici S. Morgan K. Barzilai N. Feng Z. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2786-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), rats on the high fat diet used in this study do not increase caloric intake compared with chow-fed controls (33Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, with 3 days feeding of the highly palatable diet (28Wang J. Obici S. Morgan K. Barzilai N. Feng Z. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2786-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), rats increased caloric intake (from 72 ± 3 to 112 ± 4 kcal/day, p = 0.001) and triglyceride levels were not significantly reduced by leptin, indicating the presence of leptin resistance (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Effects of 90 min of leptin perfusion on oxygen consumption in livers from lean and diet-induced obese rats. Livers were isolated and perfused as described in Fig. 1. Oxygen consumption was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as percentage change in oxygen consumption (0 versus 90 min) in leptin-perfused (Leptin +) livers compared with corresponding vehicle-perfused livers (Leptin –) at the end of the 90-min perfusion period.

Subsequently, livers were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized, and triglyceride content was measured.

Of these, leptin activation of PI 3-kinase (24Burcelin R. Kamohara S. Li J. Tannenbaum G.S. Charron M.J. Friedman J.M.

We hypothesized first that the activation of one or a subset of these signaling elements would be required for the lipid-depleting effects of leptin on liver and second that defects in leptin activation of these pathways may contribute to hepatic leptin resistance in DIO. As a first step in addressing these hypotheses, we determined the effects of wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (10 μm), two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase activity, and cilostamide (1 μm), a PDE3B-specific inhibitor, on the lipid-lowering effects of leptin (Fig. 5). Co-perfusion of wortmannin or LY294002 with leptin completely blocked the lipid-depleting effects of leptin on livers from lean rats, demonstrating that PI 3-kinase activation is necessary for the effects of leptin on hepatic lipid levels. Conversely, cilostamide was unable to prevent the leptin-induced decrease in liver triglycerides (24 ± 5%, p = 0.01), demonstrating that PDE3B activation is not required for the lipid-reducing effects of leptin. Furthermore, in the absence of inhibitors, leptin increased hepatic PI 3-kinase activity by 183 ± 6% (p = 0.003) and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by 185 ± 30% (p = 0.02) compared with vehicle-perfused control livers (Fig. 6, panels A, C, and D). In agreement with previous reports (36Kim Y.B. Uotani S. Pierroz D.D. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2328-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Rizk N.M. Stammsen D.

Polyglutamine or polyalanine expansions cause several neurodegenerative diseases. To examine the properties of HPAAs, we expressed 20 kinds of 30-residue HPAA fused to the C terminus of yellow fluorescent protein in mammalian cells. Specific localization was observed depending on the HPAA. Polyarginine and polylysine aggregated in the nucleus. Polyalanine, polyhistidine, polyisoleucine, polyleucine, polymethionine, polyphenylalanine, polythreonine, polytryptophan, and polyvaline localized in the cytoplasm, and some of these HPAAs formed aggregate(s). Hydrophobic HPAAs such as polyisoleucine, polyleucine, polyphenylalanine, and polyvaline were found as one major aggregate or cumulus in the perinuclear region. Western blot analysis indicated that hydrophobic HPAA tracts appear to oligomerize and form high molecular weight complexes. These results indicate that hydrophobicity itself may trigger the oligomerization and aggregation of proteins when overexpressed in cells.

In the human genome, there are many repetitive sequences, including trinucleotide repeats (triplet repeat) (1Kashi Y. King D. Soller M.

HPAA tracts exist in many proteins, including a variety of transcription factors. Some HPAA-containing proteins are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. At least nine inherited neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and six forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 4Nakamura K. Jeong S.Y. Uchihara T. Anno M. Nagashima K. Nagashima T. Ikeda S. Tsuji S. Kanazawa I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1441-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) are caused by the expansion of trinucleotide (CAG) repeats encoding polyglutamine. These are adult onset diseases involving the progressive degeneration of the nervous system. The presence of a polyglutamine tract is the only common feature of those proteins in these diseases. These diseases likely share a common molecular pathogenesis resulting from toxicity associated with the expanded polyglutamine tract. It is said that expanded polyglutamine endows the disease proteins with a dominant gain of function that causes apoptotic cell death. Several years ago, it was recognized that expanded polyglutamine forms neuronal intranuclear inclusions in animal models of polyglutamine diseases and in the central nervous system of patients with these diseases (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 5Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These inclusions consist of accumulations of insoluble aggregated polyglutamine-containing fragments in association with other proteins. It has been proposed that proteins with long polyglutamine tracts misfold and aggregate as antiparallel β-strands termed “polar zippers” (7Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The correlation between the threshold polyglutamine length for aggregation in experimental systems and the CAG repeat length that leads to human disease supports the argument that aggregation of expanded polyglutamine underlies the toxic gain of function. Although in some experimental systems the toxicity of expanded polyglutamine has been dissociated from the formation of visible inclusions, the formation of insoluble molecular aggregates appears to be a consistent feature of toxicity (8Sisodia S.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

For example, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) has been found to be associated with the expansion of an alanine repeat of polyadenine-binding protein 2 (12Brais B. Bouchard J.P. Xie Y.G.

In addition to the case of OPMD, at least six other genes have been identified in which polyalanine expansions cause human diseases, including the Aristaless-related homeobox protein in X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy (19Stromme P.

Among these polyalanine diseases, some that are caused by the expansion of polyalanine tracts might not be “polyalanine diseases,” because they can be caused by point mutations in the genes as well as by the expansion of polyalanine tracts, suggesting that the loss of function of these proteins rather than the expansion itself is essential for the pathogenesis. Huntington's disease-like 2 has been described as being caused by CTG repeat expansion, which will be translated into either a polyalanine or polyleucine stretch (22Holmes S.E. O'Hearn E.

Genet. 2001; 29: 377-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Some transcription factors have HPAA tracts such as polyproline, polyglutamine, polyglycine, or polyalanine. For example, the Forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) contains a 40-residue polyglutamine tract. Myelin transcription factor 1 contains a 32-residue polyglutamic acid tract. Brain-2 (POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 2) contains a 5-residue polyalanine, 21-residue polyglycine, 7-residue polyproline, and a 21-residue polyglutamine. Polyproline or polyglutamine have been shown to activate transcription when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 factor, and the activity increases with HPAA length (23Gerber H.P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Hofferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). But the role of HPAA tracts in many transcription factors is not yet clear. Two polyglutamic acid regions in bone sialoprotein are conserved and play a role in the hydroxyapatite-nucleating activity (24Tye C.E. Rattray K.R. Warner K.J. Gordon J.A. Sodek J. Hunter G.K.

A six-residue polyhistidine is a widely used “polyhistidine tag” with metal binding activity. Polylysine coatings on the surface of culture dishes make them very hydrophilic and help in the adhesion and proliferation of cultured cells. In this study, we expressed 20 kinds of HPAA (of about 30 residues) fused to the C terminus of YFP to clarify the property of HPAA itself under the same experimental conditions. This is the first report comparing the aggregation properties of each type of HPAA in cells. Plasmid Construction—Expression constructs encoding EYFP with C-terminal polyamino acid tracts were synthesized by ligating double-stranded 90-mer oligonucleotides (Proligo, Kyoto, Japan) into the pEYFP-C1 mammalian expression vector (Clontech). (CAG/CTG)30 was used for Gln, Ser, Ala, Leu, and Cys; (ATG/CAT)30 was used for Met, Asp, and Ile; (TGG/CCA)30 was used for Trp, Val, Pro, and His; (GGC/CCC)30 was used for Arg; (GAA/TTC)30 was used for Glu, Lys, and Phe; (TAC/GTA)30 was used for Tyr; (AAC/TTG)30 was used for Asn and Thr; and (AGG/CCT)30 was used for Gly. Restriction enzymes and T4 polymerase were used to adjust the frame for each polyamino acid. The integrity of repeat was confirmed by sequencing. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich). Transient transfection was performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instruction. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 30 min, and the medium was removed and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. The fluorescence of YFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy IX70 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Transfection Efficiency—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the YFP-HPAA plasmid. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. The percentage of transfected cells was measured as the percentage of fluorescent positive cells by flow cytometer (EPICS® XL™, Beckman Coulter). Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with YFP-HPAA plasmids. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested and sonicated in PBS with 1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration was measured with a DC protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein, 14.1 μg for each sample, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Finetrap NT-32; Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-GFP/YFP polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California) at 37 °C for 1 h, and then with an anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 37 °C for 40 min. The resulting membranes were visualized with a POD immunostain kit (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) or an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Bioscience). Intracellular Localization of Homopolymeric Amino Acidfused YFP—To compare the molecular properties of different HPAA stretches in mammalian cells, 20 kinds of triplet repeats, each encoding every kind of HPAA, were cloned in mammalian expression vector pEYFP-C1. HPAA tracts of ∼30 (26∼32) residues were fused to the C terminus of YFP. The tracts were expressed in COS-7 cells via the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor. The nucleus was visualized by Hoechst staining, and the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Figs. 1 and 2). We examined ∼200 transfected cells to count the localization 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2A). Transfection efficiency was examined and ranged from 46 to 63% of total cells; there was no significant difference among all constructs on analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests (data not shown).Fig. 2Summary of intracellular localization of homopolymeric amino acid-fusion YFP expressed in COS-7 cells. A, the localization of ∼200 transfected cells was counted and shown as a percentage. B, summarization of the localization. C, among polyglutamine, polyalanine, polycysteine, and polyleucine, the localization of polyglutamine and polyalanine differed depending on the length of the HPAA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) YFP fluorescence was distributed diffusely in cells expressing only YFP (Fig. 1A). YFP with Asn-35 (35-residue homopolymer of asparagine fused at the C terminus of YFP), Asp-30, Gln-30, Glu-30, Gly-28, Pro-27, and Ser-29 gave similar fluorescence patterns to that of YFP only (Figs. 1B and 2, A and B). YFP with Arg-30 or Lys-30 formed aggregates in the nucleus, in addition to showing diffuse cytoplasmic expression. The patterns looked alike, with 2–3 aggregates in the nucleus of each cell, although the aggregates of Lys-30 were larger and brighter than those of Arg-30. With Cys-29 or Tyr-28 the fluorescence was diffusely present throughout the cell but intense in the nucleus. Tyr-28 formed several aggregates both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas Cys-29 formed aggregates or cumuli only in the cytoplasm. With Ala-29, His-26, Ile-32, Leu-30, Met-30, Phe-30, Thr-35, Trp-30, or Val-29, the fluorescence was present exclusively in the cytoplasm. Among these residues, His-26 and Trp-30 formed several cytoplasmic aggregates. Most of the rest, except Ala-29 and Thr-35, showed small and dispersed aggregates in the cytoplasm. Ala-29 and Thr-35 did not produce visible aggregation under light microscopy. Ile-32, Leu-30, Phe-30, and Val-29 formed one large cumulus in the perinuclear region of each cell in addition to small and dispersed aggregates in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, these large cumulus-containing cells showed a distorted nuclear morphology. To learn the effect of repeat expansion, constructs containing longer HPAA tracts were made for four kinds of HPAA (Ala, Cys, Leu, and Gln) with the lengths of 70, 70, 130, and 150, respectively. As shown previously (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 25Onodera O. Burke J.R. Miller S.E. Hester S. Tsuji S. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), about half of Gln-150-transfected cells formed one large and bright aggregate in the perinuclear region of each cell (Fig. 2C), a drastically different pattern than that in the shorter Gln-30-expressing cells, which did not differ from the pattern seen in the case of control YFP. 20% of Ala-70-transfected cells formed small and dispersed aggregates in the cytoplasm that were not seen in Ala-29. Cys-70 and Leu-130 showed the same localization as their shorter Cys-29 and Leu-30 counterparts. Similar results were observed in other cell types, such as HEK293 (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed using an antibody against YFP (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of all constructs was confirmed. Enhanced chemiluminescence staining was performed for Arg and Lys (Fig. 3B) because the normal immunoblot staining of these two was too faint. The conformation of these two constructs might be changed when they are aggregated in the nucleus and, thus, not be recognized by the antibody because the fluorescence of these two was not faint under the fluorescent microscopy observation (Figs. 1 and 2). It is also possible that the long stretch of positively charged amino acids affect migration of these proteins in the electric field, or insufficient transfer onto the membrane might occur because of the high molecular weight of these proteins. Except for Lys, Cys, Thr, and the longer Cys-70, every YFP-HPAA showed a band around its calculated molecular weight. Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, and Phe showed one or several bands on the SDS gel above the expected molecular weight bands, indicating that those proteins might exist in oligomeric forms. Conversely, several had more bands under the expected molecular weight, which might represent degradation products. Cys, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Tyr, Val, and all longer HPAA constructs (Ala-70, Cys-70, Leu-130, and Gln-150) showed smear staining in the stacking gel, or a band between the stacking gel and running gel was observed. This indicates that these proteins oligomerized and assumed an aggregated conformation. Hydrophobic HPAAs Oligomerize and Aggregate—Studies of HPAA have focused on polyglutamine or polyalanine because these two play an important role in several human inherited diseases. It is widely known that many causative proteins with elongated polyglutamine or polyalanine form aggregates in cells (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). To compare the properties of different HPAA stretches in mammalian cells, we expressed all of the 30-residue HPAAs of all the 20 amino acids fused to the C terminus of YFP. As shown in Fig. 1B, the intracellular localization of HPAAs differed dramatically depending on the HPAA. With Arg or Lys, aggregates were observed in the nucleus. It is possible that these basic amino acids form aggregates in the nucleus due to electrostatic interaction or work as nuclear localization signals. The properties of each amino acid might be amplified when they form homopolymers. In the case of Ala, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, or Val, the fluorescence was present exclusively in the cytoplasm. Among these HPAAs, His, Ile, Met, Phe, Trp, and Val formed diffuse aggregates within the cytoplasm, and Ile, Leu, Phe, and Val formed a single cumulus in the perinuclear region of each cell. Of the aggregate or cumulus-forming HPAAs, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, and Val were shown to have higher molecular mass in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we found that the cumulus-forming HPAAs, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Val, are all highly hydrophobic and show strong aggregation as judged by Western blot staining. It is highly possible that the protein context may play a role in modulating the properties of single amino acid repeats. Hydrophobic amino acid repeats near the hydrophobic domain could promote aggregation of the protein. Therefore, overall hydrophobicity as well as the localized hydrophobic nature of each protein should be taken in consideration. The Occurrence of HPAAs in Nature—We searched the human protein data base for HPAA-containing proteins to determine the occurrence of HPAA stretches in nature. There are many HPAA-containing proteins in the human genome. However, the number of HPAA-containing proteins varies among the different HPAA species. In Table I, we show the number of human proteins containing each species of HPAA in nature. The table includes proteins with an HPAA tract longer than 11 consecutive residues. As seen in Table I, there are many proteins that contain polyalanine, polyglutamine, polyglutamic acid, polyglycine, polyhistidine, polyproline, or polyserine. On the other hand, there are few containing polyisoleucine, polylysine, polymethionine, polyphenylalanine, polytryptophan, polytyrosine, or polyvaline stretches. This table predicts that hydrophobic HPAAs and polylysine in proteins, both of which are shown in this study to be highly aggregated, could have played a negative role in organism survival during evolution. It has been shown that aggregation-prone proteins possess cytotoxic effects on cells in studies of many human diseases caused by aggregation and deposition of abnormal proteins (26Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 2002; 296: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) including polyglutamine diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.Table IThe occurrence of HPAA-containing proteins in nature The number of HPAA-containing proteins varies among HPAA species. A search of the human protein data base reveals many proteins containing relatively hydrophilic HPAAs, including polyalanine, polyglutamine, polyglutamic acid, polyglycine, polyhistidine, polyproline, or polyserine. On the other hand, there are few hydrophobic HPAAs composed of polyisoleucine, polylysine, polymethionine, polyphenylalanine, polytryptophan, polytyrosine, or polyvaline stretches that occur naturally.11∼2021∼3031∼4041∼Ala37000Arg0000Asn0000Asp3000Cys0000Gln281530Glu24410Gly18200His12000Ile0000Leu2000Lys0000Met0000Phe0000Pro16100Ser8402Thr2000Trp0000Tyr0000Val0000 Open table in a new tab With regard to the occurrence of each HPAA, two other possibilities should also be considered apart from cytotoxicity, i.e. the instability of some specific codons and the potent functions of HPAAs. CAG/CTG, CGG/CCG, GTC/GAC, and GTG/CAC are reported to be unstable during replication and, moreover, CAG/CTG has been shown to be eight times more unstable than other repeats (27Ohshima K. Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1853-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, this might be the reason for the abundance of polyglutamine, polyalanine, and polyserine, because they are all encoded by CAG/CTG. Interestingly, polyleucine and polycysteine, which are also encoded by CAG/CTG, are less abundant than polyglutamine, polyalanine, and polyserine. This suggests again that the more hydrophobic HPAAs are less abundant in natural proteins. New Insights into Polyglutamine and Polyalanine—Until now, no study has been undertaken on HPAAs other than polyglutamine and polyalanine, except for one study in which a long polyleucine stretch of 291 residues was compared with a polyglutamine of the same length (28Dorsman J.C. Pepers B. Langenberg D. Kerkdijk H. Ijszenga M. den Dunnen J.T. Roos R.A. van Ommen G.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because our study is the first research to consider all kinds of HPAA, it not only sheds light on the properties of all HPAAs, but also offers new insight into polyglutamine and polyalanine diseases. Polyglutamine and polyalanine diseases arise when the HPAA tract in the pathogenic protein elongates over a threshold length. Whereas the threshold is 38 residues in the case of polyglutamine, the threshold of polyalanine is estimated to be smaller. In this study, we observed aggregates formed by long Gln-150 and Ala-70 whereas their shorter counterparts, Gln-30 and Ala-29, did not form visible aggregates. Our Western blot analysis also showed that these longer HPAAs are highly aggregated and revealed staining patterns similar to those of 30-residue HPAAs of hydrophobic amino acids, including Cys, Ile, Leu, and Val. From these results, we suggest that the hydrophobicity of polyglutamine and polyalanine might become stronger as the tract becomes longer. Moreover, the difference in the threshold between polyglutamine and polyalanine diseases may be explained by the fact that alanine is more hydrophobic than glutamine and thus needs fewer residues to become hydrophobic enough to cause toxicity. It has been suggested that expanded polyglutamine or polyalanine forms anti-parallel β-sheets (16Blondelle S.E. Forood B. Houghten R.A. Perez-Paya E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8393-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H.

Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1998; 24: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) resulting in a polar zipper, and this is not inconsistent with our results. In summary, it is likely that the expanded polyglutamine or polyalanine repeats associated with many diseases remain at a soluble state compared with other HPAAs of the same length. The existence of HPAAs and their lengths might be determined by several factors including hydrophobicity and the stability of the triplet repeats coding for the individual amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2040194285,"In this report, we investigated the role of the C-terminal tail of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptor in the control of the receptor kinase activity. Using a panel of PDGF β-receptor mutants with progressive C-terminal truncations, we observed that deletion of the last 46 residues, which contain a proline- and glutamic acid-rich motif, increased the autoactivation velocity in vitro and the Vmax of the phosphotransfer reaction, in the absence of ligand, as compared with wild-type receptors. By contrast, the kinase activity of mutant and wild-type receptors that were pre-activated by treatment with PDGF was comparable. Using a conformation-sensitive antibody, we found that truncated receptors presented an active conformation even in the absence of PDGF. A soluble peptide containing the Pro/Glu-rich motif specifically inhibited the PDGF β-receptor kinase activity. Whereas deletion of this motif was not enough to confer ligand-independent transforming ability to the receptor, it dramatically enhanced the effect of the weakly activating D850N mutation in a focus formation assay. These findings indicate that allosteric inhibition of the PDGF β-receptor by its C-terminal tail is one of the mechanisms involved in keeping the receptor inactive in the absence of ligand.

Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Four polypeptide chains, namely PDGF-A, -B, -C, and –D, form homodimeric and heterodimeric ligands that bind to two structurally related PDGF receptors, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ (2Heldin C.H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Each receptor contains a large extracellular domain involved in growth factor binding and an intracellular region that includes a split tyrosine kinase domain flanked by a juxtamembrane domain and a C-terminal tail. PDGF stimulation induces receptor dimerization, which causes a dramatic increase in its kinase activity, resulting in the autophosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain that act as docking sites for cytoplasmic signaling proteins (2Heldin C.H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar).PDGF participates in the development of certain tumors, as illustrated first by the observation that the simian sarcoma virus oncogene v-sis is functionally identical to PDGF-B (3Robbins K.C. Antoniades H.N. Devare S.G. Hunkapiller M.W. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1983; 305: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Östman A. Heldin C.H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of PDGF ligands or receptors occurs in certain forms of neoplasia, such as gliomas. In addition, genetic alterations of the PDGF receptor genes have been found in different types of human cancer cells. These modifications produce ligand-independent activated receptors, which stimulate cell growth in an uncontrolled manner. For instance, in chronic monomyelocytic leukemia, chromosomal translocations lead to the production of oncogenic chimeric proteins in which the PDGFRβ kinase domain is fused to an oligomerization motif, such as the transcription factor Tel (5Jousset C. Carron C. Boureux A. Quang C.T. Oury C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Charon M. Levin J. Bernard O. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover, activating point mutations were described in the PDGFRα juxtamembrane domain and the activation loop in certain gastrointestinal stromal tumors (6Heinrich M.C. Corless C.L. Duensing A. McGreevey L. Chen C.J. Joseph N. Singer S. Griffith D.J. Haley A. Town A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Fletcher J.A. Science. 2003; 299: 708-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which the PDGF receptor kinase is activated by ligand binding is not fully understood. In several other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the insulin receptor, a structurally conserved mobile segment containing key regulatory tyrosines, called the activation loop, controls the access to the active site cleft. Dimerization of the kinase domain upon ligand binding provokes the trans-phosphorylation of the activation loop, which moves from a closed conformation to a position that allows substrate binding (7Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3481) Google Scholar, 8Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In the PDGF β-receptor, however, the role of the phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine, located at position 857, has been debated. The mutation of that residue has only a moderate effect on receptor phosphorylation (9Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding mutation in other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and insulin receptors, severely impairs their kinase activities (10Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, introduction of the D850N mutation in the PDGFRβ activation loop is not enough to confer transforming potential (this report and footnote 2), 2F. Chiara and R. Heuchel, unpublished results. 2F. Chiara and R. Heuchel, unpublished results. in contrast to the homologous mutations in the stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit) and c-Met, which have been found in tumors (11Nagata H. Okada T. Worobec A.S. Semere T.

Altogether, these observations suggest that additional mechanisms may control the activation of PDGFRβ. In this respect, the receptor juxtamembrane region, which resembles a WW domain, was suggested to play a self-inhibitory role in the receptor kinase activation (15Irusta P.M. Luo Y. Bakht O. Lai C.C. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38627-38634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, protein tyrosine phosphatases may also prevent receptor activation in the absence of ligand (16Shimizu A. Persson C. Heldin C.-H. Östman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27749-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In this study, we reveal an additional intramolecular mechanism that keeps PDGFRβ in an inactive state in the absence of PDGF. We show that deletion of the PDGFRβ C-terminal tail increases the autoactivation velocity and the Vmax of the receptor kinase in the absence of ligand. The kinase activities of mutant and wild-type receptors were comparable when the receptors were subjected to ligand-mediated dimerization before the assay. The inhibitory function of the C-terminal tail could be mimicked by a soluble peptide comprising part of that domain. Deletion of the PDGFRβ C terminus did not confer ligand-independent activation in cells but cooperated with the D850N mutation in the activation loop to produce a transforming receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a cDNA encoding the full-length human PDGFRβ inserted into the pcDNA3 cloning vector (Invitrogen) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing.Cell Culture, Reagents, and Transfection—COS-1 simian kidney epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and porcine aortic epithelial (PAE) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and L6 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). Anti-phosphotyrosine (pY99, catalog number sc-7020) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-PDGFRβ R3 and monoclonal antibodies B1 and B2, raised against the extracellular region of PDGFRβ, have been described elsewhere (16Shimizu A. Persson C. Heldin C.-H. Östman A. J.

PDGF-BB stimulation (10 ng/ml) was performed on serum-starved COS or PAE cells for 7 min at 37 °C. Focus formation assays were performed as described (17Chiara F. Michieli P. Pugliese L.

Briefly, cells (1.5·105 cells per 100-mm plate) were transfected with the appropriate pcDNA3 plasmid (10 μg/plate) by the calcium phosphate method in the presence of 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO). After 24 h, serum concentration was reduced to 5%, and the cells were cultured for additional 21 days. The medium was changed every 3 days. Foci were scored after fixation and staining with Giemsa dye.Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were obtained by solubilizing cells in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Trasylol, and 1 mm Pefabloc). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay system (Pierce).Approximately 600–1000 μg of extracted protein were used per immunoprecipitation reaction. The PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated using 3 μg of B1 and B2 monoclonal antibodies kindly provided by Dr. K. Rubin. Incubation of antibodies with extracts was performed for 2 h at 4 °C after pre-incubation of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl), boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli SDS-sample buffer, and run on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-PDGFRβ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Kinase Assays—Transiently transfected COS cells were lysed in lysis buffer in the absence of sodium orthovanadate to allow dephosphorylation, and PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies. Immunopurified proteins were then washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl). The phosphorylation reaction was performed in kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 50 μm unlabeled ATP for increasing periods of time at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of boiling Laemmli SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen), Western immunoblotting with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies, and autoradiography. Signal quantification was performed using a PhosphorImager apparatus and Image Quant software (Amersham Biosciences).For exogenous substrate phosphorylation assays, the phosphorylation reaction was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 10 μm unlabeled ATP and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min at 4 °C and blocked by the addition of EDTA. The samples were analyzed as above. Inhibitory peptides (diluted in kinase buffer, pH 8) were added to the reaction mixture at the indicated concentrations.RESULTSThe C-terminal Tail of PDGFRβ Negatively Regulates Receptor Kinase Activity—To test if the PDGFRβ C-terminal tail is involved in a self-inhibitory mechanism, we constructed deletion mutants lacking the last 29, 46, and 75 amino acid residues of the receptor, referred to as ct29, ct46, and ct75, respectively (Fig. 1). We compared the kinetics of activation of these mutants with wild-type receptors, with or without activation by ligand stimulation.We first performed in vitro autophosphorylation assays on immunopurified receptors from lysates of transiently transfected COS cells in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. To avoid ligand-independent receptor activation induced by over-expression, only limited amounts of expression vectors were used for transfection. Receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by using a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular part of human PDGFRβ, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the receptor mutants ct46 and ct75, in the absence of ligand stimulation, were autophosphorylated at a substantially higher rates as compared with those of wild-type PDGFRβ and ct29; ct46 and ct75 reached full activation after 30 min of reaction at 20 °C, whereas wild-type PDGFRβ and ct29 were phosphorylated more slowly. The increased auto-activation velocity of the ct46 and ct75 receptor mutants was observed only in the absence of the ligand; ligand-dimerized receptors and receptor mutants had comparable kinetics of auto-activation (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Partial deletion of the C-terminal tail increases PDGFRβ autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand. Wild-type (Wt) or mutated PDGFRβ was transiently expressed in COS1. Cells were starved for 1 day in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and left untreated (A) or stimulated with PDGF-BB (B). Immunopurified receptors from COS lysates were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for increasing periods of time, and the extent of autophosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. Total amounts of receptor were determined by Western blotting and used to normalize the values. The average of three independent experiments with S.D. is shown. A.U., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next compared the in vitro kinase activity of wild-type and deleted receptors toward an exogenous substrate, MBP. In the experiment presented in Fig. 3A, the unstimulated wild-type PDGFRβ and ct29 displayed an initial linear phase with a slow rate of MBP phosphorylation, gradually reaching the saturation at 60 min of reaction. By contrast, ct46 and ct75 rapidly phosphorylated MBP, reaching saturation after 30 min of reaction (Fig. 3A). Ligand stimulation enhanced the kinase activity of wild-type and ct29 mutant receptors, which reached maximal MBP phosphorylation at 30 min, whereas ct46 and ct75 reached full phosphorylation of the substrate after only 15 min (Fig. 3B). In this assay, ct75 was slightly more active than ct46. The relevance of that small difference was not clear, because it was not confirmed in other assays (see Fig. 2 and below).Fig. 3Partial deletion of the C-terminal tail increases the catalytic activity of the PDGFRβ toward an exogenous substrate. Wild-type (Wt) or mutated PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated from COS cells left untreated (A) or stimulated with PDGF-BB to pre-activate receptors (B), as described in the legend of Fig. 2. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in the presence of [32P]ATP and MBP for increasing periods of time. The extent of MBP phosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis by a PhosphorImager. Values were treated as described in the Fig. 2 legend. A.U., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further characterize the mutant receptors, their kinase activities were measured in the presence of different concentrations of substrate. Fig. 4A shows that the extent of MBP phosphorylation was higher in unstimulated ct46 and ct75 mutants compared with that in the ct29 and wild-type receptors. Again, after PDGF stimulation there was no difference in phosphorylation rates between the wild-type and truncated receptors (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Removal of the C-terminal tail increases the affinity of the receptor for its substrate. Wild-type (Wt) or mutated PDGFRβ receptors were transiently expressed in COS cells. Cells were left untreated (A) or stimulated with PDGF-BB (B), and the receptors were isolated by immunoprecipitation and used to phosphorylate MBP for 15 min at 20 °C. The amount of [γ-32P]ATP incorporated into MBP at different substrate concentrations was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis by a PhosphorImager. A.U., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These data suggested a major regulatory role for the amino acid sequence located between positions 46 and 29 in the C terminus of PDGFRβ. This region contains a glutamic acid/proline repeat flanked by glutamine residues, referred to as the PE1 motif (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, a similar motif, named PE2, is also present in the last 29 amino acids of the receptor. To test the importance of the PE1 motif directly, we designed a new mutant receptor, called ΔPE1, in which 15 residues, including the PE1 motif, were deleted, and we compared its autokinase activation kinetics with wild-type and mutated receptors. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the absence of ligand stimulation the ΔPE1 mutant was autophosphorylated at the same rate as ct46 and ct75 and reached full activation after 30 min, whereas wild-type PDGFRβ and ct29 were phosphorylated more slowly. As observed previously, the advantage of deleted mutants was lost after ligand stimulation. Altogether, these data suggest that the region containing the PE1 motif in the C-terminal tail of the PDGFRβ is involved in an autoinhibition mechanism, which is cancelled by ligand binding to the receptor.Fig. 5Deletion of the PE1 motif enhanced the PDGFRβ kinase activity. Wild-type (Wt) or mutated PDGFRβ was transiently expressed in COS1. Cells were starved for 1 day in a medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and left untreated (A) or stimulated with PDGF-BB (B). Immunopurified ct46, ΔPE1, and ct75 deleted receptors from COS lysates were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for increasing periods of time, and the extent of autophosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Total amounts of receptor were determined by Western blotting and used to normalize the values. One representative experiment of two is shown. A.U., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A Soluble Peptide Mimics the Inhibitory Function of the C-terminal Domain—To further test the role of the P/E-rich sequences in the C-terminal tail, we designed soluble peptides containing the PE1 motif, the PE2 motif, or both (PE1/2, see Fig. 1). The effect of these peptides on receptor kinase activity was tested in autophosphorylation assays performed in vitro. We observed that the PE1 and PE1/2 peptides efficiently inhibited PDGFRβ autophosphorylation (Fig. 6). The PE2 peptide did not affect the kinase activity even at 1.25 mm, the highest concentration used. These results are in agreement with the data obtained on mutant receptors, because deletion of the PE2 motif (ct29 mutant) had no effect, whereas deletion of the PE1 motif enhanced the kinase activity (ct46 and ΔPE1 mutants). As an additional specificity control, a synthetic peptide containing a proline-rich sequence derived from the C-terminal tail of human FGFR1 was included in the experiments. This peptide had essentially no effect on the kinase activities of PDGFRβ (Fig. 6) and FGFR1 (data not shown). We also found that the PDGFRβ-derived peptides had no inhibitory activity on two other receptor tyrosine kinases, FGFR1 and EGFR (data not shown).Fig. 6Peptides containing the PE1 motif inhibit PDGFRβ kinase activity. PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated (IP) from transiently transfected COS cells, starved for 24 h, and stimulated with PDGF-BB. Immunocomplexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence of the indicated peptide concentrations and [γ-32P]ATP under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Autophosphorylated receptors were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting (IB). After PhosphorImager analysis, values were normalized by dividing by the total amount of receptor. The arrows indicate the 190-kDa mature and 170-kDa immature forms of PDGFRβ. C-term., C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results prompted us to test whether the addition of the PE1/2 peptide to deleted receptors could compensate for the loss of kinase self-inhibition during its activation in the absence of ligand stimulation. To explore this possibility, we performed an in vitro kinase assay on unstimulated receptors, which were immunoprecipitated from PAE cells stably expressing ct75, to measure their auto-phosphorylation kinetics and their ability to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate in the presence or in the absence of the PE1/2 peptide. We found that the auto-phosphorylation rate of the ct75 mutant was markedly decreased in the presence of PE1/2, reaching a rate similar to that of wild-type PDGFRβ in the absence of peptide. The inhibitory peptide also delayed the activation of the wild-type receptor, thus enhancing the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal tail, but did not affect the maximal auto-kinase activity. Thus, the ct75 mutant was more sensitive to inhibition by the PE1/2 peptide compared with the wild-type receptor, which was to be expected if this peptide mimics the region that is lacking in ct75 (Fig. 7A). Similar results were obtained in MBP phosphorylation experiments (Fig. 7B). In conclusion, these results further support the notion that a proline- and glutamic acid-rich motif in the C-terminal part of PDGFRβ negatively regulates its kinase activity.Fig. 7The PE1/2 peptide mimics the PDGFRβ C-terminal tail. PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS-1 cells, starved for 24 h in starvation medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and immunocomplexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assay for various periods of time in the presence of the indicated peptide (0.6 mm) and [γ-32P]ATP to evaluate the receptor autophosphorylation (A) or MBP to measure the activity toward an exogenous substrate (B). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. Shown are results from one representative experiment of two performed.

Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have suggested that the PDGFRβ C-terminal tail may undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding, based on experiments performed with a conformation-sensitive antibody, called Ab-P2, raised against the unphosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 932–947 located close to the kinase domain (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This antibody is able to recognize the native wild-type receptor in its activated form only, indicating that the epitope is buried in the inactive receptor and becomes accessible upon ligand binding. The Ab-P2 antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate wild-type PDGFRβ and ct75 from PAE cells. As shown in Fig. 8A (upper panel), Ab-P2 recognized ct75 even in the absence of PDGF. By contrast, the wild-type receptor was immunoprecipitated only after ligand stimulation, as expected. By a parallel immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal anti-PDGFRβ antibodies B1 and B2, which are directed against the extracellular domain, we confirmed equal receptor expression (Fig. 8A, lower panel). Thus, the change of conformation of the C-terminal region of PDGFRβ, which is induced by ligand binding, is mimicked by truncation of the last 75 amino acid residues; it is possible that this region interacts with the kinase domain or the juxtamembrane domain and thereby restricts the availability of the active site of the kinase domain.Fig. 8Ct75 presents an active conformation in the absence of ligand. A, PAE cells stably expressing the wild-type (WT) PDGFRβ or ct75 mutant were starved for 24 h and stimulated with PDGF-BB. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with immunopurified Ab-P2 antiserum or B1 and B2 monoclonal antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (IB) with PDGFRβ antiserum R3 or antibody anti-phosphotyrosine (pY99). B, COS cells were transiently transfected with wild-type PDGFRβ or with K634A (kinase dead) or Y857F mutated receptors, treated, and analyzed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next asked whether receptor dimerization was enough to displace the tail from its inhibitory conformation or whether receptor phosphorylation is needed. To address this issue, we analyzed the conformation of a receptor devoid of kinase activity (K634A mutant), which dimerizes upon ligand binding but is not phosphorylated. Using Ab-P2, we could not immunoprecipitate K634A receptors from PDGF-stimulated transfected COS cells, in contrast to the stimulated wild-type receptor (Fig. 8B, upper panel). These data suggest that the change in conformation of the C-terminal region is dependent on phosphorylation. We also tested the importance of the phosphorylation of tyrosine 857 in the activation loop. First, we observed that deletion of the C-terminal tail did not modify the phosphorylation of tyrosine 857, as tested by Western blotting with a phospho-specific antibody (data not shown). Mutation of this residue reduces but does not abolish receptor phosphorylation (9Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

Recently, the TβRIII null mouse was generated and revealed significant non-overlapping phenotypes with the TGF-β2 null mouse, implying the existence of TβRIII independent mechanisms for TGF-β2 signaling.

Here we show that the soluble extracellular domain of the type II-B receptor (sTβRII-B.Fc) bound TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 with high affinity (Kd values = 31.7 ± 22.8 and 74.6 ± 15.8 pm, respectively), but TGF-β2 binding was undetectable at corresponding doses. Similar results were obtained for the soluble type II receptor (sTβRII.Fc). However, sTβRII.Fc or sTβRII-B.Fc in combination with soluble type I receptor (sTβRI.Fc) formed a high affinity complex that bound TGF-β2, and this complex inhibited TGF-β2 in a biological inhibition assay. These results show that TGF-β2 has the potential to signal in the absence of TβRIII when sufficient TGF-β2, TβRI, and TβRII or TβRII-B are present.

Type I and type II receptors have intracellular serine/threonine kinase domains, whereas the type III receptor has only a short intracellular domain. On binding of TGF-β ligands, constitutively active type II receptors recruit and phosphorylate type I receptors; the activated type I receptor kinase then interacts with and phosphorylates downstream signaling molecules, the RSmads (13ten Dijke P.

Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In aggregate, these studies suggest that the TGF-β receptor and ligand interactions may involve a cooperative model of binding in which the extracellular domains of the type II and type I receptors make physical contact, whereas the BMP/ActRII and BMP ligands may utilize an allosteric model of binding in which the extracellular domains of the type II and type I receptors do not interact.Of the three TGF-β isoforms, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 have been less well investigated than TGF-β1. TGF-β3 appears to bind receptors and signal in a manner that is similar to TGF-β1. In contrast, TGF-β2 has much lower affinity for TβRII than TGF-β1 and -β3. It has been demonstrated that an accessory receptor, TβRIII, is necessary for efficient binding and cross-linking of TGF-β2 and subsequent signaling (28Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In this model, TGF-β2 binds to TβRIII, which then recruits TβRII and TβRI resulting in phosphorylation of TβRI and downstream signaling (28Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4371-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) is not completely overlapping with the phenotype of the TGF-β2-deficient mouse (8Sanford L.P. Ormsby I. de Gittenberger G.A. Sariola H. Frieman R. Boivin G.P. Cardell E.L. Doetschman T. Development. 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of alternative methods for TGF-β2 binding and signaling that do not involve TβRIII. Cross-linking studies of cell-surface TGF-β receptors with 125I-TGF-β2 in transfected COS cells have suggested that high affinity TGF-β2 binding and downstream signaling in these cells can occur via complexes of type I and type II receptors (30Rodriguez C. Chen F. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15919-15922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Rotzer et al. (16Rotzer D. Roth M. Lutz M. Lindemann D. Sebald W. Knaus P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has proposed that TβRII-B binds TGF-β2 with ensuing signaling in the absence of TβRIII. Of note, an earlier report showing the inability of unlabeled TGF-β2 to compete for 125I-TGF-β1 binding to TβRII-B inferred that TβRII-B resembles TβRII in its inability to bind TGF-β2 (14Suzuki A. Shioda N. Maeda T. Tada M. Ueno N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 335: 19-22Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In general, these studies of TGF-β receptor binding to ligand were performed on receptors expressed at the cell surface where binding can only be measured indirectly via cross-linking to radioligand followed by autoradiography. These studies are therefore limited by an inability to directly quantify binding and thus obtain an accurate measurement of receptor-ligand affinities. In addition, the presence of other extracellular cell surface-associated proteins that may act as accessories to binding cannot be ruled out.To overcome the limitations of cell surface expression studies and to specifically assess the ability of TβRII-B to bind TGF-β2, we have developed a cell-free system using soluble TGF-β receptors. We demonstrate that in comparison with TGF-β1 and -β3, TGF-β2 bound poorly to soluble TGF-β type II (sTβRII.Fc) or TGF-β type II-B receptors (sTβRII-B.Fc) alone. However, TGF-β2 did bind sTβRII.Fc or sTβRII-B.Fc in complex with the soluble type I receptor (sTβRI.Fc) in solution, and cell-surface TβRII or TβRII-B together with TβRI could mediate TGF-β2 signaling in the absence of TβRIII. Our heteromeric receptor binding assay system provides supporting evidence for a cooperative model of type II and type I receptor interactions with TGF-β2 ligand, and provides a rapid and straightforward way to measure the binding of receptor and/or ligand mutants that arise from structure-function studies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Subcloning—The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of human TβRII was amplified by PCR from human TβRII cDNA (12Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Mg-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested and ligated in-frame into the restriction sites BamHI (5′) and HindIII (3′) of the vector pIg-Tail (31Komesli S. Vivien D. Dutartre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to generate the sTβRII.Fc mammalian expression construct. The primers used were 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGCCGCTGCTGCTACTGCTG-3′ (forward) and 3′-ATATTGTGGTCGTTAGGACTGCGCCTAGGG-5′ (reverse). The cDNA was sequenced on both strands to confirm the fidelity of the construct.To generate cDNA for the extracellular domain of human TβRII-B, the 26-amino acid insert was generated by an overlapping primer strategy using PCR. The N-terminal half of the insert was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGGGTCGGGGGCTGCTCAGG-3′ (forward) and 3′-CTGGGGCAGATGTTCTGGGCCTCCATTTCCACATCCGACTTCTGAACGTGCGGT-5′ (reverse). The C-terminal half of the insert and the rest of the extracellular domain was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGGGGATCCGCGTCAGGATTGCTGGTGTTATA-3′ (forward) and 3′-CTGTAATAGGACTGCCCACTGAGAACATATATTAATAACGACATGATAGTC-5′ (reverse). Both PCR products were purified, mixed together, and a final round of PCR was performed using the following “outside” primers: 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGGGTCGGGGGCTGCTCAGG-3′ (forward) and the 3′-CTGTAATAGGACTGCCCACTGAGAACATATATTAATAACGACATGATAGTC-5′ (reverse). The resultant PCR product was purified, digested, and ligated in-frame into the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII (3′) of the vector pIg-Tail to generate the sTβRII-B.Fc mammalian expression construct. The extracellular domain (ECD) of human TβRII-B was then subcloned into full-length human TβRII to generate full-length TβRII-B. cDNAs were sequenced on both strands to confirm the fidelity of the construct.Mammalian Cell Expression—HEK 293 cells (ATCC number CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified of Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Mediatech, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cells were selected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified of Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% ultra-low IgG fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) in 175-cm2 multi-floor flasks (Sarstedt).Protein A Purification of sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc—The human recombinant receptors were purified by one-step Protein A affinity chromatography. Tissue culture medium was filtered through a vacuum-driven 0.22-μm, Durapore Membrane Unit (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The pH of the media was adjusted to pH 8.2 by addition of Tris base and the media was applied to HiTrap rProtein A FF columns (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). After protein loading, the columns were washed with binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) to remove non-specifically bound proteins. Human soluble receptors were eluted with 3 volumes of 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 3.0. The pH of eluted fractions was immediately neutralized by addition of a 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0. Eluted protein was stored at -20 °C. Purity of the protein was determined by 4-12% SDS-PAGE using pre-cast mini gels (Novex) followed by silver staining (Bio-Rad). Amounts of proteins eluted were quantified by the bovine serum albumin protein assay (Pierce) and confirmed by amino acid analysis (MGH-Protein Core Facility). Yields were ∼6 μg of soluble protein per 10-cm tissue culture plates.Soluble Receptor Deglycosylation—25 μg of purified sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc were denatured in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min and incubated in 50 nm sodium phosphate supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C. Denatured proteins were then incubated either in the presence or absence of 5,000 units of N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining as described above.Protein Analysis with Western Blot—Recombinant human receptors eluted from the HiTrap Protein A column were separated by 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE pre-cast minigels (Novex), then transferred to polyvinylidone difluoride transfer membrane (Schleicher & Shuell). After transfer, the membrane was washed in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and blocked overnight in 8% powdered milk in TBST. The membrane was then incubated with goat anti-human TβRII antibodies (R&D Systems) or goat anti-human Fc-specific IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), followed by donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The chemiluminescence immunoassay was performed with Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibodies directed against a peptide of human TβRII-B (QKDEIICPSCNRTAHPLRHI, Peptide Core Facility, MGH, MA) were raised in goats (SIGMA-Gemosys, The Woodlands, TX) and employed to specifically detect human recombinant sTβRII-B.Fc compared with human recombinant sTβRII.Fc. Mouse sTβRI.Fc was purchased from R&D Systems.Ligand Iodination—Carrier-free human TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 were purchased from R&D Systems. Two μg of ligand per reaction was iodinated with [125I] by the modified chloramine-T method as previously described (32Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Binding Assays on Protein A Plates—Soluble recombinant human receptors were diluted in TBS/casein blocking buffer (BioFX, Owings Mills, MD) and incubated on Protein A-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) overnight. Plates were then washed with wash buffer (BioFX) and blocked 2 h at room temperature with TBS/casein buffer. For competition binding assays, fixed amounts of radioligands (50,000-100,000 counts) were added to the plates together with increasing amounts (2 pm to 500 nm) of homologous or heterologous non-radioactive ligands.Binding Assays in Solution—Soluble recombinant human receptors were diluted in TBS/casein blocking buffer (BioFX) and incubated overnight in the presence or absence of ligand. For competition binding assays, fixed amounts of radioligands (50,000-100,000 counts) were added to the samples together with increasing amounts (2 pm to 500 nm) of homologous or heterologous non-radioactive ligands. Samples were then placed on Protein A-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) for 90 min, washed 3 times with wash buffer (BioFX), and counted using a γ-counter.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Mink Lung cells (Mv1Lu) were transiently transfected with the (CAGA)12MPL-Luc reporter construct (33Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar) and with a pRL-TK vector (Promega) in a ratio of 10:1 to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were then serum starved for 6 h before treatment with varying amounts of TGF-β ligands in the presence or absence of varying amounts of soluble receptor for 16 h. Experiments were performed in triplicate wells. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined with the Dual Reporter Assay (Promega). Relative light units were calculated as ratios of Firefly (reporter) and Renilla (transfection control) values. Alternatively, Mv1Lu cells were used that had been stably transfected with the (CAGA)12MPL-Luc reporter construct. In this case, relative light units were corrected for total amount of protein in the lysate as determined by a bovine serum albumin protein assay (Pierce). Rat myoblast L6 cells were transfected with the (CAGA)12MPL-Luc reporter construct and with a pRL-TK vector and in addition with empty vector or full-length TGF-β receptors constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000. The same protocol as for the Mv1Lu cells was then followed.Data Analysis—Each experiment was repeated at least three times and different preparations of sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc were tested and used. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The Ligand Program from the National Institutes of Health was used to fit binding curves for the binding data (34Schneyer A. Schoen A. Quigg A. Sidis Y. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Student's t test was used with a p value of <0.05 to determine statistical significance.RESULTSProduction and Characterization of Soluble Type II-B.Fc (sTβRII-B.Fc) and Soluble Type II.Fc (sTβRII.Fc) Chimeric Proteins—cDNA encoding the ECDs of either TβRII or TβRII-B were fused to the Fc portion of human IgG and transfected into HEK 293 cells to generate sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown schematically in Fig. 1A. The ECD of human TβRII-B contains the 26-amino acid insert that replaces Val32 of TβRII (14Suzuki A. Shioda N. Maeda T. Tada M. Ueno N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 335: 19-22Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Hirai R. Fijita T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Rotzer D. Roth M. Lutz M. Lindemann D. Sebald W. Knaus P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Analysis of soluble receptor proteins purified by one-step Protein A affinity chromatography with SDS-PAGE and silver staining showed that the sTβRII.Fc protein was ∼50 kDa, whereas the sTβRII-B.Fc protein was ∼55 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3), consistent with the presence of the 26-amino acid insert in sTβRII-B.Fc. Under non-reducing conditions, protein bands of ∼100 kDa for sTβRII.Fc and ∼110 kDa for sTβRIIB.Fc were visualized, reflecting the disulfide bond formation of the dimeric Fc domain (data not shown).Both sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc proteins were sensitive to N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 1B), indicating that both proteins are N-glycosylated. The molecular mass of the deglycosylated receptors, ∼40 kDa (sTβRII.Fc, lane 2) and ∼42 kDa (sTβRII-B.Fc, lane 4), correspond to the predicted molecular masses of the core protein of each chimeric protein.Western blot analysis of soluble recombinant receptor chimeric proteins shown in Fig. 1C confirmed that the soluble receptor proteins contained both the human Fc domain (Fig. 1C, left), and the extracellular domain of the type II receptor (Fig. 1C, middle), using an anti-human Fc antibody (αFC) and an anti-type II receptor ECD domain antibody (αRII). As expected, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide encoding the 26-amino acid insertion sequence of TβRII-B recognized only the sTβRII-B.Fc protein with no detectable cross-reactivity to sTβRII.Fc protein (α26aa, Fig. 1C, right). The anti-human Fc antibody also recognized sβTRI.Fc (from R&D Systems, Fig. 1D).sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc Can Bind TGF-β1 and -β3, but Not TGF-β2—Radioligand competition experiments were performed to determine the selectivity and affinity of sTβRII-B.Fc and sTβRII.Fc proteins for different TGF-β isoforms. A non-saturating amount of soluble receptor was incubated overnight with 125I-labeled TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3 with or without serial dilutions of unlabeled TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3 at final concentrations from 2 pm to 500 nm, as indicated. The amount of competitor that inhibited 50% of 125I-labeled TGF-βs was defined as the effective dose (ED50). The ED50, relative potency, and calculated dissociation constants (Kd) averaged from at least three separate experiments are summarized in Table I (all slopes were parallel). For sTβRII-B.Fc, the ED50 (in ng) obtained when 125I-TGF-β1 was competed with unlabeled TGF-β1 and -β3 was 0.58 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.4, respectively, and for sTβRII.Fc, 0.64 ± 0.16 and 1.7 ± 0.4, respectively. When 125I-TGF-β3 was competed with unlabeled TGF-β1 and -β3, the ED50 (in nanograms) for sTβRII-B.Fc was 1.1 ± 0.3 and 2.3 ± 0.8, respectively, and for sTβRII.Fc, 2.0 ± 0.36 and 3.2 ± 1.1, respectively. The relative potency was calculated by comparing ED50 values and showed that TGF-β1 was more effective than TGF-β3 in all cases. Cold TGF-β2 was unable to compete with 125I-TGF-β1 or 125I-TGF-β3 binding to the soluble receptors, even at a concentration of 1250 ng/ml (500 nm).Table IED50 relative potency, and Kd for sTβRII-B.Fc and sTβRII.

A Scatchard analysis from one representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2, and averages from at least three separate experiments are summarized in Table I. sTβRII-B.Fc and sTβRII.Fc proteins had high affinity for TGF-β1 and -β3, with Kd values in the picomolar range. sTβRII-B.Fc had a severalfold higher affinity for TGF-β1 and -β3 than sTβRII.Fc, but the difference in calculated affinities was not statistically significant. When 125I-TGF-β2 was employed, no binding could be detected, even when the amount of soluble receptor per well was increased to 100 ng/well.Fig. 2Measurement of sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc binding affinities. sTβRII-B.Fc and sTβRII.Fc were incubated on Protein A-coated plates overnight followed by 100,000 counts of 125ITGF-β1 or -β3 in the presence of increasing amounts (2 pm to 500 nm) of homologous non-radioactive ligand. Samples were washed and counted using a standard γ-counter. Panels show a representative inhibition curve and Scatchard plot for sTβRII-B.Fc (upper panel) and sTβRII-B.Fc (lower panel) binding to TGF-β1 (closed circles) or -β3 (open circles) from one of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)sTβRII.Fc and sTβRII-B.Fc Can Inhibit TGF-β1 and -β3, but Not TGF-β2 Biological Activity—Next we tested whether sTβRII-B.Fc and sTβRII.Fc could block TGF-β activity by performing a biological inhibition assay using a TGF-β responsive luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3). Mv1Lu cells transfected with the (CAGA)12MPL-Luc reporter construct were treated with 100 pm TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3 in combination with increasing amounts (30-1300 pm) of purified sTβRII-B.Fc (Fig. 3A) or sTβRII.Fc (Fig. 3B). The relative luciferase activity induced by TGF-β1 (Fig. 3, diamonds) and TGF-β3 (Fig. 3, triangles) was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by either sTβRII-B.Fc or sTβRII.Fc. The ED50 was 360 pm for sTβRII-B.Fc to both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3. For sTβRII.Fc, the ED50 was 664 pm for TGF-β1 and 501 pm for TGF-β3. In contrast, there was no inhibition of TGF-β2-induced luciferase activity by either sTβRII-B.Fc or sTβRII.Fc (Fig. 3, squares).Fig. 3sTβRII.Fc or sTβRII-B.Fc can inhibit TGF-β1 and -β3 but not TGF-β2 signaling activity.

PsaB-Trp627 is part of the hydrophobic recognition site that is essential for tight binding of the two electron donors plastocyanin and cytochrome c6 to the donor side of PSI (Sommer, F., Drepper, F., and Hippler, M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 6573–6581). To examine the function of PsaA-Trp651 in binding and electron transfer of both donors to PSI, we generated the mutants PsaA-W651F and PsaA-W651S by site-directed mutagenesis and biolistic transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The protein-protein interaction and the electron transfer between the donors and PSI isolated from the mutants were analyzed by flash absorption spectroscopy. The mutation PsaA-W651F completely abolished the formation of a first order electron transfer complex between plastocyanin (pc) and the altered PSI and increased the dissociation constant for binding of cytochrome (cyt) c6 by more than a factor of 10 as compared with wild type. Mutation of PsaA-Trp651 to Ser had an even larger impact on the dissociation constant. The KD value increased another 2-fold when the values obtained for the interaction and electron transfer between cyt c6 and PSI from PsaA-W651S and PsaA-W651F are compared. In contrast, binding and electron transfer of pc to PSI from PsaA-W651S improved as compared with PSI from PsaA-W651F and admitted the formation of an inter-molecular electron transfer complex, resulting in a KD value of about 554 μm that is still five times higher than observed for wild type. These results demonstrate that PsaA-Trp651 is, such as PsaB-Trp627, crucial for high affinity binding of pc and cyt c6 to PSI. Our results also indicate that the highly conserved structural recognition motif that is formed by PsaA-Trp651 and PsaB-Trp627 confers a differential selectivity in binding of both donors to PSI.

Photosystem I (PSI) 1The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; WT, wild type; pc, plastocyanin; cyt, cytochrome. is an integral light-driven plastocyanin: ferredoxin oxidoreductase that is embedded in the thylakoid membrane. It is a multiprotein complex that uses light energy to transport electrons from the lumenal soluble electron carrier plastocyanin (pc) across the membrane to the stromal soluble electron acceptor ferredoxin. In cyanobacteria and green algae, cytochrome c6 (cyt c6) can substitute pc depending on the availability of copper in the medium (1Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Ho K.K. Krogmann D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 310-316Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol.

The crystal structure of PSI from Synechococcus elongatus has been refined to a resolution of 2.5 Å (5Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). PSI of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii consists of about 14 subunits (6Hippler M. Rimbault B. Takahashi Y. Protist. 2002; 153: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), of which PsaA and PsaB form the core of the complex, each carrying a set of cofactors required for a functional electron transport chain through PSI. The 4Fe-4S cluster FX is located on both PsaA and PsaB, and the terminal 4Fe-4S clusters FA and FB are bound to PsaC on the stromal side where binding of ferredoxin takes place facilitated by PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE (7Setif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). On the lumenal side of PSI, the primary electron donor P700, a chlorophyll a dimer, is located near the lumenal surface. It is separated from the lumenal space by two α helices, l′ and l, formed by loops j′ and j in PsaA and PsaB, respectively, which are arranged in parallel to the membrane plane. A characteristic feature for PsaF from algae and vascular plants is an extension of its lumenal N-terminal domain that is absent from cyanobacteria and that was proposed to form an amphipatic helix with basic patches facing the binding site of the soluble electron donors (8Hippler M.

The electron transfer to eukaryotic PSI shows a multifaceted kinetic behavior and can be described by a multistep process involving donor binding, PSI-donor complex formation, electron transfer, and unbinding of the donor (9Drepper F.

These studies showed that the basic patch present in the N-terminal domain of PsaF is crucial for proper binding, complex formation between donor and PSI, and fast electron transfer. It is of note that the existence and the discussed function of the eukaryotic N-terminal domain of PsaF is supported by the new crystal structure data on plant PSI (18Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In contrast to eukaryotic organisms in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, efficient binding and electron transfer between PSI and pc or cyt c6 does not depend on the PsaF subunit since the specific deletion of the psaF gene in cyanobacteria did not affect photoautotrophic growth (19Chitnis P.R. Purvis D. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the in vivo and in vitro measured electron transfer rate between cyt c553 and PSI was the same as in WT (20Xu Q. Yu L. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic interaction site of the PSI core formed by PsaB has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Sun et al. (21Sun J. Xu W. Hervas M. Navarro J.A. Rosa M.A. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19048-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) introduced short stretches of mutations in the lumenal loop j of the PsaB protein from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and could isolate a double mutant (W622C/A623R), which was highly photosensitive and showed a severe defect in the interaction with pc or cyt c6. A more conservative mutation of Trp627 (corresponding to Trp622 in Synechocystis and Trp631 in S. elongatus) to Phe in the eukaryotic PSI of C. reinhardtii also displayed a strong effect on growth (14Sommer F. Drepper F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6573-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells became strongly photosensitive, and in vitro analysis of the electron transfer reactions revealed a differential effect on the binding constants of pc and cyt c6. No complex formation was observed for the interaction of pc with the altered PSI, whereas it was still present with cyt c6, displaying a 10-fold decreased electron transfer rate. Interestingly, as seen from the crystal structure, Trp631 in loop j of PsaB (corresponding to Trp627 in C. reinhardtii) forms a sandwich complex with the corresponding Trp655 of PsaA (corresponding to Trp651 in C. reinhardtii). This stacked π-electron system is located in close distance to P700. In this study, we questioned the role of PsaA-Trp651 for binding and electron transfer between PSI and pc or cyt c6. Mutants PsaA-W651F and PsaA-W651S were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and biolistic transformation of C. reinhardtii. Both mutations had large effects on the in vitro measured electron transfer kinetics between pc or cyt c6 and the altered PSI. The results are discussed in respect to the function of residue PsaB-W627F in binding and electron transfer between the donors and PSI. Strains and Media—C. reinhardtii wild-type and mutant strains were grown as described (22Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas sourcebook: A comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). If necessary, the media (Tris acetate phosphate medium or high salt minimal medium) were solidified with 1.5% Kolbe agar (Roth) and supplemented with 150 μg/ml spectinomycin (Sigma) when required. Nucleic Acid Techniques—In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Escherichia coli strain DH5α as a bacterial host. For the single exchange of PsaA-Trp651, PCR was performed using as template plasmid pKR154 (24Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) containing the psaA gene and the aadA-cassette (25Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and using as mutation-carrying primers 5′-GGTTACGTGACTTCTTATTTGCACAATCATCAC-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide for the exchange of PsaA-Trp651 to Phe or 5′-CGTGACTTCTTATCGGCACAATC-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide for the exchange PsaA-W651S. After PCR, the template was DpnI-digested, and the PCR product was transformed and amplified in E. coli. The mutations were verified by sequencing. Biolistic transformation of chloroplasts using the PDS-1000/He device (Bio-Rad) and selection on spectinomycin was carried out as described (14Sommer F. Drepper F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6573-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As the recipient strain, ΔPsaA cells lacking the psaA gene were chosen (24Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Isolation of Proteins from C. reinhardtii—Thylakoid membranes and PSI from wild-type and mutant strains were isolated as described (12Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and chlorophyll content was determined according to Porra et al. (26Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). Isolation of pc and cyt c6 was done as published (12Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the concentrations of pc and cyt c6 were determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient of 4.9 mm-1 cm-1 at 597 nm for the oxidized form of pc and 20 mm-1 cm-1 at 552 nm for the reduced form of cyt c6. SDS-PAGE and Immuno-analysis—SDS-PAGE (15.5% T, 2.66% C), was carried out as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Western blotting and immuno-detection followed the protocols according to Hippler et al. (12Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the quantification of PSI content in mutant strains as compared with wild type, different amounts of the thylakoid fraction isolated from wild type supplemented with thylakoids from the PSI lacking the ΔPsaB strain to a final amount of 20 μg of proteins were fractionated on a SDS-PAGE gel together with thylakoids isolated from mutant strains according to 20 μg of proteins. Immuno-analysis was carried out using anti-PsaF antibodies and anti-LHCII (light-harvesting proteins of PSII) antibodies to verify equal loading. Cross-linking Procedure—Cross-linking was performed as described (12Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Redox Potentiometry—Determination of the redox midpoint potential for P700/P700+ from WT and the different mutant strains was done essentially as described (9Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A cuvette with an optical path length of 10 mm containing 3.5 ml of sample under argon was used. As redox mediators, duroquinone and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine at 5 μm, ferro- and ferricyanide at 10 μm, and pc at 2 μm were added, and the redox potential was adjusted by additions of ferricyanide or ascorbate. For measurement of the redox potential, a platinum electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used. Calibration of the reference electrode was done with quinhydrone at a given pH and a ferro-/ferricyanide system displaying an error of ±5 mV (n = 4). Midpoint redox potentials were determined by fitting the redox titration data to Nernst equation curves using a non-linear curve-fitting program (ORIGIN v4.10, Microcal Software). All redox potentials are displayed relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Flash Absorption Spectroscopy—Kinetics of flash-induced absorbance changes at 817 nm were measured essentially as described (9Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cuvette contained 200 μl of the sample and had an optical path length of 1 cm for the measuring light and of ∼3 mm for the actinic light. Analysis of the electron transfer kinetics was performed essentially as described (9Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Kinetic curves were deconvoluted where necessary into three distinct kinetic components by using a least square fit based on a Marquardt algorithm. The two faster kinetic components, with half-lives of t½ in the range of μs to a few ms, which were mainly affected by the concentration of the donor, were used for further analysis of the binding and electron transfer of the donor to PSI. The analysis was based on the model described in Ref. 9Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar assuming a simple dissociation equilibrium for the complex between the reduced donor protein and PSI. The relative amplitude of the fast (μs) kinetic phase of the P700+ reduction kinetics is described by relA(1)=f×[D][D]×KD(Eq. 1) where [D] gives the concentration of the reduced donor, KD gives the dissociation constant, and f represents an empirical factor (f < 1) that relates to the amplitude A(1) observed after the flash to the fraction of PSI in a complex with the reduced donor prior to the flash (9Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The second kinetic phase, which is assumed to originate from a bimolecular reaction between PSI and the soluble donor, was analyzed as a pseudo first order reaction because in all experiments, the donor concentration exceeded the concentration of PSI by more than 1 order of magnitude. The second order rate constant k2 was determined from experiments at donor concentrations where the reaction rate (ln 2/t½ (2Ho K.K. Krogmann D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 310-316Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) of the exponential time course increased linearly with increasing concentration by using the relation k2 = ln 2/(t½ (2)·[D]). A global fit analysis was used to improve the determination of the amplitude A(1) because its relative amplitude was very low (< ∼0.2) at low donor concentrations in experiments with the mutated PSI. A sum of three exponentials was fitted simultaneously to six individual kinetic traces measured at different donor concentrations using the same value of the half-time of the fast kinetic phase t½(1) for each kinetic trace. The global curve-fitting was also used for the evaluation of kinetic traces measured in the presence of high concentrations of MgCl2 (>30 mm) since the slowest and the intermediate kinetic phase had half-times in the same (ms) time range under these conditions. In this case, a constant ratio of the amplitudes was assumed that was derived from measurements at concentrations below 30 mm MgCl2. All fits were performed on two independent sets of measurements. Growth Properties—To investigate the impact of PsaA-Trp651 on the binding and the electron transport from pc or cyt c6 to PSI, we performed site-specific mutagenesis and altered this residue to Phe and Ser. A plasmid containing the altered PsaA together with the aadA cassette conferring resistance to spectomycin was introduced into the C. reinhardtii strain ΔPsaA, lacking psaA, by biolistic transformation. The growth properties of the resulting mutant strains PsaA-W651F and PsaA-W651S were investigated. Hereby the mutant strains together with a WT strain were spotted on plates containing different media (Tris acetate phosphate and high salt minimal media) that were exposed to different light intensities and atmospheric conditions (Table I). All strains were able to grow heterotrophically under normal atmospheric conditions and all light intensities were tested, whereas under photoautotrophic conditions, the mutant strains became sensitive to light intensities higher than 700 microeinsteins m-2 s-1. Photoautotrophic growth could be restored under anaerobic conditions, indicating that the production of reactive oxygen species under aerobic conditions could be a cause for the photosensitivity of both mutant strains. This is in line with observations made for other mutants affected at either the donor side or the acceptor side of PSI, where additionally increased lipid peroxidation as a consequence of high light treatment under aerobic conditions was reported (28Sommer F. Hippler M. Biehler K. Fischer N. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 1881-1892Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Table IGrowth inhibition of mutants under high light is restored under anaerobic conditions Cells from liquid cultures were spotted on plates containing Tris acetate phosphate or high salt minimal medium for heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth respectively and placed under different atmospheric and light conditions.AEROBANAEROBStrainTAPHSMTAPHSMTAPHSM60 μE/m2saE, einstein60 μE/m2s700 μE/m2s700 μE/m2s700 μE/m2s700 μE/m2sWT++++++++++++PsaA-W651F+++++-++++PsaA-W651S+++++-++++a E, einstein Open table in a new tab PSI Content—To test whether the mutations affected the amount of PSI present in the mutant strains, thylakoids were isolated from both mutants and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. PSI was detected by Western blotting using PsaF-specific antibodies (Fig. 1), and the amount was estimated by comparison with the PsaF signal originated from a dilution series of wild-type thylakoids. The PSI content in strain PsaA-W651S or strain PsaA-W651F could be estimated to be above 70% as compared with WT. Therefore, the light sensitivity of both strains cannot be explained by a decrease in PSI content. Cross-linking Experiments of Wild-type and Mutant PSI with pc or cyt c6—To assess the binding and accessibility of PsaF for the two electron donors in wild type and the mutant PSI complexes, we performed cross-linking experiments using the zero-length linker EDC/NHS that leads to the formation of covalent bonds between the basic and acidic patches of PsaF and pc or cyt c6, respectively. After cross-linking, the reaction mixture was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PsaF antibodies. The heme group of cyt c6 gives an antibody-independent light reaction in the presence of ECL and is also detectable in Fig. 2. PsaF could be cross-linked to both donors in wild-type and mutant PsaA-W651F. Although the cross-linking product between PSI from PsaA-W651S and cyt c6 could only be detected as a weak band, it was clearly detectable between pc and PsaF from mutant PsaA-W651S. Thus, the interaction between PsaF of PSI PsaA-W651S and cyt c6 appears to be strongly disturbed. Incubation of the different PSI particles with the cross-linking mixture in the absence of donor gave rise to an additional band detectable with the anti-PsaF antibodies and migrating about 2–5 kDa above the PsaF band. In the presence of the electron donors, this band disappeared completely for wild-type PSI but was still detectable to some extent for the altered PSI complexes (Fig. 2). Flash Absorption Spectroscopy—The effects of the mutations on binding and electron transfer between the two donors pc or cyt c6 and PSI was analyzed by using flash-induced time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. We measured the kinetics of the absorption changes at 817 nm caused by P700 oxidation induced by a single flash and the subsequent reduction of P700+ by soluble donors. Fig. 3 shows absorption transients for the altered PSI in the presence of 200 μm pc (left panel) or 300 μm cyt c6 (right panel), respectively. In both mutants, the kinetics are drastically slowed down as compared to those with WT PSI (not shown, see Ref. 12Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In WT PSI, the reduction of P700+ by either of the two electron donors consisted of three distinct kinetic components: a fast first order phase with a half-time of t½(1) of 3–4 μs being independent of the concentration of pc or cyt c6 and an amplitude A(1) that increased with increasing concentration of the donors, a slower second order component the half-life t½(2) (μs to ms range) and amplitude A(2) that depended on the donor concentration, and a third component (100 ms to s time range) that is assumed to derive from very slow ascorbate reduction of pc and/or damaged PSI that is only accessible for the donors at very slow rates. Therefore, for further discussion, we will only consider the two former components. Reduction of PSI PsaA-W651F by pc follows a monoexponential time course in the time range shown (Fig. 3A). A fast (μs) phase as found for wild-type PSI in the presence of 200 μm pc is not detectable, which indicates that binding between the reduced PSI and pc prior to flash oxidation is strongly disturbed. In contrast, the kinetic traces for reduction of PSI from PsaA-W651F by cyt c6 (Fig. 3B) as well as for reduction of PSI from PsaA-W651S (Fig. 3, C and D) by both donor molecules show a small contribution of a fast (μs) kinetic phase. In further investigations of the kinetic components, the concentration of the donors was varied up to 300 μm for cyt c6 and 200 μm for pc. The reaction rate k for the slower phase increased linearly with increasing concentrations for both donors and exhibited a slight saturation profile at high concentrations (Fig. 4). The second order rate constants k2 were estimated to be 1.9 × 107 s-1 m-1 and 5.5 × 106 s-1 m-1 for the reduction of PSI from PsaA-W651F by pc and cyt c6, respectively. These rates are 4- and 6-fold slower for pc and cyt c6, respectively, than the rates obtained with wild-type PSI. For PSI from PsaA-W651S, second order rate constants of 3.1 × 107 s-1 m-1 and 2.1 × 106 s-1 m-1 for pc and cyt c6, respectively (Fig. 4), were estimated, corresponding to a 3- and 16-fold decrease as compared with the rate for wild-type PSI. Fig. 5 shows the relative amplitude of the fast phase A(1) of P700+ reduction for the mutated PSI complexes in the presence of varying concentrations of soluble donors as indicated. The amplitude of the fast phase increased with increasing concentrations of cyt c6 at the expense of the amplitude for the slower component A(2). The half-time of t½(1) of ∼30 μs remained constant. For pc as a donor, no fast component could be observed with PSI from mutant PsaA-W651F at concentrations of pc up to 200 μm. However, with PSI containing the serine mutation PsaA-W651S, a fast kinetic component was visible, indicating that both donors were able to form a transient complex with this mutant of PSI. These data are similar to the results with PSI from mutant PsaB-W627F, where the first order electron transfer (t½(1)) from cyt c6 to P700 was slowed down by about a factor of 10 as compared with WT, whereas no first order component was detectable for pc as a donor (14Sommer F. Drepper F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6573-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Equation 1 indicates that the relative amplitude A(1) has a hyperbolic dependence of the donor concentration [D], i.e. shows a half-maximum saturation at a donor protein concentration equal to KD and approaching a maximum value f at infinite concentration. For the binding of pc or cyt c6 to wild-type PSI, the results were very close to the KD values of 83 and 81 μm and f values of 0.67 and 0.68, respectively, found in the previous study (13Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For PSI isolated from the PsaA mutant strains, from the data shown in Fig. 5, the maximum value of the amplitude A(1) at very high donor concentrations could only be estimated because the relative contribution of this kinetic component remained below 25% within the range of donor concentration exploited. The data a"
https://openalex.org/W1606017238,"Integrins are adhesion receptors that mediate both cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions. It has also been reported that the loss of integrin alpha4 expression might be associated with metastasis in several cancers. However, the molecular mechanism for loss of their expression in cancers has not been explored. In the present study, we found that the integrin alpha4 expression is lost in human gastric cancer cell lines and that this is recovered by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, implying transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing demonstrated the CpG methylation-dependent silencing of integrin alpha4 expression in eight of nine (88.8%) gastric cancer cell lines and in 84.7% of 46 primary tumors. We also investigated whether the restoration of integrin alpha4 in integrin alpha4-inactivated cells affects their ability to invade extracellular matrix, using matrigel assays. Interestingly, integrin alpha4-stable transfectants had markedly less invasive ability than the parental cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the transcriptional repression of the integrin alpha4 gene is caused by aberrant DNA methylation, and that this may play an important role in human gastric carcinogenesis."

Results are in agreement with a multilevel regulation of dUTPase in the Drosophila proteome, possibly involving several interacting protein partners of the enzyme. Using independent approaches, the existence of such macromolecular partners was verified. Faithful conservation and transmission of genetic information are crucial for living organisms. The enzyme dUTPase prevents uracil incorporation into DNA by hydrolysis of dUTP into dUMP and inorganic pyrophosphate and provides a unique and essential preventive DNA repair function. Lack of dUTPase leads to uracil-substituted DNA that perturbs base excision repair, resulting in DNA fragmentation and thymineless apoptosis of the cell. The physiological role of the enzyme argues for regulation of dUTPase presence, localization, and/or function, depending on cell status. This implication was closely investigated in human cells. Two isoforms of the enzyme were identified: a mitochondrial isoform with constitutive expression, and a nuclear isoform with cell cycle-dependent expression (1Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both are transcribed from the same gene using alternative promoters and differ only in their N-terminal region responsible for adequate localization (2Tinkelenberg B.A. Fazzone W. Lynch F.J. Ladner R.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). dUTPase in mitochondria is necessary for integrity of mitochondrial DNA that replicates independently from the cell cycle. In mature lymphocytes, correlation between dUTPase presence and cell mitogenic status suggested enzyme up-regulation in stages associated with DNA synthesis, whereas in immature populations, enzyme levels are constitutive (3Strahler J.R. Zhu X.X. Hora N. Wang Y.K. Andrews P.C. Roseman N.A. Neel J.V. Turka L. Hanash S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The requirement of actively dividing cells for high dUTPase levels is also confirmed by studies in rat liver regeneration (4Hokari S. Horikawa S. Tsukada K. Sakagishi Y. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 583-590PubMed Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated T and B cells (5Vilpo J.A. Med. Biol. 1983; 61: 54-58PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of dUTPase induces resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that target thymidylate biosynthesis (6Canman C.E. Radany E.H. Parsels L.A. Davis M.A. Lawrence T.S. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2296-2298PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that in addition to inhibition of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, dUTPase targeting as a novel chemotherapeutic strategy may ensure synergistic effects. Cancer cells are usually characterized by deficiency in most apoptotic pathways and are not easily induced into committing suicide. Programmed cell death pathways still operable after malignant transformations are therefore of high therapeutic value. Thymineless cell death was recently suggested to be independent from p53, a central factor in most apoptotic pathways (7Munoz-Pinedo C. Oliver F.J. Lopez-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Pugacheva E.N. Ivanov A.V. Kravchenko J.E. Kopnin B.P. Levine A.J. Chumakov P.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4595-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This finding underlines the importance and possible gains of targeting thymidylate metabolism in tumor cells. In multicellular organisms, apoptosis plays a key role not only in prevention (and therapy) of malignant transformations but in other developmental processes as well. Apoptosis of T and B cells, triggered by receptor-ligand interactions, is essential in the development of the immune system to prevent autoimmunity as well as to facilitate selection of lymphocytes (9Strasser A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Van Parijs L. Abbas A.K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of dUTPase in anti-IgM antibody-induced B-cell apoptosis was reported recently (11Brockstedt E. Rickers A. Kostka S. Laubersheimer A. Dorken B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Bommert K. Otto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28057-28064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), indicating that the thymineless pathway might also be of importance in cell death during development. Putative accumulation of uracil-containing DNA under thymineless conditions in larval stages of Drosophila melanogaster may play a role in programmed cell death necessary for metamorphosis in the pupal stage (12Deutsch W.A. InsectMol. Biol. 1995; 4: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The role of dUTPase was considered to be central in this process; moreover, a developmentally induced heat-stable dUTPase inhibitor protein was also suggested to exist (13Nation M.D. Guzder S.N. Giroir L.E. Deutsch W.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Endogenous macromolecules specifically antagonizing with factors involved in apoptosis and/or DNA metabolism and repair are undoubtedly of great importance because these may provide a drug design lead molecule already tailored by evolution. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge about the molecular biology, physiology, and cellular status of fly dUTPase impeded a systematic assessment of its regulatory pathways. To approach this problem, we have cloned the fly enzyme and performed kinetic and structural characterization of the recombinant protein (14Kovari J. Barabas O. Takacs E. Bekesi A. Dubrovay Z. Pongracz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabo P. Vertessy B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17932-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To describe the role of dUTPase in Drosophila that might also reveal important clues about eventual parallel mechanisms in Homo sapiens, we decided to proceed with physiological characterization of fly dUTPase. In the present work, expression, localization, and developmental patterns of Drosophila dUTPase are described. Two isoforms of the enzyme were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by mass spectrometry. Discrepancy between protein and mRNA levels as well as cellular localization patterns suggested the possibility of regulation by additional factors. Schneider Line 2 (S2) 1The abbreviations used are: S2, Schneider line 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PSD, post source decay; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; NLS, nuclear localization signal. Cell Procedures—Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured at 22 °C in Drosophila SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium. Extracts were prepared from cell pellets washed twice in PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm TRIS, pH 7.2, also containing 10% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor mix (Sigma)), sonicated for 1 min, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g. Collection of Different Developmental Stages of Drosophila—Oregon-R wild-type flies were kept on cornmeal-yeast food, containing Nipagin as fungicide, at room temperature. Two-h early embryos, 12-h embryos, 36-h first larvae, 60-h second larvae, 96-h third larvae, and 8-day pupae, staged according to Ashburner (15Ashburner M. Drosophila. ALaboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), were collected, washed, and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizator and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Ovaries were fractionated into immature and more mature populations by trypsinolysis and filtration. A heat-stable fraction of larval extract was prepared by 5-min incubation at 100 °C in a boiling water bath of the crude extract, followed by centrifugation. Protein concentration measurements by Bradford assay indicated that ∼5% of the total protein content stays in the solution phase after this heat treatment. Subcellular Fractionation of Drosophila Embryos—Twelve-h embryos were collected, washed, and homogenized in 50 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.9, also containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was subjected to differential centrifugation at 4 °C, following the procedure described by Igaki et al. (16Igaki T. Kanuka H. Inohara N. Sawamoto K. Nunez G. Okano H. Miura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The first pellet after centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min contained the nuclear fraction. Supernatant from this step was further centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 10 min to sediment the mitochondrial fraction. The cytoplasmic fraction was obtained after a final centrifugation at 54,000 × g for 1 h. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were applied on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Preparation of Polyclonal Antibody for Drosophila dUTPase—Rabbits were immunized with recombinant full-length Drosophila dUTPase (14Kovari J. Barabas O. Takacs E. Bekesi A. Dubrovay Z. Pongracz V.

Three immunizing shots were given, at time intervals of 2-3 weeks, first in complete then in incomplete Freund's adjuvant or in physiological saline (17Chu E. Voeller D.M. Jones K.L. Takechi T.

Western and Far-Western Blotting—Extracts were run using SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma). Blots were stained first with Ponceau dye and then developed with the antiserum, followed by staining with secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-rabbit IgG, at 1:80,000 and 1:2,500 dilutions, respectively). For visualization, nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or the enhanced chemiluminescence kit of Amersham Biosciences was used. Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) was used as loading control. For far-Western blotting, wet membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and incubated with 30 μg/ml of recombinant Drosophila dUTPase at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with PBS, the procedure was continued according to Western blotting protocol. Immunoprecipitation—dUTPase isoforms were immunoprecipitated from S2 cells with partially purified polyclonal antibody coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma). Antigen was eluted from the resin by boiling for 5 min in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, also containing 10% SDS (21Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Springer T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were in-gel digested by trypsin (Promega) after reduction and alkylation. The tryptic digests were analyzed on a Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS, Bruker, Germany) unfractionated as well as after reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography fractionation. 2,5-Dihydroxy benzoic acid was used as the matrix. All mass spectra were acquired in positive reflectron mode, with delayed extraction, using external calibration. A database search was performed on a National Center for Biotechnology Information database using ProteinProspector. 2Internet address: prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm. To obtain sequence information, post source decay (PSD) analysis of selected components was performed. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA Gel Electrophoresis—Total RNA was isolated from different developmental stages of Drosophila and S2 cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). Reverse transcription was performed with RNase H(-) (Promega) at 37 °C for 1.5 h. For PCR amplification of dUTPase cDNAs, primers were designed to straddle the putative intronic region of the dUTPase gene (see Fig. 2). DNA gel electrophoresis was performed on 1.5% agarose gels using standard procedures. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Ovaries and discs were dissected in Drosophila Ringer's and fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in 100 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 6.9, also containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5% Tween 20, and an equal volume of heptane. Two-h embryos were collected, dechorionized (protocol 9.2, Ref. 22Rothwell W.F. Sullivan W. Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 141-175Google Scholar), fixed for 10-12 min (23Mitchison T.J. Sedat J. Dev.

Immunostaining of ovaries, discs, and embryos (protocol 9.7, method 1 of Ref. 22Rothwell W.F. Sullivan W. Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols.

Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 141-175Google Scholar). S2 cells were cultured on microscope slides, fixed in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in H2O for 5 min, blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with antibodies and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 30 min and for 10 min, respectively, with PBS washing between steps. Antiserum at 1:10,000 dilution and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Sigma) at 1:500 dilution were used. Samples mounted in FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem) were visualized with a Leica DMLS fluorescence microscope and with an Olympus confocal laser scanning microscope. mRNA in Situ Hybridization—cDNA was prepared by PCR on the dUTPase gene containing the pET-22b expression plasmid (14Kovari J. Barabas O. Takacs E. Bekesi A. Dubrovay Z. Pongracz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabo P. Vertessy B.G. J. Biol.

The DIG Nucleic Acid Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche) was used for labeling the cDNA with digoxigenin and in situ detection. Ovaries were fixed, and hybridization was performed according to Ephrussi et al. (24Ephrussi A. Dickinson L.K. Lehmann R. Cell. 1991; 66: 37-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Samples were mounted in PBS buffer containing 90% (v/v) glycerol and analyzed with a Leica DMLS microscope. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Full-length (1-187) and C-terminaltruncated (1-159) recombinant Drosophila dUTPases (14Kovari J. Barabas O. Takacs E. Bekesi A. Dubrovay Z. Pongracz V. Zagyva I. Imre T.

Chips were analyzed using either 5 μl/min or 20 μl/min flow rate in a Biacore X instrument (Biacore AP, Uppsala, Sweden) with flow buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, also containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P20 detergent). Thirty- to 35-μl injections of recombinant purified dUTPase (1-159), serum albumin (both at 0.15 mg/ml), and first instar larval extract (at 0.05-0.28 mg/ml concentrations) were applied on the dUTPase chips. Two Isoforms of dUTPase Protein in Drosophila—A monospecific antibody was required for dUTPase detection in Drosophila samples. Fig. 1A demonstrates that a highly specific polyclonal serum with no cross-reactivity to other cellular proteins was raised against recombinant full-length Drosophila dUTPase. In Drosophila S2 cell extract (Fig. 1A, lane 5), two distinct serum-reactive protein bands (with molecular masses of 23 and 21 kDa) suggested that two dUTPase isoforms might be present. Immunoprecipitated dUTPase proteins (Fig. 1B) were subjected to in-gel trypsinolysis and mass spectrometry (Fig. 1, C and D). For the two putative isoforms, 64 and 59% of the peptide masses detected in the mass spectra showed clear matches to predicted dUTPase tryptic fragments, providing 72 and 66% coverage (Fig. 2, compare underlines and overlines) of the dUTPase sequence, respectively. Peptide mass fingerprints of the two digests are almost identical, excluding a unique peptide ((2Tinkelenberg B.A. Fazzone W. Lynch F.J. Ladner R.D. Exp.

Genomic data on Drosophila dUTPase predicted a unique C-terminal 28-residue extension (25Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A peptide with m/z 1251.6 corresponding to the C-terminal tryptic segment of this region was detected in the mass spectra of both investigated protein samples (single asterisk in Fig. 1, C and D). PSD analysis (26Chaurand P. Luetzenkirchen F. Spengler B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) of this peptide from both 23- and 21-kDa samples confirmed the sequence as AAEPEGAAPAPVAT (residues in one-letter code, Fig. 1E). This indicates that the unique Ala-Pro-rich C-terminal segment is present in both putative isoforms. The potential significance of this result will be addressed below. Having determined that C termini are identical in the two putative isoforms, N termini were investigated.

Interestingly, the determined sequence PSTDFADIPAAK argues for lack of the N-terminal methionine residue from the physiological dUTPase 23-kDa species. Similar posttranslational processing has been reported for the nuclear isoform of human dUTPase (1Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The absence of this peptide from the tryptic digest of the 21-kDa isoform, even after reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography fractionation, may indicate that the smaller species has a different N terminus. In this digest, the peptide with m/z 876.5, corresponding to residues 17-23 of the predicted dUTPase sequence, could be detected as closest to the N terminus. PSD spectrum of this peptide confirmed its sequence as IDTCVLR (Fig. 1G). These data indicate that N termini are in fact different in the two putative isoforms. This difference is in excellent agreement with the observed alteration in molecular masses of intact isoforms, as determined on SDS-PAGE gels (see Fig. 1B). The lack of the indicated N-terminal segment in the shorter isoform does not influence the five conserved dUTPase sequence motifs, necessary for catalytic function. However, alteration of the N terminus results in breakdown of a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the 21-kDa isoform (Fig. 2 and “Discussion”). To exclude the possibility that the shorter isoform is generated by uncontrolled proteolysis in cell extracts, its existence was addressed at the mRNA level. The recent Drosophila Genome Release 3.1 reports an intronic region, conforming to the widely accepted GT-AG rule (27Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), in the single dUTPase gene denoted as CG4584. The resulting two expected mRNA transcripts are termed tr-A and tr-B in Fig. 2. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, forward and reverse primers (Fig. 2, dark gray boxes) were designed to straddle the putative intronic region of the dUTPase gene. RT-PCR with various Drosophila samples showed two bands at positions expected for the predicted 670- and 578-bp lengths of the amplified region of tr-A and tr-B, respectively (Fig. 3E). These results confirmed the existence of two splice variants of dUTPase mRNA in Drosophila corresponding to two protein isoforms with different N termini. Developmental Control of dUTPase Is Different at Protein and mRNA Levels—The two isoforms were followed at both protein and mRNA levels throughout development. Both protein isoforms showed a drastic decrease during larval stages (Fig. 3A), in agreement with the previous hypothesis (compare the Introduction of Deutsch (12Deutsch W.A. InsectMol. Biol. 1995; 4: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)). In the pupal stage, the enzyme is again at a higher level. The ratio of the two protein isoforms is about 1:1 and does not change significantly during development (Fig. 3A). Adult flies express dUTPase mostly in their ovaries; male flies do not contain the enzyme at detectable levels (Fig. 3B). Mature as compared with immature follicles become significantly enriched in the short 21-kDa variant (Fig. 3C). This phenomenon parallels a change in subcellular localization of the enzyme (see below). In addition to developmental regulation of dUTPase expression, enzyme levels were also suggested to change during the cell cycle in human cells (1Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this control may also apply for fruit fly, we analyzed dUTPase levels in cycling and resting cells. Extracts of cells in the logarithmic growing stage showed high dUTPase levels, whereas the enzyme in overgrown cell populations was beyond detection limit (Fig. 3D). In striking contrast to the strong developmental control of the dUTPase protein presence, mRNA levels show a constitutive character during fly development (Fig. 3E). Relative amounts of transcripts show some alteration in different stages (Fig. 3E). The considerable difference between changes of the mRNA and the protein levels during development suggests the existence of a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of the dUTPase isoforms in Drosophila. Subcellular Localization of dUTPase in Different Tissues of Drosophila—Between the two isoforms, the full-length dUTPase contains a putative NLS (PAAKKMKID; Fig. 2 and “Discussion”). However, the shorter isoform does not possess any potential subcellular localization signal. To investigate the presence of the two isoforms in different cellular organelles, subcellular fractionation experiments of Drosophila embryos were carried out. Fig. 3F demonstrates that: i) the nuclear fraction contains both dUTPase isoforms in 1:1 ratio; ii) the mitochondrial fraction does not contain a detectable amount of the enzyme; and iii) the cytoplasmic dUTPase composition is comparable to that found in the fraction sedimenting with the nuclei. To complement the above experiments performed in homogenized samples with cellular studies, immunohistochemistry was performed (Fig. 4). Follicles passing throughout maturation in the ovary were stained for dUTPase and DNA (Fig. 4A). In immature follicles, developing cells showed uniformly nuclear dUTPase staining, and the oocyte could not yet be distinguished (Fig. 4A, asterisk). During further development, nurse cells and the oocyte were visualized as separate compartments (Fig. 4A, arrow), and dUTPase stain was more diffuse and less intensive. In more mature follicles (Fig. 4A, cross), there was a clear distinction between large-nuclei nurse cells and the egg cell with its small nucleus (Fig. 4A, dashed arrow), which is positioned at one of the poles of th"
https://openalex.org/W2011612212,"Functional inactivation of tuberous sclerosis 2 gene (Tsc2) leads to renal carcinogenesis in the hereditary renal carcinoma Eker rat models. Recent studies revealed a role of tuberin, a TSC2 product, in suppressing the p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) activity via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Phosphorylated S6 protein, a substrate of p70S6K, was expressed in the early lesions in Eker rats, and this expression was suppressed by the treatment of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. We previously isolated the novel gene Niban expressed in renal carcinogenesis of Eker rats. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of Niban was detected from early preneoplastic lesions in Eker rats. Interestingly, in contrast to the phosphorylated S6 protein, the expression of Niban was unchanged and early lesions still remained even after treatment with rapamycin. These results might suggest the existence of another pathway independent of mTOR-S6K pathway in Tsc2 mutant renal carcinogenesis. In addition, Niban was also expressed in other renal carcinoma models, including Tsc1 and Tsc2 knockout mice, and various types of human renal cell carcinomas. Thus, Niban was commonly expressed in renal carcinomas and might be a new marker for renal carcinogenesis."

Autoptic data in affected individuals suggest that the neurons expressing mutant vasopressin undergo selective degeneration. Expression studies have shown that the mutants are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but how this trafficking defect is linked to neurotoxicity is unknown. One possibility is that unsecreted mutant precursors, or degradation products thereof, are cytotoxic. We therefore investigated the fate of endoplasmic reticulum-retained pathogenic mutants. Our data show that the mutants are retrotranslocated to the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome. In the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, three distinct un- or deglycosylated cytosolic species of vasopressin precursors were stabilized: pre-pro-vasopressin, pro-vasopressin, and an N-terminally truncated form. In addition to the retrotranslocated forms, a fraction of the newly synthesized precursor was not translocated, but was synthesized into the cytosol due to inefficient function of the vasopressin signal peptide. As a result, cytosolic pre-pro-vasopressin and its degradation product were also recovered when wild-type vasopressin was expressed. Cytosolic forms of vasopressin might trigger cytotoxicity in vivo, as has been proposed in the case of prion protein, which also contains an inefficient N-terminal signal peptide.

As a result, cytosolic pre-pro-vasopressin and its degradation product were also recovered when wild-type vasopressin was expressed. Cytosolic forms of vasopressin might trigger cytotoxicity in vivo, as has been proposed in the case of prion protein, which also contains an inefficient N-terminal signal peptide. The antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin, is synthesized in vasopressinergic neurons of the hypothalamus as a precursor consisting of three moieties (Fig. 1): the 19-amino-acid signal sequence, the nonapeptide hormone, the vasopressin-associated carrier protein neurophysin II, and a 39-amino-acid glycopeptide (copeptide) with a single N-glycosylation site (1Sausville E. Carney D. Battey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10236-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor is cotranslationally targeted to the ER, 1The abbreviations are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ADNDI, autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PrP, prion protein. where the signal is cleaved off by signal peptidase and the copeptide is core glycosylated. The prohormone contains a total of eight disulfide bonds. After complex glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus, the matured precursor is cleaved into its three moieties and targeted to secretory granules at the distal end of the axons. From there, the hormone is released into the circulation upon osmotic and non-osmotic stimuli. Vasopressin binds to its receptor on cells of the renal collecting duct, initiating a signaling cascade that leads to the mobilization of aquaporin-2 water channels, allowing regulated water reabsorption. Through this mechanism, vasopressin mediates the conservation of as much as ∼20 liters of fluid/day, thereby playing an important role in water homeostasis. Lack of circulating vasopressin causes diabetes insipidus. Affected individuals suffer from polyuria and polydipsia due to the inability to concentrate their urine. In rare cases, the condition is caused by mutations in the vasopressin gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (2Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J.

Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) appears to be a neurodegenerative disease. Postmortem histologic examinations revealed only few magnocellular neurons and scar tissue replacing much of the vasopressinergic nuclei (15Braverman L.E. Mancini M.P. McGoldrick D.M. Ann. Intern.

The neurodegeneration hypothesis was further supported by a study that showed decreased viability of cultured cells stably expressing mutant vasopressin (20Ito M. Jameson J.L. Ito M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A number of expression studies have shown that the mutant vasopressin precursors are retained in the ER (11Nijenhuis M.

Together, the data suggest a cytotoxic effect of retained mutant precursors or of their degradation products. We therefore studied the degradation of vasopressin mutants associated with ADNDI and found it to occur by the proteasomal machinery following retrotranslocation into the cytosol. Analysis of the degradation intermediates furthermore showed that a significant portion of the primary translation products fails to enter the ER lumen. Both pathways of degradation, via the ER lumen and directly from the cytosol, were also found to some extent for the wild-type protein. The cytotoxic effect of mutant vasopressin prohormone may result from processes that are quantitatively, but not fundamentally, different from those occurring in cells expressing the wild-type protein. Plasmids and Constructs—cDNAs for the wild-type vasopressin precursor and the mutants A–1T, ΔE47, and G57S were a gift from M. Ito (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The signal peptide of enkephalin was fused to wild-type and ΔE47 pro-vasopressin and, to delete the vasopressin hormone sequence, to the wild-type neurophysin II-glycopeptide sequence (in the same manner as described in Ref. 25Cescato R. Dumermuth E. Spiess M. Paganetti P.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Point mutations D–17R, L–9R, and R8E/K11E/R12E, were generated by polymerase chain reaction. All cDNAs were subcloned into the pRc/RSV expression plasmid (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and used 2–3 days after transfection. Neuro2a were grown in DMEM containing 4500 mg/liter glucose in 5% CO2. They were transfected using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories). To produce stably expressing cell lines, the cDNA of the vasopressin precursor was subcloned into the expression vector pCB6 and transfected into CV-1 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. Clonal cell lines resistant to 0.5 mg/ml G418-sulfate were isolated and screened for pro-vasopressin expression by immunofluorescence. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For labeling experiments, transfected cells were starved for 30 min in DMEM without cysteine and methionine (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were labeled for the times indicated with 100 μCi/ml 35S-protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in starvation medium and chased in starvation medium supplemented with excess cysteine and methionine. Cells were transferred to 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and scraped. After 10 min of centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using rabbit polyclonal anti-neurophysin II or anti-vasopressin antibodies (ICN). The immune complexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide Tris/Tricine SDS-gels and autoradiography. For deglycosylation, immunoprecipitates were either boiled for 2 min in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6, 1% SDS and incubated with 1 milliunit of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 37 °C or boiled in 100 μlof0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS and incubated with 0.25 units of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 37 °C Protease Inhibition—Stock solutions of 10 mm N-acetyl-leucyl-leucylnorleucinal (ALLN), 1 mm lactacystin, 1 mm pepstatin A (all from Sigma) in Me2SO and of 10 mm leupeptin (Roche Applied Science) in water were prepared. For application to the cells, they were diluted into DMEM to final concentrations of 250 μm ALLN, 25 or 40 μm lactacystin, 100 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A. ALLN was added to the cells 90 min prior to the experiment, and lactacystin was added to the cells 10 min prior to the experiment and was freshly added to the starvation, labeling, and chase media. The lysosomal inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin A were applied to the cells 16 h before the experiment and were present during all further incubations. Cytosol Extraction—To separate the cytosol from microsomes, labeled cells were incubated at 4 °C in swelling buffer (15 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 15 mm KCl) supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (from a 500-fold concentrated stock of 1 mg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and 5 mg/ml benzamidine, dissolved in 40% Me2SO and 60% ethanol) for 15 min at 4 °C, scraped, and centrifuged for 30 min at 136,000 × g. The supernatant containing the cytosol and the resuspended organelle pellet were subjected to immunoprecipitation and analyzed as above. Proteasome Inhibitors Stabilize Mutant Vasopressin Precursors and Degradation Intermediates—To test the fate of wild-type and mutant pre-pro-vasopressin in COS-1 cells, transiently transfected cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h and chased with excess unlabeled methionine/cysteine for 0 or 6 h. Cells and media were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody directed against neurophysin II followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–8). Upon pulse-labeling, wild-type protein and the mutants ΔE47 and G57S were found as a major species of ∼21 kDa corresponding to N-glycosylated pro-vasopressin. The mutant A–1T, in which mutation of the last residue of the signal sequence causes inefficient signal cleavage (5Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), appeared as two major products corresponding to glycosylated pre-provasopressin and pro-vasopressin. In all cases, additional faint bands in the range of∼17–19 kDa were produced. After 6 h of chase, wild-type pro-vasopressin and the signal-cleaved fraction of the A–1T mutant were secreted into the medium. Since COS cells lack prohormone-processing enzymes, intact glycosylated pro-vasopressin of 21 kDa was recovered. Hardly any protein could be detected in the cells, indicating that the mutants ΔE47, G57S, and the uncleaved fraction of A–1T had been retained and degraded. To test for degradation via the ER-associated degradation pathway, the proteasomal peptide inhibitor ALLN was added to the medium 90 min before and during the pulse and the chase periods (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–16). ALLN stabilized the putative degradation intermediates of ∼17–19 kDa for wild-type and mutant precursors, and to a variable extent also, the full-sized, glycosylated band of the mutant precursors, consistent with proteasomal degradation of retained protein. This was confirmed by experiments using lactacystin, a more specific proteasomal inhibitor. Addition of 25 μm lactacystin stabilized low molecular weight forms that were indistinguishable from those seen with ALLN treatment (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a mixture of leupeptin and pepstatin A, two inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, had no stabilizing effect on the mutant ΔE47 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that mutant pro-vasopressin as well as a fraction of wild-type pro-vasopressin are degraded by the proteasome in a process that involves intermediates of 17–19 kDa. Three Cytosolic Degradation Intermediates Are Stabilized in the Presence of Proteasome Inhibitors—In addition to the expected glycosylated pro-vasopressin and in the case of A–1T to glycosylated pre-pro-vasopressin, up to three different lower molecular weight forms could be distinguished. To analyze potential precursor-product relationships, we performed a time course of labeling of cells expressing either wild-type or mutant ΔE47 vasopressin precursor in the presence or absence of ALLN (Fig. 3A). In addition to an increasing signal of glycosylated pro-vasopressin (form 1), the three smaller species (forms 2–4) appeared with distinct kinetics. Form 2 appeared with the highest relative intensity after the shortest pulse times of 5 min. Form 3, however, appeared and increased in intensity in parallel with glycosylated pro-vasopressin. Form 4 only accumulated after 30–60 min and in the presence of ALLN. The same bands were observed using the more specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Fig. 3B). The patterns of products generated by wild-type and mutant precursors were qualitatively similar, indicating that they are not related to specific mutations. To characterize the different forms, immunoprecipitates of ALLN-treated labeled cells expressing ΔE47 vasopressin precursor were incubated with endoglycosidase H or F (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). The 21-kDa form 1 was deglycosylated to an apparent molecular size of ∼18 kDa corresponding to form 3. In contrast, the lower bands were insensitive to deglycosylation. This suggested that product 3 corresponds to un- or deglycosylated pro-vasopressin and that product 4 corresponds to a subsequent degradation intermediate lacking a short segment of the polypeptide at the N or C terminus. Upon immunoprecipitation using an antibody directed against the vasopressin hormone, form 4 was not recovered (Fig. 4A, lane 4), indicating that it lacks the hormone sequence at the N terminus. Based on its size, product 2 likely represents pre-pro-vasopressin, the primary translation product that had not been translocated to the ER lumen. For comparison, we expressed various mutant precursors to serve as size markers (Fig. 4B). A mutant with a non-functional signal sequence (L–9R; lane 2), in which an arginine disrupts the hydrophobic core, comigrated with form 2. Only a very small fraction was glycosylated but not processed by signal peptidase (arrowhead). A mutant lacking the signal peptide entirely (ΔSP), i.e. pro-vasopressin synthesized into the cytosol, migrated like band 3 (lane 3). In a further construct, the hormone domain was deleted (ΔVP) by fusing neurophysin II-glycopeptide to the signal sequence of pre-pro-enkephalin. In addition to a glycosylated product of ∼21 kDa, this construct also produced a 17-kDa form comigrating with band 4 (lane 4). Interestingly, this product of 17 kDa was generated by all constructs, indicating that N-terminal clipping occurred independently of whether the protein was initially inserted into the ER or synthesized directly into the cytosol and whether a signal sequence was still attached or not. ER-associated degradation involves the retrotranslocation of unfolded or misfolded proteins from the ER lumen back to the cytosol, where they are exposed to cytosolic N-glycanase (26Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 27Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine the localization of the low molecular weight forms, cells expressing wild-type or ΔE47 vasopressin precursor were labeled for 1 h in the presence of ALLN, broken by swelling and scraping, and subjected to ultracentrifugation. We then analyzed the immunoprecipitated products in the membrane pellet (Fig. 4C, M) and the cytosol fraction (C) in comparison with the unfractionated total cell lysate (L). The experiment was performed with cells labeled for 5 min (lanes 1–3), producing predominantly form 2, or for 60 min (lanes 4–9), generating forms 3 and 4 in addition to glycosylated pro-vasopressin. The membrane fraction contained almost all of the glycosylated wild-type and mutant pro-vasopressin, whereas the smaller products were predominantly recovered in the cytosolic fraction. These products therefore either were retrotranslocated from the ER lumen or had never been targeted into the ER. The Native Signal Peptide of Vasopressin Precursor Is Inefficient in ER Targeting—The occurrence of unglycosylated prepro-vasopressin indicates that the native signal sequence is inefficient in mediating translocation across the ER membrane. To test this, we expressed wild-type and ΔE47 mutant precursor with the native signal sequence in parallel with the same proteins containing the signal peptide of pre-pro-enkephalin. Upon labeling for 3–60 min, form 2 was only produced by the constructs with the native vasopressin signal sequence but not with the enkephalin signal (Fig. 5A). In contrast, forms 3 and 4 were generated with either signal, indicating that they are derived from form 1, glycosylated pro-vasopressin in the ER lumen, after retrotranslocation. The fact that wild-type and ΔE47 mutant proteins behaved identically indicates that the mutation is not responsible for the phenomenon and that the native signal of the vasopressin precursor is inherently inefficient. The signal of the vasopressin precursor is unusual in that it contains a negative charge near the N terminus (Asp–17) and is C-terminally followed by a cluster of positive charges (Fig. 5B). The enkephalin signal, in contrast, has a positive N terminus and a longer hydrophobic core. To test whether the unusual charge distribution is responsible for inefficient translocation of the vasopressin precursor, Asp–17 was mutated to Arg, or the residues Arg8, Lys11, and Arg12 were mutated to Glu. However, upon expression of these charge mutants in COS-1 cells, the pre-pro-vasopressin form (form 2) was still detected (Fig. 5C). Inefficiency to translocate the protein is thus not, or not solely, due to the unusual charge distribution. Missorting of Pre-pro-vasopressin Is Not Due to Overexpression and Also Occurs in Neuronal Cells—To exclude the possibility that mistargeting of pre-pro-vasopressin is simply a consequence of high level expression in COS cells, we examined the polypeptides produced in stably transfected CV-1 cells, the parental cell line of COS-1 cells lacking the large T antigen driving the SV40 promoter/origin of replication present in our expression plasmids. In labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments, the stable CV-1 cell line expressing wild-type vasopressin precursor yielded a somewhat lower signal from the same number of cells than COS cells, of which only 5–10% were transfected. The CV-1 cells are therefore producing at least 10–20-fold less of the protein per cell. Even in this situation, all three low molecular weight forms were made (Fig. 6A). In particular, form 2, pre-pro-vasopressin, was made as well. The inefficiency of the vasopressin signal is thus also apparent at moderate rates of synthesis. In vivo, the vasopressin precursor is expressed by hypothalamic secretory neurons. We tested whether the products observed in fibroblasts were also generated in Neuro2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line that endogenously expresses secretogranin II and that had been shown to sort exogenous pro-opiomelanocortin into dense-core granules (28Chevrier D. Fournier H. Nault C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 79: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In transfected Neuro2a cells expressing wild-type or ΔE47 mutant vasopressin precursor and labeled for 5–60 min, pre-pro-vasopressin (form 2) and unglycosylated pro-vasopressin (form 3) were detected and stabilized by ALLN as in COS-1 and CV-1 cells (Fig. 6B). However, form 4 corresponding to N-terminally truncated pro-vasopressin could not be detected. Although the inefficiency of the vasopressin signal is observed in all cell types tested, the cytosolic protease responsible for N-terminal truncation of vasopressin precursors in COS-1 and CV-1 cells is missing in Neuro2a cells. Degradation of Vasopressin Precursor Occurs via Proteasomes—In cells expressing mutant vasopressin precursor, products of lower molecular weight than full-sized glycosylated pro-vasopressin were stabilized by proteasomal inhibitors. No stabilization was observed with inhibitors of lysosomal proteases. This confirmed the expectation that the mutant proteins retained in the ER by the lumenal quality control system are subject to ER-associated degradation, i.e. proteolysis by the cytosolic proteasome. Interestingly, significant stabilization of the same types of intermediates was also observed in cells expressing the wild-type protein. This may be due to a considerable number of polypeptides that never attained the native structure owing to errors in translation or post-translational processes necessary for proper protein folding. It has previously been estimated that about one-third of newly synthesized total protein is rapidly degraded (29Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are often, but not always, tagged by ubiquitin (30Yewdell J.W.

We were unable to demonstrate ubiquitination of vasopressin polypeptides using multiple approaches, including immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated vasopressin precursor with anti-ubiquitin antibodies, increasing the ubiquitin pool of the cells by overexpressing a ubiquitin cDNA, or coexpression of dominant-negative ubiquitin constructs (K48R and K48RG76A). It is unclear whether we did not reach sufficient amounts of ubiquitinated material, whether the ubiquitinated form might not be recognized by our antibodies, or whether the vasopressin mutants are targeted to the proteasome through alternative pathways, such as neddylation or sumoylation (35Aguilar R.C. Wendland B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

In general, only a small amount of the protein is detectable in ubiquitinated forms, which furthermore are heterogeneous in size. In addition, rapid deubiquitination may occur in cell lysates. With Proteasome Inhibitors, Three Unglycosylated Forms Accumulate in the Cytosol—Upon incubation with proteasome inhibitors, three vasopressin precursor forms of molecular sizes in the range of 17–19 kDa were stabilized (forms 2–4). All three of them were unglycosylated and cytosolic. Comparison of their electrophoretic mobility with that of different mutant vasopressin precursors, as well as immunoreactivity with antibodies directed against the hormone domain, indicate that these forms correspond to unglycosylated pre-pro-vasopressin (form 2), deglycosylated pro-vasopressin (form 3), and N-terminally truncated pro-vasopressin (form 4). Small amounts of form 3 have been observed previously in untreated cells (22Beuret N. Rutishauser J. Bider M.D. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18965-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but have been interpreted to be the product of incomplete glycosylation in the ER lumen. That this form is largely released into the supernatant of broken cells indicates that it has been retrotranslocated and deglycosylated. The data support a scenario (illustrated in Fig. 7) in which pre-pro-vasopressin is inserted into the ER, cleaved by signal peptidase, and modified to glycosylated pro-vasopressin (form 1). Mutant proteins that are unable to fold into the native structure, but to some extent also wild-type polypeptides, are retrotranslocated to the cytosol and rapidly deglycosylated (form 3). In addition, a fraction of the translation products is not transported into the ER (form 2), based on the finding that the signal sequence was not cleaved and the protein remained unglycosylated. In the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, both forms 2 and 3 may be N-terminally clipped to produce form 4 before degradation. The protease responsible for this slow clipping is unknown and appears to be expressed in a cell type-specific manner since form 4 was not detectable in Neuro2a cells. Cytosolic non-proteasomal proteases are known to be involved in the processing of antigenic peptides to be presented by MHC class I molecules (e.g. ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing; Ref. 38Serwold T. Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The Vasopressin Signal Functions Inefficiently—The production of pre-pro-vasopressin suggests that the native vasopressin signal is inefficient. This is not due to incomplete signal cleavage since no glycosylated pre-pro-vasopressin could be detected. In ADNDI mutants affecting the cleavage efficiency of the signal, such as A–1T (mutation of the cleavage site; Ref. 5Ito M. Oiso Y. Murase T. Kondo K. Saito H. Chinzei T. Racchi M. Lively M.O. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and ΔG227 (truncation of the signal; Ref. 22Beuret N. Rutishauser J. Bider M.D. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18965-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), glycosylated pre-pro-vasopressin is easily detected. A–1T also revealed increased form 2 (Fig. 2, A, lane 15, and B, lane 11) since retrotranslocated polypeptides add to those that were primarily synthesized into the cytosol. Therefore, the defect in the native vasopressin signal is due to inefficient targeting or translocation. The phenomenon is not an artifact of overexpression and potential saturation of the secretory route since it is also observed in CV-1 cells expressing at least 10 times less protein per cell. Moreover, it is detected in Neuro2a cells, which have characteristics of neuroendocrine cells, and is thus likely to occur also in vasopressinergic cells in vivo. The charges flanking the hydrophobic core of signal sequences largely determine signal orientation in the ER translocation machinery (39Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Typically, the N-terminal portion of signal peptides is positively charged (the positive-inside rule; Ref. 40von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) or at least more positive than the C-terminal flanking sequence (41Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This is not the case for the vasopressin signal, in which the charge difference Δ(C–N) calculated according to the rules by Hartmann et al. (41Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) is +2. Surprisingly, however, the unusual charge distribution is not responsible for the translocation inefficiency: mutation of Asp–17 to Arg or of Arg8, Lys11, and Arg12 to Glu did not reduce the production of prepro-vasopressin despite an improved charge difference of 0 and –4, respectively. The efficiency of the enkephalin signal fused to pro-vasopressin is thus also not just due to the positive N terminus. The hydrophobic core of the enkephalin signal is longer and more hydrophobic (in total and on average) than that of the vasopressin signal. This might account for more efficient recognition by signal recognition particle (42Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Inefficient function of signal sequences is observed rarely. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) is found as a secreted and a cytosolic form because of an internal, uncleaved signal that is inefficient both in binding signal recognition particle and in subsequent interaction with the translocation complex (43Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.D. Strub K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) precursor is in part found as pre-pro-PTHrP in the cell and accumulates in nucleoli due to a nucleolar targeting signal (44Amizuka N. Fukushi-Irie M. Sasaki T. Oda K. Ozawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although this signal has a positive N terminus, its C-terminal sequence is even more positively charged. In both cases, dual localization may reflect separate functions in different compartments. Of special pathophysiological interest is the case of the prion protein (PrP). A particular misfolded conformation of PrP (PrPSc), which is favored by certain mutations in the protein, causes neurodegenerative disorders (prion diseases). The N-terminal signal of PrP is inefficient, and membrane targeting of a fraction of the protein is rescued by a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence (45Hölscher C. Bach U.C. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13388-13394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PrP can adopt multiple membrane topologies, including a fully translocated form (SecPrP), two transmembrane forms with either the N-terminal or the C-terminal portion of the polypeptide translocated into the ER lumen (NtmPrP and CtmPrP, respectively) and a cytosolic form (46Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 47Hegde R.S. Rane N.S. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 337-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Again, the charge difference of the signal is the opposite of that typical for secretory signal peptides. It has been shown that mutant PrP as well as a significant portion of wild-type PrP is degraded via the proteasome since cytosolic, unglycosylated forms accumulate upon treatment with proteasomal inhibitors (48Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 49Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that the cytosolic forms of PrP trigger at least some neurodegenerative prion diseases because expression of a cytosolic form of PrP lacking the N-terminal signal and the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor sequence was toxic in Neuro2a cells and rapidly caused neurodegeneration in transgenic mice (50Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition, conversion to a PrPSc-like conformation was found to be increased for a mutant PrP causing heritable prion disease correlating with its increased transport into the cytosol (51Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To which extent the situation of mutant vasopressin precursor parallels that of PrP remains to be determined. It is not known at present whether ADNDI results from a toxic product in the cytosol or in the ER lumen. Several factors that are induced by ER stress have been shown to mediate cell damage. The transcription factor CHOP has been shown to induce an apoptotic response in renal tubular cells of mice injected intraperitoneally with tunicamycin (52Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), and downstream effectors of CHOP have been characterized (53Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In a mouse model of non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia occurs as a consequence of apoptotic destruction of pancreatic β cells induced by ER stress due to ER retention of a mutant insulin precursor. Targeted deletion of CHOP delays the onset of diabetes in these mice (54Oyadomari S. Koizumi A. Takeda K. Gotoh T. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin-induced apoptotic destruction of renal tubular cells is significantly alleviated in mice deficient in caspase-12, which is located at the ER and mediates ER-associated apoptosis in a specific manner (55Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Caspase-12 also mediates amyloid-β-induced toxicity in primary cortical neurons cultured ex vivo but is not activated by non-ER-associated apoptotic signals, such as cycloheximide, tumor necrosis factor, or anti-Fas, again illustrating its specific role in ER-associated cell damage. In ADNDI, cytotoxic pathways triggered by ER retention directly and/or by retrotranslocated degradation intermediates in the cytosol may be involved in the degeneration of vasopressinergic neurons. Our findings indicate that proteasomal degradation of mistargeted precursors occurs even when two wild-type alleles are expressed. In heterozygous individuals, a critical concentration of toxic molecules may be exceeded, leading to neuronal degeneration.

Recent studies demonstrated GCs act as antagonists of leptin in rodents. However, little is known about the interaction between GCs and leptin signaling. In the present study, we investigated the effects of GCs on leptin action in vitro and in vivo. GCs rapidly inhibited the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as assayed by Western blotting using anti-phosphospecific-STAT3 in human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7) transiently expressing long form leptin receptor. GCs also inhibited the leptin-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation but unaltered the specific binding of 125I-leptin to the cells. Parallel experiments, however, demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of GCs were not observed in either IL-6- or LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we examined the feeding behavior and hypothalamic leptin signaling following intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of GCs prior to icv leptin infusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. The food intake after 24 h of icv leptin injection increased 3-fold in GCs-treated animals. In addition, central infusion of GCs resulted in a marked reduction of hypothalamic STAT3 phosphorylation in response to icv infusion of leptin. To clarify the molecular mechanism by which GCs rapidly reduce leptin-induced JAK/STAT signaling, we examined the intracellular signal transduction pathway potentially mediated by GCs. PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, blocked the inhibitory effects of GCs on leptin-induced JAK/STAT activation in Huh7 cells. These results suggest GCs antagonize leptin action by a rapid inhibition of the leptin-induced JAK/STAT pathway partly via MAPK cascade.

GCs-mediated regulation of cytokine production and action has been extensively investigated. GCs inhibit the transcription of most proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α (25Brattsand R. Linden M. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition to the inhibition of a cytokine expression, GCs can often negatively regulate its subsequent signaling pathway (26Mozo L. Gayo A. Suarez A. Rivas D. Zamorano J. Gutierrez C. J.

In contrast, GCs stimulate the expression of the ob gene and leptin secretion in rodents or humans (29Slieker L.J. Sloop K.W. Surface P.L. Kriauciunas A. LaQuier F. Manetta J. Bue-Valleskey J.

Adrenalectomy enhances the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of leptin on food intake and body weight in normal rats (31Zakrzewska K.E. Cusin I. Sainsbury A. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Jeanrenaud B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 717-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the same study, the supplementation of adrenalectomized rats with dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited the enhanced leptin action. It was also demonstrated that central DEX injection induces obesity associated with hyperleptinemia in normal rats (32Zakrzewska K.E. Cusin I. Stricker-Krongrad A. Boss O. Ricquier D. Jeanrenaud B. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GCs act as counter-regulatory hormones of leptin. However, the molecular basis for the cross-talk between the OBRb and GCs pathway has remained unclear. In the present study, we report the acute effects of DEX on the leptin-induced JAK/STAT pathway in vitro and in vivo. We also further investigated the intracellular signal transduction mechanism of GCs-mediated modulation of leptin signaling. Materials—Recombinant mouse leptin was obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). All reagents for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-JAK2 and -STAT3 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-STAT5 and -STAT6 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphospecific JAK2 was from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). Anti-STAT1, -phosphospecific STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). DEX, IL-6, LIF, CelLytic-M mammalian cell lysis/extraction reagent, and CelLytic-MT mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent were purchased from Sigma. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Huh7 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cDNA encoding mouse leptin receptor long form (OBRb) was generated as described previously (9Bjorbaek C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). For binding assays, Huh7 cells were grown in 24-well plates and transfected using 0.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 700 ng of DNA per well according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Western blotting experiments, cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected using 7 μl of LipofectAMINE and 2 μg of DNA per well. At 48 h post-transfection including 15 h of serum deprivation, cells were incubated for 5 or 15 min with 1 nm leptin. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate-buffered saline), dissolved in lysis buffer, CelLytic-M, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Binding Assays—Huh7 cells expressing OBRb were incubated with 100,000 cpm of 125I-leptin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in RPMI medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm unlabeled mouse recombinant leptin. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 n NaOH. The radioactivity in the lysates was measured in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined as the radioactivity bound in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled leptin. Animals—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan) were housed at 22 °C in a 12–12-h light-dark cycle environment (lights on at 7:00 and off at 19:00) and provided with standard laboratory diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo) and tap water ad libitum. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Nagasaki University. Placement of icv Cannulae—At 9 weeks of age and weighing 320–360 g, a 23-gauge stainless steel guide cannula was stereotaxically implanted into the third cerebral ventricle (6 mm anterior to the interaural line, 7.7 mm in depth from the brain surface) by using the SR-6N Stereotaxic Instrument (Narishige Scientific Instrument Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) under pentobarbital anesthesia (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal administration). A stainless steel wire stylet (29 gauge) was inserted into the guide cannula and was tightly fixed on the skull with dental cement to prevent leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. icv Infusion of Dexamethasone—After a 7-day recovery period, the rats were divided into three groups as follows: the control group, the leptin group, and the DEX/leptin group. The rats were injected icv with a bolus of vehicle (6.0 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% of bovine serum albumin) for the control group, leptin (7.5 μg dissolved in 6.0 μl of vehicle) for the leptin group, and DEX (5.0 μg dissolved in 6.0 μl of vehicle) and leptin (7.5 μg dissolved in 6.0 μl of vehicle) for the DEX/leptin group via the cannula (1.0 μl/min). All treatments were performed as close to 19:00 as possible, when the dark phase began. To measure the food intake of each group, the food was weighed 24 h after the icv administration of DEX, leptin, or vehicle. Tissue Excision and Preparation—At 12 h after the injection, leptin (7.5 μg dissolved in 6.0 μl of vehicle) or the same volume of vehicle was administered via the icv cannula (1.0 μl/min) to the leptin group and the DEX/leptin group. At 30 min after the infusion, the rats were decapitated, and the whole hypothalamus was dissected in ice-cold saline on the ice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until the assays. The hypothalamus was homogenized in lysis buffer, CelLytic-MT, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was assayed using a BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Western Blotting—In the in vitro study, 40 μl of the cell lysates was mixed with SDS sample buffer, and in the in vivo study, it was a 200-μg protein of the supernatant. The mixture was boiled for 5 min before the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The membranes were incubated with anti-phospho-STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, or JAK2 antibody (1:1,000) in 5% milk in TBST overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times at room temperature, the membranes were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:2,000) in 1% milk in TBST for 60 min at room temperature, and again washed six times with TBST. The targeted proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The membranes were stripped in Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were then reprobed with anti-STAT1, STAT3 (1:1,000), STAT5, STAT6 (1:200), or JAK2 (1:1,000) antibodies. Statistical Analysis—Differences between two groups were determined by two-tailed Student's t test. p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Effects of DEX on STAT3 Phosphorylation in Vitro —It is well known that administration of GCs to rodents and humans results in obesity associated with hyperleptinemia in addition to hyperinsulinemia. In this study, we examined the effects of DEX on leptin-induced JAK/STAT signaling pathway using human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7). Due to a lack of endogenous leptin receptor, we transiently transfected OBRb cDNA to Huh7 cells (33Chen J. Kunos G. Gao B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 20: 162-168Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Leptin has been shown to activate STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6 in other cell lines (8Baumann H. Morella K.K. White D.W. Dembski M. Bailon P.S. Kim H. Lai C.F. Tartaglia L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8374-8378Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 12Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). We tested which STAT proteins might be involved in leptin signaling in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cells transiently expressing long form leptin receptor (OBRb) were stimulated with 1 nm of leptin at room temperature for 15 min. The cell lysates were subsequently immunoblotted with antibodies for phospho-STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, or STAT6. The bands could only be detected with the antibody for phospho-STAT3. When these membranes were stripped and reprobed with each respective anti-STAT antibody, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6 proteins were all detected in the Huh7 cells (Fig. 1A). We thus tested whether DEX affects the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in Huh7 cells. The Huh7 cells transiently expressing OBRb were pretreated with physiologically relevant concentrations of DEX sequentially stimulated with leptin. The cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies. To investigate the dose response of inhibitory effects of DEX on leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, the cells expressing OBRb were pretreated with 0–10 nm DEX for 1 h at 37 °C before 1 nm leptin stimulation for 15 min at room temperature. A 1-h DEX pretreatment inhibited the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. A significant inhibitory effect of DEX was detected from 0.1 nm DEX pretreatment (Fig. 1B). The leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was completely inhibited by 10 nm DEX pretreatment. Furthermore, to determine the time course of DEX inhibitory effects on leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, the cells were pretreated in 10 nm DEX for various times. The inhibition of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was detected after a 5-min pretreatment with 10 nm DEX and inhibited completely after 1 h (Fig. 1C). All membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT3 antibodies. The total amount of STAT3 protein was not affected by DEX. OBRb is a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily, which includes receptors for IL-6, LIF, prolactin, erythropoietin, and growth hormone (GH). We performed parallel experiments with Huh7 cells expressing endogenous IL-6 and LIF receptor. DEX showed no effect on IL-6- or LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in either a dose- or time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D and E). Effects of DEX on JAK2 Phosphorylation in Vitro —JAK2 is presumed to be STAT3 tyrosine kinases involved in signaling by the cytokine subfamily to which OBRb belongs. We therefore examined whether DEX affects leptin-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-JAK2 antibody. Because Huh7 cells did not have enough endogenous JAK2 protein to be detected by using Western blotting, both JAK2 and OBRb were transiently co-transfected into the cells. When Huh7 cells co-transfected with JAK2 and OBRb were stimulated with 1 nm of leptin for 5 min, JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was increased to a greater extent compared with that in cells co-transfected with empty vector and OBRb. The degree of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to leptin appears to be correlated with the relative amount of JAK2 protein. However, leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in cells co-transfected with JAK2 and OBRb was almost equal to that in cells co-transfected with empty vector and OBRb (Fig. 2A). In parallel experiments, we examined IL-6- or LIF-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in Huh7 cells transfected with empty vector or JAK2 cDNA. We could not detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous JAK2 in Huh7 cells transfected with empty vector after stimulation by IL-6 or LIF. Each ligand markedly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 in cells transfected with JAK2 (Fig. 2B). Similar to the results obtained for STAT3 phosphorylation mediated via leptin, the amount of JAK2 protein did not affect STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to either ligand. Next, we examined the effects of DEX on leptin-induced JAK2 phosphorylation using Huh7 cells co-transfected with JAK2 and OBRb. The cells expressing both JAK2 and OBRb were incubated with or without 10 nm DEX for 1 h and stimulated with 1 nm leptin for 5 min. DEX completely inhibited the leptin-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells co-expressing JAK2 and OBRb, as assayed by Western blotting using anti-phosphospecific JAK2 (Fig. 2C). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-JAK2 antibodies. The total amount of JAK2 protein was not affected by DEX. We did not determine the tyrosine kinase activity of JAK2 in this study. In general, the catalytic activity of JAK2 was stimulated by phosphorylated tyrosine at position 1007 (34Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). We used anti-phosphospecific JAK2 antibody that recognizes this critical site for JAK2 kinase activity. Therefore, phosphorylation of JAK2 should be correlated with the activity of JAK2 in the present study. We next examined the effects of DEX on leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in Huh7 cells co-transfected with JAK2 and OBRb. Similar to previous results (Fig. 1, B and C), DEX attenuated the phosphorylation of STAT3 in cells co-expressing JAK2 and OBRb (Fig. 2C). Effects of Dexamethasone on 125I-Leptin Binding—To test whether DEX decreases the cell surface expression of leptin receptor in Huh7 cells transiently expressing OBRb, we studied the effects of DEX on 125I-leptin binding to the cells. Cells were incubated with 0–100 nm of DEX for 1 h and then subjected to 125I-leptin binding assay. DEX pretreatment had no significant effects on the specific binding of 125I-leptin to the cells expressing OBRb (Fig. 3). The Effects of icv Infusion of DEX on Leptin Action in Vivo —To test whether DEX antagonizes the inhibitory effect of leptin in vivo, we measured the cumulative food intake 24 h after the infusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. As expected, a single icv infusion of leptin significantly suppressed food intake compared with the vehicle-infused control rats. Cumulative food intake 24 h after combined icv infusion of leptin and DEX increased 3-fold compared with icv leptin infusion alone (Fig. 4A). Next we examined the effect of DEX on the leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. Western blotting was carried out using anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody as a primary antibody in the hypothalamus at 30 min after icv infusion of leptin. Pretreatment of icv DEX infusion for 12 h prior to infusion of leptin decreased the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the hypothalamus without affecting the total amount of STAT3 protein (Fig. 4B). The Mechanism of the DEX Effects on JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway—The mechanism by which DEX inhibited leptin-induced JAK/STAT signaling was further examined. DEX rapidly inhibited the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, suggesting that these effects did not require de novo protein synthesis. DEX has been shown to modulate the activity of several protein kinases, including protein kinase C (35John C. Cover P. Solito E. Morris J. Christian H. Flower R. Buckingham J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3060-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (36Qiu J. Wang P. Jing Q. Zhang W. Li X. Zhong Y. Sun G. Pei G. Chen Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory effects of DEX on leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation are mediated through these kinases, we investigated the inhibitory effects of DEX by using the specific inhibitors of protein kinase C and MAPK. Rottlerin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, and SB202190, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, had no effect on the DEX inhibition of leptin-induced STAT3 activation (Fig. 5A). In contrast, when 1 μm of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, was added to the cells prior to treatment with DEX, the inhibitory effect of DEX on leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was blocked. PD98059 by itself had no effect on the STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). We also determined whether PD98059 affects the inhibition of signaling events upstream of STAT3 phosphorylation. We thus investigated the effect of PD98059 on leptin-induced JAK2 phosphorylation that is inhibited by DEX. Pretreatment of PD98059 prevented DEX-mediated inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation. PD98059 itself did not alter the total amount of JAK2 protein or tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (Fig. 5C). The current data demonstrate that DEX inhibits the leptin-induced STAT3 signaling pathway in a cultured cell line and also in the rat hypothalamus. GCs cause an increase in the level of ob gene expression and leptin secretion in isolated adipose tissue from rodents and humans (29Slieker L.J. Sloop K.W. Surface P.L. Kriauciunas A. LaQuier F. Manetta J. Bue-Valleskey J. Stephens T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5301-5304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 35John C. Cover P. Solito E. Morris J. Christian H. Flower R. Buckingham J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3060-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GCs decrease gene expression for most cytokines including IL-6 and LIF (25Brattsand R. Linden M. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies suggested that GCs have a major ability to modify the actions of leptin in vivo (31Zakrzewska K.E. Cusin I. Sainsbury A. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Jeanrenaud B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 717-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zakrzewska K.E. Cusin I. Stricker-Krongrad A. Boss O. Ricquier D. Jeanrenaud B. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this antagonism remain unclear. In the present study, a rapid inhibitory effect of DEX on the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was observed from 0.1 nm of DEX pretreatment in cultured cells expressing OBRb. This concentration in blood level can be considered within the physiologically relevant range (37Halleux C.M. Servais I. Reul B.A. Detry R. Brichard S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of DEX in the central nervous system of humans. One study reported the concentration of DEX in plasma and central nervous system after intravenous administration of DEX to rabbits (38Lamiable D. Vistelle R. Nguyen-Khac M. Millart H. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 434: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Comparing these two concentrations, central nervous system:plasma ratio is around 10% after 6 h from DEX administration. This inhibitory effect of DEX was not observed in other cytokine receptors such as IL-6 and LIF receptor. We are unable to explain the difference between leptin and the IL-6 or LIF system with regard to the effects of DEX. Although OBR is a member of the class I cytokine receptor family, it has been demonstrated that OBR transduces the signal via its homooligomerization without gp130, the signal transducing component for IL-6 and LIF receptor (39Nakashima K. Narazaki M. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structural analysis revealed that the extracellular domain of OBR contains two repeating cytokine receptor domain/fibronectin type 3 domains, in contrast to other members of the class I family (40Fong T.M. Huang R.C. Tota M.R. Mao C. Smith T. Varnerin J. Karritskiy V.V. Krause J.E. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hypersecretion of corticosterone has been observed in genetically obese rodents (41Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and obese humans (42Strain G.W. Zumoff B. Strain J.J. Levin J. Fukushima D.K. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 980-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Continuous central administration of GCs to normal rats resulted in obesity associated with hyperleptinemia, in keeping with the increase in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y levels (32Zakrzewska K.E. Cusin I. Stricker-Krongrad A. Boss O. Ricquier D. Jeanrenaud B. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A central bolus injection of low dose leptin showed no significant effects in normal rats, but significantly decreased food intake and body weight in adrenalectomized rats (31Zakrzewska K.E. Cusin I. Sainsbury A. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Jeanrenaud B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 717-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, an icv bolus administration of GCs (DEX) to normal rats attenuated the inhibitory effects of exogenous leptin on food intake. In agreement with those in vitro findings, GCs markedly inhibit leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus. These results suggest the short term effects of GCs on food intake may be partly mediated via an inhibition of central leptin signaling. The findings in the present study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of GCs occurs at JAK2 upstream of STAT3 in Huh7 cells. DEX has been reported to cause a rapid decrease of the cell surface number in GH receptors, and subsequently to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 in fibroblasts (43King A.P.J. Tseng M. Logsdon C.D. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18088-18094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GH receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily that includes receptors for IL-6, LIF, G-CSF, prolactin, and leptin. We have shown previously that in contrast to GH receptor, no significant effects on leptin binding were observed in DEX-pretreated Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing OBRa or OBRb (44Uotani S. Bjorbaek C. Tornoe J. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings, the present observations showed DEX had no effects on the cell surface number of OBRb in Huh7 cells transiently expressing OBRb. It was reported previously that GCs inhibit IL-2-induced JAK/STAT signaling that suppresses the expression of IL-2 receptor and JAK3 in primary human T cells (27Bianchi M. Meng C. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A more recent study demonstrated that inhibition of STAT1 expression as a mechanism by which GCs inhibit INF-γ signaling (28Hu X. Li W. Meng C. Ivashkiv L.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4833-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects on the expression of these proteins involved in JAK/STAT signaling were mediated by a genomic mechanism of GCs action. Apart from the classic genomic action of GCs, it has been well documented that GCs also have rapid intracellular signal transduction pathway action (45Buttgereit F. Scheffold A. Steroids. 2002; 67: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because the inhibitory effect of DEX on leptin signaling occurred so rapidly, it is suggested that the mechanism does not require de novo protein synthesis. We showed that PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, significantly blocked the DEX effect on leptin-induced JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in Huh7 cells. The present results suggest that the upstream signaling protein MEK might be involved in the DEX-mediated inhibition of leptin signaling. There have been several reports that the MEK-ERK pathway participates in the regulation of cytokine-induced JAK/STAT activation. In PC12 cells, it was reported that GCs rapidly activate ERK1/2 MAPK in a MEK-dependent manner (36Qiu J. Wang P. Jing Q. Zhang W. Li X. Zhong Y. Sun G. Pei G. Chen Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MEK-ERK cascade can mediate the inhibition of IL-6- but not INF-α-induced STAT3 activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells (46Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported ethanol inhibits leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation partly via p38 MAPK, activated by inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses in Huh7 cells (47Degawa-Yamauchi M. Uotani S. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi R. Abe T. Kuwahara H. Yamasaki H. Eguchi K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A more recent study (48Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the targeted disruption of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), also called stress-activated protein kinase, shows reduced adiposity and increased insulin sensitivity associated with enhanced insulin receptor signaling in both genetically and diet-induced obese mice. These findings suggest that MAPKs may play an important role in the modification of insulin and leptin action. In conclusion, the present results provide evidence for a direct cross-talk between the leptin and GCs signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. In Huh7 cells, GCs rapidly inhibit the leptin-induced JAK/STAT pathway partly mediated via MAPK cascades. In vivo GCs attenuate hypothalamic leptin signal transduction pathway and reduce the sensitivity in response to central administration of leptin.

Nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonium in an ATP- and reductant-dependent reaction. It is one of the best characterized metalloenzymes and is an excellent model for elucidating metalloprotein assembly. Nitrogenase is composed of two oxygen-labile metalloproteins: dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase (1Bulen W.A. LeComte J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dinitrogenase (also termed component I or iron-molybdenum protein) is a 240-kDa α2β2 tetramer of the nifD and nifK gene products (3Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Each αβ nitrogenase dimer contains an iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) 1The abbreviations used are: FeMo-co, iron-molybdenum cofactor; NifB-co, NifB cofactor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. and a P cluster (4Kim J.

Dinitrogenase reductase (also termed component II or iron protein) is a 60-kDa α2 dimer of the nifH gene product that contains a single 4Fe-4S center coordinated between the two subunits (6Georgiadis M.M.

In contrast to the α2β2 subunit composition of the mature dinitrogenase, apodinitrogenase (FeMo-co-deficient) from Klebsiella pneumoniae or Azotobacter vinelandii strains with mutations in nifB, nifN, or nifE have a hexameric composition (α2β2γ2). The hexameric apodinitrogenase can be activated in vitro by the simple addition of purified FeMo-co (7Homer M.J. Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. J.

Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11971-11984Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). FeMo-co is found buried, and thus inaccessible, within the protein in the mature α2β2 dinitrogenase. It is believed that the maturation of apodinitrogenase occurs in several steps. The α2β2 form of apodinitrogenase is synthesized having an inaccessible FeMo-co site. The FeMo-co site in the α2β2 form is then made accessible through a reaction that requires dinitrogenase reductase and MgATP (11Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dinitrogenase reductase-dependent maturation of apodinitrogenase promotes the binding of γ (NafY) and its conversion to the stabilized α2β2γ2 form. Finally, FeMo-co is inserted, and NafY disassociates from the mature dinitrogenase. Consistent with this notion, it has been recently shown that a deletion in nafY halves the competency of apodinitrogenase for FeMo-co insertion in Azotobacter extracts (10Rubio L.M. Rangaraj P.

The ability of NafY to bind separately to free FeMo-co or to apodinitrogenase led Roberts and co-workers (13Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

This proposal remains controversial because it has been shown that NafY is dispensable for the insertion of FeMo-co into apodinitrogenase (10Rubio L.M. Rangaraj P. Homer M.J. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W.

We overexpressed NafY in Escherichia coli cells and found that the purified protein has an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain of NafY is conserved among the NifX, NifY, VnfX, and NifB family of proteins and has been referred to as the “core domain” of NafY. The core domain is able to bind to FeMo-co but unable to bind to apodinitrogenase (16Dyer D.H. Rubio L.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Ludden P.W. Rayment I. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of the core domain has been determined and shown to consist of a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices (16Dyer D.H. Rubio L.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Ludden P.W.

Here we report on the biochemical properties of the purified NafY protein and the NafY-FeMo-co complex. We also present data suggesting that the His121 amino acid residue of NafY is involved in FeMo-co binding. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—A. vinelandii strain DJ (wild type) was obtained from D. R. Dean (Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Technical Institute, Blacksburg, VA). Strain UW146 (nifB-nafY) has been described previously (10Rubio L.M. Rangaraj P. Homer M.J. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14299-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Growth in the presence of molybdate, nif derepression, and cell breakage has been described (17Shah V.K. Davis L.C. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α and BL21 (pREP-4) strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). For growth of E. coli on plates, medium solidified with 1.5% agar was used. Antibiotics were used at standard concentrations (18Ausubel F.N. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York2000Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of NafY—Overproduction of NafY in E. coli was accomplished by fusing a nafY gene cartridge to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene, whose expression is controlled by a tac promoter. Plasmid pRHB62 contains the nafY gene cartridge ligated into the pGEX-4T-3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), which incorporates a thrombin cleavage site to remove GST from the fusion partner. The overproduction of GST-NafY, purification of the NafY fusion protein, and separation of the GST moiety from NafY using thrombin were performed as described previously (16Dyer D.H. Rubio L.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Ludden P.W. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32150-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A typical purification procedure yielded 15 mg of NafY from 500 ml of cell culture. The preparations of purified NafY were supplemented with glycerol to 10% (v/v), made anaerobic through degassing with alternate cycles of vacuum and flushing with argon gas, and frozen as droplets into liquid nitrogen until used. When pure preparations of the GST-NafY fusion protein were required, the purification protocol was identical to that of NafY, but the incubation with thrombin protease was omitted, and GST-NafY was eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose column with 5 column volumes of 10 mm reduced glutathione in PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). The eluted GST-NafY protein had some minor protein contaminants at this point, and the preparation was loaded into a 1 cm × 10 cm Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in PBS for further purification. The column was washed with 1 column volume of PBS, and proteins were eluted from the column using a linear 150–500 mm NaCl gradient in PBS. GST-NafY eluted at about 350 mm NaCl and was estimated to be >95% pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis of nafY—Generation of site-directed mutations in nafY was carried out using plasmid pRHB62 as template and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The presence of the introduced mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids pRHB68 (C166S), pRHB69 (C166A), pRHB70 (H121L), pRHB71 (C125A), and pRHB72 (C125A,H188L) were generated. Plasmids encoding NafY variants were transferred to E. coli strain BL21 (pREP-4) by transformation. The overexpression and purification of NafY variants was carried out as described above for the wild-type NafY. Purification of Other Components—Apodinitrogenase was purified in its NafY-deficient α2β2 form by affinity chromatography utilizing the GST-NafY fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (>95% purity). 2L. M. Rubio, and P. W. Ludden, unpublished results. The resultant protein was stored anaerobically in liquid nitrogen until used. Methods for the purification of FeMo-co (19Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and NifB-co (20Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Determination of the Native Molecular Mass of NafY—The native molecular mass of NafY was determined by equilibrium sedimentation of pure NafY in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using 12-mm double sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces. Three 100-μl samples were prepared by dilution of a dialyzed stock solution with its dialysate to give concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg of NafY/ml. 105 μl of dialysate were in the reference sector of each cell. Concentration gradients were recorded at 280 nm every 3–4 h until the gradients were superimposible. Equilibrium data were attained at 10,000 rpm and 17,300 rpm at 20 °C. Gel filtration chromatography experiments were performed by applying 100 μl of sample (containing 80 μg of NafY) onto a Superose 6, Superdex 200, or a Sephacryl S-200 column connected to an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were 1 cm diameter × 30 cm long. PBS buffer and a 0.5 ml/min flow rate were used. When FeMo-co was included in the analysis, PBS was made anaerobic by sparging with nitrogen for 2 h and then adding 0.1 mm sodium dithionite. Quantitation of the Affinity of NafY for FeMo-co and Interaction between NafY and NifB-co—The Kd of the NafY-FeMo-co complex was estimated using the equation developed by Lundblad et al. (21Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), after measuring the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of NafY upon FeMo-co binding. Fluorescence changes in NafY were recorded at room temperature with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 B spectrofluorometer using pure NafY protein in PBS supplemented with 10% glycerol. The instrument settings were: λex = 295 nm; excitation slit, 2.5 nm; λem = 354 nm; and emission slit, 7.5 nm. The values were corrected for dilution and for inner filter effects. The interaction between NafY and NifB-co was studied measuring the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of NafY because of the presence of increasing concentrations of NifB-co. Fluorescence changes in NafY were recorded as above. The values were corrected for dilution and for inner filter effects. Determination of the Number of FeMo-co-binding Sites in NafY— Purified NafY and isolated FeMo-co were used to determine the stoichiometry of the binding. All glassware was rinsed with 4 n HCl overnight to remove traces of contaminating molybdenum and iron and then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. An amount of FeMo-co equivalent to 10 nmol of molybdenum was added to 3 nmol of NafY in 1.35 ml of anaerobic 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 1 mm sodium dithionite, pH 7.5. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then applied to a 1 cm × 30 cm Superdex 200 column equilibrated in the same buffer to separate unbound FeMo-co from the NafY-FeMo-co complex. The protein sample was eluted in the same buffer and then subjected to protein and metal analyses. The iron and molybdenum contents of the protein samples were determined at the University of Georgia by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—The procedure for SDS-PAGE has been described (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described by Brandner et al. (23Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified preparations of NafY described in this work were used to raise anti-NafY antibodies at the Polyclonal Antibody Service of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Anoxic Native Gel Electrophoresis and Iron Staining—The proteins were separated on anoxic native gels with a 7–16% acrylamide and a 0–20% sucrose gradient as described (11Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When needed, native gels were stained for iron as described previously (24Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein Assays—The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). EPR Analysis—We performed EPR analysis of the NafY-FeMo-co complex. The complex was generated by mixing an excess of NafY (3.5 mg, 130 nmol) and 50 nmol of FeMo-co in a total volume of 36.5 ml of anaerobic 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm sodium dithionite, pH 7.5 buffer. The complex was then anaerobically concentrated in an Amicon cell, diluted, and reconcentrated with the same buffer until the concentration of N-methylformamide was under 1% (v/v). EPR was performed at a microwave frequency of 9.44 Ghz and a modulation amplitude of 10 millitesla using a Bruker ESP 300E EPR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker ER0815 frequency converter, a Bruker ER041 XG microwave bridge, and a Oxford ITC temperature controller. Overexpression and Purification of NafY and GST-NafY— The NafY protein from A. vinelandii was produced in E. coli BL21 (pREP-4) cells carrying pRHB62 plasmid as a GST-NafY fusion protein of about 50 kDa. Accumulation of soluble GST-NafY in crude extracts of BL21 cells was achieved in highly aerated cultures after incubation at 30 °C in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig. 1, lane 2). (Incubation of BL21 cells at 37 °C and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside resulted in the accumulation of insoluble GST-NafY.) The protocol for purification of NafY involved three steps: glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, in situ digestion with thrombin to separate NafY from the GST moiety, and benzamidine-Sepharose affinity chromatography to remove the thrombin (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The purity of NafY at the end of the process was determined to be >99% based on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, lane 3). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the as-isolated NafY protein has a single peak with a maximum at 281 nm and is featureless in the 310–900 nm range (data not shown). The as-isolated NafY protein does not contain significant levels of iron or molybdenum. Purification of the GST-NafY fusion protein was performed in two steps: a glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and a Mono-Q anion-exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purity of GST-NafY at the end of the purification protocol was determined to be >95% based on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, lane 4). Unassociated and FeMo-co-Bound Forms of NafY Are Monomeric—We began characterizing the purified NafY by determining its molecular mass and quaternary structure. Homer et al. (13Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) had reported that, in cell-free extracts of A. vinelandii, NafY is a dimer of 46 kDa that monomerizes into 23-kDa subunits upon FeMo-co binding. The result was based on gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl resin. In the process of determining the molecular masses of the unassociated and the FeMo-co-bound forms of purified NafY, we found that both forms are monomeric under the conditions employed here. Equilibrium centrifugation experiments were performed because they are less sensitive to protein shape-induced errors than gel filtration. The native molecular mass of NafY was determined in three different samples containing 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg of NafY/ml. Analysis of the equilibrium centrifugation data yielded an average mass of 28,012 ± 134 Da for the unassociated NafY (Fig. 2A). This number is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of a NafY monomer as deduced from the nafY gene sequence (26,141 Da) and also with the 26,152 ± 3 Da number obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on several preparations of purified NafY (data not shown). Importantly, the analysis of the equilibrium centrifugation experiments showed no significant levels of NafY dimer formation in any of the three different concentrations of NafY tested (Keq for the dimer/monomer pair = 0.042 ± 0.008). These results clearly indicate that the unassociated form of NafY is a monomer. We were not able to determine the molecular mass of the FeMo-co-bound form of NafY by equilibrium centrifugation because of technical problems with the O2 lability of FeMo-co. Therefore, for this analysis we performed gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, Superose 6, or Superdex 200 FPLC columns and followed the elution profile of FeMo-co by measuring the absorbance at 436 nm. The NafY-FeMo-co complex is easily generated by mixing pure NafY and FeMo-co in anoxic buffer immediately before the chromatography and is stable during the gel filtration. Surprisingly, the 436-nm signal was detected as a 46-kDa species (Fig. 2B). This 46-kDa species corresponds to NafY-bound FeMo-co as demonstrated by the coelution of NafY and FeMo-co at the same fraction (shown by SDS-PAGE analysis in the inset of Fig. 2B). We also subjected the unassociated form of NafY to gel filtration chromatography under the same conditions and followed the elution profile by absorbance at 280 nm (Fig. 2B). Unassociated NafY behaves as a 44-kDa species. Therefore, both NafY and the NafY-FeMo-co complex exhibit the same retention volume, indicating that NafY does not change its association state upon FeMo-co binding. The gel filtration results presented here differ from those reported previously. One explanation would be that the form of NafY present in crude extracts of A. vinelandii (studied in Ref. 13Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) behaves differently from the NafY purified from E. coli cells (studied here). However, this is unlikely because both proteins have identical migration patterns on anoxic native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Our gel filtration and equilibrium centrifugation results also differ from each other. Although NafY behaves almost as a dimer in gel filtration, it clearly behaves as a monomer during equilibrium centrifugation. Equilibrium centrifugation is far less sensitive than gel filtration to errors because of anomalies in protein shape, and the simplest explanation is that the size of NafY is overestimated when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography because the shape of NafY would be very different from spherical. In any event, the results presented here suggest that: 1) NafY is a monomeric 26-kDa protein and 2) FeMo-co binding to NafY does not alter this monomeric state. Purified NafY Is Able to Bind FeMo-co—The capability of purified NafY to bind FeMo-co was assayed by means of anoxic native gel electrophoresis. It has previously been shown that the FeMo-co-bound form of NafY migrates faster than the unassociated NafY in native gel electrophoresis of crude extracts of A. vinelandii (13Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we show that purified NafY also shifts to a more quickly migrating species in native gels upon FeMo-co binding (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A). The presence of FeMo-co in the more quickly migrating species is supported by iron staining of the gel, where only the more quickly migrating species gives a positive iron stain (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Because the oligomerization state of NafY does not change upon FeMo-co binding, the migration shift of NafY in native gels suggests that the protein is either more compact in the presence of FeMo-co or that the net charge on the protein has changed. In addition, NafY mobility shift does not require the presence of any additional protein; therefore NafY alone is sufficient for FeMo-co binding. The GST-NafY fusion protein is also capable of binding FeMo-co and shifting to a more quickly migrating species in anoxic native gel electrophoresis (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3B). It seems that the GST moiety of the GST-NafY fusion protein does not obstruct the FeMo-co-binding site present in NafY. We have also performed EPR analysis of the NafY-FeMo-co complex. The EPR spectrum of NafY-bound FeMo-co at 10 K retains the characteristic S = 3/2 signal (g = 4.42, 3.70, and 1.98) of the dithionite-reduced M center of dinitrogenase and N-methylformamide-extracted free FeMo-co (Fig. 4). Although the EPR spectral components of NafY-FeMo-co are broader than the dinitrogenase M center, the overall spectrum is better defined than free FeMo-co; the sharpening of the spectrum upon complexation of FeMo-co to NafY to is similar to the observed effect of thiophenol addition to free FeMo-co in N-methylformamide (26Rawlings J. Shah V.K. Chisnell J.R. Brill W.J. Zimmermann R. Munck E. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sharp feature at g = 2.03 in the NafY-FeMo-co spectrum is observed in variable amounts in different samples and is not present in the NafY spectrum (data not shown); therefore, it may arise from protic or oxic decomposition of FeMo-co. The small feature at g = 6.0 arises from an electronic excited state also present in the spectra of the M center and free FeMo-co (27George G.N. Prince R.C. Bare R.E. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of NafY-FeMo-co establishes that no fundamental alteration of the cofactor occurs upon binding to NafY. It is proposed that the sharpness of the S = 3/2 signal from the M center is due to the coordination environment of FeMo-co in dinitrogenase. The broadness of the signal shown in Fig. 4 (curve b) implies that there is structural flexibility for FeMo-co within the complex. NafY Binds One Molecule of FeMo-co with High Affinity—To calculate the dissociation constant of the NafY-FeMo-co complex, we needed to know the number of FeMo-co-binding sites in NafY. To address this question, the following experiment was performed. First, pure NafY was incubated with saturating amounts of FeMo-co to generate a NafY-FeMo-co complex; second, unbound FeMo-co was separated from the NafY-FeMo-co complex by anaerobic gel filtration in a Superdex 200 FPLC column; and third, protein, iron, and molybdenum contents of the fraction containing NafY (and bound FeMo-co) were determined, and their molar ratios were calculated. The result presented in Table I, where the protein:molybdenum:iron molar ratio obtained is close to 1:1:7, strongly suggests that NafY has one FeMo-co-binding site per monomer. In a parallel experiment with no FeMo-co added, the as-purified NafY shows no significant levels of iron and molybdenum.Table IMetal contents of as-purified NafY and the in vitro generated NafY-FeMo-co complexProtein sampleMolybdenumIronmol/mol NafYmol/mol NafYNafYNDaND, there were not detectable metal levels above the blank.NDNafY-FeMo-co complexb10 nmol of FeMo-co were added to 3 nmol of NafY in 1.35 ml of anaerobic Tris-HCl buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.

Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6603-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), in contrast to the delayed PS exposure associated with apoptosis (17Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Högstrand K.

ATPec is able to evoke physiological responses in a wide variety of cells and tissues. ATP is concentrated in cell cytosol and in exocytic vesicles, reaching 2–4 and 100 mm, respectively (19Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. C. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can be merely released from damaged cells, transported through carriers or channels, or secreted (19Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J.

In the extracellular medium, its lifetime is very short due to its rapid degradation by ectonucleotidases and ecto-ATPases (19Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. C. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPec binds to distinct types of purinergic receptors classified into two subfamilies: metabotropic P2Y receptors coupled to G-protein (P2Y1–6 and P2Y11) and ligand-gated ion channel P2X receptors (P2X1–7) (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). P2X7 receptor, previously designated as P2Z receptor (23Surprenant A. Rassendren E. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), utilizes extracellular ATP4– to increase cationic permeability with consecutive plasma membrane depolarization. Another feature of the P2X7 receptor is its ability to form or activate a non-selective pore, permeable to molecules with molecular mass <400 Da in thymocytes, when the ATPec application is prolonged or repeated (24Pizzo P. Zanovello P. Bronte V. Di Virgilio F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Activation of the P2X7 receptor triggers various physiological processes, including cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (26Di Virgilio F. Immunol.

Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 8: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (706) Google Scholar). PS exposure, Ca2+ influx, and pore formation are dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of the P2X7 receptor, which harbors a putative tumor necrosis factor receptor-related death domain and a Src homology 3-binding domain (29Adriouch S. Dox C. Welge V. Seman M. Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4108-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that ATPec induced early PS exposure, 1-oleoyl-2-[6-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) scrambling, and apoptosis in 35–40% of the thymocytes. PS exposure and NBD-PC scrambling were dependent on an increase in Ca2+ and/or Na+ influx resulting from P2X7 activation. At physiological external concentrations, Na+ was more potent than Ca2+ to induce PS exposure. Portions of this work have appeared in a preliminary report (31Courageot M.P. Lépine S. Giraud F. Sulpice J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Invitrogen, and Ca2+-free RPMI 1640 medium was from BIO MEDIA. ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine, UTP, α,β-methyleneATP (αβmATP), 2′- and 3′-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)ATP (BzATP), suramin, pyrioxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS), oxidized ATP, propidium iodide (PI), ethidium bromide, monensin, gramicidin D, and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma and prepared as stock solutions in water or in ethanol for gramicidin D and dexamethasone. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-annexin-V was obtained from Bender MedSystems, and Factor Va was from Hematologic Technologies Inc. The fluorescent analog NBD-PC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The fluorescent Ca2+ probes (fluo4-AM and fura2-AM) and fluorescent plasma membrane potential probe DiBac4(3) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Thymocytes were isolated from thymus of 3–6-week-old BALB/c male mice. Cell suspensions with viability, as estimated by trypan blue exclusion, lower than 95% were discarded. Thymocytes (2·106/ml) were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS (5% FCS/RPMI) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When required, cells were incubated in Ca2+-free RPMI 1640 medium or in saline media (choline media) containing 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 150 μm EGTA, and various concentrations of NaCl (0–139 mm) or CaCl2 (0–5 mm) supplemented with choline chloride to maintain the osmolarity to 300 mOsm. Endogenous PS Externalization—When cells were incubated in Ca2+-containing medium, PS exposure was assayed from the binding of FITC-annexin-V in the presence of PI (50 μg/ml), a marker of plasma membrane integrity used to evaluate the percentage of necrotic cells. PS+/PI–cell population represents non-necrotic cells with externalized PS. Alternatively, when cells were incubated in a medium devoid of Ca2+, factor Va, another specific ligand of PS whose binding is Ca2+-independent, was used as described previously (32Kojima H. Newton-Nash D. Weiss H.J. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 2237-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Binding of factor Va was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The fixation of factor Va on the cell surface altered the plasma membrane integrity as reflected by the uptake of PI in all PS+ cells. Consequently the responsive cells were expressed as total PS+ cells. However, the proportion of the necrotic cells, estimated in independent assays by measurement of PI uptake, was found to be less than 10% after ATPec treatment, a proportion similar to that observed in control cells. The percentage of PS+ cells determined by factor Va binding was always slightly higher than that obtained by FITC-annexin-V staining, suggesting that the affinity of factor Va for PS was higher than that of FITC-annexin-V. NBD-PC Internalization—The transverse redistribution of the PC analog was assayed as described previously (6Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 33Williamson P. van den Eijnde S. Schlegel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 66: 339-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation of thymocytes for 10 min with 1 mm ATPec, the fluorescent analog NBD-PC (62.5 nm final concentration representing about 1.5% of cellular phospholipids) was loaded into the cells by 6-min incubation at room temperature. The percentage of cells with internalized PC was assayed after extraction by fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (2 min at 4 °C) of the fraction of the analog present in the external leaflet. Samples were sorted by flow cytometry after addition of PI to evaluate the proportion of necrotic cells. Plasma Membrane Depolarization—Thymocytes (2·106/ml) were stained with 300 nm DiBac4(3) for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity of the DiBac4(3) probe increased when cells were depolarized. In these experiments, PI uptake was used to exclude necrotic cells and to determine plasma membrane integrity in non-necrotic cells. Ethidium or Propidium Uptake—After various times of incubation at 37 °C, an aliquot of cells (2·106/ml) was stained with PI (50 μg/ml) or ethidium bromide (10 μg/ml) for 3 min at room temperature. The extent of the pore opening induced by ATPec was evaluated from the fluorescence of propidium or ethidium bound to nuclear DNA and detected by flow cytometry. Detection of Surface Markers CD4 and CD8 —The surface markers CD4 and CD8 were detected by flow cytometry after staining thymocytes with R-phycoerythrin-anti-CD4 and either FITC-anti-CD8 or biotin-anti-CD8 and peridin chlorophyll a protein-streptavidin. Cytosolic Calcium Concentration—Thymocytes (2·106/ml) were loaded with 2 μm fluo4-AM (15 min at 37 °C). PI uptake was used to exclude necrotic cells. The variations in [Ca2+]i were determined in non-necrotic cells. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the following equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd [(F – Fmin)/(Fmax – F)] where Kd is the dissociation constant of the Ca2+-fluo4 complex (345 nm) (34Martinez M.C. Freyssinet J.M. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Fmax is the maximum fluorescence (obtained after addition of 8 μm A23187 and 1.4 mm Ca2+ for 5 min), and Fmin is the minimum fluorescence (obtained after addition of 8 μm A23187 and 5.4 mm EGTA for 5 min). In control cells one fluorescence peak was observed, whereas after ATPec stimulation a second population with higher fluorescence was apparent (high Ca2+ cells). F is the geometric mean fluorescence value of this high Ca2+ cell population. In all these experiments, cells were sorted by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FaxVantage cytometer. Fluorochrome excitation was performed by argon laser at 488 nm, and fluorescence emissions were analyzed with a 530 nm filter for FITC, NBD-PC, DiBac4(3), and fluo4; with a 575 nm filter for ethidium and R-phycoerythrin; with a 630 nm filter for PI; and with a 660 nm filter for peridin chlorophyll a protein. Cells (5·106/ml) were loaded with 4 μm fura2-AM (30 min at 37 °C) and resuspended in a Ca2+-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 150 μm EGTA. Fura2 fluorescence was recorded continuously in a thermostatted and magnetically stirred cuvette of a spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence emission ratio of the probe excited at 340 and 380 nm reflected [Ca2+]i. Nuclear condensation was quantified by fluorescence microscopy after DNA staining with Hoescht 33342 (10 μg/ml) and PI (50 μg/ml) for 10 min. Approximately 200 randomly selected cells were scored for each experimental condition. Cells exhibiting blue or red condensed or fragmented nuclei were considered apoptotic. Cells with red nuclei without signs of condensation or fragmentation were considered necrotic. For detection of DNA fragmentation, cells (3·106) were washed and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min on ice followed by 60 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (30 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C), DNA in the supernatant was precipitated overnight in cold absolute ethanol containing 0.3 m sodium acetate at –20 °C. After centrifugation (30 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C), the pellet was resuspended in water and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml DNase-free RNase. DNA concentration was quantified by UV spectrometry at 260 nm. About 5 μg of DNA was mixed with gel loading solution and incubated for 5 min at 65 °C before electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. DNA was visualized by UV light. Data are means ± S.E. of a minimum of three independent experiments. Differences between means were evaluated by paired t test with p < 0.05 being taken as the level of significance. ATPec Induces Apoptosis and PS Exposure in a Limited Thymocyte Population—Cell death was measured after 5-h incubation of freshly isolated thymocytes in the presence of ATPec. Nuclear condensation was significant at 0.5 mm ATPec in 20–25% of the cells and maximal at 1 mm affecting 35% of the total population (Fig. 1A). Thymocyte apoptosis was confirmed by visualization of DNA fragmentation on agarose gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleosome formation induced by 1 mm ATPec was comparable to that promoted by 1 μm dexamethasone, a well known inducer of thymocyte apoptosis (Fig. 1B). When compared with spontaneous thymocyte apoptosis, the effect of 1 mm ATPec on nuclear condensation was significantly increased after 4-h treatment and reached a maximum (35–40%) after 6 h (Fig. 1C). Incubation for up to 9 h did not change significantly the percentage of cells with condensed nuclei and marginally increased the percentage of necrotic cells (11%), indicating that under these experimental conditions ATPec induced apoptosis preferentially to necrosis in a limited population of thymocytes. During the apoptotic process, PS exposure was reported to be concomitant or to precede slightly nuclear events such as nuclear condensation (5Stuart M.C. Damoiseaux J.G. Frederik P.M. Arends J.W. Reutelingsperger C.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ATPec induced PS exposure and nuclear condensation within the same range of concentrations (0.5–3 mm) with a maximal effect at 1 mm (Figs. 1A and 2A). Surprisingly PS exposure was already significant in 15% of cells after 6-min treatment with 1 mm ATPec and was maximal after 20–30 min, affecting about 40% of the thymocytes (Fig. 2B). These results show that PS exposure was a very early event in thymocytes, preceding nuclear alterations. After 5-h incubation with 1 mm ATPec, both PS exposure and nuclear condensation, observed by light microscopy after FITC-annexin-V binding and Hoescht staining, were detected in the same cell population (data not shown). Differentiation of immature thymocytes into mature T cells takes place in the thymus and proceeds via an ordered sequence of developmental steps characterized notably by variable expression of CD4 and CD8. Early precursor cells are initially double negative CD4–CD8– (DN) and go through a double positive CD4+CD8+ (DP) intermediate state before differentiating into single positive CD4+CD8– or CD4–CD8+ (SPCD4+ or SPCD8+, respectively). The distribution of the thymocyte population and the percentage of PS-exposing cells in each subset (DN, DP, and SP, either CD4+ or CD8+) were analyzed by flow cytometry. As previously reported (2Apasov S.G. Koshiba M. Chused T.M. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5095-5105PubMed Google Scholar), DP accounted for about 80% of the population (Fig. 2C). ATPec induced PS externalization in each thymocyte subset. The most mature thymocytes (SPCD4+ or SPCD8+) were also those in which the percentage of cells exposing PS was significantly the highest (68 and 73% versus 43 and 29% in DN and DP, respectively) (Fig. 2C). These data show that, as far as PS exposure is concerned, ATPec responsiveness was dependent on the maturation state of thymocytes. P2X7 Purinoceptor Is Involved in ATPec-induced PS Exposure—Thymocytes express different classes of membrane receptors activated by purine ligands (1Chvatchkov Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T.

Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify which purinoceptor(s) was mediating early PS exposure in thymocytes, the effect of various purine agonists and antagonists was investigated. Neither adenosine (a P1 receptor agonist) nor UTP (a P2Y1, P2Y4, and P2Y6 agonist) (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) was able to induce PS exposure. αβmATP, a P2X1 or P2X3 receptor agonist (25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar), was unable to induce PS exposure (Fig. 3A). In contrast, 0.1 mm BzATP, a P2X7 agonist with a 10-fold higher affinity than ATPec (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar), promoted PS externalization to the same extent as did 1 mm ATPec (Fig. 3A). Furthermore antagonists of P2X (suramin or PPADS) (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar), at concentrations known to inhibit P2X1 receptor (1Chvatchkov Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T. Buell G. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1996; 5: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), had no effect on PS exposure induced by 1 mm ATPec (Fig. 3B), whereas oxidized ATP, a P2X7 antagonist (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited ATPec-induced PS externalization (Fig. 3B). As P2X7 is activated by ATP4– but not by Mg-ATP (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar), chelation of ATPec by high Mg2+ concentrations antagonizes P2X7 activation. Pretreatment of thymocytes with 15 mm Mg2+ significantly inhibited PS exposure induced by ATPec without affecting PS exposure in control cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore ADP induced PS exposure in a significantly smaller percentage of cells than did ATPec, whereas 1 mm AMP was without effect (Fig. 3A) as expected from their respective affinities for the P2X7 purinoceptor (2Apasov S.G. Koshiba M. Chused T.M. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5095-5105PubMed Google Scholar, 23Surprenant A. Rassendren E. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar, 35Chused T.M. Apasov S.G. Sitkovsky M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1371-1380PubMed Google Scholar). PS exposure induced by 1 mm ADP was inhibited by oxidized ATP confirming that this effect was mediated through P2X7 activation (data not shown). PS exposure required ATPec concentrations above 0.1 mm (Fig. 2A) in agreement with the range of concentrations reported to activate P2X7, excluding a role for P2X1 purinoceptor, whose activation occurs at concentrations below 0.1 mm (25North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Altogether these data provide evidence for the implication of P2X7 in ATPec-induced PS exposure. P2X7 Receptor Is Initially in Channel Conformation during PS Exposure—To determine whether P2X7 was in a channel or pore conformation under the conditions leading to early PS exposure, we measured the uptake of two impermeant nucleus markers of different molecular sizes, ethidium (314 Da) and propidium (414 Da), in response to 1 mm ATPec. Fig. 4A shows that, during the first 20 min of incubation, there was no uptake of propidium, and the uptake of ethidium, observed in less than 15% of cells, was not significantly different with or without ATPec. Furthermore the level of fluorescence intensity was the same in control or ATPec-treated cells (data not shown). These data indicate that P2X7 was not in a pore conformation at least for the period during which PS became externalized in thymocytes upon treatment with 1 mm ATPec. Nevertheless, after 40 min of ATPec treatment, only ethidium and not propidium uptake was observed in a significant percentage of cells (Fig. 4A), showing that the pore formation was a time-dependent and size-limited process in thymocytes. P2X7 is an ATP-gated nonspecific cation channel mediating fast permeability changes to Na+, K+, and Ca2+ (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). When thymocytes were incubated in a Ca2+-free medium, there was no change in [Ca2+]i upon addition of 1 mm ATPec, showing that this treatment did not induce any Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless subsequent addition of Ca2+ to the medium triggered a significant increase in [Ca2+]i, reflecting Ca2+ influx in ATPec-treated cells (Fig. 4B). Attempts to measure Na+ influx by using Sodium Green-AM or sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate-AM (Molecular Probes), two specific probes for Na+ detection, were unsuccessful, presumably as a result of inefficient probe loading in thymocytes. However, addition of 1 mm ATPec induced a rapid depolarization of the plasma membrane detected from the increase in DiBac4(3) fluorescence (Fig. 4C), pr"
https://openalex.org/W1982306126,"The involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in steroid-induced cell proliferation has received much attention. However, the adaptor molecule that mediates this interaction remains to be identified. In this communication, we identify p52(Shc) as the mediator between tyrosine phosphorylation signaling and steroid signaling in steroid-responsive cell proliferation. Although the different LNCaP prostate cancer cells, C-33, C-51 and C-81, express similar levels of functional androgen receptor (AR), they exhibit different levels of androgen sensitivity. C-33 cell proliferation is highly responsive to the presence of androgens, whereas C-51 cell proliferation is comparatively less responsive to androgens. In contrast, C-81 cell proliferation is independent of androgens. In these cells, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of both p52(Shc) and ErbB-2 were greatest in C-81 cells, comparatively less in C-51 cells and weaker in C-33 cells. The levels and activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase, cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, decreased correspondingly in those cells. In both androgen-independent, rapidly growing C-81 and ErbB-2 cDNA-transfected C-33 cells, p52(Shc) was hyperphosphorylated at Tyr317 (Y317). Conversely, p52(Shc) tyrophosphorylation was decreased in prostatic acid phosphatase cDNA-transfected stable subclones of C-81 cells, which restore androgen-sensitive proliferation and leads to slow growth rates. In C-33 cells, androgen-stimulated cell proliferation correlated with tyrophosphorylation of ErbB-2 and increased phosphorylation of p52(Shc) at Y317, but not at Y239, differing from phosphorylation patterns associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant of p52(Shc), that is Y317F, blocks Y317 phosphorylation of endogenous p52(Shc) and abolishes androgen-stimulated proliferation, but not EGF-stimulated proliferation. Thus, Y317 of p52(Shc) serves as an important regulatory site that allows tyrosine phosphorylation pathways to moderate androgen sensitivity in human prostate cancer cells."

Recent evidence has indicated that hyperactivation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) may represent an important biochemical change in the development of tuberous sclerosis-associated lesions. We show here that deletion of either Tsc1 or Tsc2 or expression of the Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase leads to hyperphosphorylation of S6K1 at a subset of regulatory sites, particularly those of two essential residues functionally conserved among AGC superfamily serine/threonine kinases, i.e. the activation loop (T-loop; Thr-229) and the hydrophobic motif (H-motif; Thr-389). These sites are reciprocally and dose-dependently regulated when S6K1 is coexpressed with the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex. Mutations that render S6K1 mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-resistant also protect S6K1 activity and phosphorylation from down-regulation by Tsc1/2. We demonstrate that two disease-associated mutations in Tsc2 fail to negatively regulate S6K1 activity concomitant with a failure to modify T-loop and H-motif phosphorylation. Finally, we identify one pathological Tsc2 mutation that retains its ability to negatively regulate S6K1, suggesting that, in some cases, tuberous sclerosis may develop independently of S6K1 hyperactivation. These results also highlight the importance of dual control of T-loop and H-motif phosphorylation of S6K1 by the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex.

Tuberous sclerosis is a hyperproliferative disorder resulting in the appearance of benign tumors in multiple organ systems including brain, skin, lungs, heart, eyes, kidneys, pancreas, and the skeleton (1Gomez M.R.

In metazoans, Tsc1 and Tsc2 form a signaling complex that performs a cell growth suppressive function. Studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in either dTsc1 or dTsc2 increase cell size and do so cell autonomously (6Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T. Cell. 2001; 105: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 7Gao X. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Conversely, combined overexpression of dTsc1 and dTsc2 reduces cell size, whereas expression of either product individually is without effect (6Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T. Cell. 2001; 105: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a model in which the Tsc1-Tsc2 heterodimer is the functional configuration. Homozygous disruption of either Tsc1 or Tsc2 in mice is embryonically lethal, whereas mice heterozygous for either allele display increased organ size and a propensity for tumor development (8Kwiatkowski D.J.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that a deficiency in either of the tuberous sclerosis gene products leads to hyperactivation of S6K1. 1The abbreviations used are: S6K1, S6 kinase 1; AID, autoinhibitory domain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid; CT, carboxyl terminus; HA, hemagglutinin A; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; rpS6, ribosomal protein 6. 1The abbreviations used are: S6K1, S6 kinase 1; AID, autoinhibitory domain; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid; CT, carboxyl terminus; HA, hemagglutinin A; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; rpS6, ribosomal protein 6. In the absence of an S6K1 crystal structure, the model of S6K1 activation is based on extensive mutational and structure-function studies and by inferences from the structure and analysis of other AGC kinases, including Akt (10Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). It is postulated that the unphosphorylated autoinhibitory domain (AID) folds upon and occludes the amino-terminally positioned kinase domain, perhaps performing the following two functions: 1) limiting access of the substrate to the catalytic site; and 2) burying additional activating phosphorylation sites within the protein's interior (see Fig. 1A). Activation is achieved through a coordinated and sequential series of phosphorylations beginning with phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal AID. Up to six serine/threonine and proline sites, designated (S/T)P, are localized to the AID and undergo phosphorylation in response to activating stimuli. Substitution of four of these sites with alanine compromises the serum-induced activation of S6K1 (12Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas exchange of these sites with phosphomimic acidic residues only slightly increases the basal activity (12Han J.W.

Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that phosphorylation of the AID is necessary but not sufficient for S6K1 activation. Subsequently, two sites conserved among kinases of the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine kinases are phosphorylated, namely the activation loop (T-loop) site at position Thr-229 and the hydrophobic motif (H-motif) site at position Thr-389. Mutation of Thr-229 to either alanine or glutamate abolishes kinase activity (13Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.-W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, it is less clear just how the phosphorylation of these sites participates in the collective regulation of S6K1. For S6K1, T-loop and H-motif phosphorylation is the net result of the integration of two major input pathways, nutrient sufficiency and growth factor adequacy. The nutrient sufficiency pathway senses the availability of glucose and amino acids as well as mitochondrial function and requires a complex comprised of mTOR, the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), and GβL (19Kim D.-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 20Hara K.

Raptor appears to physically recognize the TOS (target of rapamycin signaling) motif in S6K1 and another mTOR substrate, the eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP), and may function to present such substrates to the mTOR kinase (21Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate S6K1 in vitro both at the H-motif site, Thr-389, and at the AID sites, Ser-411 and Thr-421/Ser-424, although Thr-389 appears to be the major site of phosphorylation (22Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA depletion of mTOR, Raptor, or GβL compromises nutrient stimulation of S6K1 (19Kim D.-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar), demonstrating a requirement for each component of the complex in productive signaling. It is unclear precisely how nutrient availability is sensed by the mTOR-Raptor-GβL complex. Regulation of S6K1 by the growth factor adequacy pathway involves activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and, thus, the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in cellular membranes. S6K1 is activated by ectopic expression of PI3K (14Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (12Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), indicating that PI3K is both necessary and sufficient for S6K1 activity. In response to growth factors, PI3K phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the D3 position of the inositol ring, producing PIP3. The PH (pleckstrin homology) domains of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt bind PIP3, resulting in the membrane localization and activation of these proteins (reviewed in Ref. 23Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). In mitogen-stimulated cells, S6K1 is phosphorylated at the T-loop site, Thr-229, by PDK1 (24Pullen N. Dennis P. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 25Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A phosphopeptide modeled after the phosphorylated H-motif of S6K1 binds much more efficiently to PDK1 than the unphosphorylated peptide (26Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), potentially explaining the strongly synergistic nature of H-motif and T-loop phosphorylation of S6K1. Moreover, when coexpressed in cells, PDK1 binds much more efficiently to an S6K1 variant bearing a phosphomimic H-motif substitution (27Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phosphorylated H-motif provides a surface with which PDK1 makes physical contact. Akt is also phosphorylated and activated by PDK1. In response to growth factors, Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 on as many as five sites (28Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting the intrinsic GTP exchange activity of Tsc2 for the small GTP-binding protein Rheb (30Zhang Y. Gao X.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Thus, in response to growth factors, Rheb accumulates in the GTP-liganded and, thus, active configuration. Although Rheb activation is sufficient to activate S6K1 even in the absence of amino acids (33Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), whether or not Rheb signals to S6K1 indirectly through mTOR remains a debated issue. Given the requirement of T-loop and H-motif phosphorylation for S6K1 activation and given the finding that Tsc1 or Tsc2 loss-of-function results in hyperactivation of S6K1, we set out to determine what role individual phosphorylations play in the collective control of S6K1 by the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-S6K1 antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 476–487 (476RQPNSGPYKKQA487), which are close to the carboxyl terminus of rat S6K1 and are used for immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous S6K1, anti-S6K1 antiserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-230). Anti-rpS6 (Ser(P)-240/Ser(P)-244) and anti-S6K1 (Thr-421(P)/Ser(P)-424) were from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-S6K1 (Thr(P)-229) and anti-S6K1 (Ser(P)-371) were from BIOSOURCE, anti-S6K1 (Ser(P)-411) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-S6K1 (Thr(P)-389) was from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. Anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibodies were purified from mouse ascites. Insulin and rapamycin were purchased from Sigma. LY294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmid Constructs—Amino-terminally HA-tagged, wild type rat S6K1, E389D3E-S6K1, D4E-S6K1, ΔCT-S6K1, and ΔNTΔCT-S6K1 cloned into pRK7 were generously provided by John Blenis (Harvard University) and Jim Jefferson (Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine). Human Tsc1 and Tsc2 cloned into pEFP2 were provided by Jeff DeClue (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Amino-terminally FLAG-tagged Tsc1 was constructed by site directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using pEFP2-Tsc1 as a template. Sense and antisense primers were designed to incorporate the FLAG epitope as a loop structure, flanked on either side by sequence that annealed to the template. FLAG-tagged Tsc2 was constructed similarly using pEFP2-Tsc2 as a template. Amino-terminally Myc-tagged human Rheb was supplied by Paul Worley (Johns Hopkins University). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from Tsc1- and Tsc2-null embryos and wild type MEFs were generously provided by David Kwiatkowski (Harvard University). MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%, v/v) and penicillin, streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin. For experiments requiring insulin stimulation, MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing low serum (0.5% fetal calf serum, v/v) overnight and stimulated with insulin as indicated the following morning. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%, v/v) and penicillin, streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin. Cells were transfected by lipofection using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cell Extraction and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were extracted in lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3% CHAPS (v/v), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 500 μm phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 20 min and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Lysates were either mixed 3:1 with 4× sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min or subjected to immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, lysates normalized for cell protein were incubated with 4–8 μg of anti-S6K1 antibody or with 2 μl of 12CA5 ascites and mixed end-over-end for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads were added for an additional hour, and immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and heated for 5 min to 100 °C in 1× sample buffer.

In brief, immunopurified endogenous or exogenous S6K1 was incubated with a synthetic peptide (AKRRRLSSLRA), and 32P incorporation into the peptide substrate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In Drosophila, loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2 leads to increased activity of dS6K and, as a result, a significant increase in the size of affected cells. To establish whether or not Tsc1 and Tsc2 regulation of S6K1 is conserved in mammalian cells, we assayed the kinase activity of S6K1 in vitro in MEFs isolated from Tsc1- or Tsc2-null mice or their wild type counterparts. Whereas treatment of wild type MEFs with insulin induced a marked increase in S6K1 activity, the basal activity of S6K1 isolated from Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs was high and was not increased further by insulin (Fig. 1B). In fact, basal S6K1 activity in the knock-out MEFs was equivalent to the insulin-stimulated activity measured in wild type MEFs, suggesting that deletion of either Tsc1 or Tsc2 renders S6K1 constitutively activated. Nevertheless, the high basal activity of S6K1 in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs remained sensitive to rapamycin (40 nm) and to LY294002 (20 μm), which inhibits mTOR and PI3K equally efficiently at this concentration (35Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In whole cell extracts from Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs, basal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), an endogenous S6K1 substrate, was equivalent to the insulin-stimulated levels observed in wild type MEFs (Fig. 1C, cf. lane 4 versus lanes 7 and 13). These data are consistent with genetic epistasis analyses conducted in Drosophila, indicating that mTOR lies downstream of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex in the regulation of S6K1 (6Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T. Cell. 2001; 105: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 7Gao X. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Whereas overexpression of Tsc1-Tsc2 reduces H-motif phosphorylation of coexpressed S6K1 (29Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar), Tsc2-null cells display augmented H-motif phosphorylation of S6K1 relative to wild type cells (36Jaeschke A. Hartkamp J. Saitoh M. Roworth W. Nobukuni T. Hodges A. Sampson J. Thomas G. Lamb R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It remains to be resolved, however, whether T-loop phosphorylation (Thr-229) or phosphorylation of other regulatory sites in the AID is influenced by the loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2. To address this question, S6K1 was immunoprecipitated from Tsc1- or Tsc2-null MEFs as well as from wild type MEFs under different treatment conditions. The phosphorylation status of S6K1 was assessed using antiphosphopeptide antibodies specific for the phosphorylation sites Thr-229, Ser-371, Thr-389, Ser-411, and Thr-421/Ser-424 (see Fig. 1A). In all cell types, the pattern of basal and insulin-stimulated S6K1 activity (Fig. 1B) tightly correlated with H-motif phosphorylation at Thr-389 (Fig. 2). Importantly, whereas phosphorylation of Thr-389 in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs was inhibited by rapamycin, phosphorylation of this site was strongly resistant to inhibition by wortmannin. In contrast, S6K1 prepared from wild type MEFs displayed a reduction in H-motif phosphorylation when treated with either rapamycin or wortmannin. The wortmannin resistance of H-motif phosphorylation in MEFs devoid of Tsc1 or Tsc2 suggests that PI3K regulates S6K1 upstream of Tsc1-Tsc2 and that the effect of the loss of Tsc1-Tsc2 is dominant in the stimulation of S6K1 by PI3K. T-loop phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr-229 under these conditions mirrors phosphorylation of the H-motif in that this phosphorylation was largely rapamycin-sensitive and wortmannin-resistant in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null cells. A similar correlation was observed for phosphorylation of the AID sites Ser-411 and Thr-421/Ser-424. Unlike the regulation of the sites described above, the phosphorylation of Ser-371 was neither robustly stimulated by insulin nor inhibited by rapamycin or wortmannin. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-371 is unregulated under these conditions and appears to some extent constitutive. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of rpS6 (Fig. 2B) indicates that the cumulative effect of this multisite regulation was constitutive activation of S6K1 when Tsc1 or Tsc2 is functionally lost. Clearly, deletion of the genes encoding Tsc1 or Tsc2 induces maximal phosphorylation of S6K1 at several regulatory sites, including the T-loop and H-motif sites. Consequently, in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null cells S6K1 is constitutively activated and refractory to conditions that would otherwise be inactivating, e.g. serum-deprivation. Overexpression of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex in cells has the converse effect, i.e. S6K1 inhibition (28Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 29Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (see below). We therefore sought to address whether or not this inhibition is associated with dephosphorylation of the same subset of Tsc1-Tsc2-regulated sites defined by the aforementioned studies. HEK293T cells exhibit high basal S6K1 activity (data not shown) and were therefore chosen for the subsequent experiments. Cells were transfected with increasing amounts of vectors expressing FLAG-tagged Tsc1 and FLAG-tagged Tsc2 together with HA-tagged S6K1, and S6K1 kinase activity was assayed in vitro at two different ectopic S6K1 gene dosages. Expression of Tsc1-Tsc2 led to a dosage-dependent reduction in cotransfected S6K1 activity (Fig. 3A). This effect was irrespective of the level of ectopically expressed S6K1 used in these experiments. Overexpression of Tsc1-Tsc2 reduced H-motif phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), paralleling the decrease in S6K1 kinase activity. In contrast, little change in the phosphorylation of the AID sites, Thr-421/Ser-424, was observed upon Tsc1-Tsc2 expression. This was somewhat unexpected, given the robust stimulation of Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation observed in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the phosphorylation of S6K1 at Ser-371 also was not significantly altered upon Tsc1-Tsc2 overexpression, which is consistent with this site remaining relatively unregulated by the Tsc1–2 complex. These data suggest that overexpression of Tsc1-Tsc2 inhibits S6K1 primarily through regulation of the H-motif and, potentially, T-loop phosphorylation, with a minimal effect on AID phosphorylation. We reasoned that the S6K1 mutations that artificially preserve or mimic H-motif phosphorylation should render the activity of the corresponding variant resistant to inhibition in cells overexpressing of Tsc1-Tsc2. Unfortunately, any modification of the T-loop site in S6K1, whether it be alanine or glutamate substitution, abolishes kinase activity (13Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.-W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C.

Therefore, the necessity and sufficiency of regulation of the T-loop site could not be directly tested in such an assay. A series of HA-tagged truncation and phosphomimic S6K1 mutants were expressed in the presence or absence of FLAG-tagged Tsc1 and FLAG-tagged Tsc2, and the kinase activity of each mutant was assayed in vitro. Because the specific activities of each S6K1 construct differ as a result of each unique mutation, the activity measurements for each construct assayed in the absence of Tsc1-Tsc2 was assigned a value of 100% to allow comparison between constructs (Fig. 4A). The unadjusted kinase activity measurements are presented for reference in Fig. 4B, as is the rel"

These pathways appear to play a critical role in endothelial cell migration, because selective inhibition of either ERK or PI3-K/Akt signaling almost completely prevented endothelial cell migration. Recently, we demonstrated that a truncated kringle domain of human apolipoprotein(a), termed rhLK68, inhibits endothelial cell migration in vitro. However, its mechanism of action was not well defined. In this study, we determined the effects of rhLK68 on ERK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways to explore the molecular mechanism of rhLK68-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell migration. Treatment with rhLK68 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation but did not influence Akt activation. Interestingly, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatase, sodium orthovanadate, dose-dependently reversed both rhLK68-induced dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and decreased migration of endothelial cells, whereas rhLK68 showed no significant effects on MEKs phosphorylation.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. Without blood vessels, tumors are unable to grow beyond a critical size (2–3 mm3) or metastasize to another organ (1Folkman J. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In view of this essential requirement, inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis has become one of the most promising pharmacological targets in cancer treatment, and numerous angiogenesis inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Angiogenesis is tightly controlled by a balance between proangiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; apo(a), apolipoprotein(a); KIV, plasminogen kringle 4-like repeats of apo(a); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; OV, sodium orthovanadate. 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; apo(a), apolipoprotein(a); KIV, plasminogen kringle 4-like repeats of apo(a); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; OV, sodium orthovanadate. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and anti-angiogenic factors, such as angiostatin, endostatin, and thrombospondin-1 (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar). Perturbations in this balance can trigger angiogenic cellular signals, thereby leading to inappropriate angiogenesis. The kringle domain is a protein structure comprising ∼80 amino acids with conserved triple disulfide bonds that appears to function as an independent folding unit (3Patthy L. Trexler M. Vali Z. Banyai L. Varadi A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 171: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Kringle domains are found in many proteins with a surprisingly diverse array of functions such as growth factors, proteases, or coagulation factors (hepatocyte growth factor, plasminogen, prothrombin, and urokinase, etc.). They are thought to play an important role in protein-protein interactions that provide specificity to and regulation of their parent proteins. Moreover, many kringle domains have been identified as inhibitors of angiogenesis (4Cao Y. Cao R. Veitonmaki N. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Canc. Agents. 2002; 2: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, kringles have been suggested to constitute the first example of a conserved architecture that specifically inhibits blood vessel growth. Of the kringle-containing proteins, apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) contains the largest numbers of kringle domains, with as many as ∼52 kringles (5Lackner C. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It consists of tandemly repeated kringle domains that closely resemble plasminogen kringle 4 (KIV), followed by sequences that are homologous to the kringle 5 (termed KV) and protease domains of plasminogen (6McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The KIV domains of apo(a) can be classified into 10 types (designated types KIV-1 to KIV-10), based on amino acid sequence (7Guevara Jr., J. Knapp R.D. Honda S. Northup S.R. Morrisett J.D. Proteins. 1992; 12: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the physiological and biochemical roles of apo(a) kringle domains remain to be elucidated, there exists some evidence suggesting that they can inhibit angiogenesis in vitro (8Schulter V. Koolwijk P. Peters E. Frank S. Hrzenjak A. Graier W.F. van Hinsbergh V.W. Kostner G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and suppress tumor growth in vivo (9Trieu V.N. Uckun F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that a recombinant peptide comprising the apo(a) kringle domains (rhLK68) that contains KIV-9, KIV-10, and KV inhibits bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell mitogenesis and migration in vitro and suppresses the growth of human lung and colon tumors in nude mice (10Kim J.S. Chang J.H. Yu H.K. Ahn J.H. Yum J.S. Lee S.K. Jung K.H. Park D.H. Yoon Y. Byun S.M. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29000-29008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, its mechanism of action was not clearly elucidated. This study was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of rhLK68-mediated angiogenesis inhibition. We examined the effects of rhLK68 on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signaling pathway(s), because of the critical role these cascades play in angiogenesis. We demonstrate here that rhLK68 inhibits the activation of ERK1/2, but not PI3-K/Akt, induced by bFGF, VEGF, and HGF. In addition, we present data suggesting that protein-tyrosine phosphatases may play an important role in the inhibition of ERK signaling by rhLK68. Preparation of Recombinant Human LK68 —Recombinant human LK68 (rhLK68), which comprises cryptic kringle fragments of apo(a) containing KIV-9, KIV-10, and KV, was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (10Kim J.S. Chang J.H. Yu H.K. Ahn J.H. Yum J.S. Lee S.K. Jung K.H. Park D.H. Yoon Y. Byun S.M. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29000-29008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, rhLK68 expressed as an inclusion body was collected, refolded in vitro, and purified using lysine-Sepharose column chromatography. The bacterial endotoxin level was determined with the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay kit (Chromogenix AB, Mölndal, Sweden), and the rhLK68 preparation used in this study contained bacterial endotoxin at less than 0.4 ng/mg protein. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human bFGF, produced from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Recombinant human VEGF165 and HGF, both of which were produced from Spodoptera frugiperda, were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Sodium orthovanadate (OV) was purchased from Sigma. U0126, LY294002, rabbit antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2, and phospho-mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). Rabbit antibodies against phospho-Akt and Akt were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-actin was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). HUVECs within passages 3–6 were used for all experiments. HUVECs were maintained in 1.5% gelatinized 24-well plates in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (Clonetics). For studies on the cell migration and cell signaling stimulated by angiogenic factors, endothelial cell basal medium-2 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum was used. Wound Migration Assay—The effect of rhLK68 on HUVEC migration stimulated by angiogenic factors including bFGF, VEGF, and HGF was assayed in a monolayer denudation assay as previously described (10Kim J.S. Chang J.H. Yu H.K. Ahn J.H. Yum J.S. Lee S.K. Jung K.H. Park D.H. Yoon Y. Byun S.M. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29000-29008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVECs were wounded by scraping, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove cellular debris, and incubated in endothelial cell basal medium-2 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, following which rhLK68 proteins (1 or 3 μm) were added. In some experiments, U0126 (1 μm), LY294002 (1 μm), or OV was also added as indicated. After 30 min, growth factors such as bFGF (3 ng/ml), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or HGF (10 ng/ml) were added to the monolayer and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 8 h. The control cultures were incubated in endothelial cell basal medium-2 plus 1% fetal bovine serum without growth factors. The cells that migrated into the denuded area were photographed with an Olympus C-3030 digital camera, and their numbers were quantified. Western Blot Analysis of Cell Signaling Molecules in HUVECs—The effects of rhLK68 on activation of ERK or Akt were analyzed by Western blot analysis of endothelial cell extracts with antibodies to their active and phosphorylated forms. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium-2 until confluency, washed, and grown in endothelial cell basal medium-2 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh low serum medium with or without rhLK68 (1 or 3 μm). Occasionally, U0126, LY294002, or sodium orthovanadate was added. After a 30-min incubation, bFGF (3 ng/ml), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or HGF (10 ng/ml) was added and incubated for a further 10 or 20 min to determine the level of phospho-MEK1/2 or phospho-Akt, respectively. The level of phospho-ERKs was determined after incubation for 15 min with VEGF or for 30 min with bFGF or HGF. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were quantified for protein concentration and separated on 4–20% precast SDS-PAGE gels. Control and rhLK68-treated lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-phospho-MEK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK, or anti-phospho-Akt. Equal protein loading was verified using anti-actin, anti-ERK1/2, or anti-Akt antibodies. Detection of immunoreactive bands was carried out using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HUVECs (50,000 cell/cm2 and 5,000 cell/cm2) were cultured on glass coverslips in endothelial cell growth medium-2 to obtain confluent and subconfluent cultures at the time of bFGF stimulation, respectively. After serum starvation, the HUVECs were treated with either 1 μm U0126 or 1 μm rhLK68 in the presence or absence of OV (10 μm) for 30 min. The cells were then treated with 3 ng/ml bFGF for 30 min. For immunostaining, the cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 10 min, and permeabilized by treatment with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100. The cells were then treated with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit antibody against phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology) in blocking buffer. The unbound proteins were removed by washing, and the cells were subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for 1 h. The coverslips were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and examined using a fluorescence microscope (Model Axiophot-2; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). RhLK68 Inhibits HUVEC Migration Stimulated by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF—To examine the effects of rhLK68 on HUVEC migration stimulated by angiogenic factors such as bFGF, VEGF, or HGF, an in vitro wound migration assay was employed as described above. HUVECs migrated significantly into the wound area in response to bFGF, VEGF, and HGF in a dose-dependent manner. When determined with the same concentration of proteins (10 ng/ml), HGF produced the highest level of HUVEC migration, followed by bFGF and VEGF (data not shown). Because bFGF induced similar level of HUVEC migration at concentrations of either 3 or 10 ng/ml, we used 3 ng/ml bFGF in the subsequent experiments. Exposure to rhLK68 inhibited the migration stimulated by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The effects of a specific inhibitor of MEKs, U0126, and a specific PI3-K inhibitor, LY294002, on the migration of endothelial cells were also determined. As shown in Fig. 1, either U0126 or LY294002 almost completely blocked bFGF-, VEGF-, and HGF-induced migration of HUVECs. These results suggest that rhLK68 is an inhibitor of endothelial cell migration stimulated by multiple angiogenic factors and that both ERK and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways may play an important role in the migration of endothelial cells. RhLK68 Inhibits bFGF-, VEGF-, or HGF-stimulated Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but Not Akt, in HUVECs—The possible involvement of ERK1/2 or Akt signaling pathways in endothelial cell migration prompted us to examine the effects of rhLK68 on the activation state of ERK1/2 and Akt. The angiogenic factors bFGF, VEGF, and HGF induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. In cells treated with bFGF or HGF, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was evident as early as 5 min, reached a maximum value at 15–20 min, and decreased thereafter. On the contrary, VEGF appeared to induce ERK activation more rapidly than bFGF or HGF, because phosphorylation of ERK1/2 increased to a peak level within 10 min of VEGF stimulation (data not shown). Interestingly, preincubation of either 1 or 3 μm rhLK68 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 stimulated by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF, and this inhibition was dose-dependent (Fig. 2). In addition to the ERK signaling pathway, Akt signaling was also induced by treatment with bFGF, VEGF, or HGF. All of these angiogenic factors stimulated Akt phosphorylation maximally at 20 min after treatment. In contrast to the inhibition of ERK activation by rhLK68, however, rhLK68 did not influence Akt phosphorylation stimulated by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF (Fig. 3). To determine whether there was any cross-talk between these two signaling pathways, the activities of either MEK1/2 or PI3-K were selectively inhibited using U0126 or LY294002, respectively, and the effect on ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation was investigated. In cells activated by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF, U0126 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERKs but not Akt, whereas LY194002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation but did not influence ERKs (Figs. 2 and 3), indicating that the ERK and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways act independently and without any significant cross-talk. RhLK68-mediated dephosphorylation of ERKs appears to be specific to endothelial cells, because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of ERKs in THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cells was not affected by this peptide (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that rhLK68 may exert its function by specifically interfering with the activation of ERKs, but not Akt, in endothelial cells. Moreover, they suggest that rhLK68 may target common ERK signaling pathways that are induced by multiple angiogenic factors.Fig. 3Effect of rhLK68 on Akt phosphorylation. HUVECs were preincubated with rhLK68 (1 or 3 μm), U0126, or LY294002 for 30 min as indicated. The cells were stimulated for 20 min with bFGF (A, 3 ng/ml), VEGF (B, 10 ng/ml), or HGF (C, 10 ng/ml) and lysed, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation of Akt was determined by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Akt (upper panels) or anti-Akt (lower panels). The results shown are representative of three separate and independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein-tyrosine Phosphatases May Play an Important Role in rhLK68-mediated Inhibition of ERK Phosphorylation and Endothelial Cell Migration—Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation can be achieved either through the down-regulation of MEKs, which are responsible for the addition of phosphates to ERKs, or by the up-regulation of protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate activated ERKs. To explore the molecular mechanism involved in rhLK68-induced ERK dephosphorylation, we examined the effects of rhLK68 on MEK activation. Although bFGF, VEGF, and HGF induced the phosphorylation of MEKs, this signaling event was not affected by rhLK68 treatment (Fig. 4), thus indicating that dephosphorylation of ERKs by rhLK68 may be mediated by a protein phosphatase-dependent mechanism. Because ERK1/2 requires the MEK1/2-mediated dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the TEY motif of the activation loop (11Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), the inactivation of fully phosphorylated ERK1/2 requires the activities of serine/threonine and/or protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In contrast, full activation of Akt requires the phosphorylation of both the Thr-308 and Ser-473 residues; thus only serine/threonine phosphatase activities are required for Akt dephosphorylation. Taken together with the finding that rhLK68 inactivates ERK1/2 but not Akt, we hypothesized that protein-tyrosine phosphatases may be involved in ERK1/2-specific dephosphorylation by rhLK68. To examine this hypothesis, HUVECs were preincubated with a general protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, OV, and stimulated with bFGF, VEGF, or HGF in the presence of either 1 or 3 μm rhLK68. OV treatment recovered rhLK68-induced ERK dephosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). In cells stimulated with bFGF, VEGF, or HGF, treatment with 10 nm OV had little effect on rhLK68-induced ERK dephosphorylation. However, a higher concentration of OV (10 μm) resulted in a level of ERK phosphorylation that was nearly identical to cells stimulated by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF either in the presence or absence of rhLK68. These results indicate that inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases by treatment with 10 μm OV can completely compensate for rhLK68-induced dephosphorylation. Given that rhLK68 inhibits endothelial cell migration by interfering with the phosphorylation of ERKs, we performed a wound migration assay to examine whether OV can also reverse the rhLK68-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell migration. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment with increasing concentrations of OV (0.01–10 μm) restored the rhLK68-mediated inhibition of HUVEC migration in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was more pronounced in cells treated with 1 μm rhLK68 than that in cells treated with 3 μm, reflecting differences in the migration inhibitory activities of 1 and 3 μm rhLK68. Collectively, these results indicate that rhLK68 inhibits the phosphorylation of ERKs and subsequent endothelial cell migration stimulated by multiple angiogenic factors, possibly via a protein-tyrosine phosphatase-dependent mechanism.Fig. 5Inhibition of rhLK68-mediated ERK dephosphorylation by OV. HUVECs were preincubated in the presence or absence of either rhLK68 (1 or 3 μm) or OV for 30 min as indicated. The cells were stimulated with bFGF (A, 3 ng/ml), VEGF (B, 10 ng/ml), or HGF (C, 10 ng/ml) and lysed, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation of ERKs was determined by Western blotting using anti-phospho-ERK (upper panels) or anti-ERK (lower panels). Relative amounts of phospho-ERKs normalized to total ERKs are indicated between the upper and lower panels. The level of ERKs in unstimulated cells was considered as 1.0. The results shown are representative of three separate and independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Effects of OV on the rhLK68-mediated inhibition of HUVEC migration. Confluent HUVECs were scraped and preincubated with either 1 or 3 μm rhLK68 in the presence of increasing concentrations of OV for 30 min as indicated. Migration of HUVECs was stimulated by treatment with angiogenic factors such as bFGF (A, 3 ng/ml), VEGF (B, 10 ng/ml), or HGF (C, 10 ng/ml) and monitored for 8 h, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are expressed as percentages of the basal response.

Moreover, although OV restored completely the rhLK68-mediated dephosphorylation of ERKs, it could not compensate the decreased cell migration completely (Figs. 5 and 6). To explain this lack of correlation between ERK activity and the rate of migration, we raised a hypothesis that those treatments may affect differentially the phosphorylation of ERKs between migrating and nonmigrating cells. To address this possibility, immunostaining for phospho-ERK was performed using confluent or sparse cells, representing two distinct cell populations in the wound migration assay system employed in the present study: one contact-inhibited cells and one migrating cells, respectively. When compared with saline-treated cells (Fig. 7A), bFGF significantly induced the phosphorylation of ERKs in both confluent and sparse cells (Fig. 7B). However, the ERK phosphorylation was less apparent in confluent cells in comparison with that found in sparse cells. Similarly, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by cell-cell contact was also reported by Lampugnani et al. (12Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Corada M. Takahashi T. Balconi G. Breviario F. Orsenigo F. Cattelino A. Kemler R. Daniel T.O. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) in VEGF-treated HUVECs. U0126 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERKs induced by bFGF in both cell populations (Fig. 7C). On the other hand, although rhLK68 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERKs in confluent cells, its inhibitory effects were significantly higher in sparse cells (Fig. 7D). OV restored the rhLK68-mediated ERK dephosphorylation in both cell populations (Fig. 7E). Similar results were also observed in VEGF- or HGF-treated cells (data not shown). These results were consistent with the results obtained from Western blot analysis and indicate that rhLK68 may inhibit the phosphorylation of ERKs induced by angiogenic factors preferentially in migrating cells than in contact-inhibited cells. During angiogenesis, quiescent endothelial cells become activated by pro-angiogenic factors and are induced to migrate, proliferate, and differentiate to form a new lumen-containing vessel. Because the migration of endothelial cells is a critical step in angiogenesis, the inhibition of endothelial cell motility would be expected to affect the angiogenic process. Although a number of angiogenesis inhibitors have been reported to inhibit endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis, and consequently the growth of angiogenesis-dependent malignancies, their mechanism of action is not well defined. In the migration of endothelial cells, the ERK (13Pintucci G. Steinberg B.M. Seghezzi G. Yun J. Apazidis A. Baumann F.G. Grossi E.A. Colvin S.B. Mignatti P. Galloway A.C.

Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) signaling pathways have been reported to play critical roles. In this study we have consistently shown that selective inhibition of either ERK or PI3-K/Akt signaling, using U0126 or LY294002, almost completely prevented endothelial cell migration. Furthermore, although cross-talk between these adjacent signaling pathways has been reported previously (17Mograbi B. Bocciardi R. Bourget I. Busca R. Rochet N. Farahi-Far D. Juhel T. Rossi B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45307-45319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), here activation of ERK and PI3-K/Akt signaling induced by bFGF, VEGF, or HGF appeared to occur without any cross-talk, because PI3-K inhibitors had no effect on ERK but abolished Akt phosphorylation, whereas MEK inhibitors significantly inhibited ERK activation without affecting Akt phosphorylation. Of these two signaling pathways, rhLK68 selectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by bFGF, VEGF or HGF, without influencing the phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors such as the 16-kDa fragment of prolactin (18D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), platelet factor 4 (19Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Lozano R.M. Cuevas P. Canron X. Redondo-Horcajo M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Bikfalvi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and plasminogen kringle 5 (20Gao G. Li Y. Gee S. Dudley A. Fant J. Crosson C. Ma J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9492-9497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have also been reported to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERKs and endothelial cell migration. Therefore, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation appears to be an important mechanism of action employed by angiogenesis inhibitors. Despite the importance of ERK and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways, inhibition of ERK or Akt signaling does not always seem to be required to inhibit endothelial cell migration. Angiostatin, for instance, has been reported to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERKs (21Redlitz A. Daum G. Sage E.H. J. Vasc. Res. 1999; 36: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, Eriksson et al. (22Eriksson K. Magnusson P. Dixelius J. Claesson-Welsh L. Cross M.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported contradictory results demonstrating that angiostatin inhibits endothelial cell migration without affecting intracellular signaling including the ERK and Akt pathways. Recently, Wajih and Sane et al. (23Wajih N. Sane D.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) demonstrated that angiostatin selectively inhibits HGF-induced phosphorylation of both ERKs and Akt by interfering with the binding of HGF to their receptor, c-Met, but does not affect bFGF- or VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERKs and Akt. These findings suggest that, in addition to ERK and PI3-K/Akt signaling, additional signaling cascades are likely to be involved in endothelial cell migration. Because of the critical importance of ERK1/2 in cellular signaling, the activities of ERKs must be tightly regulated, and this may be achieved by the balanced activities of MEKs and/or various types of ERK-specific protein phosphatases. Although the mechanisms of ERK activation have been well characterized, much less is known about its subsequent inactivation. Given that rhLK68 inhibits endothelial cell migration stimulated by multiple angiogenic factors and does not affect the activation of MEKs, it appears unlikely that rhLK68 affects events upstream of ERK activation, such as the binding of angiogenic factors to their receptors, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, and subsequent signaling cascades leading to activation of MEKs. In contrast to ERK activation, which can be accomplished solely by MEKs, the presence of multiple protein phosphatases involved in ERK inactivation indicates that these enzymes may play an important role in the regulation of ERK activity. Considering that dephosphorylation of either the phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine residue is sufficient for its total enzymatic inactivation (24Posada J. Cooper J.A. Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), ERK1/2 deactivation could occur through the action of all classes of protein phosphatases including serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A (25Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Zhou B. Wang Z.X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-SL (27Tarrega C. Blanco-Aparicio C. Munoz J.J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2629-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and HePTP (28Pettiford S.M. Herbst R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 858-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or through the dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (29Keyse S.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Of these options, protein-tyrosine phosphatases seems to play a significant role in rhLK68-induced ERK dephosphorylation and decreased migration of endothelial cells, because these events are restored by treatment with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, in a dose-dependent manner. This notion is further supported by the findings that full inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatase using FK506 produces only a partial recovery of rhLK68-mediated inhibition of HUVEC migration (data not shown). Unfortunately, however, the identity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that are specifically responsible for the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and how they exert their functions in response to rhLK68 still remain to be elucidated. Although the data presented in the present study clearly have demonstrated the tyrosine phosphatase-dependent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and associated endothelial cell migration by rhLK68, there exists some discrepancy between the extent of ERK activation and the rate of endothelial cell migration. For instance, even when the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by rhLK68 is significantly lower than that provoked by U0126, the inhibition of migration is similar following the two treatments. Furthermore, OV (10 μm) completely restores ERK phosphorylation, whereas endothelial cell migration is still lower than that observed in untreated cells. The reason for the discrepancy between ERKs activity and rate of migration is not clear but can be explained in part by the ability of rhLK68 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation preferentially in the migrating cells rather than in contact-inhibited cells, unlike U0126 or OV, which exhibits their effects similarly in both cell populations. It is also possible that rhLK68 may affect other component(s) of the complex signaling pathways involved in endothelial cell migration and/or OV may rescue the effect on ERK phosphorylation but not those on other possible target(s) of rhLK68. Other angiogenesis inhibitors, such as endostatin, have been reported to inhibit endothelial cell migration by a tyrosine phosphatase-dependent mechanism, as evidenced by the fact that OV treatment reversed the decreased migration and endostatin-mediated disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by inhibiting Src activation (30Wickstrom S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5580-5589PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, endostatin has been reported to activate the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, and this, in turn, perturbs the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase that is essential for endothelial cell migration and survival (31Urbich C. Reissner A. Chavakis E. Dernbach E. Haendeler J. Fleming I. Zeiher A.M. Kaszkin M. Dimmeler S. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 706-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity has been reported to stimulate the motility of endothelial cells and nonmetastatic tumor cells (32Jackson J. Meisinger J. Patel S. Lim Z.C. Vellody K. Metz R. Young M.R. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 199-209PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gabel S. Benefield J. Meisinger J. Petruzzelli G.J. Young M. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1999; 121: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, DEP1/CD148, a membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase that is up-regulated by confluence and is located at intercellular junctions, has been reported to play a crucial role in developmental vascular organization through the regulation of endothelial proliferation and endothelium-pericyte interactions (34Takahashi T. Takahashi K. St John P.L. Fleming P.A. Tomemori T. Watanabe T. Abrahamson D.R. Drake C.J. Shirasawa T. Daniel T.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1817-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It also contributes to vascular endothelial cadherin-induced inhibition of VEGF receptor-2 activation (12Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Corada M. Takahashi T. Balconi G. Breviario F. Orsenigo F. Cattelino A. Kemler R. Daniel T.O. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and can dephosphorylate HGF receptor c-Met (35Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that this phosphatase has a general role in regulating signaling from growth factor receptors. Collectively, these results suggest that protein phosphatases may play an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis. Therefore, further elucidation of complete phosphatase regulatory networks and their specific substrates may provide more insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of angiogenesis inhibitors, including rhLK68, and/or provide useful molecular target(s) for the rational design of anti-angiogenic therapy. RhLK68 appears to block a common angiogenic signaling pathway triggered by various angiogenic factors including bFGF, VEGF, and HGF. This is an important and clinically beneficial aspect in blocking tumor angiogenesis. Because cancer masses consist of heterogeneous populations of tumor cells that constantly undergo genetic mutations, they are very likely to switch their angiogenic factors. Indeed, an early tumor may secrete one or two angiogenic factors, whereas a large progressive tumor can produce many angiogenic factors (36Folkman J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 113-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis inhibitors that target only one particular angiogenic factor may therefore evoke drug resistance problems. Therefore, broad spectrum inhibitors that block common angiogenic pathways could bypass drug resistance and may be therapeutically effective against multiple cancer types. In conclusion, we demonstrate in the present study that rhLK68 is a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell migration stimulated by multiple angiogenic factors and that this inhibition may be mediated through the perturbation of ERK1/2 signaling via a protein-tyrosine phosphatase-dependent pathway."

Although the Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC is Ca2+-independent, whereas the mammalian enzyme requires Ca2+ for activity, both enzymes can be activated by nonsubstrate interfaces (4Zhou C. Wu Y.

For the soluble cIP reaction, kcat was increased, and Km decreased in the presence of PC interfaces (4Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F.

That work suggested that PC binds to an activator site on the bacterial enzyme that is distinct from the enzyme active site, a model confirmed recently using artificial substrates (9Birrell G.B.

However, the details of the conformational change upon PC binding that leads to improved enzyme efficiency are not known. Growing evidence suggests that a region at the top of the barrel rim containing two tryptophans exposed to solvent (Trp-47 in helix B and Trp-242 in the flexible loop 232-244) is crucial for this protein to bind to PC interfaces and for kinetic activation of the enzyme (10Feng J.

Interfacial binding could enhance aggregation of the protein as well as alter the conformation of an individual protein molecule to generate a more active state. Recent work by Jain and co-workers (13Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Apitz-Castro R.J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2080-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggests that aggregation of the protein does occur with binding of an activator such as diC7PC. Micellar PC has been shown to increase kcat for PLCδ1 cleavage of cIP; the pleckstrin homology domain was critical for that kinetic activation (7Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11223-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the interplay of the pleckstrin homology domain with the catalytic domain in PLCδ1 is unknown, and hydrophobic groups poised at the rim of PLCδ1 could mediate similar changes for interfacial activation of that enzyme as well. Chemical cross-linking of proteins can be used to detect their aggregation state in the absence and presence of lipid surfaces (14Stieglitz K. Seaton B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol.

In this study, we used 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), a reagent that forms an amide bond between an amino and a carboxyl group of side chains that are spatially close, to probe for the aggregation and/or conformational changes of PI-PLC when bound to lipid interfaces. The sequence of the B. thuringiensis enzyme has 23 lysine, 20 glutamate, and 18 aspartate residues, most of which are on the surface of the protein. Previous attempts to cross-link the bacterial PI-PLC using dimethyl suberimidate dihydrochloride, a reagent that targets surface amino groups, in the absence or presence of Triton X-100, diC7PC, or cIP and diC7PC yielded only monomers. 2C. Zhou and M. F. Roberts, unpublished results. Therefore, it was thought that amide formation might be more effective at trapping PI-PLC aggregates. The relatively high fraction of acidic and basic residues on the surface of B. thuringiensis PI-PLC should enhance the probability of forming intermolecular cross-linked subunits. However, in the crystal structure of the related Bacillus cereus enzyme (1Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), there are nine lysine-acidic amino acid pairs within 4 Å that could be intramolecularly cross-linked by EDC as well (Fig. 1, Table I). None of these pairs are very close to the key tryptophan residues in the rim of the (βα)8-barrel that are critical for kinetic activation by PC interfaces (10Feng J. Webhi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol.

Cross-linking in the presence of diC7PC micelles yielded at most 19% dimer and larger aggregates at pH 7. An intramolecularly cross-linked species (typically 40-50% of the total intensity on SDS-PAGE) was also detected as a major product of chemical cross-linking. More interestingly, a kinetic activation of PI cleavage was observed if the cross-linking occurred in the presence of diC7PC micelles. This kinetic activation does not correlate with aggregation of the protein but rather correlates with trapping the enzyme in a conformation where it has a higher affinity for individual diC7PC molecules. Cross-linking previously characterized rim tryptophan mutants of PI-PLC (W47A and W242A) also shows that each of these tryptophan residues appears to be part of a binding site for a PC molecule. This interaction is used to discuss how PC binding activates PI-PLC. Chemicals—POPC, DOPMe, PI from bovine liver, and the short chain lipids diC6PC and diC7PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and used without further purification. diC6PMe was synthesized from diC6PC using Streptomyces sp. phospholipase D (see Ref. 16Yang H. Roberts M.F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for transphosphatidylation protocol). iPrOH and D2O were purchased from Sigma. EDC was purchased from Pierce. cIP was generated enzymatically from crude PI using PI-PLC as described previously (1Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were reagent grade. PI-PLC and Mutants—The recombinant B. thuringiensis PI-PLC (17Hondal R.J. Riddle S.R. Kravchuk A.V. Zhao Z. Liao H. Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6633-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and tryptophan mutants W47A and W242A (10Feng J. Webhi H.

The concentration of each protein was measured by absorbance at 280 nm (10Feng J. Webhi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and by Lowry (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Chemical Cross-linking of PI-PLC using EDC—Cross-linking of PIPLC in the presence of different interfaces with EDC as the cross-linking reagent used 100 μg/ml PI-PLC dissolved in 100 mm MES (pH adjusted to 5.0, 6.0, or 7.0). EDC (1 m in water) was added to a final concentration of 50 mm in the reaction mixture. As a control, PI-PLC was incubated with EDC (50 mm) in the absence of lipids. Cross-linking of PI-PLC was tested separately in the presence of micellar diC7PC (2 mm), monomeric diC6PC or diC6PMe (4 mm), or SUVs of POPC or DOPMe (2 mm). These mixtures were incubated for 2-3 h at room temperature. After this time, aliquots were removed for enzymatic assays, whereas the bulk of each reaction mixture was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C to remove excess EDC, lyophilized, rehydrated with 50 μl of water, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. An alternative to dialysis was concentration of the treated protein using a 10-kDa cut-off microconcentrator and washing the protein repeatedly with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Characterization of Cross-linked PI-PLC—The effect of cross-linking on secondary structure of PI-PLC was assessed by circular dichroism as described previously (10Feng J. Webhi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9374-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Separation of cross-linked dimer from intramolecularly cross-linked PI-PLC was attempted with gel filtration using a 10 × 110-mm column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Two-dimensional PAGE (20Deutscher M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 1-818Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Fichmann J. Estermeier R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 112: 1-8Google Scholar) was used to assess heterogeneity of cross-linked protein preparations. The isoelectric focusing dimension was done with the lyophilized sample rehydrated either with 190 μl of denaturant (9 m urea) along with 4% CHAPS, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Biolytes or with 190 μl of distilled water. Each sample was loaded onto the middle of a 11-cm immobilized pH gradient strip (pH gradient 3-10) that was then covered with 1 ml of mineral oil. The strip was placed in the isoelectric focusing cell and focused at 20 °C. The strip was then equilibrated with buffer containing 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol and then placed on a precast two-dimensional gel. The SDS-PAGE dimension was run essentially the same as for conventional one-dimensional gels. Turbidity Assay for PI Cleavage—DAG produced from PI cleavage is poorly soluble in a water plus 30% iPrOH cosolvent system previously used to monitor PI-PLC activity (22Wehbi H. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1613: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). When more than 15% DAG is generated, the DAG begins to form microemulsions and partially phase-separates. This dramatically increases the optical density of the solution, here measured at 460 nm. Although absolute specific activities cannot be obtained, this assay is quick and very useful for screening PI-PLC activity for changes induced by cross-linking. Assay conditions included 1.5 mm PI, 30% iPrOH, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.1 μg of PI-PLC. Typically 2-10 μl of the enzyme mixture from the cross-linking reaction was added to 1 ml of the assay mixture. The iPrOH cosolvent assay system solubilizes the small amount of added vesicles or micelles and dilutes any PC or PMe species present in the preincubation mixture to below 0.02 mm. This amount of diC7PC (or dC6PMe) has previously been shown to have no effect on PI cleavage by PI-PLC (8Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 31P NMR Assays—31P (202.3 MHz) NMR spectra were acquired for two different assays: (i) an activity assay monitoring PI cleavage (phosphotransferase reaction) and cIP hydrolysis (cyclic phosphodiesterase reaction) as described previously (4Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Wehbi H. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1613: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and (ii) a binding assay where the 31P line width of the ligand monitors PI-PLC interactions (5Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10089-10097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer was used for both types of experiments. Two different PI assay mixtures were used to monitor PI cleavage: (i) 4 mm PI, 30% iPrOH, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and (ii) 8 mm PI, 32 mm diC7PC, 0.05 m MES, pH 7.5. For cIP hydrolysis, 8 mm cIP was mixed with 5 mm diC7PC in the Tris buffer. Amounts of enzyme ranged from 0.1 to 10 μg, depending on the reaction monitored. The amount of phospholipids introduced (<20 μm) when adding the enzyme to each assay mix was well below the threshold needed to activate the enzyme in the case of the cosolvent system and minimal compared with the 32 mm diC7PC used in the second PI cleavage assay system. diC7PC was included in the reaction mixture with cIP, since this activator optimally enhances enzyme activity (4Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and since it would mask any effect of the small amount of residual PC from the cross-linking mixtures. Measurements of the line width of the diC7PC 31P resonance in the presence of PI-PLC were carried out with samples containing 3 mg/ml (0.085 mm) enzyme in 0.05 m HEPES with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7 (5Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10089-10097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). diC7PC was titrated into the enzyme solution in the NMR tube, and the line width was measured at 28 °C; the number of transients varied (from 300 to 3000), depending on the concentration of diC7PC. A detailed analysis extracting binding constants is problematic, given the probability that (i) the enzyme lowers the critical micellar concentration of the short-chain PC and/or (ii) the exchange rate can vary from an intermediate to fast regime, depending on the number of ligand sites on the enzyme and relative affinities (e.g. the PC could form different types of aggregates with the enzyme depending on the ratio of PC to PI-PLC, and the ligand could have different off rates). Nonetheless, the large increase in line width can be used to compare PI-PLC mutants or, in this case, cross-linked enzyme to see how bound PC dynamics are affected. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Micromass TOFSpec-2E using a sinapinic acid matrix in linear positive mode. Most protein samples analyzed by mass spectrometry were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, and then concentrated to 20-25 μm using Microcon microconcentrators (10-kDa mass cut-off). The protein samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using a Micromass TofSpec-2E mass spectrometer operating in positive mode and using a sinapinic acid matrix. Spectra were calibrated using standard solutions of cytochrome c (12,360 Da), trypsinogen (23,980 Da), and/or bovine serum albumin (66,430 Da). A few protein samples were dialyzed at a much more basic pH (9.0) to remove any tightly bound phospholipids, since at this pH there is little partitioning of PI-PLC to PC or PMe vesicles (12Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9374-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For this size protein, the resolution obtained by the particular MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer used was ±150 Da. Intrinsic Fluorescence—All fluorescence measurements, obtained with a SHIMADZU RF5000U spectrofluorimeter, were carried out at 25 °C with ∼2 μm protein in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA, using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and 5-nm excitation and emission slit widths (8Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Feng J. Webhi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The wavelength maximum for PI-PLC fluorescence, 337 nm, was unaltered for wild type and cross-linked proteins both in the absence and presence of ligands. There was no detectable light scattering for any of the protein samples with PC micelles added. Changes in the fluorescence intensity at 337 nm were expressed as (I - Io)/Io, where Io is the intensity of protein alone, and I is the intensity in the presence of an additive. Vesicle Binding Assay—Binding of PI-PLC before and after cross-linking to POPC and DOPMe SUVs was carried out using a centrifugation/filtration assay described previously for this system (12Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9374-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mm were used in the binding assay with 35 μg of PI-PLC in a total volume of 2 ml. EDC Cross-linking of PI-PLC: Intra- and Intermolecular Species—EDC leads to amide formation between nearby amino and carboxyl groups on the surface of proteins and can be used to detect oligomerization of a protein. PI-PLC alone in solution (no phospholipid interface) appears mostly as a monomer as judged by gel filtration with moderate salt in the buffer (5Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10089-10097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, EDC cross-linking of the protein at pH 7 trapped 15% dimers under these conditions. The major protein species (49%) generated by EDC cross-linking in the absence of any phospholipids was an intramolecularly cross-linked protein with greater mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3), reflecting its more compact nature as compared with uncross-linked, denatured PI-PLC. Similar anomalous migration has been seen with proteins linked by intramolecular disulfide binds (23Sahoo D. Weers P.M.M. Ryan R.O. Narayanaswami V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Mitchinson C. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cross-linked protein was run on two-dimensional PAGE to try to detect how many different species were formed. There was a spread in the pI values for the intramolecularly cross-linked and normally migrating PI-PLC monomers when the isoelectric focusing was done in the presence of urea (the pI values for the major spots were between 6.9 and 9.6), indicating heterogeneity in the cross-linking reaction (Fig. 3A). Since EDC has no binding specificity for its targets but will only covalently link any spatially close residues, and since there are so many surface acidic and basic residue pairs (Table I), it is not unreasonable that there was a range of pI species. For comparison, the predicted pI for denatured B. thuringiensis PI-PLC is 5.9; this was verified by two-dimensional PAGE of uncross-linked material (data not shown). If the cross-linked protein was run in the first dimension without urea, a way of assessing the overall surface charge of the protein, one major spot was observed at both monomer molecular masses, consistent with an apparent pI of 6.9 ± 0.1 (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the either the surface charge is similar for all cross-linked species or that the protein now forms aggregates and focuses on the nondenaturing gel as a unit.Fig. 3Two-dimensional PAGE for PI-PLC samples cross-linked in the absence of diC7PC and run with urea in the first dimension (A), the same cross-linked sample run without urea in the isolectric focusing dimension (B), and PI-PLC cross-linked in the presence of 10 mm diC7PC and run without urea in the first dimension (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cross-linking of PI-PLC in the presence of PC micelles (4 mm diC7PC; the critical micellar concentration of diC7PC is 1.5 mm (25Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1992; 153: 420-428Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) or vesicles (0.5 mm POPC SUVs) still produced the intramolecular cross-linked PI-PLC (∼40% of the total protein regardless of the pH of the cross-linking reaction); however, more protein aggregates were observed than in the EDC control (Table II). The pH of the mixture cross-linked had a significant effect on multimer formation with more dimers and higher order aggregates at pH 5 than at pH 7 or 8. This is consistent with previous work that showed that binding of PI-PLC to PC SUVs is pH-dependent, with a pKa of 8.4 (12Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9374-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The formation of covalently linked PI-PLC multimers was greater for enzyme binding to PC vesicles (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5; 54% at pH 5 and 31% at pH 7 (Table II)) than to diC7PC micelles (36% at pH 5 and 19% at pH 8). To determine whether a PC surface was required for PI-PLC aggregation, cross-linking of the protein was carried out in the presence of 4 mm diC6PC. This concentration of diC6PC by itself would be monomeric, since its critical micellar concentration is 14 mm (25Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1992; 153: 420-428Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of PI-PLC in the presence of diC6PC monomers (4 mm) led to ∼15% covalently linked protein aggregates (all dimer and no higher order species), comparable with the control without any PC. Similarly, cross-linking of PI-PLC in the presence of diC6PMe, an inhibitory phospholipid that can bind to the active site (8Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1992; 153: 420-428Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), at a concentration (4 mm) below its critical micellar concentration generated a gel pattern identical to the control with no increase in cross-linked species. Therefore, it is the presence of an interface that promotes the aggregation of PI-PLC that can be trapped covalently by EDC.Table IIDistribution of cross-linked species (percentage of total protein on SDS-PAGE) for B. thuringiensis PI-PLC cross-linked by EDC in the absence and presence of PC interfacespHInterfaceS*SS2S3 + S4 +...5473518<17493615<15POPC (0.5 mm)40640147POPC (0.5 mm)39302385diC7PC (4 mm)382626106diC7PC (4 mm)40302288diC7PC (4 mm)4338172 Open table in a new tab Preparations of PI-PLC cross-linked at pH 7 in the absence and presence of diC7PC were examined by CD to see whether there was any substantial change in secondary structure. The far UV spectra were essentially superimposable, indicating that secondary structure was not significantly affected by cross-linking. However, PI-PLC cross-linked even in the absence of PC was more prone to aggregation. Gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (in an attempt to separate monomer from covalently linked dimer) yielded ∼60% of the protein in the void volume. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that this material had cross-linked dimer and monomer species, suggesting that the protein was aggregating nonspecifically. The mass of the material in the void volume was not >100 kDa, since centrifugation of the protein through a 100-kDa cut-off filter, as done in vesicle binding assays (12Wehbi H. Feng J. Kolbeck J. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9374-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), caused >95% of all of the protein to elute in the filtrate.
