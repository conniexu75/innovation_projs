https://openalex.org/W3130288076,"This paper studies the connectedness between oil price shocks and agricultural commodities. Our sample period ranges from January 2002 to July 2020, covering the three global crises; Global Financial Crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and Covid-19 pandemic crisis. We employ Granger causality tests, and the static and dynamic connectedness spillover index methodology. We find that the shocks in oil prices are Granger-caused mainly by price changes of grains, live cattle, and wheat, while supply shock granger causes variations mostly in grain prices. We find that, from the point of view of static connectedness, for both, price and volatility spillovers, the livestock is the largest transmitter, while the lean hogs are the major receiver. Our dynamic analysis evidences that connectedness increases during the financial crisis period. Our results are potentially useful for investors, portfolios managers and policy makers."

In February 2020, the disease was named “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19). COVID-19 became a pandemic in March 2020, and, since then, different countries have implemented a broad spectrum of policies. Thailand is considered to be among the top countries in handling its first wave of the outbreak—12 January to 31 July 2020. Here, we illustrate how Thailand tackled the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly the effects of public health interventions on the epidemiological spread. This study shows how the available data from the outbreak can be analyzed and visualized to quantify the severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of the interventions, and the level of risk of allowed activities during an easing of a “lockdown.” This study shows how a well-organized governmental apparatus can overcome the havoc caused by a pandemic."

Recently, the new class of glucose-lowering agents, SGLT-2 inhibitors, have been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetic complications; however, the mechanisms of such beneficial effect are largely unknown. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on cell proliferation and cell death under oxidative stress conditions and explore its underlying mechanisms. Human proximal tubular cells (HK-2) were used. Cell growth and death were monitored by cell counting, water-soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, and flow cytometry. The cytosolic and mitochondrial (ROS) production was measured using fluorescent probes (H2DCFDA and MitoSOX) under normal and oxidative stress conditions mimicked by addition of H 2 O 2 . Intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics was monitored by FlexStation 3 using cell-permeable Ca 2+ dye Fura-PE3/AM. Dapagliflozin (0.1–10 μM) had no effect on HK-2 cell proliferation under normal conditions, but an inhibitory effect was seen at an extreme high concentration (100 μM). However, dapagliflozin at 0.1 to 5 μM showed remarkable protective effects against H 2 O 2 -induced cell injury via increasing the viable cell number at phase G0/G1. The elevated cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS under oxidative stress was significantly decreased by dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin increased the basal intracellular [Ca 2+ ] i in proximal tubular cells, but did not affect calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum and store-operated Ca 2+ entry. The H 2 O 2 -sensitive TRPM2 channel seemed to be involved in the Ca 2+ dynamics regulated by dapagliflozin. However, dapagliflozin had no direct effects on ORAI1, ORAI3, TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. Our results suggest that dapagliflozin shows anti-oxidative properties by reducing cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production and altering Ca 2+ dynamics, and thus exerts its protective effects against cell damage under oxidative stress environment."
https://openalex.org/W3129946706,"Weaning is associated with increased occurrence of infections and diseases in piglets. Recent findings indicate that weaning induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress conditions that more severely impact smaller piglets. The objective of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological consequences and the relation with systemic inflammatory status in both normal and low birth weight (NBW and LBW) piglets throughout the peri-weaning period. To conduct the study, 30 sows were inseminated, and specific piglets from their litters were assigned to one of two experimental groups: NBW (n = 60, 1.73 ± 0.01 kg,) and LBW piglets weighing less than 1.2 kg (n = 60, 1.01 ± 0.01 kg). Then, 10 piglets from each group were selected at 14, 21 (weaning), 23, 25, 29 and 35 days of age to collect organ and plasma samples. Specific porcine RT 2 Profiler™ PCR Arrays related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis processes were first used to target genes that are modulated after weaning in NBW piglets (d 23 and d 35 vs. d 14). Expression of selected genes was evaluated by quantitative PCR. These analyses revealed that expression of inflammatory genes CXCL10 and CCL19 increased after weaning in intestinal mucosa, while expression of genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was downregulated in liver and kidney of both groups. Interestingly, major modulators of mitophagy ( BNIP3 ), cell survival ( BCL2A1 ) and antioxidant defense system ( TXNRD2 , GPx3 , HMOX1 ) were found to be highly expressed in NBW piglets. The systemic levels of TNF-α and IL1-β significantly increased following weaning and were higher in NBW piglets. These results provide novel information about the molecular origin of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress observed in weaned piglets and suggest that clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, antioxidant defenses and inflammatory response are compromised in LBW piglets."
https://openalex.org/W3132964541,"Introduction Gait deficits are debilitating in people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD), which inevitably deteriorate over time. Gait analysis is a valuable method to assess disease-specific gait patterns and their relationship with the clinical features and progression of the disease. Objectives Our study aimed to i) develop an automated diagnostic algorithm based on machine-learning techniques (artificial neural networks [ANNs]) to classify the gait deficits of PwPD according to disease progression in the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) staging system, and ii) identify a minimum set of gait classifiers. Methods We evaluated 76 PwPD (H-Y stage 1–4) and 67 healthy controls (HCs) by computerized gait analysis. We computed the time-distance parameters and the ranges of angular motion (RoMs) of the hip, knee, ankle, trunk, and pelvis. Principal component analysis was used to define a subset of features including all gait variables. An ANN approach was used to identify gait deficits according to the H-Y stage. Results We identified a combination of a small number of features that distinguished PwPDs from HCs (one combination of two features: knee and trunk rotation RoMs) and identified the gait patterns between different H-Y stages (two combinations of four features: walking speed and hip, knee, and ankle RoMs; walking speed and hip, knee, and trunk rotation RoMs). Conclusion The ANN approach enabled automated diagnosis of gait deficits in several symptomatic stages of Parkinson’s disease. These results will inspire future studies to test the utility of gait classifiers for the evaluation of treatments that could modify disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3133177137,"Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are highly effective in treating cancer; however, cardiotoxicity can occur, including myocarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is useful for evaluation of myocarditis, although it has not been well studied in ICI cardiotoxicity. Methods We identified patients referred for CMR evaluation of ICI cardiotoxicity from September 2015 through September 2019. We assessed structural and functional parameters, feature tracking (FT) left ventricular and atrial strain, T2- weighted ratios and quantitative late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). We also applied the Updated Lake Louise Criteria for diagnosis of myocarditis. Results Of the 20 patients referred, the median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 52.5% ± 19.1 and 50% had a normal LVEF (≥53%). FT strain analysis revealed an average abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) of −9.8%± 4.2%. In patients with a normal LVEF, the average GLS remained depressed at −12.3%± 2.4%. In all patients, GLS demonstrated a significant negative correlation with LVEF (r s = −0.64, p 0.002). Sixteen patients (80%) had presence of LGE (14 non-ischemic pattern and 2 ischemic). Percent LGE did not correlate with any CMR parameters and notably did not correlate with LVEF (r s = −0.29, p = 0.22) or GLS (r s = 0.10, p = 0.67), highlighting the value of tissue characterization beyond functional assessment. Nine patients (45%) met full Updated Lake Louise Criteria and 85% met at least one criterion, suggestive of myocarditis in the correct clinical context. Thirteen patients (65%) were treated for ICI-associated myocarditis and, of these, 54% (n = 7) had recovery of LVEF to normal. There was no correlation between LVEF (p = 0.47), GLS (0.89), or % LGE (0.15) and recovery of LVEF with treatment. Conclusion In patients with suspected ICI cardiotoxicity, CMR is an important diagnostic tool, even in the absence of overt left ventricular dysfunction, as abnormalities in left ventricular strain, T2 signal and LGE can identifying disease."
https://openalex.org/W3132804717,"The microbial communities that live in symbiosis with the mucosal surfaces of animals provide the host with defense strategies against pathogens. These microbial communities are largely shaped by the environment and the host genetics. Triploid Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) are being considered for aquaculture as they are reproductively sterile and thus cannot contaminate the natural gene pool. It has not been previously investigated how the microbiome of triploid salmon compares to that of their diploid counterparts. In this study, we compare the steady-state skin and gill microbiome of both diploid and triploid salmon, and determine the effects of salmonid alphavirus 3 experimental infection on their microbial composition. Our results show limited differences in the skin-associated microbiome between triploid and diploid salmon, irrespective of infection. In the gills, we observed a high incidence of the bacterial pathogen Candidatus Branchiomonas , with higher abundance in diploid compared to triploid control fish. Diploid salmon infected with SAV3 showed greater histopathological signs of epitheliocystis compared to controls, a phenomenon not observed in triploid fish. Our results indicate that ploidy can affect the alpha diversity of the gills but not the skin-associated microbial community. Importantly, during a natural outbreak of Branchiomonas sp. the gill microbiome of diploid Atlantic salmon became significantly more dominated by this pathogen than in triploid animals. Thus, our results suggest that ploidy may play a role on Atlantic salmon gill health and provide insights into co-infection with SAV3 and C . Branchiomonas in Atlantic salmon."
https://openalex.org/W3129614494,"The grapevine berry surface is covered by a cuticle consisting of cutin and various lipophilic wax compounds. The latter build the main barrier for transpirational water loss and protect the fruit against environmental factors e.g. pests, mechanical impacts or radiation. The integrety of the fruit surface is one important key factor for post-harvest quality and storage of fruits. Nonetheless, the developmental pattern of cuticular wax was so far only investigated for a very limited number of fruits. Therefore, we performed comparative investigations on the compositional and morphological nature of epicuticular wax crystals and underlying wax during fruit development in Vitis vinifera . The main compound oleanolic acid belongs to the pentacyclic triterpenoids, which occur very early in the development in high amounts inside the cuticle. The amount increases until veraison and decreases further during ripening. In general, very-long chain aliphatic (VLCA) compounds are present in much smaller amounts and alcohols and aldehydes follow the same trend during development. In contrast, the amount of fatty acids constantly increases from fruit set to ripening while wax esters only occur in significant amount at veraison and increase further. Wax crystals at the fruit surface are solely composed of VLCAs and the morphology changes during development according to the compositional changes of the VLCA wax compounds. The remarkable compositional differences between epicuticular wax crystals and the underlying wax are important to understand in terms of studying grape-pest interactions or the influence of environmental factors, since only wax crystals directly face the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3130606737,"Background The World Health Organization recommended a minimum of 33 months between consecutive live births to reduce the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Poorly spaced pregnancies are associated with poor maternal and child health outcomes such as low birth weight, stillbirth, uterine rupture, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality, child malnutrition, and maternal hemorrhage. However, there was limited evidence on the duration of birth interval and its predictors among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the duration of birth interval and its predictors among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data. A total weighted sample of 11022 reproductive-age women who gave birth within five years preceding the survey was included for analysis. To identify the predictors, the Gompertz gamma shared frailty model was fitted. The theta value, Akakie Information Criteria (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and deviance was used for model selection. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.2 in the bi-variable analysis were considered for the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable Gompertz gamma shared frailty analysis, the Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was reported to show the strength and statistical significance of the association. Results The median inter-birth interval in Ethiopia was 38 months (95% CI: 37.58, 38.42). Being living in Addis Ababa (AHR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.70), being rural resident (AHR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.23), being Muslim religious follower (AHR = 6.53, 95% CI: 2.35, 18.18), having three birth (AHR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.83), having four birth (AHR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.74), five and above births (AHR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.41), and using contraceptive (AHR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.77) were found significant predictors of duration of birth interval. Conclusion The length of the inter-birth interval was consistent with the World Health Organization recommendation. Therefore, health care interventions that enhance modern contraceptive utilization among women in rural areas and Muslim religious followers would be helpful to optimize birth interval."

Sherkole refugee camp is stratified under high risk for malaria. Knowledge on malaria prevalence and associated factors among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp is lacking. Methods and materials Institution-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp from October to November 2019. Total sample size was 356. Stratified random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Standardized questionnaire was used to collect data. Care Start TM Malaria Rapid diagnostic test which detect histidine-rich protein 2 of P. falciparum and plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase of P. vivax was used to diagnose malaria. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with malaria. Results A total of 356 participants were included in this study with response rate of 97.5%. The prevalence malaria was 3.9% (95% CI = 2.0–6.2). Outdoor stay at night (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.14–13.8), stagnant water near to house (AOR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.14–14.6), and the number of under-five children per household (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.03–13.0) were found to increase the odds of getting malaria. Whereas, insecticide treated net (ITN)utilization (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.06–0.61) and Health information about malaria (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.06–0.65) reduce the odds of getting malaria. Conclusions and recommendations Malaria remains the major public health problem in Sherkole Refugee camp. Outdoor stay at night, stagnant water near to house, and number of under-five children per household were the risk factors for malaria. Health information dissemination that focuses on avoiding outdoor stay at night, eliminating stagnant water &amp; using ITN, and considering number of under-five children per household during ITN distribution should be take into account."
https://openalex.org/W3132857421,"Background Vitamin D status is presently assessed by measuring total serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. However, 25(OH)D concentration alone might not accurately reflect vitamin D status owing to its weak relationship with various clinical indices and inconsistency across races. Recently, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH) 2 D] and vitamin D metabolite ratio [VMR; ratio of 24,25(OH) 2 D to 25(OH)D] have emerged as vitamin D biomarkers. The present study aimed to determine the values of 24,25(OH) 2 D and VMR in healthy Koreans and compare them with other vitamin D biomarkers, including 25(OH)D and bioavailable 25(OH)D. Methods Serum samples and medical information were collected from 200 individuals (100 females and 100 males) who underwent general health checks without self-reported symptoms. We measured 24,25(OH) 2 D concentration using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and concentrations of 25(OH)D and vitamin D binding protein using immunoassays. VMR and bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration were calculated using the above data. Serum parathyroid hormone level, and bone mineral density (BMD) data were collected as clinical outcomes, and the effects of the vitamin D markers on them were tested using multiple linear regression models. Results The mean values of 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH) 2 D, VMR, and bioavailable 25(OH)D were 24.3 ± 8.5 ng/mL, 1.9 ± 1.1 ng/mL, 7.6 ± 2.5, and 3.2 ± 1.2 ng/mL, respectively. The concentration of 25(OH)D closely correlated with 24,25(OH) 2 D (R = 0.868, P &lt; 0.001) and bioavailable 25(OH)D (R = 0.862, P &lt; 0.001). No significant effects of 24,25(OH) 2 D, VMR, and bioavailable 25(OH)D were observed on the prediction of PTH and BMD in the multiple linear regression models. Conclusion Our study presents the distribution of 24,25(OH) 2 D concentration and VMR in Korean population for the first time. Overall, our data reaffirm that 25(OH)D is the primary marker for determining vitamin D status in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3129907933,"Societal responses to crises require coordination at multiple levels of organization. Exploring early efforts to contain COVID-19 in the U.S., we argue that local governments can act to ensure systemic resilience and recovery when higher-level governments fail to do so. Event history analyses show that large, more urban areas experience COVID-19 more intensely due to high population density and denser socioeconomic networks. But metropolitan counties were also among the first to adopt shelter-in-place orders. Analyzing the statistical predictors of when counties moved before their states, we find that the hierarchy of counties by size and economic integration matters for the timing of orders, where both factors predict earlier shelter-in-place orders. In line with sociological theories of urban governance, we also find evidence of an important governance dimension to the timing of orders. Liberal counties in conservative states were more than twice as likely to adopt a policy and implement one earlier in the pandemic, suggesting that tensions about how to resolve collective governance problems are important in the socio-temporal dynamic of responses to COVID-19. We explain this behavior as a substitution effect in which more urban local governments, driven by risk and necessity, step up into the action vacuum left by higher levels of government and become national policy leaders and innovators."
https://openalex.org/W3130441927,"Background The impact of dietary phosphorus (P) excess, especially on renal and cardiovascular health, has been investigated in several species, but little is known in dogs. Objective The aim of this study was to examine effects of different P sources on concentration and postprandial kinetics of selected parameters of P homeostasis in dogs. Methods Eight beagles received one control diet (P 0.5% dry matter [DM]) and three high P diets (poultry meal, NaH 2 PO 4, and KH 2 PO 4 ; P 1.7% DM) for 18d. Urine samples were collected pre- and postprandially while faeces were collected quantitatively for 5d and analysed for minerals. On day 18, blood was sampled 1h pre- and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5 and 7h postprandially. Results Pi (KH 2 PO 4 , NaH 2 PO 4 ) but not organic P caused an increased apparent P digestibility and significantly influenced kinetics of serum FGF23, parathyroid hormone, P, CrossLaps and bonespecific alkaline phosphatase, demonstrating a disrupted calcium (Ca) and P homeostasis with potential harm for renal, cardiovascular and skeletal health. Conclusions Results of feeding Pi to dogs indicate distinct disturbances of Ca and P metabolism, in contrast to organic sources. The use of Pi in food can therefore not be considered as safe. Further research, especially on dose and long-term effects, is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3130919003,"Background Emergency Department (ED) visits and health care costs are increasing globally, but little is known about contributing factors of ED resource consumption. This study aims to analyse and to predict the total ED resource consumption out of the patient and consultation characteristics in order to execute performance analysis and evaluate quality improvements. Methods Characteristics of ED visits of a large Swiss university hospital were summarized according to acute patient condition factors (e.g. chief complaint, resuscitation bay use, vital parameter deviations), chronic patient conditions (e.g. age, comorbidities, drug intake), and contextual factors (e.g. night-time admission). Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted with the total ED resource consumption as the dependent variable. Results In total, 164,729 visits were included in the analysis. Physician resources accounted for the largest proportion (54.8%), followed by radiology (19.2%), and laboratory work-up (16.2%). In the multivariable final model, chief complaint had the highest impact on the total ED resource consumption, followed by resuscitation bay use and admission by ambulance. The impact of age group was small. The multivariable final model was validated (R 2 of 0.54) and a scoring system was derived out of the predictors. Conclusions More than half of the variation in total ED resource consumption can be predicted by our suggested model in the internal validation, but further studies are needed for external validation. The score developed can be used to calculate benchmarks of an ED and provides leaders in emergency care with a tool that allows them to evaluate resource decisions and to estimate effects of organizational changes."
https://openalex.org/W3130830445,"Operant chambers are small enclosures used to test animal behavior and cognition. While traditionally reliant on simple technologies for presenting stimuli (e.g., lights and sounds) and recording responses made to basic manipulanda (e.g., levers and buttons), an increasing number of researchers are beginning to use Touchscreen-equipped Operant Chambers (TOCs). These TOCs have obvious advantages, namely by allowing researchers to present a near infinite number of visual stimuli as well as increased flexibility in the types of responses that can be made and recorded. We trained wild-caught adult and juvenile great-tailed grackles ( Quiscalus mexicanus ) to complete experiments using a TOC. We learned much from these efforts, and outline the advantages and disadvantages of our protocols. Our training data are summarized to quantify the variables that might influence participation and success, and we discuss important modifications to facilitate animal engagement and participation in various tasks. Finally, we provide a “training guide” for creating experiments using PsychoPy, a free and open-source software that was incredibly useful during these endeavors. This article, therefore, should serve as a resource to those interested in switching to or maintaining a TOC, or who similarly wish to use a TOC to test the cognitive abilities of non-model species or wild-caught individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3132748960,"Frass (fine powdery refuse or fragile perforated wood produced by the activity of boring insects) of larvae of the European house borer (EHB) and of drywood termites was tested as a natural and novel feedstock for 3D-printing of wood-based materials. Small particles produced by the drywood termite Incisitermes marginipennis and the EHB Hylotrupes bajulus during feeding in construction timber, were used. Frass is a powdery material of particularly consistent quality that is essentially biologically processed wood mixed with debris of wood and faeces. The filigree-like particles flow easily permitting the build-up of wood-based structures in a layer wise fashion using the Binder Jetting printing process. The quality of powders produced by different insect species was compared along with the processing steps and properties of the printed parts. Drywood termite frass with a Hausner Ratio HR = 1.1 with ρBulk = 0.67 g/cm 3 and ρTap = 0.74 g/cm 3 was perfectly suited to deposition of uniformly packed layers in 3D printing. We suggest that a variety of naturally available feedstocks could be used in environmentally responsible approaches to scientific material sciences/additive manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W3129605017,"Increasing enrollment of students who are underrepresented in medicine has been a priority of United States (US) medical schools. The authors sought to compare how increasing minority student representation factors into mission statements, statements of values, and strategic action plans at top research-oriented US medical schools and US medical schools with a social mission. A Web search was performed to locate three documents for each medical school: the mission statement; a statement of values; and a strategic plan. Data were retrieved on the number of underrepresented minority graduates and total graduates from each school in the graduating classes of 2015–2019. The number and percentage of graduates during this period were compared according to schools’ mission statements using rank-sum tests. Other quantitative study data were compared by school mission using Fisher’s exact tests. Five of the schools with a social mission (25%) and none of the schools with a research mission had a mission statement that addressed increasing representation of underrepresented minority students in the medical school (p = 0.047). Schools with a mission statement that addressed this group had a higher proportion of those graduates during 2015–2019 (median 66%; IQR 28%, 68%) compared to schools that did not address this in their mission statement (median 10%; IQR 6%, 13%; p = 0.003).

https://openalex.org/W3130597549,"Background and objectives Distal upper extremity surgery is commonly performed under regional anaesthesia, including intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) and ultrasound-guided forearm nerve block. This study aimed to investigate if ultrasound-guided forearm nerve block is superior to forearm IVRA in producing a surgical block in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release. Methods In this observer-blinded, randomized controlled superiority trial, 100 patients undergoing carpal tunnel release were randomized to receive ultrasound-guided forearm nerve block (n = 50) or forearm IVRA (n = 50). The primary outcome was anaesthetic efficacy evaluated by classifying the blocks as complete vs incomplete. Complete anaesthesia was defined as total sensory block, incomplete anaesthesia as mild pain requiring more analgesics or need of general anaesthesia. Pain intensity on a numeric rating scale (0–10) was recorded. Surgeon satisfaction with hemostasis, surgical time, and OR stay time were recorded. Patient satisfaction with the quality of the block was assessed at POD 1. Results In total, 43 (86%) of the forearm nerve blocks were evaluated as complete, compared to 33 (66%) of the forearm IVRA (p = 0.019). After the forearm nerve block, pain intensity was lower at discharge (-1.76 points lower, 95% CI (-2.92, -0.59), p = 0.0006) compared to patients treated with forearm IVRA. No differences in pain experienced at the start of the surgery, during surgery, and at POD1, nor in surgical time or total OR stay were observed between groups. Surgeon (p = 0.0016) and patient satisfaction (p = 0.0023) were slightly higher after forearm nerve block. Conclusion An ultrasound-guided forearm nerve block is superior compared to forearm IVRA in providing a surgical block in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release.

https://openalex.org/W3130591935,"The aim of this article is to provide a detailed description of the Youth and Mental Health Study (YAMHS),a population-based, representative (cluster sampling), prospective cohort study that was conducted to investigate risk and resilience factors for mental health conditions, specifically depressive symptoms and disorders, from adolescence to adulthood. The baseline data were collected in 1998 (T1) in two counties in central Norway from 2464 adolescents (response rate 88.3%, mean age 13.7 years). The first follow-up was conducted in 1999 (T2) (n = 2432, response rate of 87.1%, mean age 14.9 years). A subgroup of individuals was assessed at T2 (n = 345) with clinical interviews, and this subgroup was reassessed in 2005 (T3) (n = 265, 70.1%, 20 years). The last follow-up (of participants assessed at T1 and T2) was conducted in 2012 (T4) (n = 1266, 51.9%, 27.2 years). Demographics, depressive symptoms, general psychopathology, suicidal ideation and attempts and psychological and somatic factors were recorded. Among adolescents of both sexes, psychosocial variables were correlated with and predicted depressive symptom severity. The strongest predictors were sex (female), the levels of depressive symptoms the preceding year, and the total number of stressful events. The association between stressful life events and depressive symptoms was moderated by physical activity, while the relationship between stressful events and coping style was mediated by depressive symptoms. The rate of use of specialised mental health services among the depressed was low. The lifetime prevalence of depressive disorders was 23% at 15 years, and the most common disorder was minor depression. Adolescents who attempted suicide were more often victims of violence and less resilient than were non-suicide attempters. The existing longitudinal data from the cohort will be further analysed. Follow-up data will be obtained from existing national registries by links created with individual identification numbers."
https://openalex.org/W3131633993,"Background The utility of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) related parameters in differentiation of hypovascular liver lesions is still unknown. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of IVIM related parameters in comparison to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for differentiation among intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (IMC), and hypovascular liver metastases (HLM). Methods Seventy-four prospectively enrolled patients (21 IMC, and 53 HLM) underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance examination with IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging using seven b values (0–800 s/mm 2 ). Two independent readers performed quantitative analysis of IVIM-related parameters and ADC. Interobserver reliability was tested using a intraclass correlation coefficient. ADC, true diffusion coefficient ( D ), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient ( D *), and perfusion fraction (ƒ) were compared among the lesions using Kruskal-Wallis H test. The diagnostic accuracy of each parameter was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results The interobserver agreement was good for ADC (0.802), and excellent for D , D *, and ƒ (0.911, 0.927, and 0.942, respectively). ADC, and D values were significantly different among IMC and HLM (both p &lt; 0.05), while there was no significant difference among these lesions for ƒ and D * ( p = 0.101, and p = 0.612, respectively). ROC analysis showed higher diagnostic performance of D in comparison to ADC (AUC = 0.879 vs 0.821). Conclusion IVIM-derived parameters in particular D , in addition to ADC, could help in differentiation between most common hypovascular malignant liver lesions, intrahepatic mass—forming cholangiocarcinoma and hypovascular liver metastases."
https://openalex.org/W3131764581,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons and promotes progressive muscle atrophy. It has a multifactorial etiology, where environmental conditions playing a remarkable role through the increase of oxidative stress. Genetic polymorphisms in cell detoxification genes, such as Glutathione S-Transferase Pi 1 ( GSTP1 ) can contribute to excessive oxidative stress, and therefore may be a risk factor to ALS. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of the GSTP1 rs1695 polymorphism in ALS susceptibility in different genetic inheritance models and evaluate the association of the genotypes with risk factors, clinical and demographic characteristics of ALS patients from the Brazilian central population. This case-control study was conducted with 101 patients with ALS and 101 healthy controls. GSTP1 rs1695 polymorphism genotyping was performed with Polymerase Chain Reaction–Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS statistical package and SNPStats software. Analysis of genetic inheritance models was performed by logistic regression, which was used to determine the Odds Ratio. The results of this first study in the Brazilian population demonstrated that there was no risk association between the development of ALS and the GSTP1 rs1695 polymorphism in any genetic inheritance model (codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and logarithmic); and that the polymorphic variants were not associated with the clinical and demographic characteristics of ALS patients. No association of the GSTP1 rs1695 polymorphism and ALS development in the Brazilian central population was found. These findings may be justified by the multifactorial character of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3132629418,"The protozoal pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus infects the colon of domestic cats and is a major cause of chronic colitis and diarrhea. Treatment failure is common, but antibiotics may improve clinical signs in a subset of cats, leading researchers to question involvement of the colonic microbiota in disease pathogenesis. Studies performed in women with venereal Trichomonas vaginalis infections have revealed that dysbiosis of host microbiota contributes to pathogenicity with similar findings also found in mice with intestinal Tritrichomonas musculis The aim of this study was to characterize differences in the fecal microbiota of cats with and without naturally occurring T . foetus infection and in a group of kittens prior to and after experimentally induced infection. Archived fecal DNA from cats undergoing testing for T . foetus infection (n = 89) and experimentally infected kittens (n = 4; at pre-, 2 weeks, and 9 weeks post-infection) were analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Amongst the naturally infected population, the genera Megamonas and Helicobacter were significantly increased in prevalence and abundance in cats testing positive for T . foetus infection. In the group of four experimentally infected kittens, fecal samples post-infection had significantly lower abundance of genus Dialister and Megamonas and greater abundance of the class Betaproteobacteria and family Succinivibrionaceae . We hypothesize that T . foetus promotes dysbiosis by competition for fermentable substrates used by these bacteria and that metabolic byproducts may contribute to the pathogenesis of colonic inflammation and diarrhea. Future studies are warranted for the measurement of fecal concentrations of microbial and protozoal metabolites in cats with T . foetus infection for the identification of potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3132823581,"Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by excessive host response to infection that can lead to activation of the coagulation system. Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and ADAMTS13 are important regulators of hemostasis and their dysregulation during sepsis progression is not well understood. Herein we characterize ADAMTS13 and VWF in septic and non-septic patients. ADAMTS13 activity, ADAMTS13 antigen, VWF antigen, myeloperoxidase, and protein C, were measured in plasma collected from 40 septic patients (20 non-survivors and 20 survivors) and 40 non-septic patients on the first and last day of their ICU stay. ADAMTS13 activity and ADAMTS13 antigen were reduced, whereas VWF antigen was elevated among septic patients compared to non-septic patients and healthy controls. Non-septic patients also exhibited elevated VWF antigen and reduced ADAMTS13 activity, but to a lesser extent than septic patients. Non-survivor septic patients exhibited the lowest levels of ADAMTS13 activity. ADAMTS13 activity:antigen ratio was similar across all patient cohorts suggesting that the specific activity of ADAMTS13 remains unchanged. Therefore, reduced ADAMTS13 function in circulation is likely due to a reduction in circulating levels. We suggest that massive release of VWF in response to inflammation consumes limited circulating ADAMTS13, resulting in the imbalance observed between VWF and ADAMTS13 among septic and to a lesser extent in non-septic ICU patients. Changes to ADAMTS13 did not correlate with myeloperoxidase or protein C levels. Reduced ADAMTS13 activity and antigen, and elevated VWF antigen observed among all patient cohorts on admission remained unchanged in survivors at ICU discharge. Prolonged reduction in ADAMTS13 activity and antigen in septic patients coincides with elevated levels of VWF. The persistent abnormalities in ADAMTS13 and VWF in sepsis patients discharged from the ICU may contribute to a sustained prothrombotic state."
https://openalex.org/W3089109643,"In-silico prediction of repurposable drugs is an effective drug discovery strategy that supplements de-nevo drug discovery from scratch. Reduced development time, less cost and absence of severe side effects are significant advantages of using drug repositioning. Most recent and most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have boosted drug repurposing in terms of throughput and accuracy enormously. However, with the growing number of drugs, targets and their massive interactions produce imbalanced data which may not be suitable as input to the classification model directly. Here, we have proposed DTI-SNNFRA, a framework for predicting drug-target interaction (DTI), based on shared nearest neighbour (SNN) and fuzzy-rough approximation (FRA). It uses sampling techniques to collectively reduce the vast search space covering the available drugs, targets and millions of interactions between them. DTI-SNNFRA operates in two stages: first, it uses SNN followed by a partitioning clustering for sampling the search space. Next, it computes the degree of fuzzy-rough approximations and proper degree threshold selection for the negative samples’ undersampling from all possible interaction pairs between drugs and targets obtained in the first stage. Finally, classification is performed using the positive and selected negative samples. We have evaluated the efficacy of DTI-SNNFRA using AUC (Area under ROC Curve), Geometric Mean, and F1 Score. The model performs exceptionally well with a high prediction score of 0.95 for ROC-AUC. The predicted drug-target interactions are validated through an existing drug-target database (Connectivity Map (Cmap))."
https://openalex.org/W3130243569,"Rationale The COVID-19 pandemic induces considerable strain on intensive care unit resources. Objectives We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients’ intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. Methods We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Measurements The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Main results The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. Conclusion A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios."

The only FDA approved drug Riluzole provides only symptomatic relief to patients. Early Diagnosis of the disease warrants the importance of diagnostic and prognostic models for predicting disease and disease progression respectively. In the present study we represent the predictive statistical model for ALS using plasma and CSF biomarkers. Forward stepwise (Binary likelihood) Logistic regression model is developed for prediction of ALS. The model has been shown to have excellent validity (94%) with good sensitivity (98%) and specificity (93%). The area under the ROC curve is 99.3%.

https://openalex.org/W3129605570,"Purpose To improve the acceptance and compliance of treatment of amblyopia, the aim of this study was to show that it is feasible to design an electronic frame for context-sensitive liquid crystal glasses, which can measure the state of wear position in a robust manner and detect distinct motion patterns for activity recognition. Methods Different temple designs with integrated temperature and capacitive sensors were developed to realize the detection of the state of wear position to distinguish three states (correct position/wrong position/glasses taken off). The electronic glasses frame was further designed as a tool for accelerometer data acquisition, which was used for algorithm development for activity classification. For this purpose, training data of 20 voluntary healthy adult subjects (5 females, 15 males) were recorded and a 10-fold cross-validation was computed for classifier selection. In order to perform functional testing of the electronic glasses frame, a proof of concept study was performed in a small group of healthy adults. Four healthy adult subjects (2 females, 2 males) were included to wear the electronic glasses frame and to protocol their activities in their everyday life according to a defined test protocol. Individual and averaged results for the precision of the state of wear position detection and of the activity recognition were calculated. Results Context-sensitive control algorithms were developed which detected the state of wear position and activity in a proof of concept. The pilot study revealed an average of 91.4% agreement of the detected states of wear position. The activity recognition match was 82.2% when applying an additional filter criterion. Removing the glasses was always detected 100% correctly. Conclusion The principles investigated are suitable for detecting the glasses’ state of wear position and for recognizing the wearer´s activity in a smart glasses concept."

In this study, we provide a combined approach (including monitoring of demographic and reproductive parameters and study of genetic diversity) to assess the current conservation status of the species and to estimate its future extinction risk. The five subpopulations of A . naufraga were monitored for five years (2014–2018). Population size markedly fluctuated between 68–130 mature individuals during the monitoring period. The extent of occurrence (EOO) was estimated at 28.7 km 2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) was 8 km 2 . Stage-structure recordings were similar for all subpopulations, characterized by high proportions of adult and senescent individuals, following a common pattern, which has been observed in other cliff-dwelling plants. Preliminary genetic analysis with SSRs markers revealed low heterozygosity within subpopulations and significant departure from H-W equilibrium, which combined with small population size suggest increased threat of genetic diversity loss. Our results indicate that the species should be placed in the Critically Endangered (CR) IUCN threat category, while according to Population Viability Analysis results its extinction risk increases to 47.8% in the next 50 years. The small population size combined with large fluctuations in its size, low recruitment and low genetic diversity, indicate the need of undertaking effective in situ and ex situ conservation measures."
https://openalex.org/W3130454436,"The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme maintains a captive breeding and head-starting program for endangered Grand Cayman blue iguanas ( Cyclura lewisi ) on Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. In May 2015, program staff encountered two lethargic wild Grand Cayman blue iguanas within the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park (QEIIBP). Spiral-shaped bacteria were identified on peripheral blood smears from both animals, which molecular diagnostics identified as a novel Helicobacter species (provisionary name Helicobacter sp. GCBI1). Between March 2015 and February 2017, 11 Grand Cayman blue iguanas were identified with the infection. Two of these were found dead and nine were treated; five of the nine treated animals survived the initial infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene suggests Helicobacter sp. GCBI1 is most closely related to Helicobacter spp. in chelonians. We developed a Taqman qPCR assay specific for Helicobacter sp. GCBI1 to screen tissue and/or blood samples from clinical cases, fecal and cloacal samples from clinically healthy Grand Cayman blue iguanas, including previously infected and recovered iguanas, and iguanas housed adjacent to clinical cases. Fecal and/or cloacal swab samples were all negative, suggesting that Grand Cayman blue iguanas do not asymptomatically carry this organism nor shed this pathogen per cloaca post infection. Retrospective analysis of a 2014 mortality event affecting green iguanas ( Iguana iguana ) from a separate Grand Cayman location identified Helicobacter sp. GCBI1 in two of three cases. The source of infection and mode of transmission are yet to be confirmed. Analysis of rainfall data reveal that all infections occurred during a multi-year dry period, and most occurred shortly after the first rains at the end of seasonal drought. Additionally, further screening has identified Helicobacter sp. GCBI1 from choanal swabs of clinically normal green iguanas in the QEIIBP, suggesting they could be asymptomatic carriers and a potential source of the pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3130665262,"Background The rapid response system has been implemented in many hospitals worldwide and, reportedly, the timing of medical emergency team (MET) attendance in relation to the duration of hospitalization is associated with the mortality of MET patients. We evaluated the relationship between duration of hospitalization before MET activation and patient mortality. We compared cases of MET activation for early, intermediate, and late deterioration to patient characteristics, activation characteristics, and patient outcomes. We also aimed to determine the relationship, after adjusting for confounders, between the duration of hospitalization before MET activation and patient mortality. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated patients who triggered MET activation in general wards from March 2009 to February 2015 at the Asan Medical Center in Seoul. Patients were categorized as those with early deterioration (less than 2 days after admission), intermediate deterioration (2–7 days after admission), and late deterioration (more than 7 days after admission) and compared them to patient characteristics, activation characteristics, and patient outcomes. Results Overall, 7114 patients were included. Of these, 1793 (25.2%) showed early deterioration, 2113 (29.7%) showed intermediate deterioration, and 3208 (45.1%) showed late deterioration. Etiologies of MET activation were similar among these groups. The clinical outcomes significantly differed among the groups (intensive care unit transfer: 34.1%, 35.6%, and 40.4%; p &lt; 0.001 and mortality: 26.3%, 31.5%, and 41.2%; p &lt; 0.001 for early, intermediate, and late deterioration, respectively). Compared with early deterioration and adjusted for confounders, the odds ratio of mortality for late deterioration was 1.68 (1.46–1.93). Conclusions Nearly 50% of the acute clinically-deteriorating patients who activated the MET had been hospitalized for more than 7 days. Furthermore, they presented with higher rates of mortality and ICU transfer than patients admitted for less than 7 days before MET activation and had mortality as an independent risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W3130720604,"Objective Malaria in pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. The objective was to compare outcomes of simple and severe malaria and to determine whether they vary by trimester or severity of infection. Methods Prospective cohort study performed in 3 hospitals in Rwanda. Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed malaria were enrolled and followed until 7 days postpartum. Demographic, clinical manifestations and perinatal outcomes were recorded. Results There were 446 pregnant women with confirmed malaria and outcome data; 361 (80.9%) had simple malaria. Severe malaria was more common as pregnancy progressed; out of 85 with severe malaria, 12.9%, 29.4% and 57.6% were in the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters (p&lt;0.0001). Overall, a normal term delivery occurred in 57.6%, with preterm delivery in 24.9% and abortion in 13.5%. Adverse perinatal outcomes increased with trimester of infection (p&lt;0.0001). Eight of the 9 early neonatal deaths had 3 rd trimester infection (p&lt;0.0001). There were 27 stillbirths; 63.7% were associated with 3 rd trimester infection. A significant difference in perinatal outcomes between simple and severe malaria was seen: 64% of women with simple malaria had a normal term delivery as compared to 30.6% with severe malaria (p&lt;0.0001). All complications were significantly greater with severe malaria. Conclusion Overall poor outcomes are seen in malaria with significant differences in perinatal outcomes between simple and severe malaria and by trimester of infection. In addition to vector control and exposure prevention, efforts need to be made in screening, treatment education and monitoring pregnancies affected by malaria."

Sharing corneal tissue across nations can provide some access, however the willingness of export populations, like Australians, to export their donation on death, has never been evaluated. Our research samples the Australian population, determining their willingness to export. Materials and method We conducted e-surveys. N = 1044 Australians participated. The sample represented the Australian population, based on population demographics. Chi-Square and bivariate correlation coefficients examined associations between categorical variables, with a sample size of N = 1044, power of 0.80, and alpha of p = 0.05. Outcome measures were based on population sampling, by exploring willingness export, through the e-survey method. Results 38% (n = 397) of respondents said yes to exportation, 23.8% (n = 248) said no, and 38.2% (n = 399) were undecided. We found no relationship between willingness to export and general demographics, though those registered on the Donatelife Register (p = &lt; .001), and those already willing to donate their eyes (p = &lt; .001) were significantly more willing to export. Discussion More Australians are willing to export their corneas than not, though a significant portion remain undecided. The Donatelife Register, and donation awareness, are key components of respondent decision making. Therefore, the provision of information about exportation prior to, and at the point-of-donation, is essential for assisting Australian’s to decide to export or not. Further examination and development of consent-for-export systems are necessary before routine exportation is undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W3131834726,"Background Inhalational anesthesia and propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are the two most popular methods of general anesthesia with distinct characteristics that may affect quality of recovery (QOR) differently. This study compared QOR after corrective lower limb osteotomy between desflurane-based inhalational anesthesia and propofol-based TIVA. Methods Sixty-eight patients, ASA class I or II who underwent corrective lower limb osteotomy were randomized to receive either desflurane anesthesia or propofol TIVA. The primary outcome was quality of recovery 40 (QoR-40) questionnaire scores on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 2. Postoperative nausea scores, antiemetic requirements, and amount of opioid consumption via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) were assessed as secondary outcomes. Results Global QoR-40 scores on POD 1 (153.5 (140.3, 171.3) vs. 140.0 (120.0, 173.0), P = 0.056, 95% CI; -22.5, 0.2) and POD 2 (155.5 (146.8, 175.5) vs. 152.0 (134.0, 179.0), P = 0.209, 95% CI; -17.5, 3.9) were comparable between the two groups. Among the five dimensions of QoR-40, physical independence scores were significantly higher in the TIVA group compared to the Desflurane group on POD both 1 and 2. Nausea scores (0.0 (0.0, 0.0) vs. 1.0 (0.0, 3.5), P &lt; 0.001) and number of patients requiring rescue antiemetics (0% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.017) were significantly lower in the TIVA group at the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). Although the number of bolus attempts between 0–24 h and the morphine equivalent dose of analgesics administered via IV PCA between 12–24 h were significantly less in the TIVA group compared to the Desflurane group, there was no significant difference between groups for the overall 48 h postoperative period. Conclusions Propofol-based TIVA did not improve global QoR-40 scores compared with desflurane-based inhalational anesthesia. However, considering the better QoR-40 scores in the domain of physical independence and less nausea in the early postoperative period, propofol TIVA should be considered as a useful option in patients undergoing corrective lower limb osteotomy."
https://openalex.org/W3132366655,"The risk factors associated with mortality in patients with extremely high serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are controversial. In this retrospective single-center cross-sectional study, the clinical and laboratory data of patients with CRP levels ≥40 mg/dL treated in Saitama Medical Center, Japan from 2004 to 2017 were retrieved from medical records. The primary outcome was defined as 72-hour mortality after the final CRP test. Forty-four mortal cases were identified from the 275 enrolled cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was performed to explore the parameters relevant for predicting mortality. As an alternative method of prediction, we devised a novel risk predictor, “weighted average of risk scores” (WARS). WARS features the following: (1) selection of candidate risk variables for 72-hour mortality by univariate analyses, (2) determination of C-statistics and cutoff value for each variable in predicting mortality, (3) 0–1 scoring of each risk variable at the cutoff value, and (4) calculation of WARS by weighted addition of the scores with weights assigned according to the C-statistic of each variable. MLRA revealed four risk variables associated with 72-hour mortality—age, albumin, inorganic phosphate, and cardiovascular disease—with a predictability of 0.829 in C-statistics. However, validation by repeated resampling of the 275 records showed that a set of predictive variables selected by MLRA fluctuated occasionally because of the presence of closely associated risk variables and missing data regarding some variables. WARS attained a comparable level of predictability (0.837) by combining the scores for 10 risk variables, including age, albumin, electrolytes, urea, lactate dehydrogenase, and fibrinogen. Several mutually related risk variables are relevant in predicting 72-hour mortality in patients with extremely high CRP levels. Compared to conventional MLRA, WARS exhibited a favorable performance with flexible coverage of many risk variables while allowing for missing data."

This has endangered the ecological security through conspicuous losses in topsoil quality. The rationale of the present study was to map the soil properties and create management zones for ensuring food and nutritional security. The study was conducted in South Goa district of the state of Goa located in Konkan region. A total of 258 geo-referenced soil samples were collected and analyzed for pH, EC, SOC, available N, P, K and DTPA extractable micronutrients viz ., Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn. Soil pH was found to be in acidic range. A wide variability existed in SOC content ranging from 0.12–5.85%. EC was mostly neutral with mean value 0.08±0.37 dSm -1 , while available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) varied in range from 56.4–621.6 kg ha -1 , 0.5–49.7 kg ha -1 and 31.5–786.2 kg ha -1 with mean values 211.2±76.9, 8.4±8.2 and 202.3±137.6 kg ha -1 , respectively. A wide range was exhibited by cationic DTPA extractable Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn with mean values, 0.22±0.30, 0.44±0.60, 7.78±5.98 and 7.86±5.86 mg kg -1 , respectively. Soil pH exhibited significant positive correlation with EC, AP AK and Zn and negative correlation with Fe and Cu. SOC exhibited significantly correlated with AN, AP, AK, Zn and Fe. Geo-statistical analysis revealed J-Bessel as best fit semivariogram model for pH, AP and AK; Rational Quadratic for EC, SOC, Zn and Mn; Hole effect for AN; Stable for Cu and K-Bessel for Fe for their spatial mapping. Four principal components showed eigenvalues more than one and cumulative variability of 59.38%. Three distinct soil management zones showing significant variation in soil properties were identified and delineated for wider scale management of soils. Precision nutrient management based on spatial variation and their mapping would enable refined agricultural and environmental management practices in the region."

In addition to immune cells, C5aR1 is expressed in neoplastic cells of multiple tumour entities, where C5aR1 is associated with a higher proliferation rate, advanced tumour stage, and poor patient outcomes. The aim of the present study was to obtain a broad expression profile of C5aR1 in human non-neoplastic and neoplastic tissues, especially in tumour entities not investigated in this respect so far. For this purpose, we generated a novel polyclonal rabbit antibody, {5227}, against the carboxy-terminal tail of C5aR1. The antibody was initially characterised in Western blot analyses and immunocytochemistry using transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. It was then applied to a large series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded non-neoplastic and neoplastic human tissue samples. C5aR1 was strongly expressed by different types of immune cells in the majority of tissue samples investigated. C5aR1 was also present in alveolar macrophages, bronchial, gut, and bile duct epithelia, Kupffer cells, occasionally in hepatocytes, proximal renal tubule cells, placental syncytiotrophoblasts, and distinct stem cell populations of bone marrow. C5aR1 was also highly expressed in the vast majority of the 32 tumour entities investigated, where a hitherto unappreciated high prevalence of the receptor was detected in thyroid carcinomas, small-cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and endometrial carcinomas. In addition to confirming published findings, we found noticeable C5aR1 expression in many tumour entities for the first time. Here, it may serve as an interesting target for future therapies."

We examined three groupings treated with no H 2 O 2 (control), 180 μM H 2 O 2 (low) and 1800 μM H 2 O 2 (high). The results showed a total of 114,057 unigenes were identified, 41.22% of which were functionally annotated in at least one particular database. When compared to control group, 34 and 98 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated in 180 μM and 1800 μM H 2 O 2 treatments, respectively. On the other hand, 162 and 30 DEGs were downregulated in the 180 μM and 1800 μM H 2 O 2 treatments, respectively. Cluster analysis of DEGs demonstrated significant patterns among these types of 3 groups.

https://openalex.org/W3131304909,"Three studies tested the role of prioritization in solving conflict between multiple goals in different age groups. Study 1 ( N = 185 young, middle-aged, older adults) stressed the importance to solve two competing tasks equally well within a short time. Older adults prioritized more than younger adults. However, contrary to our expectations, prioritization led to higher perceived conflict, more negative affect, and less control. Study 2 ( N = 117 younger and older adults) found that, using a more lenient instruction, deemphasizing the importance of performing equally well on both tasks, prioritization was no longer associated with perceived goal conflict. Study 3 ( N = 721 young, middle-aged, older adults) was an online study using hypothetical scenarios. This study was run to substantiate the potential mechanism underlying the differences between Study 1 and 2 and supported the hypothesized effect of the instructional strictness of pursuing two goals. Thus, when encountering conflicting goals older adults prioritize more than younger adults, but prioritization might not be optimal for solving short-term goal conflict when both conflicting goals are equally important."
https://openalex.org/W3131922062,"Background Adolescents are vulnerable to various sexual and reproductive health (SRH) problems such as unintended pregnancy, HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unsafe abortion. Adolescent-friendly health services offer SRH services such as SRH counseling, contraceptive services, STI and HIV services, and abortion-related services, which may help prevent these risks. Parent–adolescent communication about SRH prevents adolescents from adopting unhealthy SRH practices. However, its association with the utilization of SRH services is less known. Therefore, this study examined the association between parent–adolescent communication on SRH issues and the utilization of adolescent-friendly health services in Nepal. Methods This was a school-based, cross-sectional study conducted in Kailali district, Nepal, among students aged 15–19 years in Grade 11 and 12 from seven schools. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the association between parent–adolescent communication and service utilization. Results We analyzed the data from 594 students. Students with a higher score of parent–adolescent communication on SRH were significantly more likely to use adolescent-friendly health services (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 1.70, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.29–2.23, p&lt;0.001). Those who reported having engaged in sexual intercourse in the past year were more likely to use services than those who did not (AOR: 29.11, 95% CI: 13.65–62.08, p&lt;0.001). Those who belonged to the Janajati ethnic group were more likely to use these services than those from the Brahmin/Chhetri ethnic group (AOR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.28–6.42, p = 0.01). Those living alone were less likely to use services than those living with both parents (AOR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02–0.66, p = 0.01). Conclusion Students with a higher score on parent–adolescent communication on SRH were more likely to use adolescent-friendly health services. Thus, parental involvement in SRH communication could contribute to the use of adolescent-friendly health services and ultimately prevent negative SRH outcomes among students in late adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3132199430,"Background Increased intra-abdominal pressure causes hemodynamic changes that may affect renal biomarkers. Methods This randomized, single-blind, single-center clinical trial recruited patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a tertiary care center in Brazil. They were randomly allocated to a standard intra-abdominal pressure group (P 10-12 , 10–12 mm Hg) and a low intra-abdominal pressure group (P 6-8 , 6–8 mm Hg). The primary outcome was the change in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C levels measured at the beginning of the procedure (T0), at the end of the procedure (T1), and 24 hours after the procedure (T2). P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results In total, 64 patients completed the study—33 were given standard pressure and 31 were given low pressure. There was no significant difference in the biomarker between the groups ( P = 0.580), but there was a significant difference between the time points with elevation at T1 ( P &lt; 0.001). Similar to NGAL, cystatin C had an elevation at T1 in both groups ( P = 0.021), but no difference was found when comparing the groups. Conclusions In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, pneumoperitoneum increases NGAL and cystatin C levels intraoperatively, and the use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum does not change the course of these biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3132968038,"Background This study aimed to illustrate the potential utility of a simple filter model in understanding the patient outcome and cost-effectiveness implications for depression interventions in primary care. Methods Modelling of hypothetical intervention scenarios during different stages of the treatment pathway was conducted. Results Three scenarios were developed for depression related to increasing detection, treatment response and treatment uptake. The incremental costs, incremental number of successes (i.e., depression remission) and the incremental costs-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. In the modelled scenarios, increasing provider treatment response resulted in the greatest number of incremental successes above baseline, however, it was also associated with the greatest ICER. Increasing detection rates was associated with the second greatest increase to incremental successes above baseline and had the lowest ICER. Conclusions The authors recommend utility of the filter model to guide the identification of areas where policy stakeholders and/or researchers should invest their efforts in depression management."
https://openalex.org/W3130760432,"Background Patients of congenital heart disease surgery have good prospects for reaching old age. Against the backdrop of increasing life expectancies, the question of how well such patients are mastering daily routines and their working life emerges. In our study, the educational and occupational performance of patients over 15 years was examined. Methods Intergenerational social mobility (changes in social positions from the parental generation to the generation of children) was examined in terms of education, and intragenerational social mobility (changes in positions within the same generation, i.e., in individuals over their life courses) was examined in terms of occupational positions. Comparisons were made between patients and a control group drawn from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Controls were drawn from respondents who participated in the 2004 and 2018 SOEP surveys. Results The data were from 244 out of 360 patients (68%) with complete social data from the first survey (2003–2004) and who were included in the follow-up (2017–2019), and 238 controls were drawn from the SOEP. At the time of the second survey, subjects’ ages ranged from 28 to 59 years of age (M = 40.1 years). Intergenerational educational mobility did not differ between cases and controls. For intragenerational social mobility, downward changes were more frequent among controls. This latter finding may be explained by patients retiring earlier than the general population. Retirement rates increased over time, particularly among patients with severe congenital malformations. Unemployment rates were also higher among patients. Conclusions Taken together, although a considerable proportion of patients with congenital heart disease retired prematurely or never entered the labour force, their educational and occupational careers proceeded more favourably than expected."
https://openalex.org/W3131147821,"Evasive entrepreneurship (circumvention and exploitation of institutions by entrepreneurs) is a prevalent practice in many developing economies. Extant literature on the topic falls short of providing adequate theories to explain its triggers, mechanisms, and consequences. Leveraging extensive survey data from the World Bank, we used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between evasive entrepreneurial behavior—tax evasion and bribery—and the relative payoff of such practices. Of the 2599 Nigerian entrepreneurs in our sample, the majority admitted to engaging in evasive entrepreneurship. The data suggest that institutional factors thought to constrain entrepreneurship in emerging markets are counter-intuitively perceived by founders as opportunities to earn large rents and improve firm performance. Our results emphasize the urgent need to eliminate institutional constraints that paradoxically enable the growth of evasive entrepreneurship in emerging economies. Our results also suggest that prevailing local conventions involving evasive behavior may motivate nascent entrepreneurs to imitate bribery and tax evasion, normalizing malfeasance as ‘best practice.’"
https://openalex.org/W3133365458,"Language is a result of brain function; thus, impairment in cognitive function can result in language disorders. Understanding the aging of brain functions in terms of language processing is crucial for modern aging societies. Previous studies have shown that language characteristics, such as verbal fluency, are associated with cognitive functions. However, the scaling laws in language in elderly people remain poorly understood. In the current study, we recorded large-scale data of one million words from group conversations among healthy elderly people and analyzed the relationship between spoken language and cognitive functions in terms of scaling laws, namely, Zipf’s law and Heaps’ law. We found that word patterns followed these scaling laws irrespective of cognitive function, and that the variations in Heaps’ exponents were associated with cognitive function. Moreover, variations in Heaps’ exponents were associated with the ratio of new words taken from the other participants’ speech. These results indicate that the exponents of scaling laws in language are related to cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W3129314528,"When one learns that current struggles or transgressions of an individual or group are rooted in an unfortunate history, one experiences compassion and reduced blame. Prior research has demonstrated this by having participants receive (or not) a concrete historicist narrative regarding the particular individual or group under consideration. Here, we take a different approach. We explore the possibility that everyday people show meaningful variation in a broad lay theory that we call lay historicism . Lay historicists believe that—as a general fact— people’s psychological characteristics and life outcomes are powerfully molded by their life histories . We present eight studies linking lay historicism to broad tendencies toward compassion and non-blaming. Collectively, Studies 1–5 suggest that lay historicism affects compassion and blame, respectively, via distinct mechanisms: (1) Lay historicism is associated with compassion because it creates a sense that—as a general fact—past suffering lies behind present difficulties, and (2) lay historicism is associated with blame mitigation because historicists reject the idea that—as a general fact—people freely and autonomously create their moral character. Thus, lay historicism increases compassion and decreases blame via distinct mechanisms. The remaining studies diversify our evidence base. Study 6 examines criminal justice philosophies rather than broad moral traits (as in the earlier studies) and shows that lay historicism is associated with preference for humane criminal justice philosophies. Study 7 moves from abstract beliefs to concrete situations and shows that lay historicism predicts reduced blaming of an irresponsible peer who is encountered face-to-face. One additional study—in our Supplemental Materials—shows that lay historicism predicts lower levels of blaming on implicit measures, although only among those who also reject lay controllability theories. Overall, these studies provide consistent support for the possibility that lay historicism is broadly associated with humane responding to the struggles and transgressions of others."
https://openalex.org/W3131038892,"This paper presents an adaptive approach to the federated filter for multi-sensor nonlinear systems with cross-correlations between process noise and local measurement noise. The adaptive Gaussian filter is used as the local filter of the federated filter for the first time, which overcomes the performance degradation caused by the cross-correlated noises. Two kinds of adaptive federated filters are proposed, one uses a de-correlation framework as local filter, and the subfilter of the other one is defined as a Gaussian filter with correlated noises at the same-epoch, and much effort is made to verify the theoretical equivalence of the two algorithms in the nonlinear fusion system. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are superior to the traditional federated filter and Gaussian filter with same-paced correlated noises, and the equivalence between the proposed algorithms and high degree cubature federated filter is also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W3131239688,"The question of when children understand that others have minds that can represent or misrepresent reality (i.e., possess a ‘Theory of Mind’) is hotly debated. This understanding plays a fundamental role in social interaction (e.g., interpreting human behavior, communicating, empathizing). Most research on this topic has relied on false belief tasks such as the ‘Sally-Anne Task’, because researchers have argued that it is the strongest litmus test examining one’s understanding that the mind can misrepresent reality. Unfortunately, in addition to a variety of other cognitive demands this widely used measure also unnecessarily involves overcoming a bias that is especially pronounced in young children—the ‘curse of knowledge’ (the tendency to be biased by one’s knowledge when considering less-informed perspectives). Three- to 6-year-old’s (n = 230) false belief reasoning was examined across tasks that either did, or did not, require overcoming the curse of knowledge, revealing that when the curse of knowledge was removed three-year-olds were significantly better at inferring false beliefs, and as accurate as five- and six-year-olds. These findings reveal that the classic task is not specifically measuring false belief understanding. Instead, previously observed developmental changes in children’s performance could be attributed to the ability to overcome the curse of knowledge. Similarly, previously observed relationships between individual differences in false belief reasoning and a variety of social outcomes could instead be the result of individual differences in the ability to overcome the curse of knowledge, highlighting the need to re-evaluate how best to interpret large bodies of research on false belief reasoning and social-emotional functioning."
https://openalex.org/W3132827672,"In this approach, the performance of a newly developed sensor probe coated with low-dimensional Co 3 O 4 /Yb 2 O 3 nanoparticles (NPs) in rapidly detecting 1,2-diaminobenzene was evaluated by an electrochemical technique. The sensor probe was fabricated by depositing a very thin layer consisting of synthesized Co 3 O 4 /Yb 2 O 3 NPs using a 5% Nafion conducting binder onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The facile hydrothermally prepared Co 3 O 4 /Yb 2 O 3 NPs were totally characterized by conventional methods such as FTIR, UV-vis, TEM, XPS, EDS, and XRD analyses. The fabricated chemical sensor probe was found to exhibit long-term activity, stability in electrochemical response, good sensitivity (5.6962 μAμM -1 cm -2 ), lowest detection limit (0.02±0.001 pM), and broad linear dynamic range (0.1 pM to 0.01 mM). The observed performances suggest that the newly introduced sensor could play an efficient role in detecting 1,2-diaminobenzene especially in healthcare and environmental applications on a broad scale."
https://openalex.org/W3130736283,"Background Although much has been documented about the performance of the health extension program, there is a lack of information on how efficiently the program is running. Furthermore, the rising cost of health services and the absence of competition among publicly owned health facilities demands strong follow up of efficiency. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the technical efficiency of the health posts and determinants in Southwestern Ethiopia. Methods and materials We used data for one Ethiopian fiscal year (from July 2016 to June 2017) to estimate the technical efficiency of health posts. A total of 66 health posts were included in the analysis. We employed a two-stage data envelopment analysis to estimate technical efficiency. At the first stage, technical efficiency scores were calculated using data envelopment analysis program version 2.1. Predictors of technical efficiency were then identified at the second stage using Tobit regression, with STATA version 14. Results The findings revealed that 21.2% were technically efficient with a mean technical efficiency score of 0.6 (± 0.3), indicating that health posts could increase their service volume by 36% with no change made to the inputs they received. On the other hand, health posts had an average scale efficiency score of 0.8 (± 0.2) implying that the facilities have the potential to increase service volume by 16% with the existing resources. The regression model has indicated average waiting time for service has negatively affected technical efficiency. Conclusion More than three-quarters of health posts were found inefficient. The technical efficiency score of more than one-third of the health posts is even less than 50%. Community mobilization to enhance the uptake of health services at the health posts coupled with a possible reallocation of resources in less efficient health posts is a possible approach to improve the efficiency of the program."
https://openalex.org/W3130873589,"The plastic hinge is a key factor in the ductile and plastic design of structures and an important basis for the seismic strengthening of structures. The formation and behavior of plastic hinges is critical for the seismic performance of an entire structure. The relocation of plastic hinges away from the beam end is an effective way of addressing brittle failure. In this paper, the cause of the shear buckling failure of prefabricated steel beams with corrugated webs and the strain variation at the flanges of steel beams are theoretically analyzed through structural tests. Based on the analysis results, a local strengthening method is proposed, and the effects of the beam sizes and the strengthening steel plate on the plastic hinges are obtained. In addition, a calculation method for determining the size of the strengthening steel plate that promotes the relocation of the plastic zone away from the beam end is given, a design method for plastic hinge relocation is proposed based on the test data, and its validity is verified."
