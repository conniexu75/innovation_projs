https://openalex.org/W1485281074,"We have purified the high molecular weight actin-binding protein, filamin from guinea pig vas deferens. We find this mammalian filamin is very similar to chicken gizzard filamin in subunit molecular weight, amnio acid composition, actin-binding properties, immunological cross-reactivity, and the ability to be phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Anti-filamin antibodies cross-react with a high molecular weight macrophage actin-binding protein, and with a high molecular weight protein in platelets and fibroblasts. Furthermore like filamin, these proteins are also phosphorylated and cyclic AMP stimulates their phosphorylation. Anti-filamin antibodies do not cross-react with the erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin or with high molecular weight proteins in brain extracts. We conclude that filamin from avian and mammalian smooth muscle are very similar proteins and furthermore that many, but not all, non-muscle cells contain a protein closely related to filamin."

https://openalex.org/W1603201974,"Ouabain-sensitive uptake of 86Rb+ (an analogue of K+) was enhanced in L-cells that had been treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol or 7-ketocholesterol in order to deplete their sterol concentration. Ouabain-insensitive Rb+ efflux also increased in the sterol-depleted cells and the intracellular concentration of K+ diminished while the concentration of Na+ increased. All of these effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol were counteracted by the addition of mevalonate to the culture medium. Despite the evidence for increased active Rb+ transport in the 25-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells, the level of sodium and potassium ion-activated adenosine triphosphatase ((Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase) activity measured in homogenates and plasma membrane preparations from the treated cells was not significantly different from the control values. Rb+ uptake was more sensitive to ouabain inhibition in sterol-depleted cells than in control cells, although ATPase activity in plasma membrane fractions isolated from treated cells was not more sensitive to ouabain inhibition than was that from control cells. It is possible that the ability of the oxygenated sterols to inhibit DNA synthesis and cell division (Kandutsch, A. A., and Chen, H. W. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 409-415) is related to their effects upon cellular ion transport."

https://openalex.org/W1588835435,"Abstract A random-hit matrix model is proposed to account for the dynamic and steady state relationship between occupation of bovine renal medullary membrane receptors by [Lys8]vasopressin (LVP) and neurohypophyseal hormones (NHH) and the associated activation of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. The model was developed by systematic introduction of specific rules concerning receptor coupling into a general structural model which consists of two square matrices of identical size, one composed of homogeneous R (receptor) units, the second of homogeneous (cyclase) units. R units are either occupied (RO) or unoccupied (RU); units are either active (CA) or inactive (CI). Hormone molecules are envisioned to collide with R units randomly; collision with RU leads to binding, and occupation is maintained for a characteristic mean occupancy time, TO. In this structure, each R unit has an which consists of the twin unit in the C matrix, and the 4 nearest neighbor units surrounding the twin. Occupation of an R unit leads to activation of all CI units in the interaction field of that R; CA units in the interaction field are refractory. Thus binding at a given R may recruit a variable number of inactive neighboring units (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0). The model requires that there be individual coupling delays between the moment of binding at a given R and subsequent activation of CI units (mean coupling delay (Td) approximately 10% To). Activation of units persists as long as the parent R is occupied and is maintained for an additional short time interval (Tp) after RO reverts to RU, corresponding to hormone dissociation from receptor. The model accounts for the following previously demonstrated relations between LVP occupation of receptors and adenylate cyclase activation in bovine renal medullary membranes: 1) the shape of the nonlinear steady state relation between normalized (percentage maximal) receptor occupation (O) and cyclase activation (A), uniformly observed in different membrane preparations: 2) variable hormone concentration-dependent trajectories of approach to the final steady state A:O value (A:Oss) which may be either monophasic or biphasic; 3) the loss of intrinsic adenylate cyclase activity observed in bovine membranes for a series of NHH analogs with progressively diminishing affinity for receptors. The model represents an explicit theory of coupling where a successive series of temporal events are quantitatively related to each other and privide major constraints to any interpretation of the molecular organization of receptors and adenylate cyclase units in membranes. The model excludes a number of mechanistic proposals and suggests a new hypothesis for membrane coupling with features which may be generally applicable to other hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems."

https://openalex.org/W1563061672,"Macromomycin is a protein isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces macromomyceticus. It is an antibiotic and also cytotoxic to a broad spectrum of carcinoma cells, the ID50 for P388 leukemia cells being 1 X 10(-9) M. Macromomycin binds rapidly and tightly to the P388 cell membrane and the eventual death of the cell cannot be reversed by either washing the toxin away or treating the cell with trypsin. The cytotoxicity does not appear to be specific for any phase of the P388 cell cycle. Macromomycin is a single polypeptide, pI 5.38, devoid of methionine and arginine residues and contains 4 cysteine residues joined by two intramolecular disulfide bonds. The cytotoxicity results in inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in P388, the latter inhibition occurring a few hours after the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. The antibiotic and antitumor activities are destroyed rapidly by ultraviolet light, which gives a product that differs little in amino acid composition, molecular weight, and antigenic property, but can be separated from the native macromomycin by ion exchange chromatography. It is proposed that macromomycin has an ultraviolet-sensitive prosthetic group upon which much of the biological activity is based."
