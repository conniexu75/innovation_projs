https://openalex.org/W2592130743,"Adverse reactions or lack of response to medications are important concerns for drug development programs. However, faithful predictions of drug metabolism and toxicity are difficult because animal models show only limited translatability to humans. Furthermore, current in vitro systems, such as hepatic cell lines or primary human hepatocyte (PHH) 2-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures, can be used only for acute toxicity tests because of their immature phenotypes and inherent instability. Therefore, the migration to novel phenotypically stable models is of prime importance for the pharmaceutical industry. Novel 3-dimensional (3D) culture systems have been shown to accurately mimic in vivo hepatic phenotypes on transcriptomic and proteomic level, but information about their metabolic stability is lacking. Using a combination of targeted and untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry, we found that PHHs in 3D spheroid cultures remained metabolically stable for multiple weeks, whereas metabolic patterns of PHHs from the same donors cultured as conventional 2D monolayers rapidly deteriorated. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic differences between donors were maintained in 3D spheroid cultures, enabling studies of interindividual variability in drug metabolism and toxicity. We conclude that the 3D spheroid system is metabolically stable and constitutes a suitable model for in vitro studies of long-term drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.-Vorrink, S.

Sporadic mutations of SMAD4 are present in 2.1–20.0% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) but data are limited. In this study, we aimed to evaluate clinicopathologic characteristics, prognosis, and clinical outcome associated with this mutation in CRC cases. Data for patients with metastatic or unresectable CRC who underwent genotyping for SMAD4 mutation and received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2000 to 2014 were reviewed. Their tumors were sequenced using a hotspot panel predicted to cover 80% of the reported SMAD4 mutations, and further targeted resequencing that included full-length SMAD4 was performed on mutated tumors using a HiSeq sequencing system. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas data on CRC, the characteristics of SMAD4 and transforming growth factor-β pathway mutations were evaluated according to different consensus molecular subtypes of CRC. Among 734 patients with CRC, 90 (12%) had SMAD4 mutations according to hotspot testing. SMAD4 mutation was associated with colon cancer more so than with rectal cancer (odds ratio 2.85; p<0.001), female sex (odds ratio 1.71; p = 0.02), and shorter overall survival than in wild-type SMAD4 cases (median, 29 months versus 56 months; hazard ratio 2.08; p<0.001 [log-rank test]). SMAD4 mutation was not associated with age, stage at presentation, colonic location, distant metastasis, or tumor grade. A subset of patients with metastatic CRC (n = 44) wild-type for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF who received anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy with mutated SMAD4 (n = 13) had shorter progression-free survival duration than did patients wild-type for SMAD4 (n = 31) (median, 111 days versus 180 days; p = 0.003 [log-rank test]). Full-length sequencing confirmed that missense mutations at R361 and P356 in the MH2 domain were the most common SMAD4 alterations. In The Cancer Genome Atlas data, SMAD4 mutation frequently occurred with KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations and was more common in patients with the consensus molecular subtype 3 of CRC than in those with the other 3 subtypes. This is one of the largest retrospective studies to date characterizing SMAD4 mutations in CRC patients and demonstrates the prognostic role and lack of response of CRC to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy. Further studies are required to validate these findings and the role of SMAD4 mutation in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2594744254,"Zinc is an essential nutrient for all forms of life. Within cells, most zinc is bound to protein. Because zinc serves as a catalytic or structural cofactor for many proteins, cells must maintain zinc homeostasis under severely zinc-deficient conditions. In yeast, the transcription factor Zap1 controls the expression of genes required for uptake and mobilization of zinc, but to date the fate of existing zinc-binding proteins under zinc starvation remains poorly understood. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation/recycling process in which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are sequestered for degradation in the vacuole/lysosome. In this study, we investigated how autophagy functions under zinc starvation. Zinc depletion induced non-selective autophagy, which is important for zinc-limited growth. Induction of autophagy by zinc starvation was not directly related to transcriptional activation of Zap1. Instead, TORC1 inactivation directed zinc starvation-induced autophagy. Abundant zinc proteins, such as Adh1, Fba1, and ribosomal protein Rpl37, were degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner. But the targets of autophagy were not restricted to zinc-binding proteins. When cellular zinc is severely depleted, this non-selective autophagy plays a role in releasing zinc from the degraded proteins and recycling zinc for other essential purposes.

When cellular zinc is severely depleted, this non-selective autophagy plays a role in releasing zinc from the degraded proteins and recycling zinc for other essential purposes. Autophagy is a conserved process in which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are sequestered for degradation within the vacuole/lysosome (1Klionsky D.J. Autophagy: from phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 2Ohsumi Y. Historical landmarks of autophagy research.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). During autophagy, cytoplasmic components are enwrapped by autophagosomes and delivered to the vacuole, where the contents are degraded by various hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases, lipases, nucleases, phosphatases, and glucosidases. The resultant compounds are transported out of the vacuole and recycled for use in biosynthesis and energy production. Autophagy plays important roles in multiple cellular processes (3Mizushima N. Physiological functions of autophagy.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 335: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Autophagy occurs constitutively at low levels, serving as an important means for quality control by removing excessive or damaged proteins and organelles. Nutrient starvation significantly stimulates autophagy, contributing to cell survival by recycling constituents and maintaining energy levels (4Rabinowitz J.D. White E. Autophagy and metabolism.Science. 2010; 330: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Several kinds of nutrient starvation stimulate autophagy, which is thought to provide nutrients from internal reservoirs when external nutrients are unavailable. Although bulk degradation via autophagy is principally a non-selective process, selective targeting of proteins and organelles by autophagy also plays important roles in cellular physiology (5Reggiori F. Komatsu M. Finley K. Simonsen A. Autophagy: more than a nonselective pathway.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2012; 2012219625Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To respond appropriately to environmental conditions, cells must respond to nutrient signals and make appropriate changes in their metabolism. In the face of severe depletion of several nutrients, cells arrest at the G1 stage of the cell cycle and remain in a quiescent state (6Hartwell L.H. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle.Bacteriol Rev. 1974; 38: 164-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, various forms of nutrient depletion also trigger autophagy (7Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Nitrogen starvation is one of the strongest of such stimuli, and autophagy is indispensable for recycling intracellular amino acids. Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) negatively regulates this process by phosphorylating Atg13, which plays a key role in inducing autophagy (8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Tor-mediated induction of autophagy via an Apg1 protein kinase complex.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In response to nitrogen deprivation, TORC1 is inactivated, resulting in dephosphorylation of Atg13. Dephosphorylated Atg13 forms a complex with Atg1 and its regulatory complex, Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 (9Kawamata T. Kamada Y. Kabeya Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y.

Previous reports showed that depletion of glucose, sulfate, and several amino acids also induces autophagy (7Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Other forms of nutrient starvation or stress might also invoke autophagy, but the mechanism and physiological roles of these diverse nutritional perturbations remain elusive. Transition metal ions such as iron, copper, zinc, and manganese are essential for life in all organisms. Most cellular zinc is tightly bound to proteins; consequently, the level of free zinc is predicted to be quite low. In most organisms, more than 5% of proteins bind zinc. Zinc serves as a catalytic and/or structural cofactor for many proteins. These include DNA or RNA polymerases, ribosomal proteins, transcription factors harboring zinc finger domains, central metabolic enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases, superoxide dismutase, and metalloproteases (13Regalla L.M. Lyons T.J. Tamas M.J. Martinoia E. Zinc in Yeast: Mechanisms Involved in Homeostasis, Topics in Current Genetics. Vol. 14. Springer, New York2006: 37-58Google Scholar). Given that zinc is widely incorporated into essential proteins, abnormal zinc homeostasis causes serious problems for the cell. Cells must maintain zinc homeostasis in the face of fluctuations in zinc availability. Pioneering work by Eide and co-workers (14Eide D.J. Homeostatic and adaptive responses to zinc deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18565-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealed the mechanisms of transcriptional control under zinc-depleted conditions. To overcome zinc deficiency, the transcription factor Zap1 activates its own transcription and controls the expression of genes needed for uptake and mobilization of zinc. However, the fate of existing zinc-binding proteins upon zinc starvation remains poorly understood. Recently, the same group performed a systematic analysis that revealed genes that are essential or important during zinc starvation (15North M. Steffen J. Loguinov A.V. Zimmerman G.R. Vulpe C.D. Eide D.J. Genome-wide functional profiling identifies genes and processes important for zinc-limited growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8e1002699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Among them, many ATG genes were identified, but the exact mechanism by which autophagy helps cells tolerate zinc starvation remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the function of autophagy under zinc starvation. To determine the relationship between zinc homeostasis and autophagy, we analyzed the growth of cells in synthetic defined medium (SD), 3The abbreviations used are: SDsynthetic dextrosePASpre-autophagosomal structureICP-MSinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometryTPENN,N,N,N-tetrakis-[2-pyridyl-methyl]ethylenediamine. lacking zinc [SD(−zinc)]. To minimize metabolic requirements, in this work we used strains derived from the prototrophic wild-type strain X2180. Cells were grown in SD to mid-log phase (optical density [OD600] about 1) and then transferred to SD or SD(−zinc) at an OD600 of 0.05. When cultured in SD(−zinc), cells grew slowly for about six generations, and then stopped growing. The observation that zinc was a limiting factor for cell growth is consistent with the fact that zinc provides structural and catalytic cofactors for many essential proteins. synthetic dextrose pre-autophagosomal structure inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry N,N,N,N-tetrakis-[2-pyridyl-methyl]ethylenediamine. Next, we compared the growth of the wild-type strain and autophagy-defective atg2Δ cells. In standard zinc-replete conditions (SD), atg2Δ cells grew at nearly the same rate as the wild-type strain. However, under zinc-free conditions (SD(−zinc)) impairment of growth was more severe in atg2Δ than in the wild type. As zinc starvation continued (>15 h), cell growth of atg2Δ cells began to slow further, and these cells plateaued at a lower density (Fig. 1A), suggesting that autophagy plays an important role in supporting growth under zinc-depleted conditions. It was not clear how autophagy contributes to growth when zinc is unavailable from the environment. To determine whether autophagy was induced during zinc starvation, we performed several experiments to monitor autophagy. Standard and quantitative assays using alkaline phosphatase (pho8Δ60) as an autophagic reporter (16Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Novel system for monitoring autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were not applicable for this purpose, because zinc is required for the enzymatic activity and stability of Pho8 (see below and Ref. 17Qiao W. Ellis C. Steffen J. Wu C.Y. Eide D.J. Zinc status and vacuolar zinc transporters control alkaline phosphatase accumulation and activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 320-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As an alternative, we examined autophagy by fluorescence microscopy using GFP-Atg8 as a marker. Most Atg proteins, including Atg8, localize to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) thought to be the site of autophagosomal formation (18Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. The pre-autophagosomal structure organized by concerted functions of APG genes is essential for autophagosome formation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In addition to starvation-induced autophagy, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a constitutive autophagy-like system, the Cvt pathway, for which Atg11 functions as the adaptor (19Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Mechanism of cargo selection in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, GFP-Atg8-positive dots represent the PAS for both the Cvt pathway and autophagy, whereas in atg11Δ cells the dots represent only autophagosome formation (9Kawamata T. Kamada Y. Kabeya Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Organization of the pre-autophagosomal structure responsible for autophagosome formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As autophagy proceeds, GFP-Atg8 is transported to the vacuole. Using this system, we asked whether autophagy was induced by zinc starvation. In atg11Δ cells, GFP-Atg8 was not observed at the PAS after 8 h of zinc starvation but clearly localized there at 15 h. At 24 h, GFP-Atg8 clearly stained vacuoles in both wild-type and atg11Δ cells, but not in atg2Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Next, we prepared lysates from these cells and assessed the time of initiation of autophagy by immunoblot analyses. Induction of GFP-Atg8 was apparent at 10 h, and processed GFP was detected at 16 h in both wild-type and atg11Δ cells but not in atg2Δ cells (Fig. 1C), which correlated well with microscopic observations (Fig. 1B). To further validate the results, we examined another autophagy marker, API, a selective cargo for Cvt pathway during vegetative growth, for which ATG11 is essential. When autophagy is induced, pro-API is transported to the vacuole via autophagosomes, where it is processed into its mature form in an Atg17-dependent manner. In atg11Δ cells, maturation of API was not detectable before 10 h, but after 16 h mature API was clearly present. Therefore, we concluded that autophagy is induced after roughly 15–16 h in our zinc-free medium. It should be noted that, relative to nitrogen starvation, in which autophagy is promptly induced, the induction of autophagy during zinc starvation was characterized by a delay (see below). Next, we tested the effects of a cell-permeant zinc chelator, N,N,N,N-tetrakis-[2-pyridyl-methyl]ethylenediamine (TPEN). Addition of TPEN to SD inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). High doses of TPEN (100 μm) completely inhibited growth of both wild-type and atg2Δ cells. By contrast, low doses of TPEN (5 μm) partially sustained cell growth. Under this condition, atg2Δ grew more slowly than the wild type, corresponding well to the strains' relative growth in SD(−zinc) (Fig. 1A). We next investigated whether TPEN treatment would induce autophagy by monitoring GFP-Atg8. In atg11Δ cells, GFP-Atg8 was not observed at the PAS at 4 h of TPEN treatment (Fig. 1E). However, at 8 h, GFP-Atg8 started to localize to the PAS, and after 10 h it was clearly observed within vacuoles. Compared with SD(−zinc), induction of autophagy was induced earlier, probably because the high dose of TPEN increased the severity of zinc starvation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the timing of autophagy induction in response to zinc depletion is variable, depending on the degree of cellular zinc deficiency. We next investigated whether selective autophagy would function under zinc-free conditions. Like atg2Δ, cells deleted for ATG1 or ATG17 had growth defects (Fig. 1F). By contrast, deletion of ATG11 or ATG19, both of which are responsible for selective autophagy, had little effect on growth. Autophagic degradation requires Pep4 and Prb1, both of which are vacuolar proteases, and their absence causes accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuole. Similar growth defects were observed in pep4Δ cells, suggesting that degradation of autophagosome contents, rather than sequestration per se, is required to support growth. Therefore, we concluded that non-selective bulk autophagy is essential for zinc-deficient growth. Furthermore, we performed electron microscopy to further characterize the mode of autophagy induced by zinc starvation. Many autophagic bodies accumulated in pep4Δprb1Δ, but not pep4Δprb1Δatg2Δ, after zinc starvation for 28 h (Fig. 1G). In the vacuoles of pep4Δprb1Δ cells, we observed autophagic bodies containing cytosolic ribosomes, as well as some mitochondrion-related structures. Based on the ultrastructural analyses, we concluded that non-selective autophagy is induced under zinc starvation. As mentioned above, the initiation of autophagy under zinc starvation is delayed. To investigate whether zinc starvation would result in limitation of some other nutrient that is the true trigger for autophagy, we took several approaches to determine whether induction of autophagy is induced by limitation of zinc per se. First, we used ICP-MS analysis to measure cellular zinc and other divalent cations (iron and copper) before and after transfer to zinc-free medium. Wild-type and atg2Δ cells had similar ion content before zinc starvation (Fig. 2A, 0 h). After zinc starvation for 24 h, zinc levels dropped in both cells (Fig. 2A, 24 h), whereas the level of copper increased, and the iron level remained almost constant. Therefore, our zinc-free medium specifically decreased the cellular content of zinc but did not decrease the levels of copper and iron. Second, we measured the concentration of glucose in the media. A significant level of glucose (more than 1.5%) persisted in zinc-free media for up to 24 h, indicating that induction of autophagy was not caused by glucose limitation (Fig. 2B). Third, we added excess glucose, ammonium sulfate, amino acids, or a mixture of the latter two nitrogenous compounds to zinc-free medium and examined the influence of these nutrients on induction of autophagy. Indeed, neither GFP-Atg8 localization to the PAS nor its transport to the vacuole were affected by the presence of these nutrients (Fig. 2C, left). Furthermore, even if each nutrient was introduced after 15 h of zinc starvation, autophagy was still induced without any delay (Fig. 2C, right). Finally, we asked whether zinc starvation-induced autophagy would be abolished by supplementation with zinc. When zinc was introduced at 15 h, by which autophagy had already been induced, GFP-Atg8 localization to the PAS disappeared within 30 min (Fig. 2D). On the contrary, nitrogen starvation-induced autophagy was unresponsive to zinc supplementation (Fig. 2E). Therefore, we concluded that autophagy induced in zinc-free medium is primarily triggered by depletion of zinc per se, not due to limitation of some other nutrient, such as glucose or amino acids. The transcriptional response to zinc-limited conditions has been extensively studied (14Eide D.J. Homeostatic and adaptive responses to zinc deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18565-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In response to zinc deficiency, Zap1 senses cellular zinc status and regulates expression of many target genes, including ZAP1 itself. Among the targets of Zap1 are genes encoding zinc transporters, as well as factors involved in mobilization of zinc from the vacuole. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the Zap1-mediated transcriptional response and autophagy. In our zinc-free media, Zap1 was clearly up-regulated after 3–6 h of zinc starvation (Fig. 3A). In addition, we monitored the expression of Adh1 and Adh4, both of which are Zap1-targeted alcohol dehydrogenases. Under standard nutrient conditions, Adh1 is highly expressed and functions as a major alcohol dehydrogenase, whereas Adh4 expression is almost undetectable. Upon zinc starvation, they exhibit the opposite expression patterns: Zap1 induces expression of ADH4 but shuts off that of ADH1 (20Bird A.J. Gordon M. Eide D.J. Winge D.R. Repression of ADH1 and ADH3 during zinc deficiency by Zap1-induced intergenic RNA transcripts.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5726-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given that Adh1 binds two zinc atoms, and Adh4 is predicted to use iron or alternatively one zinc atom, it is possible that cells can free zinc for other essential functions by switching isozymes (14Eide D.J. Homeostatic and adaptive responses to zinc deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18565-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we examined the expression of Adh1 and Adh4. Consistent with Zap1 expression, Adh1 was down-regulated, and Adh4 was up-regulated after 6 h of zinc starvation (Figs. 3, A and B, and 5A). Deletion of ATG2 did not affect the Zap1-mediated response, indicating that autophagy does not perturb regulation of Zap1. Conversely, we investigated whether deletion of ZAP1 would affect autophagy. In zap1Δ cells, autophagy was induced earlier (4–8 h) than in wild-type cells (15 h) (Figs. 1B and 3C), as with TPEN treatment (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these observations elucidate the regulation of zinc homeostasis under zinc starvation (Fig. 3B). During the early steps of zinc starvation, cells transcriptionally up-regulate Zap1 and its target genes. Subsequently, if severely zinc-depleted conditions persist, non-selective autophagy is induced to support growth.Figure 5Autophagy enables cells to scavenge zinc by degrading abundant proteins. A–C, cells in 0.5-ml aliquots of SD (−zinc) were collected at the indicated time points. Note that as equivalent volumes of cell culture were sampled for this experiment, protein loading increases with each time point as cell density increases with growth. Therefore, equivalent band intensities of Adh1 actually represent the degradation of this protein over time.

Western blotting was performed as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given that autophagy was not directly linked to Zap, we sought to identify the signal that induces autophagy upon zinc starvation. First, we examined the phosphorylation of Atg13, with or without zinc, as a function of TORC1 activity. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Atg13 is generally estimated by assessing the mobility shift of the protein by immunoblotting (8Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Tor-mediated induction of autophagy via an Apg1 protein kinase complex.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Up to 7 h of zinc starvation, Atg13 migration was slow, but after 15 h the migration of the protein was strikingly faster (Fig. 4A). Phosphatase treatment diminished the slower migrating (0 h) and faster migrating (15 h) forms of Atg13 (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the observed mobility shift is caused by phosphorylation and that Atg13 is hypo-phosphorylated after 15 h of zinc starvation. When zinc was supplied to zinc-starved cells, Atg13 returned to the hyperphosphorylated state within 5 min (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, cycloheximide did not affect the recovery of phosphorylation, indicating that the hyperphosphorylation was not due to de novo synthesis of Atg13. To confirm this observation, we investigated Sch9, a physiological substrate of TORC1. Zinc starvation for 15 h caused dephosphorylation of Sch9 (Fig. 4D). Moreover, as with Atg13, this modification was quickly reversed following the addition of zinc (Fig. 4D). To validate that TORC1 inactivation is involved in the induction of autophagy, we performed an experiment using a hyperactive Tor1 mutant, TORL2134M. It was previously shown that TOR1L2134M, which has a point mutation within the kinase domain, significantly delayed inactivation of TORC1 under nitrogen limitation, as judged by phosphorylation of Sch9 (21Takahara T. Maeda T. Transient sequestration of TORC1 into stress granules during heat stress.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 242-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether autophagy is blocked or delayed in TOR1L2134M cells under zinc starvation. We examined autophagy using TOR1WT and TOR1L2134M cells at 0, 14, and 23 h of zinc starvation and found that TOR1L2134M cells showed delayed autophagic activity compared with TOR1WT cells (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, TOR1L2134M cells showed reduced extent of autophagy. Therefore, it is likely that TORC1 inactivation triggers zinc starvation-induced autophagy via dephosphorylation of Atg13. To date, the effect of transcriptional shut off of ADH1 by Zap1 on Adh1 protein level has not been investigated in detail. Because Adh1 is one of the most abundant zinc proteins, it serves as an effective reservoir of zinc, which could be exploited by the cell when zinc is required. To determine whether Adh1 is degraded by autophagy, we constructed wild-type and atg2Δ cells chromosomally expressing Adh1-GFP under the control of its own promoter. To chase Adh1-GFP, we monitored the amounts of Adh1-GFP before and after zinc starvation in 0.5-ml aliquots of cell culture. In wild-type cells, Adh1-GFP was subjected to degradation after 15 h of starvation (Fig. 5A), and after 48 h about half of Adh1-GFP was degraded. In atg2Δ cells, however, the amount of Adh1-GFP was unchanged. To validate this result, we monitored the level of endogenous Adh1 using anti-Adh1 antibody (Fig. 5, A–C). As with Adh1-GFP, a significant amount of Adh1 was degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A–C). Next, we investigated Adh4-GFP. Although expression of ADH4 was positively regulated by Zap1 (Fig. 3A), a significant portion of Adh4-GFP was inevitably targeted to degradation via autophagy. We hypothesized that zinc-binding proteins may be preferential targets for destruction via autophagy. To explore this idea, we monitored two abundant glycolytic proteins, Fba1 and Pgk1, the former of which is a zinc protein. We constructed wild-type and atg2Δ cells chromosomally expressing Fba1-GFP and Pgk1-GFP under the control of the native promoters. Not only Fba1-GFP but also Pgk1-GFP were degraded by autophagy (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the kinetics of degradation of these proteins were almost identical, suggesting that zinc starvation-induced autophagy does not specifically target zinc-binding proteins. Our EM analyses showed that large quantities of ribosomes were sequestered in autophagic bodies (Fig. 1G). Ribosomes are highly abundant structures, and cellular ribosome contents correlate closely with growth rate. Structural analyses of ribosomes revealed that each ribosome binds at least eight zinc ions (22Garreau de Loubresse N. Prokhorova I. Holtkamp W. Rodnina M.V. Yusupova G. Yusupov M. Structural basis for the inhibition of the eukaryotic ribosome.Nature. 2014; 513: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), indicating that ribosomes are a potentially rich source of zinc. Accordingly, we investigated whether ribosomal zinc proteins were degraded by autophagy. To this end, we focused on Rpl37, which has been structurally validated as a zinc finger protein (13Regalla L.M. Lyons T.J. Tamas M.J. Martinoia E. Zinc in Yeast: Mechanisms Involved in Homeostasis, Topics in Current Genetics. Vol. 14. Springer, New York2006: 37-58Google Scholar, 23Ben-Shem A. Garreau de Loubresse N. Melnikov S. Jenner L. Yusupova G. Yusupov M. The structure of the eukaryotic ribosome at 3.0 Å resolution.Science. 2011; 334: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Because yeast has two genes encoding L37, RPL37A and RPL37B, we tagged both proteins with GFP. Both proteins were also degraded by autophagy (Fig. 5C). Based on these findings, we speculate that by degrading major zinc-binding proteins and ribosomes via autophagy, cells can liberate zinc for other essential uses. To further test the idea that autophagy increases the bioavailability of zinc under severe starvation, we focused on Pho8, a vacuolar phosphatase/nucleotidase (24Kaneko Y. Hayashi N. Toh-e A.

https://openalex.org/W2594710689,"Background Cognitive problems in breast cancer patients are common after systemic treatment, particularly chemotherapy. An increasing number of fMRI studies show altered brain activation in breast cancer patients after treatment, suggestive of neurotoxicity. Previous prospective fMRI studies administered a single cognitive task. The current study employed two task paradigms to evaluate whether treatment-induced changes depend on the probed cognitive domain. Methods Participants were breast cancer patients scheduled to receive systemic treatment (anthracycline-based chemotherapy +/- endocrine treatment, n = 28), or no systemic treatment (n = 24) and no-cancer controls (n = 31). Assessment took place before adjuvant treatment and six months after chemotherapy, or at similar intervals. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation and performance were measured during an executive functioning task and an episodic memory task. Group-by-time interactions were analyzed using a flexible factorial design. Results Task performance did not differ between patient groups and did not change over time. Breast cancer patients who received systemic treatment, however, showed increased parietal activation compared to baseline with increasing executive functioning task load compared to breast cancer patients who did not receive systemic treatment. This hyperactivation was accompanied by worse physical functioning, higher levels of fatigue and more cognitive complaints. In contrast, in breast cancer patients who did not receive systemic treatment, parietal activation normalized over time compared to the other two groups. Conclusions Parietal hyperactivation after systemic treatment in the context of stable levels of executive task performance is compatible with a compensatory processing account of hyperactivation or maintain adequate performance levels. This over-recruitment of brain regions depends on the probed cognitive domain and may represent a response to decreased neural integrity after systemic treatment. Overall these results suggest different neurobehavioral trajectories in breast cancer patients depending on treatment type."

Recently developed clinical practice guidelines from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group have harmonized definitions of AKI, but have not been widely applied to patients receiving colistin.We retrospectively defined AKI by KDIGO definitions among adult patients receiving intravenous colistin for ≥ 3 days. Risk factors for AKI within 48 hours and 7 days of initiating colistin were determined by multivariable logistic regression.Among 249 patients treated with colistin, rates of AKI were 12% and 29% at 48 hours and 7 days, respectively. At 48 hours, patients in the intensive care unit were at increased risk for AKI. Within 7 days, colistin daily doses >5mg/kg, chronic liver disease, and concomitant vancomycin were independent predictors. Seven percent of patients required renal replacement therapy at a median of 5 days (range: 3-7) following colistin initiation.Safe use of colistin is promoted by early detection of AKI with KDIGO criteria, avoiding nephrotoxins, and limiting duration of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2593791875,"Intensive fishing can strongly impact marine ecosystems; among other things, it usually causes the mean trophic level of the catches to decline, an indicator of the occurrence of the 'fishing down' (FD) phenomenon. Although FD occurs throughout the world oceans, it can easily be masked by diverse factors, which has misled authors as to its generality. In this contribution, which uses the East China Sea as an example, we explore the masking effect on FD of the taxonomic coarseness of catch data, of assuming that individual sizes remain constant after intensive fishing, and the geographic expansion of fisheries. The result showed that all of these masking factors occur in the East China Sea, where only a few species are reported separately and the bulk of the catch is pooled into non-informative 'mixed fishes'. Also, the small mesh sizes and intensive fishing have reduced the sizes of fish and their trophic levels, while the fisheries have expanded offshore. Overall, taking the masking factors into account, the fishing down effect, i.e., the decline of the mean trophic level of the catch between 1979 and 2014 is in the order of 0.15 TL per decade, i.e., one of the highest estimates of FD in the world. Some ecological implications are presented."

From 2009 to 2011, 101 Norwegian patients were recruited. Stool swabs and questionnaires were collected every three months for one year and at the end of the study in 2012. Information on antibiotic prescriptions was collected from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Stool samples were cultured directly on ChromID ESBL agar as well as in an enrichment broth, and culture positive isolates were examined by blaCTX-M multiplex PCR. Isolates without blaCTX-M were investigated for alternative ESBL-determinants with a commercial microarray system. Time to fecal clearance of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae was also analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare groups according to previously described risk factors. The ESBL point prevalence of fecal carriage were 61% at 4 months, 56% at 7 months, 48% at 10 months, 39% at 13 months, 19% after two years, and 15% after three years or more. We found no correlation between duration of carriage, comorbidity, antibiotic use or travel to ESBL high-prevalence countries. Prolonged carriage was associated with E. coli isolates of phylogroup B2 or D. Importantly, comparative MLST and MLVA analyses of individual paired urine and fecal E. coli isolates revealed that ESBL production commonly occurred in diverse strains within the same host. When investigating cross-transmission of ESBL producing bacteria in health care institutions, this notion should be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2593173902,"The goal of this study is to investigate associations between subjective memory complaint and objective cognitive performance in older people with previous major depression–a high-risk sample for cognitive impairment and later dementia. A cross-sectional study was carried out in people aged 60 or over with previous major depression but not fulfilling current major depression criteria according to DSM-IV-TR. People with dementia or Mini-Mental State Examination score less than 17 were excluded. Subjective memory complaint was defined on the basis of a score ≧4 on the subscale of Geriatric Mental State schedule, a maximum score of 8. Older people aged equal or over 60 without any psychiatric diagnosis were enrolled as healthy controls. Cognitive function was evaluated using a series of cognitive tests assessing verbal memory, attention/speed, visuospatial function, verbal fluency, and cognitive flexibility in all participants. One hundred and thirteen older people with previous major depression and forty-six healthy controls were enrolled. Subjective memory complaint was present in more than half of the participants with depression history (55.8%). Among those with major depression history, subjective memory complaint was associated with lower total immediate recall and delayed verbal recall scores after adjustment. The associations between subjective memory complaint and worse memory performance were stronger in participants with lower depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score<7). The results suggest subjective memory complaint may be a valid appraisal of memory performance in older people with previous major depression and consideration should be given to more proactive assessment and follow-up in these clinical samples."

https://openalex.org/W2593457525,"Microbiological contamination of retrieved tissues has become a very important topic and a critical aspect in the safety of allografts. We have analysed contamination in 11,129 tissues with a longitudinal contamination profile for each individual tissue. More specifically, 10,035 musculoskeletal tissues and 1,094 cardiovascular tissues were retrieved from a total of 763 multi-tissue donors, of whom 105 were heart-beating donors as well as organ donors, while the remaining 658 were non-heart beating donors and tissue donors only. All tissues were decontaminated twice, the first time immediately after retrieval and the second time after processing. Each tissue was submitted to microbiological culture three times, i.e., upon retrieval (Time 1), after the first decontamination (Time 2) and after the second decontamination (Time 3). The contamination rate for musculoskeletal tissues was 52%, 16.2% and 0.5% at Time 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The contamination rate for cardiovascular tissues was 84%, 42% and 6%. More than one strain was simultaneously present in 10.8% of musculoskeletal tissues and 44.6% of cardiovascular tissues. Out of 8,560 non-heart-beating donor musculoskeletal tissues, 4,689 (54.8%), 1,383 (16.2%) and 42 (0.5%) were contaminated at Time 1, Time 2 and Time 3, respectively. Out of 1,475 heart-beating donor musculoskeletal tissues, 522 (35.4%) 113 (7.7%) and 2 (0.1%) tissues were found to be contaminated at Time 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Design Retrospective cohort study Setting Midwestern United States quaternary referral center Population Singleton pregnancies undergoing second trimester anatomic survey from 1999–2009. Pregnancies with incomplete follow-up were excluded. Methods Candidate predictors were identified from the literature and univariate analysis. Backward stepwise logistic regression with statistical comparison of model discrimination, calibration and clinical performance was used to generate final models for the prediction of stillbirth. Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions. A stillbirth risk calculator and stillbirth risk score were developed for the prediction of stillbirth at or beyond 32 weeks excluding fetal anomalies and aneuploidy. Statistical and clinical cut-points were identified and the tools compared using the Integrated Discrimination Improvement. Main outcome measures Antepartum stillbirth Results 64,173 women met inclusion criteria. The final stillbirth risk calculator and score included maternal age, black race, nulliparity, body mass index, smoking, chronic hypertension and pre-gestational diabetes. The stillbirth calculator and simple risk score demonstrated modest discrimination but clinically significant performance with no difference in overall performance between the tools [(AUC 0.66 95% CI 0.60–0.72) and (AUC 0.64 95% CI 0.58–0.70), (p = 0.25)]. Conclusion A stillbirth risk score was developed incorporating maternal risk factors easily ascertained during prenatal care to determine an individual woman’s risk for stillbirth and provide an evidenced based approach to the initiation of antenatal testing for the prediction and prevention of stillbirth."

These indicate that Tg and the analogues are bound via the Tg scaffold but with lower affinity to the same homologous cavity as on the membrane surface of SERCA1a. The lower Tg affinity may depend on a more flexible binding cavity in SPCA1a, with low contributions of the Tg O-3, O-8, and O-10 chains to the binding energy. Conversely, the protein interaction of the Tg O-2 side chain with SPCA1a appears comparable with that of SERCA1a.

The inhibition of SPCA1a by Tg may give rise to some concerns in connection with the clinical use of Tg analogues that target SERCA for prostate cancer therapy. In this therapeutic approach, a non-toxic, cell-impermeable pro-drug is administered that consists of a Tg analogue, which is coupled to a peptide that is specifically cleaved by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protease (26Denmeade S.R.

Extracellular cleavage of the peptide by local PSA in or near the prostate cancer releases the toxic Tg analogue Leu-8ADT, which is taken up by neighboring PSA-excreting cancer cells inducing targeted cell death (27Doan N.T.

The estimated 3 orders of magnitude difference in the binding affinity of Tg for SERCA and SPCA may be considered sufficiently discriminatory to enable the use of Tg analogues for selective SERCA inhibition in vitro and in vivo. However, it remains unclear whether this is also true for other Tg analogues. Toward the design of Tg analogues for clinical therapy related to SPCA dysfunction (see “Discussion”), we wanted to understand the off-target effect of Tg on SPCA1a, the closest relative of SERCA, by determining the structure-activation relationship (SAR) of Tg for SPCA1a. Moreover, due to the reported micromolar affinity of Tg to SPCA1 (24Dode L. Andersen J.P. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Missiaen L. Vilsen B. Wuytack F. Dissection of the functional differences between human secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase (SPCA) 1 and 2 isoenzymes by steady-state and transient kinetic analyses.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3182-3189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), one might consider Tg as a possible lead compound for the development of an SPCA1a inhibitor. Insights in the SAR of Tg for SPCA1a may aid the design of specific SPCA1a inhibitors as powerful pharmacological tools. In this study, we purified the human SPCA1a isoform from a yeast recombinant expression system and reconstituted it into lipid vesicles. This purified system eliminates the influence of other membrane-bound contaminants or Ca2+-ATPases, allowing the biochemical characterization of SPCA1a relative to purified and reconstituted SERCA1a. In particular, we demonstrate that SPCA1a activity is sensitive to the lipid environment, and we show that Tg and cholesteric compound sensitivity of SPCA1a may depend on the same or the overlapping binding pocket formed by transmembrane helices M3, M5, and M7. Finally, we have established the SAR of Tg for SPCA1a to facilitate the design of more selective SPCA inhibitors. The relatively low expression level of SPCA1a in native tissues, typically in a background of high SERCA expression, hampers biochemical analysis of SPCA1a. As an alternative approach, we purified His8-tagged human SPCA1a via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography from S. cerevisiae, which serves as an excellent model system to produce and purify P-type transport ATPases (8Ton V.K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. Functional expression in yeast of the human secretory pathway Ca2+, Mn2+-ATPase defective in Hailey-Hailey disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis reveals that SPCA1a monomer and dimer bands were highly enriched in the elution fractions (Fig. 1A). Using mass spectrometry, we observed a molecular mass of 101.8 kDa, close to the predicted molecular mass of 101.7 kDa and high purity (>95%) of the human SPCA1a (Fig. 1B). The concentrated His-tagged SPCA1a in the elution fraction was further demonstrated by immunoblotting with SPCA1 (Fig. 1C) and His tag (Fig. 1D)-specific antibodies. We found that purified and lipid-free SPCA1a became reversibly inactivated in detergent solution (Fig. 2E). This we considered to be a result of either a removal of specific lipid component(s) essential for activity or loss of physical membrane constraints originally imposed by the membrane lipids. To restore a functional lipid environment, we reconstituted as described under “Experimental procedures” the proteoliposomes from detergent-solubilized SPCA1a by addition of defined lipid components, followed by removal of detergent with Bio-beads. For this, 600 μg of phosphatidylcholine (PC) was first mixed with 200 μg of purified and detergent-solubilized SPCA1a (i.e. the protein was solubilized with detergent at a lipid/protein ratio of 3:1, w/w). The efficiency of SPCA1a incorporation into liposomes was compared for three types of detergents, i.e. Triton X-100 (PC/Triton X-100 = 8:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1 (w/w)), n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (PC/DDM = 1:1 (mol/mol)), and octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8) (PC/C12E8 = 1:2 (w/w)), in line with already established protocols for SERCA1a (28Rigaud J.L.

How to make tubular crystals by reconstitution of detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase.Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2545-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reconstitution with Triton X-100 rendered the most efficient incorporation of SPCA1a into proteoliposomes, especially at a high lipid to detergent ratio (Fig. 2A). Importantly, we were able to recover the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of the purified SPCA1a reconstituted with Triton X-100 or DDM but not with C12E8. Moreover, we determined that a lipid/detergent ratio of 20:1 generated the most active SPCA1a in proteoliposomes (Fig. 2B). Therefore, all further reconstitutions were carried out with a lipid/protein/detergent weight ratio of 60:20:3. Membrane proteins are functionally adapted to the local lipid environment of their cellular membranes. We therefore analyzed the impact of different lipid types on the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of SPCA1a, which in human colon adenocarcinoma cells is sensitive to cholesterol (CL) and is preferentially associated with lipid rafts (30Baron S. Vangheluwe P. Sepúlveda M.R. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Vanoevelen J. The secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1 is associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains of human colon adenocarcinoma cells.Biochim.

For reconstitution, various phospholipids (Fig. 2C), CL, sphingomyelin (SM), or a combination of the latter two (SM + CL) (Fig. 2D) were supplied together with PC, and SPCA1a ATPase activity was assessed. Compared with PC alone, the presence of phosphatidic acid (PA), SM, or SM/CL slightly but significantly enhanced activity, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lowered the SPCA1a ATPase activity. In further experiments, PA was routinely added during SPCA1a reconstitution, as has been done previously for SERCA1a reconstitution (29Young H.S. Rigaud J.L. Lacapère J.J. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L.

Next, we directly compared the biochemical properties of purified and reconstituted SPCA1a (4:1 PC/PA ratio) and SERCA1a, the skeletal muscle Ca2+-transport ATPase, which was purified and reconstituted according to a well established protocol (29Young H.S.

Compared with SERCA1a, SPCA1a displays a higher apparent Ca2+ affinity (Km of 0.125 ± 0.004 and 0.088 ± 0.005 μm, respectively) and a 5-fold lower turnover rate (Vmax of 12.29 ± 0.13 and 2.54 ± 0.04 nmol of Pi/μg/min), in line with previous reports (21Dode L. Andersen J.P. Raeymaekers L. Missiaen L. Vilsen B. Wuytack F.

Chem. 2005; 280: 39124-39134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although we previously reported that SPCA1a and SERCA1a respond differently to CL (30Baron S. Vangheluwe P. Sepúlveda M.R. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Vanoevelen J. The secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1 is associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains of human colon adenocarcinoma cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we observed here little functional effects of incorporating 20% CL upon reconstitution. However, by replacing CL with cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS), a more soluble cholesterol derivative (Fig. 2F), we found that it affected both the reconstituted SPCA1a or SERCA1a activities (Fig. 2G). SERCA1a displayed a concentration-dependent inhibition by CHEMS with an IC50 (defined as the concentration that leads to 50% inhibition of activity) of 8.8 ± 0.66 μm and a maximal inhibition of 80% at around 100 μm. For SPCA1a, a slight and not significant activation up to 106% was observed at lower concentrations, whereas higher concentrations above 6 μm impaired SPCA1a to a maximal inhibition of 47% at 300 μm, in line with the previous observation that SPCA1a and SERCA1a respond differently to CL (30Baron S. Vangheluwe P. Sepúlveda M.R. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Vanoevelen J. The secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1 is associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains of human colon adenocarcinoma cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because two endogenous lipids oleamide and linoleamide have recently been reported to be inhibitors of SPCA2 (34Yamamoto S. Takehara M. Kabashima Y. Fukutomi T. Ushimaru M. Identification of novel inhibitors of human SPCA2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 477: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we tested here whether these lipids also modify SPCA1a or SERCA1a activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Up to 1 mm, oleamide only partially inhibited SPCA1a and SERCA1a (Fig. 3A), whereas complete inhibition was previously reported for SPCA2 (34Yamamoto S. Takehara M. Kabashima Y. Fukutomi T. Ushimaru M. Identification of novel inhibitors of human SPCA2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 477: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast to SERCA1a, linoleamide fully inhibited SPCA1a with an IC50 of 30 μm (Fig. 3B), which is 8-fold higher than the value that has been reported for SPCA2 (34Yamamoto S. Takehara M.

A prospective study was carried out and patients who underwent ACSS from March 2014 to August 2014 in our hospital were included in this study. A self-designed dysphagia questionnaire was delivered to all of the patients from the first day to the fifth day after ACSS. Perioperative characteristics of patients were recorded, and incidences and risk factors of dysphagia were analyzed. A total of 104 patients who underwent ACSS were included and incidences of dysphagia from the first to the fifth day after ACSS was 87.5%, 79.81%, 62.14%, 50% and 44.23%, respectively. There was a good correlation between the new dysphagia scoring system and Bazaz scoring system (P < 0.001). Operative time and body mass index (BMI) were the risk factors for dysphagia during the first to the second day postoperatively. However, the dC2-C7angle was the main risk factor for dysphagia from the third to the fifth day after surgery. There were comparatively high incidences of early dysphagia after ACSS, which may be ascribed to operative time, BMI and the dC2-C7 angle."

To better understand factors associated with high VL, we examined characteristics of patients presenting for treatment in Hanoi, Vietnam. We examined baseline data from the Viral Load Monitoring in Vietnam Study, a randomized controlled trial of routine VL monitoring in a population starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a clinic in Hanoi. Patients with prior treatment failure or ART resistance were excluded. Characteristics examined included demographics, clinical and laboratory data, and substance use. Logistic regression was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Out of 636 patients, 62.7% were male, 72.9% were ≥30 years old, and 28.3% had a history of drug injection. Median CD4 was 132 cells/mm3, and 34.9% were clinical stage IV. Active cigarette smoking was reported by 36.3% with 14.0% smoking >10 cigarettes per day. Alcohol consumption was reported by 20.1% with 6.1% having ≥5 drinks per event. Overall 53.0% had a VL >100,000 cp/ml. Male gender, low body weight, low CD4 count, prior TB, and cigarette smoking were associated with high VL. Those who smoked 1–10 cigarettes per day were more likely to have high VL (aOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.15–3.45), while the smaller number of patients who smoked >10 cigarettes per day had a non-significant trend toward higher VL (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.75–2.66). Alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with high VL. Tobacco use is increasingly recognized as a contributor to premature morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients. In our study, cigarette smoking in the last 30 days was associated with a 1.5 to 2-fold higher odds of having an HIV VL >100,000 cp/ml among patients presenting for ART. These findings provide further evidence of the negative effects of tobacco use among HIV-infected patients."

Lately, the occurrence of spontaneous tendon ruptures or tendinosis have suggested a negative influence of statins upon tendon tissue. But how statins might influence tendons is not clear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of statin treatment on mechanical strength, cell proliferation, collagen content and gene expression pattern in a tendon-like tissue made from human tenocytes in vitro. Human tendon fibroblasts were grown in a 3D tissue culture model (tendon constructs), and treated with either simvastatin or atorvastatin, low or high dose, respectively, for up to seven days. After seven days of treatment, mechanical testing of the constructs was performed. Collagen content and cell proliferation were also determined. mRNA levels of several target genes were measured after one or seven days. The maximum force and stiffness were reduced by both statins after 7 days (p<0.05), while the cross sectional area was unaffected. Further, the collagen content was reduced by atorvastatin (p = 0.01) and the cell proliferation rate was decreased by both types of statins (p<0.05). Statin treatment also introduced increased mRNA levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP-1 and decreased levels of collagen type 1 and 3. In conclusion, statin treatment appears to have a negative effect on tendon matrix quality as seen by a reduced strength of the tendon constructs. Further, activated catabolic changes in the gene expression pattern and a reduced collagen content indicated a disturbed balance in matrix production of tendon due to statin administration."

In this study we firstly investigated the effect of lead prenatal exposure in rats to (3g/L), from neonatal to young age, on the motor/sensory performances, excitability of the spinal cord and gaits during development. Then we evaluated neuroprotective effects of curcumin I (Cur I) against lead neurotoxicity, by means of grasping and cliff avoidance tests to reveal the impairment of the sensorimotor functions in neonatal rats exposed prenatally to lead. In addition, extracellular recordings of motor output in spinal cord revealed an hyper-excitability of spinal networks in lead treated rats. The frequency of induced fictive locomotion was also increased in treated rats. At the young age, rats exhibited an impaired locomotor gait. All those abnormalities were attenuated by Cur I treatment at a dose of 16g/kg. Based on our finding, Cur I has shown features of a potent chemical compound able to restore the neuronal and the relative locomotor behaviors disturbances induced by lead intoxication. Therefore, this chemical can be recommended as a new therapeutic trial against lead induced neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2592256977,"Introduction Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by early postural instability and backward falls. The mechanisms underlying backward postural instability in PSP are not understood. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that postural instability in PSP is a result of dysfunction in the perception of postural verticality. Methods We gathered posturography data on 12 subjects with PSP to compare with 12 subjects with idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and 12 healthy subjects. Objective tests of postural impairment included: dynamic sensory perception tests of gravity and of surface oscillations, postural responses to surface perturbations, the sensory organization test of postural sway under altered sensory conditions and limits of stability in stance. Results Perception of toes up (but not toes down) surface tilt was reduced in subjects with PSP compared to both control subjects (p≤0.001 standing, p≤0.007 seated) and subjects with PD (p≤0.03 standing, p≤0.04 seated). Subjects with PSP, PD and normal controls accurately perceived the direction of gravity when standing on a tilting surface. Unlike PD and control subjects, subjects with PSP exerted less postural corrective torque in response to toes up surface tilts. Discussion Difficulty perceiving backward tilt of the surface or body may account for backward falls and postural impairments in patients with PSP. These observations suggest that abnormal central integration of sensory inputs for perception of body and surface orientation contributes to the pathophysiology of postural instability in PSP."

Computational workflows were developed and applied to identify the mycobacterial species in each DNA sample, to find single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between samples of the same species, to further differentiate SNPs between as many as three different genotypes within a single sample, and to identify which samples are closely clustered genomically. Results Nine species of mycobacteria were found in 123 samples from 105 birds. The most common species were Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium genavense, which were in 49 and 48 birds, respectively. Most birds contained only a single mycobacterial species, but two birds contained a mixture of two species. The M. avium samples represent diverse strains of M. avium avium and M. avium hominissuis, with many pairs of samples differing by hundreds or thousands of SNPs across their common genome. By contrast, the M. genavense samples are much closer genomically; samples from 46 of 48 birds differ from each other by less than 110 SNPs. Some birds contained two, three, or even four genotypes of the same bacterial species. Such infections were found in 4 of 49 birds (8%) with M. avium and in 11 of 48 birds (23%) with M. genavense. Most were mixed infections, in which the bird was infected by multiple mycobacterial strains, but three infections with two genotypes differing by ≤ 10 SNPs were likely the result of within-host evolution. The samples from 31 birds with M. avium can be grouped into nine clusters within which any sample is ≤ 12 SNPs from at least one other sample in the cluster. Similarly, the samples from 40 birds with M. genavense can be grouped into ten such clusters. Information about these genomic clusters is being used in an ongoing, companion study of mycobacterial transmission to help inform management of bird collections."

https://openalex.org/W2591721366,"Most Gram-negative bacteria respond to excessive levels of H2O2 using the peroxide-sensing transcriptional regulator OxyR, which can induce the expression of antioxidant genes to restore normality. Vibrio vulnificus has two distinct OxyRs (OxyR1 and OxyR2), which are sensitive to different levels of H2O2 and induce expression of two different peroxidases, Prx1 and Prx2. Although OxyR1 has both high sequence similarity and H2O2 sensitivity comparable with that of other OxyR proteins, OxyR2 exhibits limited sequence similarity and is more sensitive to H2O2. To investigate the basis for this difference, we determined crystal structures and carried out biochemical analyses of OxyR2. The determined structure of OxyR2 revealed a flipped conformation of the peptide bond before Glu-204, a position occupied by glycine in other OxyR proteins. Activity assays showed that the sensitivity to H2O2 was reduced to the level of other OxyR proteins by the E204G mutation. We solved the structure of the OxyR2-E204G mutant with the same packing environment. The structure of the mutant revealed a dual conformation of the peptide bond before Gly-204, indicating the structural flexibility of the region. This structural duality extended to the backbone atoms of Gly-204 and the imidazole ring of His-205, which interact with H2O2 and invariant water molecules near the peroxidatic cysteine, respectively. Structural comparison suggests that Glu-204 in OxyR2 provides rigidity to the region that is important in H2O2 sensing, compared with the E204G structure or other OxyR proteins. Our findings provide a structural basis for the higher sensitivity of OxyR2 to H2O2 and also suggest a molecular mechanism for bacterial regulation of expression of antioxidant genes at divergent concentrations of cellular H2O2.

The structure of the mutant revealed a dual conformation of the peptide bond before Gly-204, indicating the structural flexibility of the region. This structural duality extended to the backbone atoms of Gly-204 and the imidazole ring of His-205, which interact with H2O2 and invariant water molecules near the peroxidatic cysteine, respectively. Structural comparison suggests that Glu-204 in OxyR2 provides rigidity to the region that is important in H2O2 sensing, compared with the E204G structure or other OxyR proteins. Our findings provide a structural basis for the higher sensitivity of OxyR2 to H2O2 and also suggest a molecular mechanism for bacterial regulation of expression of antioxidant genes at divergent concentrations of cellular H2O2. Most aerobic organisms encounter reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), during aerobic respiration processes (1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Oxidative stress.Curr. Opin.

At higher than critical concentrations of H2O2, highly toxic hydroxyl radicals, which can damage essential cellular components, can be generated (3Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S.

To cope with H2O2 stress, many bacteria have developed elaborate sensing and scavenging systems. In particular, pathogenic bacteria have sophisticated systems to overcome host immune responses that produce a high level of H2O2 (4Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Farr S.B. Ames B.N.

OxyR has a DBD for recognizing target gene promoters and an RD containing two conserved cysteine residues (peroxidatic and resolving cysteines) for sensing H2O2 (8Choi H. Kim S. Mukhopadhyay P.

Recently elucidated full-length OxyR crystal structures from Pseudomonas aeruginosa have revealed the homotetrameric arrangement of the protein, where the two dimeric RDs face each other, and the two dimeric DBDs are oriented in the same direction. The crystal structures have also provided insight into how this redox-dependent structural alteration of RDs is propagated to the DBDs, leading to inward or outward motion between dimeric DBDs (9Jo I.

The peroxidatic cysteine residue of OxyR is first oxidized by H2O2 to cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH), in which a bound H2O2 molecule and two water molecules near the peroxidatic cysteine are thought to play crucial roles via a so-called “H2O2-driven oxidation mechanism” (9Jo I.

The Cys-SOH ultimately forms a disulfide bond via the resolving cysteine in a certain concentration range of H2O2, resulting in formation of the oxidized (or disulfidized) form of OxyR that activates the induction of target genes (11Bang Y.J.

VvOxyR2 exhibits limited sequence similarity to other typical OxyR types and is activated by a lower H2O2 concentration (∼0.5 μm) than VvOxyR1. VvOxyR2 induces Vvprx2 encoding VvPrx2, which has higher activity than VvPrx1 at low H2O2 levels, although VvPrx2 is more susceptible to irreversible inactivation caused by overoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine above the working concentration of H2O2 (>5 μm) (16Kim S.

In this mechanism, above the working concentration of H2O2 for VvPrx2, VvOxyR2 undergoes a new conformational change to prevent non-functional gene expression. In this third state, the peroxidatic cysteine residue of VvOxyR2 is further oxidized to cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) or cysteine-sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H), yielding the overoxidized form of OxyR that lacks transcriptional activity (11Bang Y.J.

To understand how OxyR proteins with similar structures have differing sensitivities to different levels of H2O2, we determined the crystal structures of OxyR2 RD from V. vulnificus and performed biochemical analyses. To investigate the relationships between the structural features and the higher H2O2 sensitivity of OxyR2 from V. vulnificus (VvOxyR2), the crystal structures of wild-type VvOxyR2-RD (residues 86–301) grown under reduced conditions were determined using the zinc-anomalous signals from a ZnCl2-soaked crystal (17Cha S.S. An Y.J. Jeong C.S. Kim M.K. Lee S.G. Lee K.H. Oh B.H. Experimental phasing using zinc anomalous scattering.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The resulting electron-density maps were of sufficient quality to allow us to build an almost complete model. The structure was refined against the 1.6 Å-resolution data set. The asymmetric unit contained two protomers of VvOxyR2-RD, and the final model produced 19.2% Rfree and 15.9% Rfactor with reasonable stereochemistry (Table 1). Like other OxyR-RDs, the protomer consists of two subdomains (RD-I and RD-II; Fig. 1A). Two notable dimers generated by the crystallographic 2-fold axis were found in the crystal, where each protomer individually participated in dimer formation. These observations indicate that VvOxyR2 is also a dimer in solution, as are other OxyR proteins. The overall structure of VvOxyR2-RD was similar to other OxyR-RD structures previously determined in the reduced state (Fig. 1, A and B). The two conserved cysteine residues (Cys-206 and Cys-215) remained as free thiol forms separated by the inter-cysteine helix (residues 206–215). The relative orientation between the dimers is similar to those of OxyR proteins from E. coli, Neisseria meningitidis, P. aeruginosa, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in the reduced state (8Choi H.

Thus, it was concluded that VvOxyR2-RD exhibited the typical reduced conformation of OxyR.Table 1X-ray diffraction and refinement statisticsVvOxyR2-RDWT (SO4-free)WT (ZnCl2-soaked)E204G (SO4-free) (high resolution)E204G (SO4-free) (P3121)E204G (SO4-bound)Data collectionBeam linePAL 5CPAL 5CPAL 5CPAL 7APAL 7AWavelength (Å)0.979401.282301.008200.979330.97933Space groupC2221C2221C2221P3121C2221Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)70.2, 138.3, 97.570.3, 138.4, 97.471.2, 138.2, 97.1141.4, 141.4, 109.772.7, 137.4, 96.7α, β, γ (degrees)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 12090, 90, 90Resolution (Å)50.0–1.60 (1.63–1.60)aValues in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.50.0–1.96 (1.99–1.96)50.0–1.55 (1.58–1.55)50.0–2.3 (2.32–2.30)50.0–1.52 (1.55–1.52)Rpim0.027 (0.164)0.034 (0.113)0.028 (0.163)0.089 (0.368)0.020 (0.131)I/σI18.6 (2.45)51.2 (12.6)19.3 (3.2)9.7 (2.46)31.3 (3.8)Completeness (%)98.7 (95.5)99.6 (99.4)99.4 (96.0)96.6 (88.0)99.7 (99.1)Redundancy8.0 (4.2)5.4 (4.7)9.5 (6.2)4.8 (3.1)10.8 (6.7)RefinementResolution (Å)48.7–1.6019.9–1.5533.9–2.3019.8–1.52No. of reflections55,57864,56153,82772,860Rwork/Rfree0.159/0.1920.155/0.1880.228/0.2670.157/0.183No. of total atoms3836401067524132Wilson B-factor (Å)11.2211.2129.711.9Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0150.0120.0030.008Bond angles (degrees)1.3101.2090.5860.964Ramachandran plotFavored (%)98.198.397.698.8Allowed (%)1.91.72.41.2Outliers (%)0000PDB code5X0V5X0Q5B705B7Da Values in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell. Open table in a new tab To analyze the structure in more detail, we superposed the VvOxyR2-RD structure on P. aeruginosa OxyR (PaOxyR) in the reduced state (Fig. 1B). Whereas the RD-I subdomain showed minimal deviation among the structures, the RD-II subdomain had a particular variation in the location of the resolving cysteine (Cys-215 in VvOxyR2, Cys-208 in PaOxyR) (Fig. 1C). Compared with cysteine positions in other OxyR proteins, the resolving cysteine Cys-215 is buried in the interior of the RD-II subdomain along with the inter-cysteine α-helix. However, the peroxidatic cysteine is located at the same position as in other OxyR proteins (Fig. 1). Notably, the structural superposition of VvOxyR2 with other OxyR proteins revealed large conformational differences at the peptide bond (or peptide flipping) between Lys-203 and Glu-204 (Fig. 1C). However, neither the Lys-203 nor Glu-204 side chains was involved in an interaction with other residues or the bound H2O2 and water molecules near the peroxidatic cysteine residue. Sequence alignment revealed that Glu-204 of VvOxyR2 was replaced with a glycine residue observed in most OxyR proteins and that the glycine residue usually provided conformational flexibility to the adjacent peptide bonds (Fig. 1D). Thus, Glu-204 of VvOxyR2 is more likely than the Lys-203 residue to be responsible for the noncanonical conformation of the peptide bond. To examine the role of Glu-204, we generated a mutant V. vulnificus that harbors the VvoxyR2 (E204G) variant gene instead of wild-type VvoxyR2 and measured the minimum concentrations of H2O2 required for oxidation of VvOxyR2 in a bacterial cell. The bacterial strains expressing either the wild-type VvOxyR2 or the VvOxyR2 (E204G) variant were grown anaerobically and then were briefly exposed to various concentrations of H2O2. To facilitate analyses to determine the number of free thiols in the cellular VvOxyR2 proteins, the cells were treated with a 0.5-kDa alkylating agent, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), that specifically reacts with a free thiol group. AMS linking would cause upshifts in the protein bands when visualized on SDS-polyacrylamide gel; the upshifts were proportional to the number of attached AMSs on the protein. To estimate the number of free thiols in VvOxyR2, the cells were treated with AMS, and all cellular proteins were then resolved on non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-OxyR2 antibody to visualize the VvOxyR2 protein bands. The number of free thiols in VvOxyR2 cellular proteins was estimated by the upshift in protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Upon oxidation, the molecular size of the resulting AMS-alkylated VvOxyR2 decreased by ∼1 kDa because a disulfide bond that forms between the two redox-sensitive cysteines, Cys-206 and Cys-215, prevents alkylation of the two cysteine thiols (16Kim S. Bang Y.J. Kim D. Lim J.G. Oh M.H. Choi S.H. Distinct characteristics of OxyR2, a new OxyR-type regulator, ensuring expression of Peroxiredoxin 2 detoxifying low levels of hydrogen peroxide in Vibrio vulnificus.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 93: 992-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oxidation of wild-type VvOxyR2 occurred within 30 s of exposure to 0.5 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2A, top), as reported previously (16Kim S. Bang Y.J. Kim D. Lim J.G. Oh M.H. Choi S.H. Distinct characteristics of OxyR2, a new OxyR-type regulator, ensuring expression of Peroxiredoxin 2 detoxifying low levels of hydrogen peroxide in Vibrio vulnificus.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 93: 992-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the VvOxyR2 (E204G) variant was not oxidized until it was exposed to 5 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2B, top), suggesting that a Glu-204 to glycine mutation resulted in a significant increase in H2O2 level that can be sensed by VvOxyR2. To assess the transcriptional activities of wild-type VvOxyR2 and the E204G variant, we next measured the transcript level of Vvprx2, a target gene of VvOxyR2 in V. vulnificus, using quantitative real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that Vvprx2 expression was activated by VvOxyR2 when exposed to exogenous H2O2 exceeding concentrations of 0.5 μm (Fig. 2A, bottom). In contrast, the VvOxyR2 (E204G) variant poorly activated Vvprx2 expression until exposed to 5 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2B, bottom). Collectively, these results indicate that Glu-204 of VvOxyR2 is a key residue for sensitivity to H2O2. To ascertain the structural role of Glu-204, we determined three crystal structures of the VvOxyR2-RD (E204G) variant. Of these, the structure of the crystals grown under crystallization conditions similar to those of the wild-type protein exhibited the same space group (C2221) and packing constraints at a resolution of 1.55 Å, resulting in a SO4-free high-resolution structure. Another structure was determined in a different space group (P3121) at a moderate resolution (2.3 Å). We additionally determined another crystal structure at 1.5 Å resolution, designated the SO4-bound form, because it contains a sulfate ion near the peroxidatic cysteine residue. The overall structures of the variant were very similar to those of the wild-type protein except for the region around Gly-204 (Fig. 3, A and B). In the SO4-free high-resolution structure of the E204G variant, the peptide bond at the mutated region exhibited a dual conformation containing both the noncanonical conformation observed in wild-type VvOxyR2 and the typical conformation observed in most OxyR proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). The other structures (SO4-free P3121 and SO4-bound forms) of the variant presented only the typical conformation or the flipped conformation compared with the wild-type VvOxyR2 structure (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together, our finding suggests that the substitution to a glycine residue provides structural flexibility favoring the typical conformation at the peptide bond between residues 203 and 204. To analyze the structural role of Glu-204 of VvOxyR2, we generated a V. vulnificus variant strain harboring a VvoxyR2 (E204A) that would allow the role of the side chain to be excluded. This E204A variant VvOxyR2 was expected to have a peptide conformation similar to that of the wild-type VvOxyR2 having Glu-204, because only a glycine residue endows flexibility to the peptide bonds in proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A, this substitution exhibited an expression profile of Vvprx2 similar to the wild-type strain. Vvprx2 expression was induced by the mutant VvOxyR2 when treated with H2O2 exceeding concentrations of 0.5 μm, as observed with wild-type VvOxyR2 (Fig. 2A). This observation indicates that the peptide bond conformation of Glu-204 rather than the side chain of the Glu-204 is responsible for the hypersensitivity of VvOxyR2. We next excluded the role of the positive charge at Lys-203, which, like Glu-204, seems to be unique in VvOxyR2 (Fig. 1D, blue arrow). When the lysine residue was changed to a negatively charged Asp, a similar Vvprx2 expression profile was found (Fig. 4C). We examined the structures of VvOxyR2 by focusing on the interactions involved in the peptides around Glu-204 or Gly-204. We noted that the carbonyl group of the peptide bond after Glu-204 or Gly-204 interacts directly with a chloride ion, which corresponds to the H2O2 molecule in the H2O2-bound PaOxyR C199D structure (Fig. 5, A and B) (9Jo I. Chung I.Y. Bae H.W. Kim J.S. Song S. Cho Y.H. Ha N.C. Structural details of the OxyR peroxide-sensing mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 6443-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). More importantly, the peptide bond after Gly-204 exhibited a minor conformational duality, caused by the dual conformation of the peptide bond before Gly-204 in the SO4-free high-resolution E204G structure that has the same packing constraints as the wild-type protein (Fig. 3C). The backbone carbonyl group of Gly-204 (or the carbonyl group of the peptide bond between Gly-204 and His-205) exhibited a 0.7-Å difference between the two conformations. This observation indicates motion or positional uncertainty of 0.7 Å in the carbonyl group involved in the binding of H2O2 near the peroxidatic cysteine residue (Figs. 3B and 5C). The conformational duality or flexibility in this carbonyl group contributes to the lower sensitivity of E204G variant VvOxyR2. In other words, the wild-type VvOxyR2 has a higher sensitivity to H2O2 due to the more rigid conformation resulting from employing Glu-204 instead of glycine with its intrinsic conformational flexibility. Due to the structural variation in the peptide bond after Glu-204 or between Glu-204 and His-205, the position of the side chain of His-205 was also affected by the conformation of the peptide bond (Fig. 5C). We thus investigated the role of the side chain of His-205. A V. vulnificus variant strain harboring the oxyR2 (H205A) mutant gene failed to express the target gene Vvprx2 at the indicated concentrations of H2O2, demonstrating the crucial role of His-205 in sensing H2O2 (Fig. 4B). Because His-205 interacts with an invariant water molecule (W1 in Fig. 5, A and B), this conformational variation at the side chain of His-205 also contributes to the sensitivity of VvOxyR2. To gain mechanistic insight into the relationship between the structural variations of VvOxyR2 and the sensitivity to H2O2, we measured the second-order reaction rate constants of VvOxyR2-RD and VvOxyR1-RD by analyzing competition kinetics with horseradish peroxidase-like peroxiredoxins (20Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E. Augusto O. Reactions of yeast thioredoxin peroxidases I and II with hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite: rate constants by competitive kinetics.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the control, BSA and its 35 cysteine residues (one free cysteine residue) were employed. As shown in Fig. 6, both OxyR proteins exhibited constants of 107m−1 s−1, and BSA displayed a negligible value in this assay. The rate constants for the OxyR RDs were similar to those for peroxiredoxins, indicating that the peroxidatic cysteines of OxyRs are oxidized to Cys-SOH by H2O2 as fast as occurs with peroxiredoxins. Noticeably, VvOxyR2-RD was about 2 times faster than VvOxyR1-RD, which may account for the higher sensitivity of VvOxyR2 than VvOxyR1. The faster reaction rate implies a lower activation energy of the reactions, and it would be more possible to perform the reaction even at a very low concentration of H2O2. OxyR2 from V. vulnificus has a distinctive amino acid sequence relative to other OxyRs and has a higher sensitivity to H2O2. However, the molecular underpinnings of the higher sensitivity of VvOxyR2 were unknown. To investigate the structural basis of the higher sensitivity of the protein, we determined the crystal structures of wild-type and an E204G variant of VvOxyR2-RD. In particular, we identified a VvOxyR2-specific residue, Glu-204, near the peroxidatic cysteine residue. The plane of the peptide bond that occurs before Glu-204 was rotated compared with the other OxyR proteins that have a glycine residue at the Glu-204 site. Further analyses revealed that a VvOxyR2 variant harboring an E204G mutation exhibited decreased sensitivity to H2O2 in V. vulnificus that was comparable with that of other OxyR proteins. Structural comparisons of the wild-type and the E204G variant VvOxyR2 provided a reasonable structural explanation for the higher sensitivity of VvOxyR2. The E204G mutation resulted in significant conformational flexibility in the region of Gly-204 and His-205. The carbonyl group of the peptide bond between His-205 and Gly-204 is involved in binding of a H2O2 molecule, and the imidazole ring of His-205 interacts with the invariant water molecule near the peroxidatic cysteine. Thus, our study suggests that the OxyR proteins regulate their sensitivity to H2O2 by altering the structural constraints of the peptide bond after Glu-204, which are involved in binding of H2O2 and a water molecule via the peptide bond with and the side chain of the His-205 residue. What then is the mechanistic relationship between the structural variation of the OxyR proteins and the sensitivity to H2O2? The higher sensitivity could be accounted for by the higher affinity for H2O2 and the water molecules at the site near the peroxidatic cysteine residue. Unfortunately, we were not able to measure the binding constant of H2O2 due to the rapid reaction of H2O2 with"
https://openalex.org/W2592812754,"GNE myopathy (GNEM), also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), is a late- onset, progressive myopathy caused by mutations in the GNE gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the first regulated step in the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA). The disease is characterized by distal muscle weakness in both the lower and upper extremities, with the quadriceps muscle relatively spared until the late stages of disease. To explore the role of SA synthesis in the disease, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic analysis of both free and total SA levels in a large cohort of GNEM patients and a mouse model. A sensitive LC/MS/MS assay was developed to quantify SA in serum and muscle homogenates. Mean serum free SA level was 0.166 μg/mL in patients and 18% lower (p<0.001) than that of age-matched control samples (0.203 μg/mL). In biopsies obtained from patients, mean free SA levels of different muscles ranged from 0.046–0.075 μg/μmol Cr and were markedly lower by 72–85% (p<0.001) than free SA from normal controls. Free SA was shown to constitute a small fraction (3–7%) of the total SA pool in muscle tissue. Differences in mean total SA levels in muscle from patients compared with normal controls were less distinct and more variable between different muscles, suggesting a small subset of sialylation targets could be responsible for the pathogenesis of GNEM. Normal quadriceps had significantly lower levels of free SA (reduced by 39%) and total SA (reduced by 53%) compared to normal gastrocnemius. A lower SA requirement for quadriceps may be linked to the reported quadriceps sparing in GNEM. Analysis of SA levels in GneM743T/M743T mutant mice corroborated the human study results. These results show that serum and muscle free SA is severely reduced in GNEM, which is consistent with the biochemical defect in SA synthesis associated with GNE mutations. These results therefore support the approach of reversing SA depletion as a potential treatment for GNEM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2593374825,"In fungi, heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins) are key elements of signal transduction pathways, which control growth, asexual and sexual development, as well as virulence. In this study, we have identified two genes encoding heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, named Gvm2 and Gvm3, from Valsa mali, the causal agent of apple Valsa canker. Characterization of Gvm2 and Gvm3 mutants indicates that Gvm3 may be a crucial regulator of vegetative growth. Deletion of the corresponding gene results in a 20% reduction in growth rate. Besides, Gvm2 and Gvm3 seem to be involved in asexual reproduction, and mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative and cell membrane stresses. Interestingly, both G protein alpha subunits were most probably involved in V. mali virulence. In infection assays using Malus domestica cv. ‘Fuji’ leaves and twigs, the size of lesions caused by deletion mutants △Gvm2, or △Gvm3 are significantly reduced. Furthermore, many genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes—important virulence factors in V. mali—are expressed at a lower level in these deletion mutants. Our results suggest that Gvm2 and Gvm3 play an important role in virulence probably by regulation of expression of cell wall degrading enzymes. △Gvm2, and △Gvm3 mutants were further analyzed with respect to their impact on the transcript levels of genes in the cAMP/PKA pathway. The expression of the genes encoding adenylate cyclase VmAC, protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit VmPKR, and PKA catalytic subunit VmPKA1 are down-regulated in both mutants. Further analyses indicated that intracellular cAMP level and PKA activity are down-regulated in the △Gvm3 mutant, but are basically unchanged in the △Gvm2 mutant. Overall, our findings indicate that both Gvm2 and Gvm3 play diverse roles in the modulation of vegetative growth, asexual development, and virulence in V. mali."

Despite its regulatory function in neurons, little is known about the CARM1 cellular location and its role in dendritic maturation and synapse formation. Here, we examined the effects of CARM1 inhibition on dendritic spine and synapse morphology in the rat hippocampus. CARM1 was localized in hippocampal post-synapses, with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy revealing co-localization of CARM1 with post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 protein, a post-synaptic marker. Specific siRNA-mediated suppression of CARM1 expression resulted in precocious dendritic maturation, with increased spine width and density at sites along dendrites and induction of mushroom-type spines. These changes were accompanied by a striking increase in the cluster size and number of key synaptic proteins, including N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and PSD-95. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of CARM1 activity with the CARM1-specific inhibitor AMI-1 significantly increased spine width and mushroom-type spines and also increased the cluster size and number of NR2B and cluster size of PSD-95. These results suggest that CARM1 is a post-synaptic protein that plays roles in dendritic maturation and synaptic formation and that spatiotemporal regulation of CARM1 activity modulates neuronal connectivity and improves synaptic dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2593397248,"Facial features differ in the amount of expressive information they convey. Specifically, eyes are argued to be essential for fear recognition, while smiles are crucial for recognising happy expressions. In three experiments, we tested whether expression modulates the perceptual saliency of diagnostic facial features and whether the feature’s saliency depends on the face configuration. Participants were presented with masked facial features or noise at perceptual conscious threshold. The task was to indicate whether eyes (experiments 1-3A) or a mouth (experiment 3B) was present. The expression of the face and its configuration (i.e. spatial arrangement of the features) were manipulated. Experiment 1 compared fearful with neutral expressions, experiments 2 and 3 compared fearful versus happy expressions. The detection accuracy data was analysed using Signal Detection Theory (SDT), to examine the effects of expression and configuration on perceptual precision (d’) and response bias (c), separately. Across all three experiments, fearful eyes were detected better (higher d’) than neutral and happy eyes. Eyes were more precisely detected than mouths, whereas smiles were detected better than fearful mouths. The configuration of the features had no consistent effects across the experiments on the ability to detect expressive features. But facial configuration affected consistently the response bias. Participants used a more liberal criterion for detecting the eyes in canonical configuration and fearful expression. Finally, the power in low spatial frequency of a feature predicted its discriminability index. The results suggest that expressive features are perceptually more salient with a higher d’ due to changes at the low-level visual properties, with emotions and configuration affecting perception through top-down processes, as reflected by the response bias."

https://openalex.org/W2593543339,"The potential involvement of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) in extracellular matrix (ECM) production is recognized. However, the role CCN2 in fibronectin (FN) gene expression has remained incompletely understood and even controversial. Here we report that CCN2 is absolutely necessary for FN expression in primary human skin dermal fibroblasts, the major cells responsible for ECM production in skin. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches demonstrate that CCN2 is an essential component of FN expression in both basal and stimulation by TGF-β signaling, the major regulator of FN expression. CCN2 is significantly induced by Smad3, a critical mediator of TGF-β signaling. CCN2 acts as a downstream mediator of TGF-β/Smad signaling and acting synergistically with TGF-β to regulate FN gene expression. Finally, we observed that CCN2 and FN predominantly expressed in the dermis of normal human skin, stromal tissues of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and simultaneously induced in wounded human skin in vivo. These findings provide evidence that CCN2 is responsible for mediating the stimulatory effects of TGF-β/Smad on FN gene expression, and attenuation of CCN2 expression may benefit to reduce fibrotic ECM microenvironment in disease skin."

However, data for different access flow levels on outcomes related to long-term dialysis patients, especially in Chinese patients, are limited. Herein, we performed an ambispective, mono-centric cohort study investigating the association between the AVF flows and inflammation, cardiovascular events and deaths in Chinese hemodialysis patients bearing a radio-cephalic fistula (AVF) from 2009 to 2015. Twenty-three patients (35.9%) developed at least one episode of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in two years after AVF creation. AVF Qa, IL-6 and hsCRP were significantly higher in patients with CVD than in patients without CVD. Multi-factorial binary logistic regression analysis found that the independent and strongest risk factor for CVD in HD patients was serum IL-6, which showed a positive association with AVF Qa levels in patients. Therefore, the linkage between AVF Qa tertiles and adverse clinical outcomes (cardiovascular events and mortality) was examined over a median follow-up of five years. IL-6 was significantly increased in the high AVF Qa (>1027.13 ml/min) group. Patients with median AVF Qa showed the lowest morbidity and mortality of CVD according to the AVF Qa tertiles, whereas higher Qa was associated with a higher risk of CVD, and lower AVF Qa (600 ml/min ≤AVF Qa <821.12 ml/min) had a higher risk of non-CVD death. Therefore, keeping the AVF Qa at an optimal level (821.12 to 1027.13 ml/min) would benefit HD patients, improve long-term clinical outcomes and lower AVF-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2591990563,"Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most deadly cancers in Europe and the USA. There is consensus that radical tumor surgery is the only viable option for any long-term survival in patients with PDAC. So far, limited data are available regarding the routine surgical management of patients with advanced PDAC in the light of surgical guidelines. Methods A national survey on perioperative management of patients with PDAC and currently applied criteria on their tumor resectability in German university and community hospitals was carried out. Results With a response rate of 81.6% (231/283) a total of 95 (41.1%) participating departments practicing pancreatic surgery in Germany are certified as competence and reference centers for surgical diseases of the pancreas in 2016. More than 95% of them indicate to carry out structured and interdisciplinary therapies along with an interdisciplinary pre- and postoperative tumor board. The majority of survey respondents prefer the pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy (93.1%) with standard lymphadenectomy for cancer of the pancreatic head. Intraoperative histological evaluation of the resection margins is used regularly by 99% of the survey respondents. 98.7% of survey respondents carry out partial or complete vein resection, 126 respondents (54.5%) would resect tumor adjacent arteries, and 102 respondents (44.2%) would perform metastasectomy if complete PDAC resection (R0) is possible. Conclusion Evidence-based and standardized pancreatic surgery is practiced by a large number of hospitals in Germany. However, a significant number of survey respondents support an extended radical tumor resection in patients with advanced PDAC even when not indicated by current clinical guidelines."

Interestingly, early life experiences are able to influence the development of the gastrointestinal tract and the reactivity to colonic inflammatory stress. We recently demonstrated that adult male rats exposed to low doses of corticosterone during lactation (CORT-nursed rats) are protected against experimental colitis induced by the intracolonic infusion of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Based on these interesting results, we wanted to better investigate which cellular actors could be involved in the protection of CORT-nursed rats from TNBS-induced experimental colitis. Therefore, in the present work, we focused our attention on different factors implicated in GR-mediated anti-inflammatory effect. To address this issue, colonic tissues, collected from control and CORT-nursed healthy animals and from control and CORT-nursed colitic rats, were processed and the following inflammatory factors were evaluated: the expression of (i) glucocorticoid receptors (GR), (ii) glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), (iii) phospho-p65NF-κB, (iv) the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, (v) the prokineticins PK2 and PK2L and (vi) their receptors PKR1 and PKR2. We found that adult CORT-nursed rats, in comparison to controls, showed increased expression of colonic GR and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-1β, TNF-α, PK2 and PK2L) in response to inflammatory colitis. The observed changes were associated with an increase in GILZ colonic expression and with a reduction in phospo-p65NF-κB colonic expression."

Wang Q. Berglund E.D. Tong Q. Action of neurotransmitter: a key to unlock the AgRP neuron feeding circuit.Front. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 200PubMed Google Scholar). With cell bodies located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, AgRP neurons detect signals from circulating hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, and insulin and respond through axonal projections to several distinct brain regions, including the paraventricular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus (2Krashes M.J.

These orexigenic signals are opposed by the release of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in overlapping brain regions by pro-opiomelanocortin neurons. AgRP neurons are essential for stimulating feeding in response to food deprivation, whereas ablation of these neurons leads to stress-induced anorexia (3Denis R.G. Joly-Amado A. Webber E. Langlet F.

AgRP signaling acts through the central melanocortin system, a critical hypothalamic pathway that consists of two G protein-coupled receptors, melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 (MC3/4R), and their peptide ligands. At MC4R, the receptor most directly linked to body weight regulation, AgRP acts as an antagonist and inverse agonist to stimulate feeding and promote positive energy balance (6Chai B.-X. Neubig R.R.

We have demonstrated previously that regions of AgRP outside of the ICK core, although not required for receptor binding, are necessary for increasing feeding and appetite in rats and contain positively charged residues well conserved among mammalian sequences. Fig. 1 summarizes these structural features of AgRP. Strikingly, we found that truncations or mutations that reduce the positive charge in this non-ICK region (Arg/Lys → Gln) attenuate feeding, whereas mutations that increase the charge significantly increase feeding. The most positively charged variant extended the number of days of feeding above baseline well past that of AgRP(83–132) and led to a 25% greater increase in body mass over 5 days (18Madonna M.E.

The tethering of chemokines by GAGs is crucial for the formation of gradients, which directs leukocyte trafficking to damaged tissues. Mounting evidence suggests that, in the melanocortin system, syndecans significantly potentiate the effects of AgRP action. Ectopic expression of syndecans leads to severe obesity and type II diabetes in mice (25Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H.

Similarly, transgenic mice that produce constitutively shed syndecan-1 are resistant to obesity. The regulation of syndecan-3, expressed in the hypothalamus, was found to be controlled by energy balance, where fed mice possess more syndecan-3 in its cleaved form, and fasted mice contain more cell surface-bound syndecan-3. Directly testing the effects on the melanocortin system in cell culture revealed that syndecan-3 co-transfected with MC4R in HEK cells potentiates the cAMP-inhibitory actions of AgRP. In comparison with syndecan overexpression, genetic disruption of hypothalamic syndecan-3 leads to a lean phenotype and reduced sensitivity to food deprivation (26Zheng Q. Zhu J. Shanabrough M. Borok E. Benoit S.C. Horvath T.L. Clegg D.J. Reizes O. Enhanced anorexigenic signaling in lean obesity resistant syndecan-3 null mice.Neuroscience. 2010; 171: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This same work demonstrated that syndecans directly potentiate the action of AgRP at MC4R. Furthermore, AgRP peptide localization near MC4R was significantly reduced compared with wild-type mice without reductions in neuropeptide Y (NPY) localization, which is expressed by the same neurons. This result was observed without any alterations in AgRP, NPY, or α-MSH expression levels. Adding to this hypothesis, heparanase was recently found to be an important regulator of body mass in an MC4R-dependent manner, more generally implicating the role of GAGs in MC4R (27Karlsson-Lindahl L. Schmidt L. Haage D. Hansson C. Taube M. Egeciouglu E. Egeciouglu E. Tan Y.X. Admyre T. Jansson J.-O. Vlodavsky I. Li J.-P. Lindahl U. Dickson S.L. Heparanase affects food intake and regulates energy balance in mice.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34313Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Not only do these results provide compelling evidence for a role for syndecans in MC4R signaling, but they also point to a mechanism for increased feeding found previously for our charged AgRP variants. Despite this, questions remain regarding whether the mature form of AgRP possesses the molecular features necessary to interact with syndecans via GAGs. Although the unstructured N-terminal domain of AgRP has been suggested to drive this interaction (25Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S.

(15Creemers J.W. Pritchard L.E. Gyte A. Le Rouzic P. Meulemans S. Wardlaw S.L. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Davies N. Armstrong D. Lawrence C.B. Luckman S.M. Schmitz C.A. Davies R.A. Brennand J.C. White A.

Douglas N.R. Chai B. Binkley J. Sidow A. Barsh G.S. Millhauser G.L. Structural and molecular evolutionary analysis of agouti and agouti-related proteins.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this region is posttranslationally cleaved before secretion and decreases the efficacy of the peptide's inhibitory action. These results are in opposition to the paradigm above, as suggested by physiological experiments, that AgRP interacts with syndecans. Here we describe the interaction of AgRP(83–132), the cleaved N-terminal domain, and our designed AgRP variants with size-heterogeneous heparin and heparan sulfate along with defined heparin oligosaccharides. We find that AgRP(83–132) binds with high affinity to heparin and heparan sulfate, whereas a synthetic N-terminal domain of AgRP fails to show in vitro binding. Remarkably, our truncated and designed AgRP mutants display a differential binding affinity to GAG polymers that perfectly matches the feeding trend we observed in rats. The differences in these peptides reside solely in the non-ICK domains. We then show evidence for general electrostatic complementarity rather than a specific GAG-binding epitope that is driven by these non-ICK domains. This study defines AgRP (83–132) as a heparan sulfate-binding protein and provides mechanisms for variants that significantly alter in vivo feeding, addressing a long-standing discrepancy between models of heparan sulfate proteoglycan modulation of MC4R and its molecular basis. There exists virtually no literature examining the interaction of AgRP and either syndecans or protein-binding GAGs. Low-resolution experiments have identified the extended, unstructured N-terminal domain of AgRP (residues 21–82) as being responsible for syndecan binding, with AgRP(83–132) demonstrating no affinity (25Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H. Bernfield M. Transgenic expression of syndecan-1 uncovers a physiological control of feeding behavior by syndecan-3.Cell. 2001; 106: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Proteins must be able to bind heparin in vitro to be classified as a heparan sulfate-binding protein (HSBP) (29Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To directly test this proposed mechanism of GAG binding, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the thermodynamic properties of mixed-molecular-weight heparin (17–19 kDa) and AgRP peptides in solution. Heparin consists of repeating disaccharide units composed primarily of iduronic acid and glucosamine and possesses a high degree of sulfation. Heparin provides a convenient first test of GAG binding because of this high level of sulfation as well as the fact that heparin is commercially available in large quantities. We initially set out to measure the differences in binding affinity between heparin and AgRP(83–132) compared with full-length AgRP. Because of the difficulties in solubilizing full-length AgRP at concentrations appropriate for ITC, we used solid-phase peptide synthesis to chemically prepare the unstructured N-terminal domain separate from AgRP(83–132). We reasoned that if the N-terminal domain retained the molecular determinants of GAG binding, then it alone would display affinity by ITC. We titrated heparin into a solution of the N-terminal domain to measure heparin affinity. To our surprise, the titrations produce no measurable heat of binding, indicating that this unstructured region does not bind heparin. Repeating the experiment with AgRP(83–132) produces a robust heat of binding and a dissociation constant of KD = 20 ± 6 nm, as shown in Fig. 2. The interaction is enthalpically driven and gives a stoichiometry of n = 15.19. This stoichiometry indicates that each heparin fragment of average molecular mass = 18,000 Da contains roughly 15 AgRP monomers. These data do not support the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain of AgRP, which is now known to be posttranslationally cleaved, interacts with the GAG components of syndecans. In direct contrast, the mature, structured C-terminal domain AgRP(83–132) displays a very high affinity to heparin in solution, comparable with other HSBPs (29Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). As our initial experiments showed that AgRP(83–132) binds heparin with high affinity, we next explored whether the positively charged amino acid residues in the non-ICK regions of the peptide had any influence on this binding. These regions were found previously to be critical for feeding in rats without having any effect on melanocortin receptor binding or cAMP inhibition, and it was hypothesized that this could be due to regulation by GAGs via heparan sulfate proteoglycan presentation (18Madonna M.E. Schurdak J. Yang Y.K. Benoit S. Millhauser G.L. Agouti-related protein segments outside of the receptor binding core are required for enhanced short- and long-term feeding stimulation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We synthesized variants of AgRP from that study with truncations of these non-ICK regions (AgRP87–132, AgRP83–120, and AgRP87–120) along with designed mutants where a positive charge was added as lysine residues (AgRP4K) or existing positively charged residues were mutated to glutamine (AgRP4Q). All sequences are summarized in Fig. 3. We subjected each of the peptides to the same ITC experiments with heparin as described in the previous section and found dramatic differences in affinities among them. Raw isotherms from ITC data of heparin titrations are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 5, of the three truncated peptides, the ability to bind heparin is abolished in AgRP(87–132) and AgRP(87–120). AgRP(83–120) retains some affinity but has more than a 4-fold higher dissociation constant, KD = 80 ± 20 nm. We found substantial differences in AgRP4Q and AgRP4K as well. AgRP4Q is absent of any heparin affinity, showing no appreciable heat of binding in the ITC experiment. The peptide lacks two arginines from the four-amino acid N-terminal segment as well as a lysine and arginine in the C-terminal loop, all of which are mutated to glutamine. AgRP4K displays significantly enhanced affinity for heparin. This peptide substitutes four non-charged amino acids in the N-terminal segment and C-terminal loop for lysines, which gives a dissociation constant of KD = 4.6 ± 0.5 nm.Figure 5ITC results with AgRP variants. Each AgRP variant was titrated with either size-heterogeneous heparin or heparan sulfate. Thermodynamic data were measured, including dissociation constants and stoichiometry. GAG binding appears to be directly correlated to the non-ICK positive charge. As shown in the % Feeding Above Saline column, taken from our previous rat feeding study, this trend correlates with 24-h feeding. Four ITC experiments were repeated with each peptide two to four times, and the reported error is the standard deviation of each set of measurements. Feeding data are presented as percent feeding above saline and standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although heparin binding is a requirement for HSBPs, the polysaccharide does not accurately represent the physiologically relevant GAG found on syndecans and other heparan sulfate proteoglycans. All cells possess syndecans, and heparan sulfate (HS) is their primary GAG component. Structurally, HS varies most from heparin regarding its degree of sulfation at C2 of the uronic acids and C3/C6 at the glucosamine residues. In general, HS possess fewer stretches of polymer that are highly sulfated and negatively charged and thus would be expected to bind proteins with less affinity in electrostatically driven interactions. HSBPs should still display an affinity for HS in vitro. We used HS derived from bovine kidney with an average molecular mass of 14 kDa to test whether AgRP(83–132) and the same panel of truncates and designed variants retained their differential GAG-binding properties. The data are summarized in Fig. 5. As expected, there is a general trend of reduced affinity for HS compared with heparin, presumably because of the reduced global negative charge inherent to HS. AgRP(83–132) binds to HS with a dissociation constant of KD = 8.2 ± 0.6 μm, which is comparable with the affinity of other HSBPs for heparin. As with heparin, AgRP(87–132), AgRP(87–120), and AgRP4Q show no binding by ITC, whereas AgRP(83–120) displays a reduced affinity compared with AgRP(83–132) (KD = 15 ± 3 μm). AgRP4K retains a remarkably high affinity for HS compared with AgRP(83–132), with KD = 0.54 ± 0.1 μm. The stoichiometry for AgRP(83–132) is n = 7, indicating that each HS fragment contained roughly seven AgRP monomers and predicted a minimum protein-binding region to be an HS heptamer. The stoichiometry measurements did not differ greatly among the peptides exhibiting HS binding. As seen in in the last column of Fig. 5, these calorimetry results show a remarkable relationship with our previous feeding studies using this panel of AgRP variants (18Madonna M.E. Schurdak J. Yang Y.K. Benoit S. Millhauser G.L. Agouti-related protein segments outside of the receptor binding core are required for enhanced short- and long-term feeding stimulation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). AgRP4Q, AgRP(87–132), and AgRP(87–120) exhibit no affinity toward either heparin or HS and are the variants that produced the smallest 24-h feeding response in our previous feeding study (18Madonna M.E. Schurdak J. Yang Y.K. Benoit S. Millhauser G.L. Agouti-related protein segments outside of the receptor binding core are required for enhanced short- and long-term feeding stimulation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in that study, truncates AgRP(87–132) and AgRP(83–120) did not produce equivalent feeding responses, and our data here show that they similarly do not produce equivalent responses to heparin/HS binding. AgRP(83–120) has a high affinity for both GAG ligands, matching the increase in feeding it produced compared with the other truncated versions of AgRP. We find similar trends with AgRP(83–132), AgRP4Q, and AgRP4K. AgRP4Q has a significantly smaller effect on 24-h feeding compared with the other designs and here did not bind heparin or HS. The effect of AgRP4K on feeding is dramatic and significantly higher than that of AgRP(83–132), again matching the trend for GAG binding. Our previous study (18Madonna M.E. Schurdak J. Yang Y.K. Benoit S. Millhauser G.L. Agouti-related protein segments outside of the receptor binding core are required for enhanced short- and long-term feeding stimulation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) also examined long-term effects on energy balance and change in body mass, although these were only measured in the non-truncate peptides. Consistent with 24-h feeding, body mass increased in the order AgRP4Q, AgRP(83–132), and AgRP4K, again matching the trend for increased GAG binding. We used NMR spectroscopy to determine the contact surface responsible for the AgRP/GAG interaction. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli produced 15N-labeled versions of AgRP(83–132) suitable for chemical shift perturbation heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments. Initially, we attempted to titrate size-heterogeneous heparin chains into solutions of the peptide but experienced severe solubility issues with substoichiometric amounts of heparin. Turning to our ITC experimental results, we calculated that AgRP monomers would interact with GAG heptamers in a roughly 1 to 1 manner. After optimizing the experimental conditions for several candidate GAG ligands, we found that heparin hexasaccharides (dp6) were most suitable for NMR. We confirmed the relevance of dp6 by ITC, titrating the hexasaccharide into solutions of AgRP at a physiologically relevant pH value. We determined that the interaction is roughly 1:1 with an n = 0.8 and dissociation constant of KD = 6.4 ± 0.5 μm (data not shown). We titrated heparin dp6 at increasing concentrations into solutions of 50 μm AgRP(83–132) at pH 6 to observe the highest number of resonances. Fig. 6A shows regions of this 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of AgRP(83–132) overlaid with that of AgRP-dp6 complexes at ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:7 AgRP:dp6. All peaks from unbound AgRP have c"

Eighteen E. faecium isolates were completely analyzed and were all resistant to vancomycin, susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin, positive for vanA and esp genes. The MLST analysis confirmed most isolates were of the sequence types linked to clonal complex 17 (CC17) that is widely associated with outbreaks in hospitals. Infection control measures, antibiotic stewardship, and surveillance activities will continue to be a priority in hospital on the Island."
https://openalex.org/W2593553300,"Peripheral regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg cells) prevent maladaptive inflammatory responses to innocuous foreign antigens. Treg cell dysfunction has been linked to many inflammatory diseases, including allergic airway inflammation. Glucocorticoids that are used to treat allergic airway inflammation and asthma are thought to work in part by promoting Treg cell differentiation; patients who are refractory to these drugs have defective induction of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. Previous observations suggest that Treg cells deficient in the transcription factor FoxO1 are pro-inflammatory, and that FoxO1 activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status and nuclear localization. Here, we asked whether altering the phosphorylation state of FoxO1 through modulation of a regulatory phosphatase might affect Treg cell function. In a mouse model of house dust mite-induced allergic airway inflammation, we observed robust recruitment of Treg cells to the lungs and lymph nodes of diseased mice, without an apparent increase in the Treg cytokine interleukin-10 in the airways. Intriguingly, expression of PP2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase linked to the regulation of FoxO1 phosphorylation, was decreased in the mediastinal lymph nodes of HDM-treated mice, mirroring the decreased PP2A expression seen in peripheral blood monocytes of glucocorticoid-resistant asthmatic patients. When we asked whether modulation of PP2A activity alters Treg cell function via treatment with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid, we observed increased phosphorylation of FoxO1 and decreased nuclear localization. However, dysregulation of FoxO1 did not impair Treg cell differentiation ex vivo or cause Treg cells to adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, inhibition of PP2A activity did not affect the suppressive function of Treg cells ex vivo. Collectively, these data suggest that modulation of the phosphorylation state of FoxO1 via PP2A inhibition does not modify Treg cell function ex vivo. Our data also highlight the caveat in using ex vivo assays of Treg cell differentiation and function, in that while these assays are useful, they may not fully recapitulate Treg cell phenotypes that are observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2592672945,"During amniote evolution, the construction of the forebrain has diverged across different lineages, and accompanying the structural changes, functional diversification of the homologous brain regions has occurred. This can be assessed by studying the expression patterns of marker genes that are relevant in particular functional circuits. In all vertebrates, the dopaminergic system is responsible for the behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. Here we show that the brain regions that receive dopaminergic input through dopamine receptor D1 are relatively conserved, but with some important variations between three evolutionarily distant vertebrate lines–house mouse (Mus musculus), domestic chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) / common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). Moreover, we find that in almost all instances, those brain regions expressing D1-like dopamine receptor genes also express Wfs1. Wfs1 has been studied primarily in the pancreas, where it regulates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and insulin production and secretion. Using radioligand binding assays in wild type and Wfs1-/- mouse brains, we show that the number of binding sites of D1-like dopamine receptors is increased in the hippocampus of the mutant mice. We propose that the functional link between Wfs1 and D1-like dopamine receptors is evolutionarily conserved and plays an important role in adjusting behavioral reactions to environmental stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2592444380,"Bacterial small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are known as novel regulators involved in virulence, stress responsibility, and so on. Recently, a lot of new researches have highlighted the critical roles of sRNAs in fine-tune gene regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda) is a gram-negative, intracellular pathogen that causes edwardsiellosis in fish. Thus far, no sRNA has been reported in E. tarda. The present study represents the first attempt to identify sRNAs in E. tarda S08. Ten sRNAs were validated by RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR). ET_sRNA_1 and ET_sRNA_2 were homolous to tmRNA and GcvB, respectively. However, the other candidate sRNAs have not been reported till now. The cellular abundance of 10 validated sRNA was detected by qPCR at different growth phases to monitor their biosynthesis. Nine candidate sRNAs were expressed in the late-stage of exponential growth and stationary stages of growth (36~60 h). And the expression of the nine sRNAs was growth phase-dependent. But ET_sRNA_10 was almost expressed all the time and reached the highest peak at 48 h. Their targets were predicted by TargetRNA2 and each sRNA target contains some genes that directly or indirectly relate to virulence. These results preliminary showed that sRNAs probably play a regulatory role of virulence in E. tarda."
