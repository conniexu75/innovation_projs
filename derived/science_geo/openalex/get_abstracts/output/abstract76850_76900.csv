Using immunoelectrophoresis, with a specific rabbit serum immune against human foetal serum proteins, de Muralt and Roulet3 and one of us (J. M.)4 found a specific precipitation line in the immunoelectrophoresis pattern of human foetal serum corresponding to an alpha1-globulin. According to de Muralt and Roulet3, this specific foetal alpha1-globulin disappears from the serum of foetuses after the twentieth week of intrauterine life. But it has been possible to demonstrate the presence of this protein in the serum of older foetuses, and in the cord blood serum as well as in that of newborns in the first week after birth5. These findings probably confirm the existence of a protein which is characteristic of the foetal period in man and which is called “foetoprotein”3,4. This protein has not yet been found in the serum of normal individuals later than the first two weeks of postnatal life."

https://openalex.org/W2090373227,"THE slowing of heart rate in animals and birds responding to the asphyxia of diving has been noted many times since the early observations of Bert in 1870 (ref. 1). More recently, the diving bradycardia has been shown to be associated with major circulatory changes in which the blood flow in viscera and skeletal muscle is reduced without change in the arterial blood pressure. Additional evidence suggests that coronary and cerebral circulation is maintained2–4."

https://openalex.org/W2086315022,"A SUBSTANCE has been obtained from the brain of rabbits killed with diisopropyl fluorophosphate that appears to have interesting properties and chemical structure. The substance can be obtained in amounts of 1.0–1.3 mg/g of brain by extraction with cold aqueous 5 per cent perchloric acid, followed by precipitation with phosphotungstic acid, and chromatography of the portion of the precipitate soluble in chloroform on silica with chloroform–methanol mixtures as eluant. The substance, obtained as a wax, gave a single fluorescent spot of RF 0.95 by thin layer chromatography on alumina with a pyridine–amyl alcohol–water (3 : 3 : 2) solvent system. The same areas also gave positive reactions with acidified permanganate, diazotized p-nitroaniline, Folin's phenol reagent, Schiff's fuchsin reagent, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and with alkaline hydroxylamine followed by acidified ferric chloride solution. Elementary analysis showed some variation from lot to lot, with an average of 75.5 per cent carbon and 12.0 per cent hydrogen, and a range of ± 1 per cent for carbon and ±0.5 per cent for hydrogen."

The osmotic pressure measurements of Adair1 and the light scattering experiments of Rossi-Fanelli, Antonini and Caputo2 agree with this concept, but our light scattering measurements have shown that reduced horse haemoglobin is in a state of close association when in 0.1 molar phosphate (pH 7.4)."

https://openalex.org/W2053937426,"THE antigenic composition of the human erythrocyte is well defined and is the basis of the established blood group systems, but little is known about individual antigenic differences in body fluids and tissue cells outside the blood groups. The cytotoxic factor of serum has been determined here with the aid of a simple method of cell culture1–3."

https://openalex.org/W2001416993,"THE processes of production, transformation, dilution, absorption and transport proceed simultaneously in the rumen, and the concentration of substances in the fluid of the rumen is influenced by some or all of these processes. Only a limited amount of information about the course of these processes in vivo can be obtained from measurements of the fluid concentrations. Thus I have tried to investigate absorption through the rumen wall after isolating the process in the following way."

https://openalex.org/W2030733482,"THE patterns of urinary oestrone excretion during the human menstrual cycle which have been published1–3 show two pronounced excretion peaks corresponding to ovulation and the luteal maximum which are between 8 and 11 days apart with a mean of 9 days. Despite the imprecision of the assay methods, a very small rise of urinary oestrone excretion could often be observed during menstruation with a peak 8–10 days before the ovulation peak. The development of our specific, more sensitive and precise method for determining urinary oestrone4 led us to the finding of an 8–10 day cycle of this urinary oestrogen in the normal human male, and to the suggestion that the periods of the urinary oestrone cycles in males and females are similar5. We therefore inferred that the normal human menstrual cycle is made up of three distinct urinary oestrone cycles with peaks of excretion between 8 and 11 days apart. The present communication gives the results of an investigation of the urinary oestrone excretion for the human menstrual cycle."

Precht discussed the possibility that the warm adjustment may be caused by changes in enzyme activity4. Since numerous other physiological changes also occur during this process, we decided to investigate whether or not new protein synthesis is a prerequisite for it, and to examine the nature of the regulation of protein synthesis if this is a causative factor."
