(1), holds crucial implications for many evolutionary studies (2). Here, we reexamine the data analyzed in (1), show that some of those data are likely unreliable, and suggest that the short-distance correlations found by Awadalla et al. (1) can be more plausibly interpreted phylogenetically."

[1156][1]), and their disappearance will cripple attempts to probe the limits of linguistic diversity. But one crucial source of linguistic diversity is not mentioned in the article. Within the last 40 years, linguists have recognized that there are two major types of human languages: signed and spoken ([1][2], [2][3]). There are perhaps 200 to 300 signed languages, but there has been no thorough survey done. Linguists now understand that signed languages exhibit the basic properties that make a communication system a language.

Research suggests that signed and spoken languages exhibit distinct patterns of variation ([3][4]). Although signed languages differ in their vocabularies, in word order, in the presence of auxiliary-like elements, and in other ways, they seem to be much less diverse typologically than are spoken languages. The relative uniformity of signed languages, in contrast to the typological diversity of spoken languages, may be due to the differing resources available to sign and speech, as well as to the differing perceptual and articulatory constraints imposed by the visual-gestural and oral-aural channels.

This is a fundamental hypothesis about the factors that determine the available structures for individual human languages, yet it has hardly been tested. Doing so demands that we examine a large sample of signed languages. But like many spoken languages, the very existence of some signed languages is threatened. The pressures of educational policy, of more prestigious spoken and signed languages, and of the ease of communication across once-formidable barriers mean that many signed languages may disappear before we have the faintest understanding of how much signed languages can vary. For example, the indigenous signed languages of Southeast Asia are being replaced by signed languages substantially influenced by American Sign Language or French Sign Language ([4][5]). Understanding and preserving linguistic diversity will require that we investigate both major types of human languages, signed and spoken.

Contrary to the characterization in Jocelyn Kaiser's article “Pests overwhelm Bt cotton crop” (News & Comment, [26 July, p. 423][2]), the Bollgard Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) gene by Monsanto is providing economic and environmental benefits to cotton growers and is performing as expected given this year's severe pest conditions.

Bollgard was evaluated in 6 years of field tests before commercialization. The vast majority of these tests were done in full public view by scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, universities, and extension facilities. Control of the pests targeted for this product—tobacco budworm, pink bollworm, and bollworm—was excellent. In a few of the field tests, high infestation levels have required application of pesticides to supplement the control provided by the Bt gene.

Monsanto is well aware of the potential for pests to adapt to the Bt protein. Because we—along with many others—have much to lose if this happens, we have worked long and hard with resistance management experts to develop strategies to delay the onset of resistance. Strategies vary depending on the insect involved. With the bollworm, the key strategy is refugia, host plants where the insect can escape exposure to the Bt protein. Nonselected populations that develop on these refuges help dilute and suppress any resistance genes that may develop in the Bollgard fields. The bollworm has a multitude of hosts—both wild and crop plants. With Bollgard, resistance management is taken even further by requiring growers to plant refuges with cotton that does not contain the Bollgard gene. When both the natural and mandated refuges are combined, resistance development in the bollworm can be delayed significantly.

# {#article-title-2}

The bollworm outbreak on Bt cotton is not a manifestation of physiological resistance predicted in 1991 ([1][3]); rather, the epidemic apparently arises from extant populations that have the inherent ability to discriminate among tissues with varying concentrations of the toxin within a plant. Whereas physiological resistance in insects to pesticides and plant resistance (biotypes) is well documented ([2][4]), inherent behavioral capabilities of insects to discriminate in a toxin mosaic superimposed on their host or habitat is not well understood ([3][5]). Insect-resistant transgenic plants appear to provide an ideal substrate in which entomologists can explore this previously recalcitrant and otherwise neglected subject. Nonlethal repellency of preadapted populations from human-valued resource tissues to yield insensitive tissues offers the prospect of conserving the extant insect genome by these intraplant refugia and of increasing mortality in cannibalistic species by concentrating populations in smaller areas. Realization of such possibilities would be accelerated if prepared minds were combined with proprietary technology in a context of production agriculture.

It is regrettable, but not surprising, that Bt cotton in its initial year of commercialization has fallen victim to the bollworm. During 1994, when bollworm numbers were extremely high in North Carolina, peak boll damage and yield reductions in two of our Bt cotton tests exceeded 20% ([1][3]).

Our data ([1][3], [2][4]) were summarily ignored in favor of data acquired when there were low numbers of “wild” bollworms or from test sites artificially infested with laboratory-cultured larvae. The wave of euphoria created by Bt cotton swept across the cottonbelt and carried many entomologists with it.

In Bt cotton, biotechnology has provided cotton farmers with a most powerful tool to assist in the management of insect pests; however, for success and sustainability the tool must be strategically integrated with other management tactics into systems designed for specific areas.

There, and there particularly, is the basement complex on which to build.

https://openalex.org/W2143019926,"In her News Focus article “UC teaching assistants win first union contract” (26 May, p. [1311][1]), Constance Holden quotes an anonymous University of California (UC) scientist as saying, “The [teaching assistant]-faculty relationship has been good; there wasn't much of anything that really needed to be fixed.” This is true overall. The teaching assistant (TA)-faculty relationship was never the catalyst for formation of the union nor for recent contract negotiations. Most TAs at UC Berkeley, certainly in my fields, have excellent working relationships with faculty. Steven Olswang, vice provost of the University of Washington, is mistaken to suggest as he did in the article that union membership undermines the collegial relationship.

The concern on my campus is undergraduate class size, which is not controlled by faculty, most of whom would rather we have manageable workloads in order to do the best job we can as TAs. The union contract agreement is with the university administration; it provides controls and arbitration means to address matters that do not involve academic relationships with faculty, but rather such employee protections as the article reports (for example, health, safety, and discrimination issues).

In my mind, we are students first, but this does not warrant unfair labor practices. Ideally, this contract will now require the university administration and the TA body to behave professionally rather than arbitrarily. TAs will have an avenue of professional redress for legitimate workplace grievances, and we no longer have to experience the (admittedly sometimes random) strike mobilizations that disrupt undergraduate learning as well as graduate student teaching. There is no reason the union contract will adversely affect the TA-faculty relationship. Perhaps this more level playing field can contribute to the development of the professional, collegial relationships that my classmates and I expect of university careers.
